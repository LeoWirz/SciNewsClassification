Let \u2018em rob a Pizza Hut \nWILMINGTON, DEL. \u2013 While most in society go to work to earn a living the thug criminals of the Thug City of Wilmington work hard at committing armed robberies, making this city in Northern Delaware a strong competitor for the nearby crime towns of Philadelphia and Baltimore. \nDelaware State Police are investigating an armed robbery committed by three black male suspects that took place over the weekend. THE SCENE OF THE ARMED ROBBERY \nThe incident occurred at approximately 11:34 p.m., Saturday, December 2, 2017, at the Pizza Hut, located 3611 Kirkwood Highway, Wilmington, as a 24-year-old female employee, who was working behind the sales counter, observed three subjects enter the store. \nThe first subject to enter the business was displaying a black handgun and had it pointed directly at the victim. As he and a second subject approached the victim behind the sales counter, a third subject remained at the entrance door acting as a lookout. \u2026ordered the victim to remove all the money from the safe, while at times sticking the muzzle of the gun into her side \nThe subject possessing the handgun, then ordered the victim to remove all the money from the safe, while at times sticking the muzzle of the gun into her side. After obtaining money from the safe, the suspects also demanded money from the registers. The victim complied and turned over an undisclosed about cash. The suspects also ordered the victim to surrender her Apple I-phone, which she did. After obtaining all the property, the suspects then forced the victim into the walk-in freezer, before fleeing in an unknown direction. \nThe victim who was not locked in the freezer, as walk-in freezers are designed to not allow persons to be locked in, waited approximately ten minutes before exiting, at which time she called 911. The victim was uninjured as a result of the incident. \n\nThe suspects are described as follows: \nSuspect #1: Black male, 25-35 years of age, 5\u20195\u201d-5\u20197\u201d, wearing all dark clothing, with a mask covering his face, displayed a black, unknown make and model handgun. \nSuspect #2: Black male, 25-35 years of age, 6\u20190\u201d- 6\u20192\u201d, wearing all dark clothing, a black knit hat, with a mask covering his face. \nSuspect #3: Black male, 5\u20198\u201d-5\u201d10\u2019, wearing all dark clothing, a black knit hat, with a mask covering his face. \nNo surveillance footage is available at this time. \nAnyone with information regarding this incident is asked to contact Detective C.

Trump\u2019s decision to recognise the disputed city of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital came late on Wednesday night, upending decades of careful US policy and ignoring dire warnings of a historic misstep that could trigger a surge of violence in the Middle East. \u201cI have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,\u201d Trump said from the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s right thing to do,\u201d he asserted. Expressing concerns over the move, the Foreign Office Spokesman said this move by United States would definitely undermine the efforts of enduring peace in the Middle East. \u201cAny such move will be against international law and the resolutions of the UN\u2019s security council,\u201d the spokesman added. The spokesman called upon the US officials to fully implement UN Security Council\u2019s resolutions and refrain from changing the historic and legal position of Jerusalem. The spokesman reiterated Pakistan\u2019s resolve to express solidarity with the people of Palestine, adding that Pakistan fully endorses the concluding statement of Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on the move. The leaders of many Islamic countries including Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, besides France, Germany and the European Union have also warned Trump against the move.

An all-day stay will cost motorists \u00a36. The proposed new parking rates for Market Street and Dampiet Street car parks Stay period \u00a36 20 Sedgemoor District Council's proposed increase of parking fees in Market Street and Dampiet Street (Image: Sedgemoor District Council) \nSedgemoor District Council stated that the increase for a four-hour stay would be a 26 per cent increase but is instead a 33 per cent raise. \nDespite opposition from Labour and some Conservative councillors, the parking price increase was approved following a heated council vote on Monday (December 5). \nThe 25 per cent price increase is set to take effect in April 2018. \nCouncillors argued that the town suffers from congestion and roadworks, and that Market Street and Dampiet Street were both accessible car parks for many shoppers. Read More \nLabour councillor Mick Lerry said: \"Bridgwater has been hit by roadworks, congestion, and 14 per cent less footfall in our town centre as a result \u2013 so why this selective policy? \n\"This targeted increase is unfair and the burden should be spread across the district. \n\"These car parks are short stay and particularly useful for people with less mobility.\" Market Street and Dampiet Street car parks' parking rates are set to raise by 25 per cent \nBut Conservative councillor Duncan McGinty defended the parking increase, stating: \"Of course I have sympathy because no one likes increases in car park charges, but we have a policy of the user pays. \n\"These are very well-liked car parks and earning more money, but every cut we make only adds to our budget gap. \n\"Are we treating Bridgwater unfairly? No, we are only bringing it in line with other car parks.\" Read More \nLabour councillor Leigh Redman said that he was \"frustrated\" with Mr McGinty's defence of the parking increase, believing that it was a \"poor excuse for penalising Bridgwater car parkers\". \nBridgwater's car park fees were last raised by more than ten per cent in April 2016. \nWhat do you think about the increased car parking rates for Market Street and Dampiet Street?

More >> A North Carolina county is working on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after declining to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers.   \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

They were over malapportionment and gerrymandering in most constituencies, the names of about 136,000 voters were missing, the EC had failed to use the latest electoral roll to conduct its exercise, and a lack of information in the notice before the boundary redrawing exercise was to be carried out. \n\u201cI encourage you to appeal this ruling,\u201d Azizul told lawyers appearing for the state. \nThe judge allowed the state\u2019s interim stay application pending the outcome of Selangor\u2019s appeal in the Court of Appeal. \n\u201cThe EC is stopped from conducting any local inquiries until the appeal is disposed of,\u201d he said. \nAzizul said there were special circumstances to grant the stay as the court would have no jurisdiction to hear the appeal once the EC presented its report to the prime minister to be tabled in parliament. \nThe judge said the challenge was unprecedented and had far reaching consequences. \n\u201cSelangor\u2019s appeal will be rendered nugatory,\u201d he said, adding that the EC had until September next year to complete its task. \nGovernment lawyer Amarjeet Singh objected to the stay application by lawyer Cyrus Das on the grounds the EC must be allowed to perform its constitutional function. \n\u201cThe stay amounts to an injunction to stop the EC from completing its task,\u201d he added. \nMenteri Besar Mohamed Azmin Ali, who was present to follow the proceeding, later told reporters an appeal would be filed as the ruling not only affected the state but also all voters. \n\u201cI am glad the status quo in Selangor remains as the EC has been stopped from conducting any inquiry,\u201d he said. \nThe PKR-led Selangor government filed the legal challenge in October last year, seeking to nullify the EC\u2019s notice of redelineation, claiming it violated the Federal Constitution in drawing new electoral boundaries. \nThe state also wanted a declaration that the notice was lacking in details and would cause voters, local authorities or the state government to be unable to exercise their constitutional right to file representations. \nIt wanted the court to quash the EC\u2019s notice and an order to direct it to publish a fresh notice on the proposed exercise. \nThe EC published an 18-page notice in major newspapers in September last year on the proposed redelineation in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah.",

This condition is known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in medical terms. In such cases, the prostate gland of the male reproductive organ begins to multiple, which causes swelling and discomfort in urination. Normally, the benign prostatic hyperplasia causes due to aging but in several cases it can be caused by any hormonal abnormalities in the testicles of the patients.\nCommon symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia are incomplete bladder emptying, weak urinary stream, painful urination, incontinence and pus in the urine. Mostly 90% of men in their eighties have benign prostatic hyperplasia. It is advisable to consult doctors if any of the above symptoms appears.\nWith proper medical history and precise physical examination, most the cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia can be diagnosed. The size and shape of the enlarged prostate can be estimated through rectal examination.\n\nAlpha-1-blockers are usually prescribed as an effective treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in India . In addition to this, sometimes doctors recommend dutasteride and finasteride for hormonal reduction purposes that could provide effective relieve from benign prostatic hyperplasia.\nIn cases of kidney failure, bladder stones or inability to empty the bladder, the best Urologist for Laser Prostate Surgery in India recommends prostate surgical procedures.\nKidney stones or failure can trigger the prostate surgery effectively. Different types of kidney stones that can cause the failure of kidney functioning are Calcium stones, Struvite stones, Uric acid stones, and Cystine stones. One of the main causes of kidney stones is the lack of water in the body of the patients. It is advisable to drink at least two to three liters of water daily. Renal tubular acidosis and hyperparathyroidism can also cause small to medium size kidney stone in the body.\nSome of the common symptoms of kidney stones are blood in urine , severe pain at the sides, burning sensation during urination, and vomiting & nausea. Doctors often conduct a physical examination to identify severe pain on the side of the stomach. Once the pain is confirmed, doctors may recommend CT or Ultrasound tests. CT scan or ultrasound can be used to confirm kidney stones with its precise size and shapes.\n\nUnder the supervision of qualified or experienced Kidney Stone Specialist Doctor in Delhi, the kidney stones of different shapes and sizes can be successfully operated.\nIf the sizes of the kidney stones are very small, it cannot be operated. In such cases, the doctors recommend drinking lots of water and regular checkups. If pain increases, the kidney stone specialists recommend one strong pain killer to mask the pain, as the kidney stones are too small to be operated and can be removed out of the systems through natural urination process.\nSource: http://www.urocareindia.com/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:18.111+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "893b6d4bc2e46ff736aed61d46b4e2da85df304a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTkpEiSIxWb.BmFDX0OLhWNbXOK0aAueP7Ydu9OeHOpprvDf95wYiwshhm9VeUcIWw5F3x_e6Bahw--", "site_full": "machsuperhero.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://machsuperhero.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Immune (11.4) \u2013 Mach", "title": "Immune (11.4)", "title_full": "Immune (11.4)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "893b6d4bc2e46ff736aed61d46b4e2da85df304a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTkpEiSIxWb.BmFDX0OLhWNbXOK0aAueP7Ydu9OeHOpprvDf95wYiwshhm9VeUcIWw5F3x_e6Bahw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kuzcopia", "published": "2017-12-07T11:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "Immune (11.4)", "text": "PREV \nPART 4\n\u201cRock force!\u201d\nFew cheered, the crowd seemed to be on Michael\u2019s side.

Michael pushed himself up, confused, and found that Rick had made a wall emerge at the end of the arena grounds.\nLooking around, Michael watched while the other three sides were now growing walls.\nWhy did he save me? Michael thought, confused.\nHe didn\u2019t, Maya replied, amused.\n\u201cYou think you\u2019re getting off that easy?\u201d\nMichael looked back at the pyramid, finding a crevice at Rick\u2019s eye level, not only on the face that he could see but on all four of them. His voice was coming from there.\n\u201cI got an ass-kicking to give you that\u2019s been a long time coming, Mac. So until that suit beeps, you\u2019re mine.\u201d\n\u201cOr until I give up,\u201d Michael found himself saying as if it was a good comeback.\n\u201cPff, you? You didn\u2019t give up when your friend was getting hurt, you\u2019ll never give up, not until you show everyone just how big of a man you are, eh?\u201d\nMichael squinted his eyes, insulted and perplexed. Another platform attempted to smack him, in the chest, but Michael was ready for it now. He simply stepped aside.\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about, man? We\u2019ve never even talked before.\u201d\n\u201cWe know your mind, lil\u2019 Mac. Nobody else in this school knows the real you, but we do. You\u2019re a manipulative asshole, and I\u2019m putting you back in your place, now that I finally got a chance.\u201d\nMichael frowned, clenching his fists.\nMaya\u2026 \nYou called, darling? She answered, excited. I\u2019ll confess! I may have told them some things. Some exaggerated, some\u2026well, just not true. I\u2019ve been a bad girl, little Mac. \nMichael yelled in frustration, swiping his hand super-fast to slice an opening through the platform that had missed him. He grabbed it and pulled it free spinning around three times before letting it go towards the pyramid\u2019s crevice. It missed, bouncing off the pyramid itself with no other effect than causing a depression on it. And that quickly regenerated.\nMichael ran to the side.\nThe ground rose up to trip him, and pillars to hit him, from both the ground and the walls. Michael avoided them all as skillfully as he did the cars and people he faced during his everyday commute. He continued to run around the pyramid, so he\u2019d be hard to see and predict.\nOccasionally, Michael would break one of the obstacles apart and, in mid-run, hop up and spin to throw them at Rick.\nAt one point, a full wall rose to stop his advance, but Michael\u2019s frustration was such he didn\u2019t even think about crashing into it, shoulder first. It shattered before the force of his momentum.\nNoticing this, he looked at the pyramid in a different light. By the time he considered about simply barreling through, it had shaken, and further stone slid from the ground to reinforce it with more layers.\nMichael observed the protective layer, realizing it was no coincidence Rick had picked a pyramid. Its curved nature would make it all the more difficult for Michael to punch through. He might be able to if he had a flat, perpendicular surface on it.\nMichael looked at the top.\nWell that\u2019ll never work, Maya said in his mind, but he was so trained in ignoring her by now that he was moving before she had even finished talking.\nThat this guy, and all of them, Michael thought bitterly, advancing towards the pyramid. That they would choose to hate me based on nothing but what she told them. \nHe ran up the pyramid\u2019s wall, just as it formed spikes, which were shooting out. But not fast enough.\nThey shot past Michael\u2019s soles and butt, falling short of hitting him. Using the momentum of his run, he threw a football kick at the top of the pyramid. A mini pyramid shot out from the top, leaving behind a flat surface for a roof. Michael narrowly grabbed onto it, to stop his run.\nAs fast as he could, he hopped, just enough that he could spin in the air, but not too far that he couldn\u2019t reach it for a punch. Then he spun around continuously.\nWhen the first sign of dizziness showed, Michael screamed and directed his angular momentum into the pyramid\u2019s newly fashioned ceiling. He felt his hand cracking, but not stopped. His arm went fully through while he used his feet to stop his spin.\nMichael yelled some more, practically in a rage, and trashed his arm around the hole, to chip at the pyramid\u2019s top. Thanks to his speed, this progressed much faster than could be expected. Thanks to his armor-like uniform, the damage to his arm was minimal.\nSoon enough, he shoved his head through and reached down. Rick was standing back up, gathering his focus, since apparently, the debris from the top of the pyramid had hit him in the head.\nRick\u2019s helmet was glowing red, about to start blinking. Michael grabbed it and waved his arm viciously around, banging Rick\u2019s head against the walls of the pyramid until the helmet started blinking.\n\u201cEnough!\u201d Michael heard from behind. \u201cRock Force loses by suit warning!\u201d\nMichael wanted to continue, but he stopped himself. In the isolated silence of the pyramid, with the cheers of the crowd muffled outside, Michael let him go.\nHe was still awkwardly stuck in the pyramid\u2019s hole, and as Rick looked up at him, a bit dazed, Michael couldn\u2019t but notice his absolute disdain. It seemed he was considering closing the pyramid again, squeezing Michael dead.\n\u201cYou hate me so much and you\u2019ve never even met me,\u201d Michael said, surprised to find out he was sweating tears.\n\u201cI know your thoughts,\u201d Rick said, unapologetically.\n\u201cYou know Maya\u2019s words!\u201d Michael whispered, savagely. \u201cOr her mind tricks, whatever! You got no idea what I\u2019ve been through. You\u2019ve no idea what she\u2019s doing to me.\u201d\nRick\u2019s anger and contempt seemed to waver then, if only momentarily.\n\u201cAnd will you even remember this conversation? Or will she wipe your mind, or tell you I\u2019m all lies and manipulations, even here, where nobody can hear me, and when I\u2019m talking to someone I\u2019ve never met or talked to?\u201d\nWhat Michael was saying might have been judgmental words, spun and targeted to manipulate, but again, for some reason, he was deeply upset. The thought of people hating him because of someone\u2019s lies was too unfair. Too unfair.\n\u201cYou\u2019re all idiots,\u201d Michael whined, in an embarrassing outburst. Then he pulled himself away, sniffing out of the pyramid.\nMichael couldn\u2019t bask in the laurels of victory. He simply walked away from the arena, hiding his face by looking down and by brushing it with his arm. The cheers were pretty loud, though, it was a shame he couldn\u2019t enjoy them in the slightest.\nWell, Maya said in her mind. That was intense! Utterly pointless, why would they trust you over their best friend? But still, I\u2019m happy I got to know you better\u2026and what you care about. \nMichael sniffed and wiped at his eyes, cursing his inability to control himself. What he had done would only make things worse for him. He had accomplished only to teach Maya how to upset him more efficiently.\nSighing, dreading what might be coming to him, Michael left the arena.\nNEXT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rick", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "forces of nature", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rock force", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:19.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "98c53c6f9375a2628239bd8fc123a8460d4cdf5d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT3.LaHO6F1Y3RziHj_cvlDGP3903Tk4_eUDKt8wpMnu.MZVAc6Fug6e0S2tLb.gPRCIR5..wOf2w--", "site_full": "www.thaivisa.com", "site": "thaivisa.com", "site_section": "https://www.thaivisa.com/forum/forum/2-general-topics/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "General topics - Thailand Visa Forum by Thai Visa | The Nation", "title": "Parsnips & Sprouts", "title_full": "Parsnips & Sprouts - General topics - Thailand Visa Forum by Thai Visa | The Nation", "published": "2017-12-06T18:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.011, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 11618, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d30cc13a50fc9e0ca6c2d80b69f5f77bf3ea946a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT3.LaHO6F1Y3RziHj_cvlDGP3903Tk4_eUDKt8wpMnu.MZVAc6Fug6e0S2tLb.gPQ95buAqPO5PM1WC_dJTJJR", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "chickenslegs", "published": "2017-12-06T23:56:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Tesco Lotus online ... https://shoponline.tescolotus.com/groceries/en-GB/search?query=parsnips\nBut I expect that availablity will depend on which branch is your nearest.\nEdit:\nDamn.

Well, technically, he's the only at what he does. So when the Chicago P.D. has a case that transcends mortal creativity or capability, they come to him for answers. For the \"everyday\" world is actually full of strange and magical things - and most of them don't play well with humans. That's where Harry comes in. Takes a wizard to catch a - well, whatever. \nThere's just one problem. Business, to put it mildly, stinks. So when the police bring him in to consult on a grisly double murder committed with black magic, Harry's seeing dollar signs. But where there's black magic, there's a black mage behind it. And now that mage knows Harry's name. And that's when things start to get... interesting. \nMagic. It can get a guy killed. Plot Edit \nHarry Dresden is hired by a woman named Monica Sells to find her husband Victor Sells , an amateur wizard who has been dabbling in magic and recently gone missing. Later, he is called by Lieutenant Karrin Murphy , chief of the Special Investigations (SI) Unit of the Chicago Police Department . Murphy's partner shows him the bodies of two people, gruesomely murdered by having their hearts ripped out. Dresden realizes that he is the chief suspect for these magical murders. A third party then intercedes to try and take Dresden off of the case. Gentleman John Marcone , the crime boss of Chicago, tries to buy Dresden out from helping CPD and SI. \nEventually, despite encounters with a vampiress named Bianca , an unknown warlock, and the ever-suspicious Warden Donald Morgan , Dresden learns that the affair centers on the drug ThreeEye , which allows normal humans to temporarily acquire the Sight , a type of magical vision that can drive a person insane. Victor Sells has been manufacturing ThreeEye to edge out mob boss John Marcone. Using the energy from thunderstorms and orgies held at his home, he powered the spells to remove his enemies, namely Marcone's men and anyone else threatening his operation, in order to gradually bring down Marcone and corner the drug trade. \nDresden interrupts Sells' spellcasting and attacks him, \"brains versus muscle\", eventually burning down Sells' house with him still inside grappling with monster scorpions and a demon he had summoned to kill Dresden. Dresden survives, but is himself trapped on the balcony of the burning house until Morgan steps in to rescue him. Morgan had witnessed the fight with Sells and, knowing now that Dresden is innocent, reluctantly testifies on Dresden's behalf to the White Council. Graphic novels \nAn abridged version of Storm Front has been published in two parts by Dabel Brothers Publishing as a comic : Storm Front, Volume 1: The Gathering Storm and Storm Front, Volume 2: Maelstrom . Trivia \nButcher's original proposed title for the novel was Semiautomagic , to sum up the series' balance of fantasy and hard-boiled detective fiction.

The photo booth cash control system package consists of the CONTROL software and a CASH-Interface2 (photo booth edition), plus cables to interface cash devices like coin and bill validator, push buttons and lamps for illumination. CONTROL software: The CONTROL software monitors the CASH-Interface2 and is able to control the photo booth software. By sending keystrokes, the Breeze DSLR Remote Pro photo booth software can be controlled. For example, a push button connected to IN1 sends a F4 to the DSLR software and starts taking picture job. A push button connected to IN2 sends a CTRL+R to the DSLR software and starts a reprint job. It is possible to just use the on screen display (OSD) buttons instead of external push buttons, so external push buttons are not necessary. In the CONTROL software itself there can be done several settings. For example set up the coin and bill validator, set the costs for a photo job, activate and set position of the on screen display (OSD), enter machine name and place, activate e-mail the log file, windows security and other settings. While the photo booth machine is in action, the CONTROL software is running invisible in the background. With enough credits the OSD buttons and push buttons at IN1 and IN2 are active. If the DSLR is running the green LED is lit and the complete window title is shown on bottom line. This way we can detect the state of the DSLR software, e.g. welcome, ready, taking, processing, and so on, and send needed key strokes to the photo booth software.

Scores of men and women joined in singing ahead of what was scheduled to be Parliament's final sitting day of the year. \"It's an historic day for Australia today and I think the celebrations around the country when we finally ... achieve marriage equality are going to be immense,\" Janet Rice said. Rice is a minor Greens party senator who was only able to remain married to her transgender wife of 31 years, Penny, because Penny remained listed as male on her birth certificate. Penny Wong, an opposition Labor Party senator who has two children with her lesbian partner, said: \"I am feeling happy.\" The House of Representatives is widely expected to vote to at allow same-sex marriage across the nation. The Senate passed the same legislation last week 43 votes to 12. The only potential obstacle to the law passing on Thursday would be if marriage equality opponents managed to amend the legislation.

But that's not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge. \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" \nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n- Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n- Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n- Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C. \nFor the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point. For Medicaid recipients, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

If you want to know about chess rules, look at the main web site of World Chess Federation at www.fide.com or go to support page of this program and download it. This program creates a 'Data' folder to save settings of this program and notes of tournaments and players. Players could play with each other on a single device or playing by multiple devices by network. This program shows squares that mouse pointes on them and that helps to prevent any mouse mistakes that happen when playing chess by computers! Although you could do moves by keyboard too. This program never shows legal moves, so you have to know chess rules before starting game! That is the main rule in chess tournaments, because no one could ask legal moves during the game. However, this program shows last move in a separate part to inform you about the moved which played. This program has all functionalities that you need to manage database, but you cannot analyze games by chess engines or creating variations for them. This program uses PGN format and its standard but in some cases, there is not any definite standard and this program uses some similar formats in those cases. This program has all time controls in chess clocks, but if you need more complex time controls, you could use them as well, because this program allows you to start game from any position by two different time controls. Therefore, you could handle any time control any time in any position. After finishing your game, you could import all moves into initial game and see your game in one single game but not in multiple segments.
