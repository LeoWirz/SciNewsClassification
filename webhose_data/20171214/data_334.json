U.S. health of... \nBy LAURAN NEERGAARDAP Medical Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens. \n___ \nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

(AP) - Southern California has felt yellow wind, orange wind, and red wind. But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

It\u2019s worth eating regularly if you have gout.", "text": "Kale for gout. All hail to kale! A superfood that\u2019s helpful in gout, but it's not a magician\u2019s cure \nThis page about kale for gout was last reviewed or updated on 22 August 2014. \nKale, the springy,curly, headless dark green vegetable, is a member of the same family as cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts and cauliflower (brassicas). Like parsley, it should be eaten , not merely used as a garnish. These brassicas are vegetables for gout sufferers, but will not control it alone. \nKale, often described as a super food, and you'll see why as you read on. It can do a good job of delivering a wide range of vitamins and minerals in useful amounts. There is thiamin (B1), folate (folic acid), magnesium, zinc, iron, plus Vitamins B6, A, (natural Vitamin A in a huge amount, about 10,000 IU), E, and K, in kale. \nAnd in higher amounts than in another super food, broccoli . Some of these are antioxidants. When gout attacks raise degenerative \u201cfree radicals,\u201d antioxidants are needed to quell them - that's one good reason to eat kale for gout. \nKale also contains the super flavonoid quercetin, which is also found in watercress and broccoli, in a very useful amount of 22.58 mg per 100 grams. (1) This is much more than in broccoli and about 70% of the amount in watercress. \nStudies have shown quercetin lowered uric acid in mice. How? It may inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme responsible for converting purines into uric acid. It might help in excreting uric acid too, and together with bromelain, act in an anti-inflammatory way. \nShould kale be avoided if you have gout? As with the other veggies in this family, it is hard to see why kale should be bad for gout because it is low purine and alkaline. Low purine means it can\u2019t produce much of the uric acid whose elevated level in the blood is the immediate cause of gout. Alkaline means it just might assist your excretion of uric acid. But you would probably also have to be on a diet which is choc-a-bloc with alkaline food. \nThe highest amount nutrients in kale are calcium, potassium and vitamin C. Potassium (in the citrate form) has a role in natural gout treatment and any sort of potassium is good for any gout diet. If you were trying to consume 500 mg of Vitamin C daily (or more) in an attempt to lower uric acid with it, you\u2019d get more than 1/5th of that from 100 grams of kale. \nBeef for vegetarians For a vegetable, raw kale has a lot of protein - 4.28 grams of protein per 100 grams. (2) And not only that, but it contains all the nine essential amino acids that form proteins, and even nine others. \nGood for eyes too Lutein, the carotenoid found in the macula part of the eye's retina, is in kale, as is its \"running mate\" zeaxanthin. Both are good for the eyes. There is about 20 mg of lutein + zeaxanthin in 100 grams of kale (kale, frozen, cooked, boiled, drained with or without salt). (3). That is very close to the amount in one typical lutein + zeaxanthin dietary supplement pill. \nAnd omega fats . Incredibly it even has some polyunsaturated fats - omega -3 and -6 fats - in a ratio that is nowadays considered healthy by many experts. That is, very unusually, there is about 30% more omega -3 than omega-6 in kale. \nMore calcium than whole milk. Seems incredible, but the numbers are: Kale 150 mg/100 grams; whole milk 113 mg/100 grams. (2) However, milk is a good drink for gout partly because of its casein, a milk protein that is not found in kale. \nWhat else in kale? The other surprise, not related to gout but worth mentioning, is its sulforaphane, which is being seriously scientifically investigated for its anti cancer properties. \nSo this is why kale is rightly called a super food. Kale for gout sufferers is a good idea. \nA gout diet checklist. KALE Raw. Nutrient data. All per 100 grams \nPurines Kale is low purine, producing according to one calculation, 48 mg uric acid per 100 grams of broccoli. \nCalories Low. 49 kcal per 100 grams. That\u2019s useful on a low calorie diet. \nCarbohydrates Fairly low. Kale has 8.75 grams of carbs per 100 grams. But the net carbs number (the real number) is 5.15 grams because there are 3.6 grams of fibre (fiber), and you deduct the fibre (fiber) from the carbs to get the effective carbs number. Compare that to a typical daily allowance low carbohydrate diet of 20-60 per day. \nGI-GL Its Glycemic Index number hasn\u2019t been calculated but estimates are a low number of around 2. This is good for low carbohydrate dieting, and for those folk such as diabetics (diabetes often accompanies gout), who don\u2019t want a food to release glucose quickly. \nAcid-Alkaline Kale, like parsley and broccoli, is very alkaline, mainly because of its high amount of potassium, an alkalizing mineral. That is good for gout. \nKALE raw. Nutrient amounts per 100 grams. \nVitamin C 120 mg", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "c. potassium", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kale", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:31.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "23c1ed33cd03d22c8f37d33460960d7f8d865fc5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTVhUNUUR.ZzG8nTyBCDgxotk0TvcTcsvowyCfVIouXnu_ZRIe_o7G7cLu__mAjRnA-", "site_full": "www.newkerala.com", "site": "newkerala.com", "site_section": "http://www.newkerala.com/india-news.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "India News Update", "title": "PM Modi inaugurates Dr Ambedkar International Centre in Delhi", "title_full": "PM Modi inaugurates Dr Ambedkar International Centre in Delhi", "published": "2017-12-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 61094, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "23c1ed33cd03d22c8f37d33460960d7f8d865fc5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTVhUNUUR.ZzG8nTyBCDgxotk0TvcTcsvowyCfVIouXnu_ZRIe_o7G7cLu__mAjRnA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "PM Modi inaugurates Dr Ambedkar International Centre in Delhi", "text": "PM Modi inaugurates Dr Ambedkar International Centre in Delhi 19 minutes ago 07-12-2017 ANI New Delhi , Dec 7 : A day after the 61st death anniversary of Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Dr Ambedkar International Centre here today and said that it would become an important institution for research and economic issues. Whilst addressing a rally, the Prime Minister said, \"Dr Ambedkar International Centre for Socio-Economic Transformation has also been created at Dr Ambedkar International Centre. It will also become an important centre for research on social and economic issues.\"Prime Minister Modi said that efforts were made to eradicate Baba Saheb's \"wonderful power\" after his demise, but his ideas could not be removed from the minds of the people.\"People are more influenced by Baba Saheb rather than the family for whom all this was done,\" said Prime Minister Modi.Prime Minister Modi's statement comes a day after he had said that the Congress Party believed that freedom in the country was brought by the Nehru-Gandhi family. \"The Congress feels only one family won India's freedom. They forgot the contribution of the tribal communities in India's struggle for freedom. The Congress Party is an expert in lying,\" he had noted.Speaking about the contributions by B. R. Ambedkar, who is the father of the Indian Constitution, Prime Minister Modi asserted that the whole nation is indebted by the contributions Baba Saheb has made.

Esker is a global leader in document process automation, helping organizations automate their manual business processes with a suite of on-demand solutions. Founded in 1985 with headquarters in Lyon, France, the multi-award-winning company now has 300,000 users of its services. With legacy on-premise contact center technology that failed to integrate with its CRM software, Esker found that call handling time was far longer than it needed to be, and knew it needed to improve the experience of its customers who call for technical support. Esker adopted NewVoiceMedia's cloud contact center solution ContactWorld for Service to replace its old system. With seamless CRM integration, the technology intelligently routes incoming calls to the most appropriate advisor and delivers immediate access to a caller's information and call history, enabling them to provide a personalized customer service experience. Additionally, the sophisticated call recording system allows Esker to better evaluate call handling, providing valuable and actionable insights into customer experience and satisfaction. Supervisors can also monitor calls in real time, better assess their employees' workload, and easily change call plans so that the team is allocated optimally to meet customer demand. Since implementation, Esker has increased efficiencies, is offering a better customer service experience and has access to data to drive successful decision making. Furthermore: The company has been able to handle more than 3,000 inbound and 2,500 outbound calls each year Average call-handling time is down by 25 percent Customer satisfaction has increased to 96 percent Number of missed calls has reduced to virtually zero \"Using ContactWorld is even better than we expected,\" commented Mathieu Labaune, technical trainer at Esker. \"It's great in terms of the look and feel of the solution, and its functionality, including seamless integration with our CRM platform, is highly valuable to us. Agents now receive whispers through their headsets alerting them to the customers' language and their details pop-up on their screen, meaning they have detailed insights which can help them provide a completely personalized service. Additionally, real-time reporting enables us to track patterns over time and drive further efficiencies.\" Dennis Fois, president and COO of NewVoiceMedia, said, \"We're delighted that Esker has experienced such incredible success with ContactWorld; from savings in average call handling time, to improved visibility of all agents and 96 percent customer satisfaction. Our true cloud delivery also means that Esker can re-direct customer calls to mobile phones as a contingency or operate hot-desk working practices if required.\" For further information about NewVoiceMedia and to download the case", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "esker", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mathieu labaune", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dennis fois", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "newvoicemedia to transform customer service", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "newvoicemedia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "contactworld for service", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lyon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:32.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a6a8792c0d7b0bb9f51b78a8aa14498572392de3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1ptr64PLjVcc74yNZ7KwBr7m.cJOc_HIYR", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/v/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/v/ - Video Games - 4chan", "title": "Which would you recommend at this point?", "title_full": "/v/ - Which would you recommend at this point? - Video Games - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T06:43:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 185, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c804d4bf918bdd31dee0f3d8810b7a75ee6bcec5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1ptr64PLjVcc74yNZ7KwBr7j9amjwWN1O1iUcn5X.EmAo-", "ord_in_thread": 69, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T10:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>399232001\nI have, and love it.
