Lai Mohammed, on Wednesday dispelled the rumour that the pump price of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) would be increased.\nHe gave this explanation while addressing state house correspondents at the end of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), which was presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.\nHe said that the Minister of Petroleum (State), Dr Ibe Kachikwu, would have been at the briefing but had to go for an urgent meeting in order to resolve the petroleum scarcity in the country.\n\u201c\u201dGovernment has no intention at all to increase the pump price of PMS; the minister has assured the council that there is enough products for the next one month even to end of January,\u2019\u2019 the minister stated.\nAccording to him, there is usually more demand for petrol product during the yuletide which explains the scarcity of the product during the period.\nMohammed said that the council had given a marching order to the Petroleum Minister (State) that the fuel crisis in the country should not last beyond the weekend.\nHe said that the minister had given assurance to ensure that the problem was contained.\nOn digitization, the minister said that the migration from analogue was on course.\nHe said that the digital switch over (DSO) platform in Ilorin would soon be inaugurated while those in Kaduna, Osogbo and Enugu were also ready for inauguration.\n\u201c\u201dWe hope that in the next couple of weeks we are going to inaugurate these DSOs.\n\u201c\u201cThe idea is that in the next few weeks we will inaugurate one DSO in one state in each of the regions of the country,\u2019\u2019 he said.\nMohammed observed that there were challenges the country was working on especially the issue of set up boxes as the government was not in a position to subsidise 40 million set up boxes.\n\u201c\u201dWe are looking at bringing down the cost of the boxes at the same time not lowering the quality of those boxes.\n\u201c\u201cI think the set up manufacturers are working very hard to bring the cost from 40 dollars to 20 dollars and we are also working with the governors and local government chairmen to see how we can collaborate.\n\u201cThey can buy more boxes while we use our technology to ensure efficient payment of television licenses,\u2019\u2019 the minister said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

Professional editors perform a variety of tasks, from managing an entire publishing process to performing only a specific part of it. Their work is important and should be respected. However, there is a difference in proofreading and editing. Editing and proofreading produce different outcomes. \nEditing involves a proactive editor making changes and suggestions that will improve the overall quality of your writing, particularly in relation to language use and expression. Proofreading is less ambitious than editing. It still performs a vital role, but it is the process of correcting surface errors in writing, such as grammatical, spelling, punctuation and other language mistakes. \nSo whether you are Dumbledore or Neville Longbottom, remember that effective proofreading is absolutely vital to the production of high-quality scholarly and professional documents. \n  Access Innovations , the world leader in taxonomies, metadata, and semantic enrichment to make your content findable.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "harry potter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dumbledore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melody k. smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neville longbottom", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:50.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6d0659d45f0a90aed1273a9d06e3ce9de7e2e95c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFprwaXCO45YPB9ndTtbCH4A5dCFYf7XCSgmRWzfH4JX_2yW4mxwAEnjQr9Vj6.ziLIgmG438.kEeGybf6DiRGHeEvcVMNyOfNcTFizgCaz5NLy1Jsl0t9u4", "site_full": "gtaforums.com", "site": "gtaforums.com", "site_section": "http://gtaforums.com/forum/259-gta-mods/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "GTA Mods - GTAForums", "title": "GTA SA Mobile Graphics to PC (SkyGfx&Sun Config&Timecyc) - Scripts & Plugins", "title_full": "GTA SA Mobile Graphics to PC (SkyGfx&Sun Config&Timecyc) - Scripts & Plugins - GTAForums", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.161, "main_image": "http://gtaforums.com/public/style_images/GTAForums_2014/meta_image.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27700, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6d0659d45f0a90aed1273a9d06e3ce9de7e2e95c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFprwaXCO45YPB9ndTtbCH4A5dCFYf7XCSgmRWzfH4JX_2yW4mxwAEnjQr9Vj6.ziLIgmG438.kEeGybf6DiRGHeEvcVMNyOfNcTFizgCaz5NLy1Jsl0t9u4", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JPN GTA LOVE", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "GTA SA Mobile Graphics to PC (SkyGfx&Sun Config&Timecyc) - Scripts & Plugins", "text": "#1 Posted 6 days ago Edited by JPN GTA LOVE, 14 hours ago.\nWelcome\nGTA SA Mobile Graphics\nUpdate Mod Link (GTA SA Mobile Graphics)\nSkyGFX Mobile\nIm Create Timecyc\nMobile Sky Sun Post Processing File (seabed.ipl)\n( This file has been tested by me It looked like a mobile)\nMod Test Picture Link\nMod Test Picture 2 Link\nLink to Mobile Graphics Mod\nLink to Mobile Graphics Mod Topic (JPN GTA LOVE)\n(Please use it with the installation destination file SkyGFX (The Hero) recommends using my setting)\n(Im so sorry link to the back)\nGTA SA 1.0 Work\nPlease Download & Testing\nPlease put it in the download file in GTA SA\n(Mega New Update Link)\n(Google Drive to Old Link)\nSorry my Stupid Bad English (my Japan Guy)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://imgur.com/a/zw4UV", "https://drive.google.com/file/d/16Q2kNTA2_9ci3F9cF7PPQm-K9Cuwigkt/view", "https://imgur.com/a/AL5YB"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:50.042+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e8ef78631ebb1e42ae3497bce8252b41c6764ea1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRG7goSWvOd_8JbJ.dtj27Uak2Dq.SK7ohrhHqX4TXeiBU_zhwrTsOmQOoEbLnZK._rMGOIq2TUhEMtT34kiXMotB8yVzKBXLCnnvaKNFUyCw--", "site_full": "www.employmentcrossing.com", "site": "employmentcrossing.com", "site_section": "http://www.seniorexecutiveemployment.com/jobsrss.php", "site_categories": ["job_search", "jobs"], "section_title": "seniorexecutiveemployment", "title": "Customer Service Representative - PT", "title_full": "Customer Service Representative - PT", "published": "2017-12-06T12:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e8ef78631ebb1e42ae3497bce8252b41c6764ea1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRG7goSWvOd_8JbJ.dtj27Uak2Dq.SK7ohrhHqX4TXeiBU_zhwrTsOmQOoEbLnZK._rMGOIq2TUhEMtT34kiXMotB8yVzKBXLCnnvaKNFUyCw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T12:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "Customer Service Representative - PT", "text": "upload resume: \nProfile PeopleReady is connecting people and workWe believe in creating limitless possibilities for employees, workers and customers.

It features Caesar (by Andy Serkis), a product of a failed experiment which imparted intelligence to members of the ape family, which leads his kind against human invasion and their extermination. With the help of a few betrayal here and there, the home of the apes fell to the brutal Colonel (by Woody Harrelson) who was bent on getting rid of the apes. With his followers left homeless and him bereaved of his wife and son, Caesar\u2019s heart is left in the dilemma of revenge and leadership. \n\nOne of the scenes that really got me was the part where the colonel asked that Caesar is brought to have a chat with him. While the colonel was having a conversation with him, Caesar got filled with rage and despite being chained and held by two soldiers, he managed to hit the colonel so hard that he fell. After standing back up, the colonel screamed \u2018that\u2019s my problem with you. so emotional! you are too emotional\u2019. He would rather describe himself as a man who does what he has to do. He obviously believes that emotions get in the way of people doing the logical/right thing. And he proved it when he killed all the soldiers who refused to kill their infected friends and family members. How right is he? \n\nWell, our emotional faculty as humans is one of the strongest and strangest we\u2019ve got. A lot of decisions we make are based on our feelings. We basically do things we feel we should do, most of the time. And you will agree with me that a lot of times we find our feelings going contrary to logic or reasoning. and at those moments we have a huge decision to make \u2013 mostly decisions that could make or mar us. And because of the consequence of following our emotions, we opt for what is reasonable or sensible so as to keep ourselves away from trouble. To do this requires a lot of willpower, which is why very few people do it at the most important junctures. Even \u2018successful\u2019 people fall victim, Alas! they are human too. \n\nDo we necessarily have to always fight against our emotions or following our feelings? Should our feelings always be in conflict and lose to our reasoning? Inasmuch as we might find our emotions against reasoning, it is one the things that distinguish us as human. Our feelings lie in our core as beings. How possibly can we survive ignoring it? Truth be told emotions can give that great push that is required to overcome obstacles standing between where we are and where we want to be. Emotions can stimulate us to make efforts that would make life better for others. Emotions help us stay away from injurious situations. So, it\u2019s not all negative. \n\nAs you wake up every day to pursue your dreams, you must take your passion along with you. Never let anyone or situation talk you out of your pursuit. One feeling you must never give in to is the feeling to quit. I might not be able to tell you exactly what to do to be \u2018successful\u2019, but I can tell you one way that guarantees you not to be successful and that\u2019s quitting. You can feel tired, it is allowed, take some rest. You can even feel frustrated, you need some motivation. But never entertain the thought of quitting.

Most of the lineup is clear with maybe 3 questions which hopefully become just 2.\nFirst question, is Iniesta cleared and ready to go? Hopefully he is and then he starts. If not, who starts instead? Denis would be my preference followed by Alena then Paulinho then Gomes. But I'll assume Iniesta is cleared and this is not a question at all.\nSecond question, right back. Many of us would like to think or wish that this was not a question, and write Semedo down, but I don't think Valverde agrees. Or perhaps the better way to say it is that Roberto's contributions to Barca's possession, passing, and offense are sometimes preferred despite his shortcomings as a defensive RB. And perhaps Vidal is somewhere in the middle.\nThird question, since Neymar left and Dembele soon got injured (back doing rondos with team!), do we start a 3rd forward like Paco or Gerard or Aleix, or a 4th mid like Paulinho, Denis, Roberto, Gomes.\nMy best guess as to what Valverde will do:\nMAtS\nSemedo-Pique-Vermaelen-Alba\nRaki-Busi-Ini (Denis if Ini not cleared)\nMessi-Suarez-Paco", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:52.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d06db894410f75cab9617f8bae35493880c3b4e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.mAKMZfTdIfT4ZhsQIUznJa80AAxys2.3xWS_nawxRiicK0bx4cg6dN.LWX2styaqWqjWx6kmjggcOQ7_mgeRloRmDmufseAdrIrmIgKmQYFEml3HF3hnjyNce.VClJK53jMVExL6PIcOjx9PafgVr", "site_full": "www.bigsoccer.com", "site": "bigsoccer.com", "site_section": "http://www.bigsoccer.com/forums/ny-nj-off-topic.1216/", "site_categories": ["world_soccer", "sports"], "section_title": "NY/NJ Off Topic | BigSoccer Forum", "title": "PBP: - La Liga Santander - Jornada 15 | Villarreal CF v FC Barcelona | 10 December 2017 [R]", "title_full": "PBP: - La Liga Santander - Jornada 15 | Villarreal CF v FC Barcelona | 10 December 2017 [R] | BigSoccer Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T19:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.083, "main_image": "http://www.bigsoccer.com/data/avatars/m/113/113129.jpg?1462358699", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45672, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "15a54ef7adcdefebf28df5ae255be7f7e38d8ccf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.mAKMZfTdIfT4ZhsQIUznJa80AAxys2.3xWS_nawxRiicK0bx4cg6dN.LWX2styaqWqjWx6kmjggcOQ7_mgeRloRmDmufseAdrIrmIgKmQYFEml3HF3hnjyNce.VClJK53jMVExL6PIXiC4kodP6fwt78K2Iegpks-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "BocaFan", "published": "2017-12-06T20:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Important match.

(AP) - Southern California has felt yellow wind, orange wind, and red wind. But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

People on Medicaid are prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But a new survey says that\u2019... \nBy RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVARAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - People on Medicaid are more prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But that's not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge. \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" \nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n- Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n- Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n- Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington.

To get you excited for what's to come for the next two weekends we've rounded up 6 local purveyors offering interesting food and gift items at The Grove Christmas Market. Check them out! A post shared by Barik Supremo Lambanog (@barik_supremo_lambanog) on Nov 25, 2017 at 9:34pm PST \n1. Premium Moonshine by Barik Supremo Lambanog \nThis season, why not change things up a bit and gift your favorite ninong or bro (or resident boozy buddy) something different? Instead of a bottle of wine, present them with a proudly Philippine-made, artisanal liquor. This is lambanog unlike any other, the craft-distilled liquor fine tuned with distinct flavors -- the local moonshine all dressed to impress and available in classic/ puro and ginger sour variants. \n2. Past\u00e9is de Nata (Egg Tarts) by Belinyas \nEgg tarts, or pastel de nata is an iconic Portuguese delicacy, and aiming to be the best ones to offer it in the country are the husband and wife tandem that run Belinyas. The Portuguese husband of Stephanie Tan-Branquinho, Joao Branquinho, wants to give foodies here a taste of authentic tarts by using the ingredients and techniques the 18th century Catholic monks used in preparing the treats in Lisbon. \n3. Unique Handcrafted Accessories and Leather Crafts by Bohemian Luxe \nWe all have that favorite fab person (BFF, sister, tita, or even lola) that just loves to accessorize and mix and match to mirror her personality through fashion -- give them the gift of uniquely designed clothing and accessories, while patronizing Filipino talent! Bohemian Luxe creates handpainted and handstitched leather accessories, locally produced handpainted earrings from recycled plastic bottles (with real pearls mounted on silver stud dipped in gold!), their recycled plastic flower earrings are all unique and not a single pair is the same. \n4. All-Natural Beauty and Bath Products by Finn The Label \nBe it to support a more mindful lifestyle or to calm down finicky skin, more ladies are turning to natural products and ingredients to add to their staples in the dresser and bath. Finn The Label is a local brand carrying handmade, homemade, and all-natural products that keep you clean and fresh -- bonus points for their minimalist and classy packaging, as it makes their products gift-worthy for sure! Choose among their handcrafted natural soaps with premium oils, beeswax lip pots and matte lipsticks, and handcrafted scented candles using natural beeswax and essential oils. For fussy and sensitive skin, Finn has an eczema balm with herbal infusions, and for when the skin acts up, you can tame those breakouts with their anti-acne roller with tea tree and clove. \n5. Planners and Notebooks to Inspire Writing, by Paper People \n'Clean and quirky with a nod to minimalism' is how homegrown brand Paper People describes their line of stationery, and it's definitely the aesthetic that draws in the millenials who love jotting down all their thoughts and getting everything in order through paper and ink. With weekly planners called 'Weekly Hustle,' notebook sets that encourage the owner to Hustle Hard and Get Sh*t Done, and fuss-free Daily Tracker notepads that keep you focused on the days priorities (that also includes daily meals, water intake, and little things you are grateful for) -- you have a lot of stocking-stuffer options to choose from. \n6. Puro Taba ng Talangka \nThis one's definitely for the biggest foodies in your life, which most likely includes yourself. Treat your tastebuds to nothing but the purest form of taba ng talangka, or crab fat, with absolutely no preservatives nor extenders for the most unadulterated gastronomic experience you can enjoy this season. It's already awesome as is, served plopped on top of a pile of steamed white rice, but gift this bottle with serving suggestions -- whip up an amazing aligue pasta, fried rice, seafood saut\u00e9e with shrimps and crabs -- you can even turn to good ol' Google for some inventive recipe ideas you can print out and include in your gift bag. \nThe Grove Christmas Market happens on December 8 to 10, and December 15 to 17, from 12nn to 9pm, at The Grove Retail Row driveway, E.

Nigeria is my target and I will remain focused to move the country forward,\u201d Buhari said at a dinner to welcome him on Wednesday night. Buhari said he would remain focused in order to restore the lost glory of the country. The dinner was organised in his honour by Kano State Government. The 75-year-old charismatic leader said he would continue to do his best to ensure that the country attained greater heights. He said the administration would continue to accord priority attention to education so as to empower the youth, to enable them contribute their quota toward the development of the country. \u201cIf you educate people, you empower them. So we have to make sacrifice to prepare the youth for the future,\u201d Buhari said. He expressed happiness over the wonderful reception accorded him and his entourage by the people of the state on their arrival in the state capital. \u201cI am overwhelmed by the massive turnout of people who left what they were doing to welcome me. This should be a clear message to the opposition. \u201cThe support has been consistent, so I don\u2019t have words to express my appreciation to the people of Kano state.\u201d He congratulated Governor Abdullahi Ganduje for working very hard to improve the living standard of the people of the state through execution of projects that had direct bearing on them. The President described Ganduje as a good politician who worked closely with everyone, particularly representatives of the state, at the state and National Assemblies. Ganduje had earlier said Kano state government had been able to execute a number of projects, in addition to initiating various empowerment programmes for the women and youths. He said as part of efforts to address unemployment, the state government awarded contract worth over N2 billion for the construction of a skills\nacquisition training centre. The centre would soon be completed and put to use, he said. \u201cWe have a number of projects that are on-going and we hope you will visit the state in near future in order to commission such projects,\u201d Ganduje said.  \n(NAN) ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "buhari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muhammadu buhari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdullahi ganduje", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ganduje", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national assemblies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kano state government", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:55.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ddf70ed18a74959b033abc79e1bf5c1fdb99616a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqsxUkjV1Gvi6jERETdqPylwT8xhxZrtst3a6KUY.xFxeGKG_IbC.ygP8OSRVD2hJKEPva7U61wGzgLpQlfnlay", "site_full": "blog.naver.com", "site": "naver.com", "site_section": "https://openapi.naver.com/v1/search/blog?query=s&start=421&sort=date&display=100", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Sabbat - Sabbatical Earlyearslaught (4CD Box)", "title_full": "Sabbat - Sabbatical Earlyearslaught (4CD Box) : \ub124\uc774\ubc84 \ube14\ub85c\uadf8", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "KS", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "http://blogthumb2.naver.net/MjAxNzEyMDdfMjcz/MDAxNTEyNjMyNjY0MDI0.Npf6lgtxmKoqzyr9yak1wdsZR27-bTK0MSLcHQYKBTEg.o6_ZPZQdYxEGZKeJqQNspSmMjNAuH9gaoQVVOe2NE10g.JPEG.back1969/P_20171207_154615.jpg?type=w2", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 89, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ddf70ed18a74959b033abc79e1bf5c1fdb99616a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqsxUkjV1Gvi6jERETdqPylwT8xhxZrtst3a6KUY.xFxeGKG_IbC.ygP8OSRVD2hJKEPva7U61wGzgLpQlfnlay", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FAPs \ubc31\uc885\ucc9c", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Sabbat - Sabbatical Earlyearslaught (4CD Box)", "text": "\u2517 .

Productions\nDecember 2014 marks the final month of the 30th anniversary year of the legendary Sabbat. As such, it is only fitting to celebrate the end of this historic year with the release of this 4xCD version of the \"Sabbatical Earlyearslaught\" compilation, previously released as a vinyl box set in April of this year. The recordings in this collection represent the band's earliest output, from its official inception in 1984 through the recording of its highly-regarded debut album, \"Envenom\", in 1990. The band's trademark brand of \u201cSabbatical Blacking Metal\u201d was first established thirty years ago with the quintessential and appropriately self-titled \"Sabbat\" 7\u201d EP, which was followed by four more 7\u201d EP releases (\"Born by Evil Blood\", \"Desecration\", \"The Devil's Sperm Is Cold\", and \"The Seven Deadly Sins\") over the course of the next five years. In addition to these original vinyl releases, Sabbat recorded the \"Bloody Countess\" rehearsal sessions and \"Sabbatical Demon\" demo, both of which were released separately on cassettes. \"Sabbatical Earlyearslaught\" compiles the recordings from all five of these EPs, both cassettes, and a rough mix of the \"Envenom\" album. Also included are various rehearsal, live, and otherwise unreleased recordings from the same six-year formative period. To accompany these recordings and provide a written narrative of the band's early history, the most extensive single biography ever written on the band's developmental period is included in a twenty-page booklet, along with the artwork that adorned the five 7\u201d EPs, as well as other original Elizaveatian artwork and photos from the same era, all of which is housed in a deluxe 4xCD jewel case. In short, this collection stands alone as the most definitive release of early Sabbat on CD format. (Note that the die-hard version of this release \u2013 containing the bonus recordings originally included in the vinyl box set, albeit this time on cassette format, as well as an exclusive bonus double 7\u201d picture disc \u2013 has been delayed by the manufacturer until early 2015.)\nD isc 1:\n01-02: \"Sabbat\" EP, 1985.\n03-04: \"Born by Evil Blood\" EP, 1987.\n05-07: \"Desecration\" EP, 1988.\n08-09: \"The Devil's Sperm Is Cold\" EP, 1989.\n10-12: \"The Seven Deadly Sins\" EP, 1990.\nDisc 2:\n01-04: \"Sabbatical Demon\" demo, 1990.\n05-12: \"Bloody Countess\" demo, 1986.\n13: Rehearsal at S.K.

Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio, left, and Keith Gregg, the county's Chief Information Technology Officer, right, speak at a press conference Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, at the Government Center about t... \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .
