Juventus to win a big game in England Juventus secured second place in Group D with a 2-0 away victory over Olympiakos to advance to the round of 16. The FC crew answer your tweets on Liverpool's chances in the UCL knockout stages, the end of Man City's unbeaten run and dream round of 16 matchups. \nJuventus goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny says he hopes to face a Premier League side in the Champions League's round of 16. \nFormer Arsenal keeper Szczesny, 27, made his Bianconeri debut in the Champions League in the 2-0 win over Olympiakos on Tuesday, a result that secured second place in their group behind Barcelona and a place in Monday's draw for the knockout stage. \nJuve have six possible opponents in that draw, and four of them -- Tottenham, Manchester City, Manchester United and Liverpool -- are English. Juve could also get Besiktas or Paris Saint-Germain, but Szczesny told his club's official website : \"I hope that we draw an English team. \n\"I'd really like it if we could win a big game in England.\" \nJuve may be one of the sides the Premier League clubs who topped their groups would prefer to avoid in the draw, with the Italian champions having reached two of the past three finals. \n\"We're one of the strongest teams in Europe and we don't fear anyone,\" Szczesny said. \nWojciech Szczesny made 132 league appearances for Arsenal before joining Roma on loan in 2015 and Juventus in the summer. \nFor now, Juve must focus on Serie A, with a game against league leaders Inter Milan on Saturday and then a meeting with Roma on Dec. 23. \n\"We've two big matches coming up at home against Inter and Roma and these are the games that get you extra motivated and we have to win both of them -- we are Juventus,\" he said. \n\"We're anticipating a fascinating tussle against Inter this Saturday. It will be very difficult, but we're confident. \n\"We haven't conceded a single goal in our last four games and this is an important platform for us to win matches, as we've plenty of firepower up front.\" \nBen Gladwell reports on Serie A, the Italian national team and the Bundesliga for ESPN FC, UEFA and the Press Association. @UEFAcomBenG.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wojciech szczesny", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "szczesny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben gladwell", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "juventus", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "champions league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liverpool", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "inter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olympiakos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "espn fc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uefa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "besiktas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arsenal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "inter milan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester united", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "premier league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "press association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris saint-germain", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england juventus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "man city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tottenham", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:11.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ea7b615a6d8eb2a702203a9c8f800277f4ca2909", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.XQybaNrF9TJE1mawMNmIWrPOR7LvpFziqxoANHTNAbQLP9si2tmf8.uU7Y0SJgu4aFI9pyIftkIw--", "site_full": "knramesh.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://knramesh.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "knramesh", "title": "Sanskrit joke", "title_full": "Sanskrit joke", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ea7b615a6d8eb2a702203a9c8f800277f4ca2909", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.XQybaNrF9TJE1mawMNmIWrPOR7LvpFziqxoANHTNAbQLP9si2tmf8.uU7Y0SJgu4aFI9pyIftkIw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ramesh Kn (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "Sanskrit joke", "text": "\u092a\u0924\u093f\u0903 - \u092d\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0947! \u0939\u0943\u0926\u092f\u0947 \u092c\u0939\u0941\u0935\u0947\u0926\u0928\u093e \u0905\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f , \u0938\u094b\u0922\u0941\u0902 (to bear) \u0928 \u0936\u0915\u094d\u0928\u094b\u092e\u093f \n\u092a\u0924\u094d\u0928\u0940 - \u090f\u0935\u0902 \u0935\u093e ?! \u091a\u093f\u0915\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0938\u093e\u0932\u092f\u0902 \u0917\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e\u092e\u0903 \u0935\u093e ? \u0930\u0941\u0917\u094d\u0923\u0935\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0915\u093e\u092e\u094d (ambulance) \u0906\u0939\u094d\u0935\u092f\u093e\u092e\u093f \u0935\u093e ? \n\u092a\u0924\u093f\u0903 - \u0939\u094d\u092e\u094d\u092e\u094d \u0905\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941 \n\u092a\u0924\u094d\u0928\u0940 - \u0905\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941, \u091c\u0919\u094d\u0917\u092e\u0926\u0942\u0930\u0935\u093e\u0923\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0903 \u0917\u0942\u0922\u092a\u0926\u0902 (password) \u0935\u0926\u0924\u0941 \n\u092a\u0924\u093f\u0903 - \u092e\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941 \u092e\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941 \u0964 \u0907\u0926\u093e\u0928\u0940\u0902 \u0915\u093f\u091e\u094d\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092f\u0917\u094d \u0905\u092d\u0935\u0924\u094d , \u0935\u0947\u0926\u0928\u093e \u0935\u094d\u092f\u092a\u0917\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0924\u094d \n\ud83e\udd23 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:11.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "622495cbb3d2599a5f34a7d23416d3ac4818ed68", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKwsVX83iHME_02n3Qs439dXYflbc.W2s3KJiZwlp7BJq1Xg4EpzfOPM1vuSTGeWLcf._Ivf6B9bmvV4k1QMfdshk83CR8DCI_WbPajTog0q2cNAaKvTGsnaJuIB3fpMf5CndEmgPlkcjlkC98evbVzTbcy6hsVTg89CyicJQQQXndFtr5jyWF", "site_full": "www.ebay.co.uk", "site": "ebay.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.ebay.co.uk/b/Gift-Vouchers-Coupons/172008/bn_1838679", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Gift Vouchers &amp;

It is true that if the image might be resized after the scan, it's always much better quality to resize to reduce the image size rather than to resize to increase the image size. If you aren't sure what your future intentions for the image might be, and won't be able to scan it again, then it's probably best to err on the large side (if storage space allows, up to reasonable amounts anyway). Resizing to be smaller discards excess pixels. But resizing to be larger must create (or fake) new interpolated pixels which were not in the original scan. There is no additional detail possible in interpolated pixels, even if the image is larger. The results are not at all the same as scanning at the higher resolution.

Mereka jadi pintar berinovasi dan menghasilkan uang, hehehe. \nKhayalan saya tentang mempunyai anak-anak berjiwa entrepreneur ini berawal dari kekhawatiran saya akan masa depan mereka. Nggak kebayang aja gimana nanti tantangan yang mereka hadapi di dunia kerja di saat sekarang aja persaingan sudah riweh luar biasa. Jadilah saya bermimpi dan sedikit berharap kalau anak-anak kelak menjadi orang-orang yang nggak hanya bisa bekerja menghasilkan uang namun juga menciptakan lapangan pekerjaan (am n). \nNah, gimana nih cara melatih mereka agar mereka punya jiwa entrepreneurship? Ternyata, menurut psikolog Rosdiana Setyaningrum, ada beberapa hal yang bisa kita lakukan sebagai orangtua. Seperti di antaranya: \na. Ajarkan anak bahwa semua barang memiliki harga. Seringkali anak susah diajak menghargai barang karena mereka nggak ngerti nilai dari barang tersebut atau darimana uang yang digunakan untuk membeli barang tersebut. Saat si kecil diajak mengetahui bahwa ada harga dari semua barang yang mereka miliki, mereka akan lebih menghargai barang-barang itu. \nb. Ajarkan bahwa anak perlu usaha untuk mendapatkan apa yang mereka inginkan. Jadikan diri kita sebagai contoh, misalnya, mamah harus bekerja untuk bisa membeli mainan atau buku-buku yang mereka suka. Karena itu, didik si kecil untuk memahami proses mendapatkan uang dengan cara melakukan pekerjaan dan belajar menabung. \nc. Berikan pemahaman akan kebutuhan Ajarkan anak untuk memahami arti prioritas dan kegunaan sebuah barang. Agar dia belajar membedakan antara kebutuhan dan keinginan. Hal ini akan mempermudah si kecil untuk memahami kata \u201ctidak\u201d ketika kita mengatakannya. \nd. Ajak untuk berbagi Ketika selama ini si kecil selalu berada dalam posisi menerima, terkadang mereka lupa bahwa ada orang lain yang juga membutuhkan. Berikan kesempatan agar anak dapat belajar berbagi dengan mereka yang kurang beruntung. \ne. Lakukan simulasi atau praktik Coba deh ajak si kecil menjual barang-barang yang tidak terpakai lagi. Ini bisa menjadi l atihan yang baik bagi si kecil untuk memahami nilai barang, uang, dan usaha. Mereka juga dapat belajar untuk merawat barang agar tetap berharga bagi orang lain. \nKebetulan, di akhir bulan lalu, Carousell bekerja sama dengan Mommies Daily menyelenggarakan Carousell Kidpreneurs, sebuah bazaar untuk anak-anak yang bertujuan untuk mengembangkan karakter entrepreneurship si kecil. \nPada bazaar ini, orangtua dan anak-anak bekerja sama untuk menjual barang tidak terpakai mereka. Semacam wadah bagi orangtua untuk mengajarkan nilai sebuah barang pada anak. Jadi, ada 10 pasang orangtua dan anak yang membuka booth preloved berisi mainan, buku cerita dan pakaian untuk dijual kembali. \nTentu saja Carousell Indonesia tidak sembarangan membuat acara ini. Menurut Associate Country Manager Carousell Indonesia, Olivia Lautner, survey yang mereka lakukan pada bulan September mengungkapkan bahwa 70% orangtua Indonesia berpikir bisa mendapatkan penghasilan tambahan sebesar hingga Rp 3.000.000,- dengan menjual barang anak yang tidak lagi terpakai. \nDari kegiatan ini, bisa dibilang bahwa enterpreneurship untuk anak bukan sekadar mengenai kemampuan menjual barang atau membangun bisnis, tapi juga kecerdasan emosional, seperti rasa percaya diri, keterampilan bersosialisasi, rasa tanggung jawab, dan keinginan untuk selalu berkembang. \nJadilah Pasar preloved di Carousell Kidpreneurs ini menjadi wadah untuk mengembangkan jiwa enterpreneurship anak. Menjual barang-barang tidak terpakai merupakan latihan yang bagus untuk mempertajam pemahaman mereka mengenai sebuah usaha dan nilai uang. Pastikan juga bahwa uang yang diperoleh harus digunakan untuk sesuatu yang bermakna.

Basel earned second place in Group A and a spot in the round of 16 after a 2-0 away win over Benfica. Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke hopes manager Peter Bosz will turn around the club's poor form. \nBasel have said they expect to receive offers for defender Manuel Akanji amid speculation he is a target for Borussia Dortmund. \nDortmund sporting director Michael Zorc scouted Akanji, 22, in Basel's Champions League meeting with Manchester United last month and publications including Blick and kicker have suggested they are planning to make a move in January. \nThe Switzerland international, who has also been linked with Dortmund's Bundesliga rivals RB Leipzig, is under contract until 2021 but Basel sporting director Marcel Streller indicated that they are open to a sale. \n\"We'll receive [offers], I am sure of that,\" Streller told Blick . \"I see which scouts attend our Champions League matches. If we'll receive a concrete offer, we must sit down with him and his agent to see what's best for Manu.\" Borussia Dortmund are reportedly lining up a move for Manuel Akanji to bolster their struggling defence. \nDortmund have struggled badly in defence in recent weeks. Since beating Hamburg 3-0 in mid-September, Dortmund have conceded 31 goals in 15 matches in all competitions, and only once, in a cup match at third-division side Magdeburg, managed to keep a clean sheet. In 10 of those 15 matches, Dortmund conceded two or more goals. \nChanges to Dortmund's system made by under-fire coach Peter Bosz, who switched from a high-risk 4-3-3 to a 3-4-3, have not helped BVB's cause, and the return of centre-back Neven Subotic, who had been left out of the squad for several weeks, has also failed to bring more stability. \nDortmund's midfielders have also struggled to put early pressure on opponents, which has compounded the persistent problems with conceding in the opening stages of games. \nHowever, Nuri Sahin, who started in midfield ahead of Germany international Julian Weigl in the 3-2 defeat at Real Madrid, told reporters on Wednesday he believes Dortmund are finally showing signs they can get back to winning ways. \n\"I believe that what happened in Madrid was a clear signal for everyone,\" he said . \"And I also believe that it might not be long now that we finally win a match again.\" \nBar the Magdeburg match, Dortmund have not won in all competitions since beating Augsburg 2-1 on Sept. 30. \nStephan Uersfeld is the Germany correspondent for ESPN FC.

Punya segudang manfaat bahkan bisa berpengaruh pada kesehatan mental anak. Tapi bagaimana kalau anak senang sentuh area sensitif ibunya, seperti payudara? Seingat saya, sepanjang jadi ibu hampir setiap malam anak saya selalu minta untuk dielus-elus telapak tangannya. Kalau nggak telapak tangan, ya, telapak kaki. Semula sih saya senang-senang saja, tapi lama kelamaan, ketika anak sudah besar seperti sekarang, kok, saya jadi khawatir, ya, takut kebiasaan ini terbawa terus sampai anak dewasa. Terlebih, kalau sampai memengaruhi kemandiriannya? Kekhawatiran lain dirasakan teman saya yang lain. Ia merasa sangat terganggu ketika anaknya yang berusia 1.5 tahun sering kali memegang payudaranya. \u201cMemang, sih, anak aku belum terlalu besar. Tapi tetap saja saya merasa risih,\u201d ungkapnya. Umh\u2026.bisa kebayang, sih, ya, kalau hal ini memang berlanjut sampai anak sudah besar? Pasti risihnya bukan main. Berkaitan dengan sentuhan ibu, belum lama ini saya datang ke acara Nivea yang meluncurkan campaign terbarunya, Sentuhan Ibu. Sebagai salah satu brand perawatan kulit, Nivea sadar sekali kalau sentuhan ibu sangat penting bagi pertumbuhan anak. Di awal acara, Vera Itabiliana mengungkapkan kalau sentuhan ibu memiliki kekuatan yang luar biasa. Bahkan berpengaruh pada kesehatan mental dan sosial anak saat dewasa. \u201cSentuhan ibu memang sakti karena dapat memberikan berbagai manfaat secara emosional pada anak,\u201d ungkap psikolog dari Lembaga Psikologi Terapan Universitas Indonesia (LPTUI), Jakarta ini. Tapi yang perlu digaris bawahi, sentuhan ini juga perlu memberikan kenyamanan untuk dua belah pihak. Baik bagi ibunya dan anaknya. Artinya, jika sentuhan tersebut tidak nyaman untuk salah satu pihak, baiknya alihkan pada area yang lain. Untuk itu, jika memang si kecil terbiasa untuk menyentuh area sensitive seperti payudara, langsung saja alihkan pada area yang lainnya. \u201cSentuhan ini memang jangan di area sensitive, dengan begitu kita juga bisa menyelipkan pendidikan seks pada anak. Mana area yang boleh disentuh, dan mana yang tidak,\u201d tambah Mbak Vera. Lebih lanjut, Mbak Vera menegaskan, jika anak memang terbiasa memegang area payudara, sebaiknya dihentikan berbarengan dengan stop ASI, dengan menjelaskan pada anak kalau itu area pribadi sehingga ibu tidak nyaman dipegang, lalu alihkan ke bagian lain seperti lengan. \u201cJika dibiasakan terus menerus, akan berdampak pada kemandiriannya juga. Bilang saja, cari nenen itu kan ciri anak bayi. Anak itu juga belajar dari pembiasaa, kalau dia begitu ke ibunya, artinya nanti orang lain juga boleh diperlukan atau memperlakukan hal yang sama.\u201d \nWalaupun begitu, bukan berarti sentuhan ibu ini jadi harus segera dihentikan lho ya. Seiring bertambahnya usia anak, sentuhan ibu tetap harus dilakukan. Misalnya, ketika ngobrol sama anak remaja, jangan lupa sambil sentuh pundaknya. Perlu diketahui kalau sentuhan ibu ini bermanfaat untuk kedua belah pihak. Untuk Ibu, bisa menimbulkan perasaan bahagia juga. Karena jadi tahu kalau anak merasa nyaman dan menikmati kebersamaan dengannga. \u201cIni menimbulkan perasaan bahagia pada ibu bahwa dia sudah doing a good job as a mother, \u201d kata Vera. Sementara untuk anak-anak yang sering kali mendapat sentuhan ibu sejak kecil bisa menimbulkan rasa lebih diterima dan dibutuhkan ketika mendapatkan sentuhan kasih sayang yang melimpah saat masih kecil.

An oscillator is an indicator that is used as a counter trend showing when the market is overbought or oversold. These indicators are momentum based. The CMF is based largely on the Accumulation Distribution Line; it compares the close value with the high and the low for that same day. Generally, CMF indicator could be used as an indicator of buying and selling pressure. When CMF is above zero it is indicator of buying pressure and when it is below zero it is indicator of selling pressure. \nChecking on current RSI levels on shares of Meadow Bay Gold Corp (MAY.V), the 14-day RSI is currently standing at 67.70, the 7-day is at 65.16, and the 3-day is resting at 59.78. Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a frequently used technical analysis tool. RSI helps measure changes in price movement of a specific equity. RSI is a momentum oscillator that moves in a range from 0 to 100. RSI is generally used to interpret whether a stock is overbought or oversold. As a general rule, an RSI over 70 may indicate an overbought situation. On the other end of the spectrum, a reading under 30 may indicate an oversold situation. \nValue investors may be scanning the shelves for bargain stocks. They may be looking to spot those shares that haven\u2019t been doing a whole lot and are being generally overlooked by the investing world. Value investors may be searching for stocks with lower price to earnings ratios that possess higher dividend yields. Investors looking for growth stocks may be willing to shell out a little more for a stock that has the possibility of increasing EPS at a quicker pace. Some investors may favor one category of stocks over another, but they may need to find a combination at some point. As markets tend to move in cycles, it may be necessary to align the portfolio to the category that is best positioned to make consistent gains in the future. \nMeadow Bay Gold Corp (MAY.V) currently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of 78.06. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal. \nShares of Meadow Bay Gold Corp (MAY.V) have a 200-day moving average of 0.16. The 50-day is 0.11, and the 7-day is sitting at 0.20. Using a bigger time frame to assess the moving average such as the 200-day, may help block out the noise and chaos that is often caused by daily price fluctuations. In some cases, MA\u2019s may be used as strong reference points for spotting support and resistance levels. \nThe Average Directional Index or ADX is technical analysis indicator used to describe if a market is trending or not trending. The ADX alone measures trend strength but not direction. Using the ADX with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) may help determine the direction of the trend as well as the overall momentum. Many traders will use the ADX alongside other indicators in order to help spot proper trading entry/exit points. Currently, the 14-day ADX for Meadow Bay Gold Corp (MAY.V) is 60.52. Generally speaking, an ADX value from 0-25 would indicate an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would indicate a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would signal a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would indicate an extremely strong trend. The Williams Percent Range or Williams %R is another technical indicator that may be useful for traders and investors. \nThe Williams %R is designed to provide a general sense of when the equity might have reached an extreme and be primed for a reversal. As a general observance, the more overbought or oversold the reading displays, the more likely a reversal may take place. The 14 day Williams %R for Meadow Bay Gold Corp (MAY.V) is noted at -31.25. Many consider the equity oversold if the reading is below -80 and overbought if the indicator is between 0 and -20. \nBy Trion Contributor", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marc chaikin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "meadow bay gold corp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cmf reading holds above zero  meadow bay gold corp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cmf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trion", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chalkin money flow", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:12.045+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3fdc03ff09eda26235852edc095e77598372d889", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOo8phhHQimYknNB3g0NfE7a1ktA_STghlNe4c6jIcSjq56Lng3HeyNwU2GToIYBVKuzMOaJKDJE5A--", "site_full": "straightrazorplace.com", "site": "straightrazorplace.com", "site_section": "http://straightrazorplace.com/", "site_categories": ["mens_health", "health"], "section_title": "Straight Razor Place - Welcome", "title": "Is this a Robeson?", "title_full": "Is this a Robeson?", "published": "2017-11-28T07:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.013, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8f80e0e8284d98b3b36ba36e23589001122e6919", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOo8phhHQimYknNB3g0NfE7a1ktA_STghlNe4c6jIcSjq56Lng3HeyNwU2GToIYBVKucjMnCyMoJfVq5_15cBy9R", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "tcmichigander", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Thanks for replies fella's.. closing this one down.

Australia has done it,\u201d Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told the House. \n\u201cEvery Australian had their say and they said it is fair, get on with it!\u201d \nThe historic reforms will commence on Saturday, when same-sex couples can a lodge a notice to marry. They will then have to wait a month before tying the knot. \nLabor opposition leader Bill Shorten hailed the passing of the bill as a uniting moment for Australia, adding: \u201cNow is the time for healing\u201d. \n\u201cA time to build, a time to love, and is now at last a time for marriage equality,\u201d he said. \nSame-sex marriage campaigners converged outside parliament in the nation\u2019s capital Canberra to celebrate the historic occasion, which sees Australia join more than 20 other countries in recognising such unions. \nThe bill was tabled in parliament by the conservative government after Australians last month endorsed the reforms in a controversial voluntary postal vote. \nNearly 80% of eligible voters took part in the poll, and almost 62% of the 12.7 million people who participated chose \u201cyes\u201d on their postal ballots. \nThe ballot had been called by Turnbull, a moderate who backed gay marriage, in the face of opposition from hardliners who refused to back a national plebiscite on the issue. \nIt was opposed by proponents of same-sex marriage, who wanted direct legislative action and argued a poll would expose gay people and their families to hate speech. \nJust under five million people voted \u201cno\u201d, with conservative politicians using their rejection of gay marriage as a catalyst to push for religious exemptions to be included in the bill. \nBut after lengthy debate, both houses of parliament knocked back amendments to the bill, including from former prime minister and staunch \u201cno\u201d campaigner Tony Abbott, on religious freedom.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill shorten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:13.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "65e558aeb420073a86ddc5974a5251ff4000b568", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJdmt7lFdIrpMwrYb0LojTBR5B3Oc7gHqg5MqFVkIkAzWhRbqWUV_V0evP1le12Sc8kGBcCacZmKSiHE991feqt2oIbPKqxoYwOJ8GFDsQ5xA_rrmz1lJoMVqXNIbZ5CKEMx2umQkO5qA-", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Appliances-Refrigerators-Bottom-Freezer-Refrigerators/N-5yc1vZc3p6/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "KitchenAid 30 in.

First, the Senate and House versions are different and must be reconciled, then the House and Senate both must separately approve the compromise. \nPolls say that some three-fourths of the country is against the measure; it\u2019s time to voice that opposition. \nAlready, some opponents are creative. The Communications Workers of America union has asked employers including AT&T and Verizon to guarantee the $4,000 annual raise that tax-overhaul proponents claim will happen. \n\u201cPresident Trump and the Republican Congress have been trying to sell this corporate tax cut to working families by making big claims about wage increases, investment and job growth that don\u2019t seem to be supported by the evidence,\u201d said CWA president Chris Shelton. \u201cWe\u2019re going straight to the people who know how corporations plan to spend the billions of dollars being handed over to them \u2013 the CEOs \u2013 and asking them if they intend to keep the promises that Trump is making on their behalf.\u201d \nNegotiated in secret, the 497-page \u201cTax Cuts & Jobs Act\u201d could permanently cut taxes for corporations and the wealthy while only temporarily relieving some working- and middle-class Americans\u2019 tax burdens; revive the debunked \u201ctrickle-down\u201d economic notion; limit or kill tax deductions including mortgages, medical expenses, write-offs for teachers and graduate students, and state and local taxes (trimmed in the Senate version; eliminated in the House\u2019s 227-205 passage Nov. 16); hurt the renewable-energy sector, the historic preservation tax credit and rural hospitals; OK oil-drilling in Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; spark an interest-rate hike; encourage donating to private schools, hurting public education; require borrowing billions, burdening future generations; and weaken the nation\u2019s safety net, from Medicare to health insurance. \nIn fact, U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) last week commented that the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is now unaffordable, remarking, \u201cThe reason CHIP is having trouble is because we don\u2019t have money anymore.\u201d \nPublic-policy professor Lily Batchelder of New York University\u2019s School of Law said Congress\u2019 bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) shows that about 100 million U.S. households under the House bill (and more under the Senate version) would either get no tax cut or would get a tax increase. \nSo, why cut taxes on the already rich and increase taxes for the rest of us (80 percent will see a hike or a \u201cbenefit\u201d of less than $100 by 2027, studies say)? Corporate profits are soaring and companies aren\u2019t investing or hiring, but buying back stock and issuing dividends to shareholders, reports Bloomberg. \nThe GOP is serving its affluent campaign contributors and scoring what Republicans hope will be a political victory. \nU.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) revealed his loyalties in a comment to the Des Moines Register, saying that helping investors is good, \u201cas opposed to those that are just spending every darn penny they have, whether it\u2019s on booze or women or movies.\u201d \nThe JCT also reports that the measure would not pay for itself, as Republicans claim, that families earning less than $75,000 a year would face higher, not lower taxes, and that it would add at least $1 trillion to the national debt. \nMoody\u2019s Investment Service announced its analysis: \u201cThe tax reform measure that passed the Senate is negative overall for state and local government finances,\u201d according to Moody\u2019s vice president Nick Samuels. It \u201cwould reduce disposable income for many taxpayers, likely outweighing the positive effect of lower federal rates on consumption [and] reduce financial flexibility by increasing political resistance to tax increases at the state and local level.\u201d \nThe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a statement saying, \u201cThis proposal appears to be the first federal income-tax modification in American history that will raise income taxes on the working poor while simultaneously providing a large tax cut to the wealthy. This is simply unconscionable.\u201d \nRepublicans may satisfy their donors and claim a legislative victory, but the financial results and political selfishness about 2018\u2019s elections could backfire. \nFor now, call the Capitol switchboard (202) 224-3121 and ask the operator to transfer you to your Representative or Senators, who may need reminding that they work for us. \n\u201cThis is not over yet,\u201d tweeted U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) \u201cThe House will still need to act on the Senate bill. It\u2019s up to every American who believes in the \u2018We the People\u2019 vision of our democracy to stop this bill before it gets to the President\u2019s desk.\u201d \nContact Bill at Bill.Knight@hotmail.com.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuck grassley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris shelton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lily batchelder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff merkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orrin hatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick samuels", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "communications workers of america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moody\u2019s investment service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cwa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joint committee on taxation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. conference of catholic bishops", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "des moines register", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moody", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "children\u2019s health insurance program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "verizon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jct", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york university\u2019s school of law", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "at&t", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arctic national wildlife refuge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alaska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:13.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0c6f852e529dc7aef56b948dc48c28721388abd6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTYbhkjIy0cBOBf9ZNI2k1BYjTbD7NzHU5Gd92OBsnvD1wfRj41SyGWsYg91Jg1GAjNkwVdWdcY8Top7IY4pl7BgM.rOUG.rnOAjVw.0EDJldy4kTl_ZnaWuxo.UcpmzWOQzgLuGTIt9w--", "site_full": "www.huffingtonpost.com", "site": "huffingtonpost.com", "site_section": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "U.S. Political News, Opinion and Analysis - HuffPost Politics | HuffPost", "title": "One Month After Texas Church Shooting, House Republicans Vote To Expand Gun Rights", "title_full": "One Month After Texas Church Shooting, House Republicans Vote To Expand Gun Rights | HuffPost", "published": "2017-12-06T22:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 387, "participants_count": 313, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a282657150000d59f85bd7f.jpeg?cache=taahkglhbc&amp;ops=1910_1000", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 139, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b7f9b1f4b191a01692eeceaa0666ab734f92cd75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTYbhkjIy0cBOBf9ZNI2k1BYjTbD7NzHU5Gd92OBsnvD1wfRj41SyGWsYg91Jg1GAjNkwVdWdcY8Top7IY4pl7BgM.rOUG.rnOAjVw.0EDJldy4kTl_ZnaWuxo.UcpmzWMvxr3RLv1xQZXEYvKv4ZJB", "ord_in_thread": 379, "author": "Kevin Kelter", "published": "2017-12-07T10:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Federal law supersedes, we had a civil war about this.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:13.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0cf245aa3394349781be398ab8e13fa67d6c26c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mtwpVP3F9EOzqP8qg136iZk", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/co/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/co/ - Comics &amp; Cartoons - 4chan", "title": "MEGA thread", "title_full": "/co/ - MEGA thread - Comics & Cartoons - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-06T04:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 119, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.011, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d7c1bc4928b28581c565ec5e293cadf07bc02da0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mtwpVP3F9EOzi7_Ch68XIXY2MaycIdiC9M-", "ord_in_thread": 33, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-06T14:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>97307964\nDamn, Thundarr, now that's something I've not seen in a while.

I rarely encounter drivers who are as reckless as a handful of cyclists on the MUP.

(UHS)", "text": "Right time to invest? \u2013 TransUnion (TRU), Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS) By - December 7, 2017 \nShares of TransUnion (NYSE:TRU) are making a strong comeback as they have jumped 89.21% since bottoming out on Dec. 07, 2016. Thanks to a rise of almost 1.81% in the past five days, the stock price is now up 78.01% so far on the year \u2014 still in strong territory. In this case, shares are down -2.45% , the 52-week high touched on Dec. 04, 2017, and are keeping their losses at 87.73% for the past 12 months. TRU Target Price Reaches $55.39 \nBrokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to hold TransUnion (TRU)\u2019s shares projecting a $55.39 target price. Analysts\u201f target price forecasts are a prediction of a stock\u201fs future price, generally over the 12 months following the release date (Asquith et al., 2005). This forecast is a point estimate that provides investors with a benchmark against which to directly compare stock price in the short run.Target prices made by analysts employed by large brokers, who have access to a greater resource pool, are more likely to be met over the 12-month forecast period. How Quickly TransUnion (TRU)\u2019s Sales Grew? \nTRU\u2019s revenue has grown at an average annualized rate of about 10.7% during the past five years. However, the company\u2019s most recent quarter increase of 13.8% looks attractive. The sales growth rate for a stock is a measure of how the stock\u2019s sales per share (SPS) has grown over a specific period of time. It tells an investor how quickly a company is increasing its revenues. The sales growth rate helps investors determine how strong the overall growth-orientation is for a stock or portfolio. Universal Health Services, Inc. Achieves Above-Average Profit Margin \nThe best measure of a company is its profitability, for without it, it cannot grow, and if it doesn\u2019t grow, then its stock will trend downward. Increasing profits are the best indication that a company can pay dividends and that the share price will trend upward. Creditors will loan money at a cheaper rate to a profitable company than to an unprofitable one; consequently, profitable companies can use leverage to increase stockholders\u2019 equity even more. Profitability ratios compare different accounts to see how efficiently a business is generating profits. These ratios show how well income is generated through operations, and are important to both creditors and investors. They help determine the company\u2019s ability to continue operating. Currently, TransUnion net profit margin for the 12 months is at 13.75%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 11.55%, and the sector\u2019s average is 9.4%. In that light, it seems in good position compared to its peers and sector. The profit margin measures the amount of net income earned with each dollar\u2019s worth of revenue. It shows the percentage of sales that remain after all of the company\u2019s expenses have been paid. The higher the ratio, the better. \nUniversal Health Services, Inc. (NYSE:UHS) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -17.02% since hitting a peak level on Mar. 01, 2017. Thanks to an increase of almost 5.81% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 1.2% so far on the year \u2014 still in weak zone. In this case, shares are 13.02% higher, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Nov. 15, 2017, but are collecting gains at -4.16% for the past six months. Analysts See Universal Health Services, Inc. 15.87% Above Current Levels \nThe good news is there\u2019s still room for Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS) to grow. At recent closing price of $107.66, UHS has a chance to add $15.87 or 14.74% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($123.53) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.1 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 0.97 , so you might not be in for a bumpy ride. Are Universal Health Services, Inc. (NYSE:UHS) Earnings Growing Rapidly? \nFor the past 5 years, Universal Health Services, Inc.\u2019s EPS growth has been nearly 12.1%. Sure, the percentage is encouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 5.68%, annually. Is UHS Turning Profits into Returns? \nUniversal Health Services, Inc. (UHS)\u2019s ROE is 15.26%, while industry\u2019s is 11.3%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 16.03%. The return on equity (ROE), also known as return on investment (ROI), is the best measure of the return, since it is the product of the operating performance, asset turnover, and debt-equity management of the firm. If a firm can borrow money and use it to achieve a higher return than the cost of the debt, then the leveraging creates additional revenue that accrues to stockholders as increased equity. \nUniversal Health Services, Inc.\u2019s ROA is 7.14%, while industry\u2019s average is 6.07%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company\u2019s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 11.35. The return on assets (ROA) (aka return on total assets, return on average assets), is one of the most widely used profitability ratios because it is related to both profit margin and asset turnover, and shows the rate of return for both creditors and investors of the company. ROA shows how well a company controls its costs and utilizes its resources.

If students are unwilling to spend the time needed to review the rules and submit a quality essay , they probably won\u2019t be willing to go above and beyond in college , either. \nOther articles:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul vi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "der hauptbestandteil von kamagra flavored", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ann arbor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o\u2019hora  bennett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beowulf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "netflix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas association of supervisors of mathematics tasm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucla admissions essays", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yorkshire pudding", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "association of supervision and curriculum development ascd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of leicester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin banneker association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national council of teachers of mathematics nctm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "downton abbey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamilton county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:14.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0aa3e9f76328b3a1373ea2a0c7d63ec2231d87b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_b2mgF8c2D1y0CaUh2LifJlQ2K1ax8QE4E3hw82kpZEIQjo34WBKuicyKRfnkbxnquxgkaTfFdvQ--", "site_full": "www.bay12forums.com", "site": "bay12forums.com", "site_section": "http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?board=15.0", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "Forum Games and Roleplaying", "title": "Shamelessly Stolen: Titans of Creation (OOC) (8/6)", "title_full": "Shamelessly Stolen: Titans of Creation (OOC) (8/6)", "published": "2017-12-06T09:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 76718, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0aa3e9f76328b3a1373ea2a0c7d63ec2231d87b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_b2mgF8c2D1y0CaUh2LifJlQ2K1ax8QE4E3hw82kpZEIQjo34WBKuicyKRfnkbxnquxgkaTfFdvQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Toady One", "published": "2017-12-06T09:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "Shamelessly Stolen: Titans of Creation (OOC) (8/6)", "text": "Just waitlisting in case half the players mysteriously disappear?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:14.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0aa3e9f76328b3a1373ea2a0c7d63ec2231d87b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_b2mgF8c2D1y0CaUh2LifJlQ2K1ax8QE4E3hw82kpZEIQjo34WBKuicyKRfnkbxnquxgkaTfFdvQ--", "site_full": "www.bay12forums.com", "site": "bay12forums.com", "site_section": "http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?board=15.0", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "Forum Games and Roleplaying", "title": "Shamelessly Stolen: Titans of Creation (OOC) (8/6)", "title_full": "Shamelessly Stolen: Titans of Creation (OOC) (8/6)", "published": "2017-12-06T09:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 76718, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "346b0b26a8009fad202a7922ad1429c02461b2dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_b2mgF8c2D1y0CaUh2LifJlQ2K1ax8QE4E3hw82kpZEIQjo34WBKuicyKRfnkbxnp9yjRCh_BJMn1QSVY1rlGJ", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "ThreeToe", "published": "2017-12-06T19:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "God darnit Micelus, how did I miss this.
