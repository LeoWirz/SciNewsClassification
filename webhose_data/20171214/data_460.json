Alex Wong / Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 9:54 am \nFour months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in \"tatters\" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics. \nIt's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray. \nOn Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch. 1. Russia, Russia, Russia \nWray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, \"a witch hunt.\" \nWray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied to the Trump campaign, including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nDoes that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Strzok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation , suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case? \nShould there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him? \nLook for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this. \n\"The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,\" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing. \n\"We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,\" Goodlatte added. 2. Independence \nThe job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was \"the Russia thing.\" \nFor his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees , who have faced criticism from the president this year. \nThis week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to \"keep calm and tackle hard\" amid the current adverse climate. And, at his confirmation hearing, Wray pledged his loyalty was to the Constitution, not a political regime. \"I will never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice, period, full stop,\" he said at the time. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee will no doubt want to ask Wray about his contacts with President Trump and others in the White House this year. 3. Oh, yeah \u2014 FBI business \nIn a matter of weeks, an important electronic surveillance tool will expire if Congress does not reauthorize it. The murder rate has spiked in several major American cities. \nCourts have thrown out corruption charges or reduced sentences of public officials accused of bribery and other offenses, following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the tools the Justice Department's public integrity unit can use to attack graft in state houses across the country. \nThe bureau also has open investigations into activity by sympathizers of the Islamic State in every one of its field offices. \nThe FBI, in short, has its hands in many baskets. And after the questions about Russia and Trump, members of the committee may want to discuss some business in regular order.

Scott Barbour / Getty Images Members of Parliament celebrate at Parliament House on Thursday in Canberra, Australia, after the approval of same-sex marriage. Michael Masters / Getty Images \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of registered voters and ensured that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\"  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scott barbour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george brandis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "parliament approves same-sex marriage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images members of parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the sydney morning herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "federation square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images  australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:11.040+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a8de18c17f96f8b4ef3e1b548e692f0895029a02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5KwN3j6K0SaRVt7ZUdZctenGVdvhpivl3Nbn1xCJiA5s2W8h45JHisXFWxEbzITaWvDJ3bNf7deoaCBv4eJUy3CzL_q5styuqtcgfBsbpFDDnfc5Qf98QAkjYitmfAh2NWnlfXO6G_dWPVD2fJ5p6", "site_full": "www.express.co.uk", "site": "express.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.newslookup.com/rss/us/top/tv/abcnews.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "ABC News (US)", "title": "North Korea's \u2018PERVASIVE POLICE STATE\u2019 is stopping Trump from striking an Iran style deal", "title_full": "North Korea's \u2018PERVASIVE POLICE STATE\u2019 is stopping Trump from striking an Iran style deal", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/750x445/889188.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1796, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 7, "comments": 0, "shares": 7}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a8de18c17f96f8b4ef3e1b548e692f0895029a02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5KwN3j6K0SaRVt7ZUdZctenGVdvhpivl3Nbn1xCJiA5s2W8h45JHisXFWxEbzITaWvDJ3bNf7deoaCBv4eJUy3CzL_q5styuqtcgfBsbpFDDnfc5Qf98QAkjYitmfAh2NWnlfXO6G_dWPVD2fJ5p6", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "North Korea's \u2018PERVASIVE POLICE STATE\u2019 is stopping Trump from striking an Iran style deal", "text": "North Korea's \u2018PERVASIVE POLICE STATE\u2019 is stopping Trump from striking an Iran style deal North Korea's \u2018PERVASIVE POLICE STATE\u2019 is stopping Trump from striking an Iran style deal EXCLUSIVE: North Korea\u2019s \u201cpervasive police state\u201d is preventing Donald Trump from striking an Iran style deal, a military expert has claimed. PUBLISHED: 04:29, Thu, Dec 7, 2017 | UPDATED: 07:46, Thu, Dec 7, 2017 \nIn an exclusive interview with Express.co.uk, CNN military analyst Cedric Leighton revealed that Kim Jong-un\u2019s tight stranglehold on his people is one of the reasons the population has not risen up and forced Pyongyang to put an end to its provocative efforts. \nHe said: \u201cI think that this is certainly a factor you know when you look at the differences between Iran and North Korea in terms of the government\u2019s ability to control their respective populations it is clearly greater in North Korea. \n\u201cYou know as oppressive as aspects of the Iranian regime may be, the regime in North Korea is far more repressive than anything that has graced either Tehran or any of the other cities in Iran. \n\u201cSo I would say that Kim Jong-un has such as pervasive police state at his command, it makes it easier for him to conduct policies that are perceived internally as being very wise policies because what they serve to is essential maintain the North Korea siege mentality. GETTY Mr Leighton said that a deployment of targeted influence operations would be a long term strategy Related articles Trump's options to stop North Korea threat revealed \n\u201cPrevious reporting makes it absolutely clear that these people believe what they have been told, and what they have been told is that the United States is a hostile power that is bent on destroying the North Korean regime. \n\u201cThe United States, of course, would beg to differ with that characterisation but the fact of the matter is that the North Korean\u2019s see an external threat and there is nothing that will galvanise an external population more than an external threat against all elements of a particular society, so the United States serves that function. \nThe military analyst stated that the brainwashing of North Korea\u2019s people could be halted by the use of targeted influence operations to introduce South Korean and US culture to the hermit kingdom. \nMr Leighton also pointed to the increasing number of defectors as a case in point that the social compact between Kim Jong-un\u2019s provocative regime and his people is weakening. North Korea celebrates latest missile launch and Kim Jong-un visits a flour factory Wed, December 6, 2017 REUTERS 1 of 9 North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un is seen during the inspection of a potato flour factory in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang \nHe added: \u201cOne of the only ways that the United States and South Korea can really change that social dynamic is through the use of targeted influence operations and by that I mean bringing in South Korean culture, American culture. \n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult in such an isolated country as North Korea, but finding ways to open up the society one person at a time to other cultural influences. \n\u201cSome of that is already happening when you see and hear the defectors that have come out from North Korea but they are very few in number although they are increasing over the years. \n\u201cOn the other side of the ledger there are a lot of social and economic pressures on the population and in some cases, especially the further you get away from Pyongyang, there are clear indications that the social compact between the population and the government may not be as strong as the government of North Korea would like us to believe.\u201d \nHowever, the military analyst disclosed that any deployment of targeted influence operations would be a long term strategy that may not be applicable at a time when tensions between the US and North Korea are rising exponentially. \nHe claimed: \u201cIf we take a more long term approach to the North Korean problem and use what in essence are targeted influence operations, that could have a significant impact if used down the road. GETTY Mr Leighton claimed the social compact between Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime and his people is weakening GETTY The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was decertified by Donald Trump in October \n\u201cBut unfortunately we don\u2019t always have the patience to deal with things down the road, we want results now and that\u2019s kind of the mentality that we are dealing with at the moment.\u201d \nAlthough it has since been decertified by Donald Trump in October, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), signed in 2015, prevents Iran from developing nuclear weapons in return for sanctions relief. \nSanctions on Iran strained the country\u2019s ability to function properly, this caused protests that pushed the government to sign the JCPOA in the hope domestic pressures would be lifted.

They signed up with a business supplier on a 55 month contract for supply of gas to their house. They have 18 months remaining and talking to friends now realise they are paying too much. They phoned and asked to break the contract and have been told NO.\nI estimate they have been paying \u00a35-600 more than they could have per anum. Relative doesn't remember why they took it out. I have a copy of the general terms but no evidence of what if anything they signed. I have a copy of the sales pitch letter from 2014 which is very misleading and scary.\nIt is probably relevant to say that before retirement my relative was a professional (not in finance) with an office elsewhere so in a way could have been deemed a 'business'.\nCan anyone advise as to what my line should be with the company and what grounds I have to encourage them to terminate the contract! It feels to me like a case of mis-selling, and there seems moral grounds to waive any penalty (which I don't fully understand but looks like about \u00a3500).\nI haven't named the company publicly because I haven't contacted them yet and don't want to embarrass them if they play fair and see sense.\nThanks.

Office scenes can also be monitored almost in real time from a remote location. \nThe machine recognises its location on a building floor without GPS. \nIt takes off from its port, makes a surveillance flight on a pre-set path and then returns autonomously. \nTaisei plans to start the T-Frend service in April in collaboration with drone system developer Blue Innovation and telecoms operator NTT East. \nThe fee for the service is yet to be officially set but \u201cthe target price\u201d is around \u00a550,000 (RM1,838) a month, said Kato. \nT-Frend\u2019s developers are also studying the possibility of giving the drone facial recognition technology to tell who is in the office after hours or whether there is an intruder. \nAdministrative officials at many companies push overtimers out of the door but this has ironically resulted in these officials working overtime themselves, to say nothing of \u201ccausing friction between employees\u201d, the companies said in a statement. \nFirms have therefore turned to security companies for this task, but they have struggled to provide enough staff given a nationwide labour shortage in Japan. \nT-Frend therefore serves the twin function of reducing overtime and making up for this labour shortage, the firms claimed. \nJapan\u2019s government has been trying to change a culture in which working long hours is perceived as proof of loyalty and dedication. \nEvery year in Japan, long working hours are blamed for dozens of deaths due to strokes, heart attacks and suicides. \nIn February, the country launched the \u201cPremium Friday\u201d programme, urging employees to knock off early on the last Friday of the month with the aim of both reducing work hours and invigorating spending. \nBut the plan fell flat with many claiming the last Friday of the month is one of their busiest days. \u2014 AFP", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "norihiro kato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auld lang syne", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "taisei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auld lang syne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ntt", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tokyo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:14.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e2eb243ccb9ffcbfb942b17cab4e074d233d0680", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1rLH6LdvsLBKnNJGgQMPFgW", "site_full": "nigeria.shafaqna.com", "site": "shafaqna.com", "site_section": "http://nigeria.shafaqna.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nigeria News (News Reader) |", "title": "Trump recognizing Jerusalem as Israel capital has fulfilled Bible prophesy \u2013 Omokri", "title_full": "Trump recognizing Jerusalem as Israel capital has fulfilled Bible prophesy \u2013 Omokri", "published": "2017-12-07T11:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5727, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e2eb243ccb9ffcbfb942b17cab4e074d233d0680", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1rLH6LdvsLBKnNJGgQMPFgW", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "Trump recognizing Jerusalem as Israel capital has fulfilled Bible prophesy \u2013 Omokri", "text": "18 hours ago Trump recognizing Jerusalem as Israel capital has fulfilled Bible prophesy \u2013 Omokri Former aide to the immediate past President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri has hailed the decision of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel...

Can someone maybe provide some feedback/suggestions/considerations? Reviews for each watch looks great, but I am struggling to determine which way to go.

Australia has done it,\u201d Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told the House. \n\u201cEvery Australian had their say and they said it is fair, get on with it!\u201d \nThe historic reforms will commence on Saturday, when same-sex couples can a lodge a notice to marry. They will then have to wait a month before tying the knot. \nLabor opposition leader Bill Shorten hailed the passing of the bill as a uniting moment for Australia, adding: \u201cNow is the time for healing. \n\u201cA time to build, a time to love, and is now at last a time for marriage equality,\u201d he said. \nSame-sex marriage campaigners converged outside parliament in the nation\u2019s capital Canberra to celebrate the historic occasion, which sees Australia join more than 20 other countries in recognising such unions. \n\u201cWe came, we saw, and love finally conquered,\u201d co-chair of the Equality Campaign Alex Greenwich told reporters. \n\u201cWe thank all Australians for their support for saying yes, we thank all those who have campaigned for many years, for over 10 years, for fairness and equality.\u201d \nThe bill was introduced in parliament by the conservative government after Australians last month endorsed the reforms in a controversial voluntary postal vote. \nNearly 80 per cent of eligible voters took part in the poll, and almost 62 per cent of the 12.7 million people who participated chose \u201cyes\u201d on their ballots. \nThe vote had been called by Turnbull, a moderate who backed gay marriage, in the face of opposition from hardliners who refused to back a national plebiscite on the issue. \nIt was opposed by proponents of same-sex marriage, who wanted direct legislative action and argued a poll would expose gay people and their families to hate speech. \nJust under five million people voted \u201cno\u201d, with conservative politicians using their rejection as a catalyst to push for religious exemptions to be included in the bill. \nBut after lengthy debate, both houses of parliament knocked back any religious freedom amendments. \nLeading \u201cno\u201d campaigner Lyle Shelton said it was \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d day. \n\u201cThe Australian people were promised that their freedom of speech, freedom of religion and parental rights would be protected in any same-sex marriage legislation, and this has not happened,\u201d he said. \nWeddings early next year \nThe House vote took place on the last sitting day of parliament for the year, with more than 100 MPs speaking on the bill this week. Queues of people lined up to watch the debate from the public gallery, with some dancing and cheering. \nIn moving scenes, the entire parliament burst into song after the bill passed, belting out the lyrics to the \u201cI Am Australian\u201d song: \u201cWe are one, but we are many; And from all the lands on earth we come; We\u2019ll share a dream and sing with one voice; \u2018I am, you are, we are Australian\u2019.\u201d \nSeveral parliamentarians who supported the changes wore rainbow-coloured socks or ties, including Warren Entsch, described in local media as a \u201cfiercely heterosexual... crocodile-farming, bull-catching Liberal\u201d. \nMPs have paid tribute to Entsch over the pass few weeks for his efforts, with the veteran Liberal MP speaking passionately about his \u201cvery lonely\u201d journey in support of equal rights on the conservative side of politics. \n\u201cThis bill will take from no-one; it simply makes our nation a kinder and a fairer place,\u201d Entsch told parliament this week. \nOne highly anticipated wedding will be the Liberal Party\u2019s Tim Wilson, who proposed to his partner Ryan Bolger while speaking on gay marriage on the floor of the House earlier this week. \nSame-sex marriage is now recognised in more than 20 countries, of which 16 are in Europe. It was most recently authorised on Tuesday by Austria\u2019s top court by 2019 at the latest. \u2014 AFP", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren entsch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill shorten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lyle shelton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex greenwich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan bolger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "entsch", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:15.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6e05775ec54546126878199bea6ed27976006c2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_ZZP0Dx2cu_O.kMTDQft2PGlGXwtqNo3NcyEu5ZYZu6oqcDSJPo2OcP16AvE9EkhmXRQxkfCwcQ--", "site_full": "shirowolfy.deviantart.com", "site": "deviantart.com", "site_section": "http://backend.deviantart.com/rss.xml?q=meta%3Aall+sort%3Atime&type=deviation", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "DeviantArt: Newest", "title": "inktober 10", "title_full": "inktober 10", "published": "2017-12-07T11:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://pre00.deviantart.net/a5fd/th/pre/i/2017/341/2/7/inktober_10_by_shirowolfy-dbvzson.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 264, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6e05775ec54546126878199bea6ed27976006c2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_ZZP0Dx2cu_O.kMTDQft2PGlGXwtqNo3NcyEu5ZYZu6oqcDSJPo2OcP16AvE9EkhmXRQxkfCwcQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "inktober 10", "text": "Not currently featured in any groups.

The trio have started a majority of the club\u2019s Europa League and League Cup games this season but are yet to start a league match, with Giroud making 12 substitute appearances while Wilshere has been limited to four and Walcott to three. \nTheir lack of top-flight action could cost them a spot in their respective nations\u2019 2018 World Cup squads but Wenger said the trio will not move away from the Emirates. \u201cThey have to make their decisions; I have to make mine,\u201d Wenger told reporters on Wednesday. \n\u201cI cannot consider too much the interest of the national team. I want to keep the squad. We do not want to become weaker. \u201cI have to consider the interest of the player but dominant of that will be the interests of the club. If you can combine the two it is even better but, first, what is important is for the club.\u201d \nEngland international Walcott has been at Arsenal for 11 years but is no longer a regular starter but Wenger has backed the 28-year-old to reclaim his spot. \u201cHe has it in him (to become a first-team regular),\u201d Wenger added. \u201cOf course he is frustrated but he is focused. He doesn\u2019t give up at all and is more determined than ever.\u201d \nArsenal have numerous players whose contracts expire in the next two years, including Alexis Sanchez, Aaron Ramsey, Mesut Ozil and Petr Cech. \u201cWhen you pick a team you do not necessarily look how long a contract is,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cThe shorter the contract is, the more hungry the players are usually. The hunger index drops with the length of the contract.\u201d \nArsenal have already progressed to the Europa League knockout stages and host Belarus\u2019 BATE Borisov in their final group game later on Thursday.

E. Schwab Book Review", "text": "Hello Humans! Yes I did finally get round to reading one of the most well-loved books of the fantasy loving world. I have to say A Darker Shade of Magic did not disappoint. I already knew I was going to love this book because I adored the Monsters of Verity duology. I\u2019m so happy to share with you my thoughts on this, the start of another series.\nGoodreads Summary: \nKell is one of the last Antari\u2014magicians with a rare, coveted ability to travel between parallel Londons; Red, Grey, White, and, once upon a time, Black.\nKell was raised in Arnes\u2014Red London\u2014and officially serves the Maresh Empire as an ambassador, traveling between the frequent bloody regime changes in White London and the court of George III in the dullest of Londons, the one without any magic left to see.\nUnofficially, Kell is a smuggler, servicing people willing to pay for even the smallest glimpses of a world they\u2019ll never see. It\u2019s a defiant hobby with dangerous consequences, which Kell is now seeing firsthand.\nAfter an exchange goes awry, Kell escapes to Grey London and runs into Delilah Bard, a cut-purse with lofty aspirations. She first robs him, then saves him from a deadly enemy, and finally forces Kell to spirit her to another world for a proper adventure.\nNow perilous magic is afoot, and treachery lurks at every turn. To save all of the worlds, they\u2019ll first need to stay alive.\nThe worldbuilding, friends. The worldbuilding. That\u2019s one of the things that strongly comes across in this book. Throughout the reading you can tell Schwab just fell in love with this setting, her passion for it comes through in every word and detail and you can\u2019t help but fall in love as well.\nThe same can be said of the characters. I am adding Lila to my list of fantasy characters who would be in my gang if I had a gang\u2026it\u2019s getting quite big now, we\u2019re thinking of getting jackets. But Kell is another amazing protagonist, Schwab manages to write male characters I can actually relate to and it is much appreciated.\nYou can\u2019t avoid the fact that this is a first novel (in a series I mean) and so there are a lot of ends that don\u2019t get tied up, however, I didn\u2019t feel like the plot was gratuitous or setting up anything bigger than itself (though it is). What I mean by that is, this is a fully fledged novel in it\u2019s own right, you could read only this and be mostly satisfied with how things are set up and then turn out. That is what I want from the first novel in a series.\nI won\u2019t wax lyrical about this book (as much as I would love to) because I feel like everything that I could possibly say has already been said by many another blogger.

(noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-02T22:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "\nBy Martin Dempster (The Scotsman) \n\nIt was easily the soundbite that made the biggest impact during a four-and-a-half hour discussion about the future of golf in Scotland. \u201cWe are all on the Titanic if we choose not to do anything,\u201d around 500 delegates were told at the first Scottish Golf national conference at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre.\n\nWhen he was subsequently accused by one delegate of being responsible for \u201ca lot of negativity\u201d about the state of the game in its birthplace by delivering that message, Stewart Darling , a Scottish Golf board member, stuck firmly to his guns. \u201cIt\u2019s not negativity \u2013 it\u2019s reality,\u201d he said in response.\n\nEleanor Cannon , the Scottish Golf chair, kicked off the day\u2019s proceedings in the capital by asking a wide cross section of the game to \u201csuspend disbelief\u201d following recent negativity towards the governing body on the back of a controversial proposed new strategy being put on hold as some keynote speakers addressed the audience and, with all due respect to the others, it was Darling who definitely made the strongest impression in the hall.\n\nHe highlighted that Scottish clubs had been losing roughly 5,000 full members every year in the last 10 years. He warned that the consequence of not doing anything to try and address that situation was an average annual subscription of \u00a3478 rising by 34 per cent in five years\u2019 time and to be 84 per cent higher in 10 years\u2019 time. \u201cThat is a fairly challenging prognosis in any walk of life,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of many illuminating graphics Darling, the CEO of Vianet Group, a strategic insight and cloud based technology business, used to get his message across highlighted golf\u2019s demographic being its biggest problem.\n\nOver 55s make up more than 100,000 of golf club members whereas 24 and unders provide just more than 10,000. He also pointed out that it used to take 20 rounds per year in 2007 for someone to justify their subscription fee and now it is 40.\n\nHe revealed, too, that only 47 per cent of members submit enough cards (three) to retain a handicap while just 53 per cent play in a formal competition.\n\nHaving too many courses is one of the game\u2019s problems. \u201cWe can\u2019t sustain 600 clubs in 10 years\u2019 time,\u201d he warned. Struggling to walk the line between smart and casual?\n\n Darling\u2019s strongest message, though, about what needs to change more than anything was about getting more women into the game. That is based on the fact that women currently make up less than 14 per cent of membership in Scotland. \u201cThere is going to have to be a fundamental re-think,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to think very clearly about the future and how we get women in. It is a big opportunity if we accept this to be the case.\nSome clubs are not welcoming to women and children - that is a fundamental issue. \u201cAlso, we are not connected as a golfing community and need to harness the power of that. Data is the new oil and new water. The power of it is massive for golf. At the moment, we have so little data on our game. We can have power if that changes and that is really important.\u201d\n\nAt the moment, only 6 per cent of Scottish Golf\u2019s income is from a commercial source. Roz Cushieri, another board member, agreed when that situation was described as \u201cabsolutely disgraceful\u201d by a delegate. \u201cBut we need to make sure what we are offering the long list of companies we are engaging with is attractive in terms of inclusivity and other things,\u201d she said before another delegate revealed that one company looking to invest a seven-figure sum in golf had said \u201cno\u201d to Scotland because it felt the game in this country wasn\u2019t \u201cfamily friendly\u201d.\n\nOne of the proposals in that new strategy was to raise the affiliation fee paid by every club member from \u00a311.25 of to \u00a324. Asked if that could still be on the table at the agm in March, board member Malcolm Kpedekpo hinted it might. \u201cThis is the start of a process and, if we think \u00a324 is the right price when we look at the strategy, then it would be wrong not to put it forward.\u201d\n\nCannon, who was delighted with the success of an event that brought the most club administrators, club committee members and professionals under the same roof in Scotland, said she hoped a new chief executive to replace Blane Dodds will be in place early in the New Year. \u201cWe had a tremendous response to the advert and will be holding interviews in December but, as part of the consultation process, we thought it was maybe wise to slow things down a bit to get feedback from today,\u201d she said.  \nRead the full article in the SCOTSMAN: CLICK HERE ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "martin dempster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roz cushieri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm kpedekpo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blane dodds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stewart darling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eleanor cannon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vianet group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edinburgh international conference centre", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:16.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "84b7dcbd4babbf6b257addf7626127275669eaee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kdgErVlnrHOGeS1xF_bHucHwhN7jQOAma9nAo3cJV3pvA5BrdQU0SlRismKWjg8BLqhlio9dud4CChtgdHJTYC96RtxhURnI2pAMA9UaHsg--", "site_full": "www.borderlandbeat.com", "site": "borderlandbeat.com", "site_section": "http://www.borderlandbeat.com/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Borderland Beat", "title": "3 Policemen Shot Dead on the La Paz Malecon/ 6 in 48 Hours", "title_full": "3 Policemen Shot Dead on the La Paz Malecon/ 6 in 48 Hours", "published": "2017-12-07T01:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "14726b581ce916042af3504ace6047dadd626816", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kdgErVlnrHOGeS1xF_bHucHwhN7jQOAma9nAo3cJV3pvA5BrdQU0SlRismKWjg8BLqhlio9dud4CChtgdHJTYC96RtxhURnK4RnY4pwUkzXLn_ixLyKiK", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T03:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "If you are not a \"Capo del Narco\", Polesias de \"inteligencia federal, siedo y pedo sacado con el dedo\" will just have your ass shot up, including your wife and your children, the cat, the dog, the horse, the perico and the chiva...\nLike common criminal Mando Unico polesias Fuerza Delictuva Estatal.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:16.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e6c3058249530e25987875a43eac88daa6063971", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVau.nY6nUqVyPuupgyr.tiSNl3vv1iGICyouR_sM8mDJaPAN5Dq.i8zyjf_Wu_4zqM.dhzm5erPBiPvxi6rIT3dkPQTM2DSrv5.AJo7U1BWjhMdg4okRsI-", "site_full": "www.expedia.no", "site": "expedia.no", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.no/Puerto-Rico-Hoteller.d180021.Reise-Guide-Hoteller", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hotell Puerto Rico | 428 billige hoteller i Puerto Rico p\u00e5 Expedia.no", "title": "Airport Hotel (Puerto Rico,", "title_full": "San Juan Airport Hotel (Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico) | Expedia.no", "published": "2017-08-30T02:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 18, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "14c6fac590ee8e3c3aafaa0e93b39d30fac45237", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVau.nY6nUqVyPuupgyr.tiSNl3vv1iGICyouR_sM8mDJaPAN5Dq.i8zyjf_Wu_4zqM.dhzm5erPBiPvxi6rIT3dkPQTM2DSrv5.AJo7U1BWWXt1bdEyss4ZZFao3_BnuqbYsHOX_XC3IgCm4iBasik-", "ord_in_thread": 17, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-02T21:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "We had a fast check in.

Former Southampton manager Adkins replaces Russian Leonid Slutsky, who was sacked on Sunday with the Tigers recording just four wins in 20 games to sit three points above the relegation zone in 20th position. \n\u201cAdkins will oversee his first training session this morning and will take charge of the side for Saturday\u2019s home game against Brentford.\u201d Hull said on their website.

The 52-year-old took charge at Southampton in 2010 and led them to back-to-back promotions as he guided them up to the Championship in 2011 and the Premier League in 2012 but was fired half-way through the subsequent season. \nAdkins joined Reading in 2013 but was sacked at the end of 2014 with the club well adrift of the Championship playoff spots.

But it was such a huge event, one that finally fully got the United States into the biggest war to date that the world has ever seen. \nThis was such a huge event in American history, and really world history, that it deserves to be mentioned on this day. After all, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor forced America into World War II, as the United States declared war on Japan. Days later, Hitler announced that Germany was declaring war on the United States. \nPearl Harbor is one of those few places almost entirely defined by the significance of one event that took place there. Even the World Trade Center in New York City is not as systematically defined by the attacks there as Pearl Harbor is by the bombing by the Japanese on this day, 75 years ago now. \nEach year, of course, there are fewer and fewer survivors who attend the ceremonies, as the Greatest Generation sadly continues to die off. Still, it seems appropriate to honor their sacrifice, their bravery, and their shining example in the fight to keep the world free from unprecedented tyranny and aggression. \nToday, I honor the sacrifices of those who gave everything that they had to give, often including their very lives, to help keep the world free, particularly on this day, those who were at Pearl Harbor. The world truly is a better place today for their efforts. \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul walsh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hitler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "pearl harbor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world trade center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pearl harbor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:17.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9bd8859ae3b29ba12d9cc2ceecaebd4b3e3c0690", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSptx_IfmwzxXNprwW7uRXqWbbWfoN8sQnU0QXluSzFTdbuOCWtYyXGHPbx.1MG7sWkOnxQnQn0yvV8BxOhRd..", "site_full": "forum.wordreference.com", "site": "wordreference.com", "site_section": "https://forum.wordreference.com/forumdisplay.php?f=6", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "English Only | WordReference Forums", "title": "disease vs. diseases", "title_full": "disease vs. diseases | WordReference Forums", "published": "2015-06-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "https://cdn77f.wordreference.com/data/avatars/m/722/722148.jpg?1434270394", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 315, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "98fbe95fe5d2851d015c4627d3111e1707f371a1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSptx_IfmwzxXNprwW7uRXqWbbWfoN8sQnU0QXluSzFTdbuOCWtYyXGHPbx.1MG7sWkOnxQnQn0ykbIoGD9mEN.iryn.RYdJ.w-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "Kacy.H", "published": "2017-12-07T08:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hello, everyone\nWhat's about my case?
