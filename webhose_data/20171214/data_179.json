Our core business divisions are generating formidable momentum. \n'Our market-leading positions and strong balance sheet, coupled with our management capability is allowing us to benefit from global growth opportunities.'

These sort of processes are ideal for using robotic process automation (RPA). \nImplications \nRPA can enable firms to do things in a faster and better manner, bringing efficiencies into the system. Additionally, there is enhanced security compared to human-driven processes. \nNext Leave a comment! Please sign in or register to comment.

As high net worth individuals (HNWI) become more financially savvy, they are demanding more sophisticated and customised services. To improve HNWI satisfaction, product innovation is essential. \nImplications \nWith firms aggressively pushing digital technologies into the current value chain in wealth management, the industry is likely to see higher penetration of automated advisory and digital marketplace platforms. \nFirms and wealth managers are expected to increasingly use social media and leverage data analytics for prospecting clients. Firms are expected to strategically focus on big data and advanced analytics to enable differentiated services and product solutions for HNWI. \nNext Leave a comment!

Clients are open to switching to other wealth management providers in search of better user experience, thus forcing firms to innovate to keep up with their demands. \nImplications \nFirms need to train their wealth managers on digital capabilities to ensure that all customers, can have the best possible experience during their interactions. Firms need to identify customer needs and identify behaviour patterns better to keep up with evolving clients needs and offer a more collaborative, individualised wealth experience. \nNext Leave a comment!

Increasing digitisation, outsourcing and reliance on emerging technologies such as the internet of things and the cloud increase exposure risk. \nImplications \nDemand for advanced threat protection products using big data analysis to detect and neutralise possible threats will grow at a much faster pace than demand for traditional enterprise security products. \nWealth firms will need to strengthen their cybersecurity capabilities to prevent cyber-attacks that might risk client information. \nNext Leave a comment!

The uncertainty around the sheer number of ever-evolving regulations coming up in domestic as well as international markets has resulted in a paradigm shift for wealth managers, resulting in an increase in the cost of compliance. \nImplications \nFirms have to be up-to-speed with the latest regulations leading to increased compliance and operational costs, which is putting a downward pressure on margins. This could spell trouble for smaller firms and consolidation may be the only answer to survive in such a situation. \nIn the short term, with growing expertise required to keep up with complex regulations, outsourcing of the back-office and the middle-office may be an obvious solution for many firms. \nNext Leave a comment!

This shortfall can be met by a hybrid model, combining self-service and wealth manager-led advice, which has evolved to become as popular as the wealth manager-led path. \nImplications \nAdvisors will likely ease out direct interactions in the mass affluent client segments while providing customised services at the higher end. \nWealth management firms may have to adjust to slimmer revenue margins in core areas of business as fee structures will be revised to accommodate higher self-service capabilities. \nNext Leave a comment!

Firms need to retrain and improve wealth manager capabilities to help understand the distinct needs of the new client segments. \nNext Leave a comment! Please sign in or register to comment.

With HNWI demanding better transparency around fees, alongside competition from fintech, wealth managers are having to assess their pricing strategies and consider better fee models to acquire and retain clients. \nImplications \nWealth management firms are likely to devise transparent fee models in line with what clients want - they need to move towards client-friendly models such a fees based on performance, a fee-by-service module, fixed yearly fees, or a combination model. \nShare of fees as a percentage of assets is destined to go down, though not completely, but fees by performance and by module will likely be the most popular models in the near future. \nNext Leave a comment!

Chairman Ken Anderson 8 comments \nWANDERERS have announced reduced ticket prices will apply for January\u2019s FA Cup Third Round clash with Huddersfield Town. \nChairman Ken Anderson confirmed yesterday admission for the game will be \u00a315 for adults and \u00a35 for concessions in all areas of the ground. \n\u201cIt was extremely pleasing to see us draw Premier League opposition in the form of Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup and the fact that it is a home game is a huge boost for us as we look to cause something of an upset,\u201d he said. \n\u201cI hope as many of you as possible will take advantage of this promotion and come along, get behind the team and help get us into the fourth round of this prestigious competition.\u201d \nWanderers have also announced the Macron will no longer be the hub for next summer\u2019s Ironman triathlon, which takes place on the same weekend as two major concerts, and will now be at Queen\u2019s Park. \nAnderson has been delighted at commercial progress made in recent weeks, which also includes a seven-figure contract between the Whites Hotel and a Chinese-based language training school. \n\u201cI have to say that the last few weeks have been some of the best and most enjoyable times for me at the club so far, as l have seen that all the hard work and efforts our staff have put in over the last 20 months starting to reap rewards and in turn, it is putting the club and Bolton Whites Hotel in a position to get back to where it once was,\u201d he said. \n\u201cBringing Little Mix and The Killers concerts to Macron Stadium next summer is a major coup and just goes to show how far the club has come.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities":

At one point, the meeting was interrupted after USR House members, outraged that the chairman of the meeting did not allow them to back their amendments, left their seats and gathered in front of the hall, holding pieces of paper reading \u201cThieves.\u201d \nThe Lower House meeting resumed on Wednesday, meeting chairman Gabriel Vlase chairing the proceedings with the help of a portable microphone, after the central rostrum was occupied by USR lawmakers. \n\u201cI\u2019m forced to continue the meeting. This is what the USR colleagues have reduced Parliament to,\u201d PSD\u2019s Gabriel Vlase said. \nVlase restarted the voting procedure on the amendments to law no.303/2004 on the statute of magistrates. \nUSR lawmakers continued to protest, gathering around the central rostrum in the Lower House, holding signs reading \u201cThieves\u201d and using a megaphone to voice their discontent. \nThe Liberals once again asked for the proceedings to be suspended, considering the scandal, but their request was rejected by vote. \n\nUSR MPs stage spontaneous protest \n\nThe Save Romania Union (USR) floor group in the Lower House on Wednesday staged a spontaneous protest in the plenary session hall over the continuation of debates on the laws of the \u201cIordache Committee\u201d. \nThey displayed white sheets of paper that read \u201cThieves!\u201d \nUSR MP Stelian Ion, a member on the Justice Legislation Select Committee, used a megaphone to state out the reasons for the protest, as the microphone was cut by the chairman of the meeting, Gabriel Vlase. \n\nDragnea on amending judicial laws: Let\u2019s see how the magistrates\u2019 accountability is resolved \n\nPSD President Liviu Dragnea stated on Wednesday, when asked whether he is pleased with the amendments brought to the judicial laws, that it depends on the way the magistrates\u2019 accountability issue will be regulated within the plenum. \n\u201cLet\u2019s see how the magistrates\u2019 accountability is resolved,\u201d Dragnea said in Parliament when asked whether he is pleased with the form of the judicial laws. \nLikewise, when asked why he did not postpone the amendments to the judicial laws, following the death of King Mihai, the PSD leader said he cannot comment on it. \n\u201cI really cannot take the liberty \u2013 out of respect for His Majesty \u2013 to comment this thing. How can someone condition a discussion, a debate on laws, on that unfortunate event yesterday?\u201d Liviu Dragnea claimed. \nSenate Speaker Calin Popescu-Tariceanu pointed out it is inappropriate to talk about putting a stop to the proceedings of Parliament or of other institutions. \n\u201cThey are two distinct things. It\u2019s improper to talk about stopping the proceedings of Parliament or of other institutions. Institutions are working. During such moments, as you well know, the Government decrees days of mourning. The days of mourning entail the limiting of certain activities of a festive character, but not work,\u201d Tariceanu said. \nAfter the speeches gave in the memory of King Mihai, PNL\u2019s House whip Raluca Turcan asked for the plenary meeting to cease, her request being rejected by the PSD-ALDE majority. \n\u201cBased on Article 91, Paragraph 3, we request that today\u2019s meeting ceases. After we witnessed a recourse to the solid values of the nation, moments that positively marked our history, today\u2019s meeting \u2013 which is foreshadowed to be one focusing on bills unrelated to the interest of the nation, but to a more limited interest \u2013 should be suspended; we should reflect on a strong, united Romania of the many, not of personal interest,\u201d Turcan said. \nHer request was rejected by the plenum, with a majority of votes. \n\nTurcan on debate on bill concerning statute of magistrates: Circus inside does good to no one; debates must take place with arguments and solutions \n\nPNL First Vice President Raluca Turcan stated on Wednesday, when the Lower House meeting debating law no.303/2004 on the statute of magistrates was interrupted by a protest staged by USR lawmakers, that \u201cthe circus inside does good to no one\u201d and that the debates must take place with arguments. Turcan added that the PNL group will remain in the hall in order to continue to ask for a debate on the articles of and amendments brought to the law concerning the statute of magistrates. \n\u201cWe consider that Parliament must have a civilised spirit of debate, arguments, solutions, so that people from outside Parliament would feel this institution reflects them. The circus inside does good to no one. We can neither take over Parliament\u2019s rostrum by force, nor stop the debate in what is the forum of democracy in any country. Hence, PNL will remain in the plenum of Parliament to continue demand and lobby for \u2013 with arguments \u2013 a debate on the articles of the bill put up for debate, concerning the accountability of magistrates, and we hope that in this way, through serious, professional conduct, we will nevertheless manage to calm the spirits and this institution would not discredit itself even more. We are unique in Europe,\u201d Raluca Turcan stated. \nShe said our country is \u201cunique\u201d against the backdrop in which House Speaker Liviu Dragnea received a final conviction in a dossier, is indicted in another one, and a suspect in a third. The lawmaker stated that the current ruling coalition only wants to pass all laws without debate and \u201cin a fast-forward manner.\u201d \n\u201cThe gravest problem in Parliament has to do with the name of Mr Liviu Dragnea and his presence at the helm of the Lower Chamber. The second problem, just as grave, is the assault on this institution, in order to pass \u2013 without debate, in an abusive and irregular way \u2013 bills that seek to politically subordinate the judiciary, intimidate magistrates and, in the end, whitewash the corruption dossiers of those who have confiscated the political decision within the ruling coalition,\u201d Turcan emphasised. \n\nProtest outside Parliament while plenum debated law on statute of magistrates \n\nSeveral hundred persons were protesting outside the Palace of Parliament while the Lower House was debating law no.303/2004 on the statute of magistrates. \n\u201cTake to the street!

Nearly 1,800 firefighters and a fleet of aircraft are fighting the flames but the blaze is only 5% contained and an estimated 12,000 buildings are in danger. \nEarlier a wildfire in a wealthy western area of Los Angeles reached an estate and winery owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch. \n#SantaAnaWinds will continue to elevate fire danger in Southern CA with expectant winds reaching 80 mph on Thursday.

Alfie used to need a rest half way up the stairs before he lost weight (PDSA/PA) \n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t even walk up the stairs; he\u2019d struggle halfway up and then had to stop for a rest before getting to the top. \n\u201cOn walks, he would sluggishly walk towards a ball we\u2019d thrown and often wouldn\u2019t bother even trying to bring it back. \n\u201cBut since being on the diet his tail hasn\u2019t stopped wagging. \n\u201cHe leaps and bounds, and is so full of energy.\u201d Alfie\u2019s owner Emily Simcox asked for help from the PDSA in getting his weight down (PDSA/PA) \nAlfie\u2019s transformation came by sticking to a strict diet and his owner showing tough love by learning to say no when he demanded food. \nNot that it all went smoothly, Ms Simcox said. \n\u201cI was making a cheese sandwich and left it on the kitchen counter,\u201d she said. \n\u201cI walked back in the room to find Alfie licking his lips, and the cheese sandwich gone.\u201d \nShe urged other pet owners to seek help if their animal is overweight. \nShe said: \u201cAlfie is proof that change is possible \u2013 we\u2019ll never look back.\u201d Lola the rabbit from Derby was also a big loser, shedding a quater of her weight (PDSA/PA) \nAlfie\u2019s weight loss was supervised by PDSA vet nurse Steph Williams, from Middlesbrough PDSA Pet Hospital. \nShe said: \u201cHe is unrecognisable from the dog that waddled into our hospital for his first weigh-in six months ago. \n\u201cHe\u2019s much healthier and will be able to enjoy a much happier life.\u201d \nPDSA vet nurse Katy Orton, who helped to judge the competition, said up to 40% of cats and dogs in the UK are fat, but help is available.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alfie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alfie alfie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emily simcox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steph williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simcox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katy orton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "middlesbrough", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pdsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middlesbrough pdsa pet hospital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "derby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:58.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "888d0d3678597a04f650495dcefd8c914620fddc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZROkKpaIVe38s2Fgp28pRtRnMM_Vq83VYC5l81aOYuVP8VPR04KTLYLOVQc2_hp2uULuzWrAMXieKWm9ZMQGKVuF.QLeN.oiWY-", "site_full": "www.fiatforum.com", "site": "fiatforum.com", "site_section": "https://www.fiatforum.com/bravo/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bravo - The FIAT Forum", "title": "General: Purchase Advice?

You can\u2019t think too far ahead in football because it changes in an instant. \n\u201cNobody knows what the future holds or what might happen in January but all I can do is keep kicking on, working hard and giving my all for Bolton. \n\u201cPersonally I think I\u2019m doing okay \u2013 I\u2019m getting the games and I\u2019m just working hard to help the team. \n\u201cIt was great to get that first league goal under my belt a couple of weeks ago against Norwich too.

drop Photo credit: Reuters Reuters December 7, 2017 09:31 CET \nBERLIN -- New-car registrations in Germany, Europe's largest auto market, will grow to one of their highest-ever levels this year, fueled by a strong economy and sales incentives for cleaner diesel models, the country's main auto lobby said. \nRegistrations of passenger cars in the home market of Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW may rise at least 3 percent to 3.4 to 3.5 million vehicles, nearing an all-time record of 3.8 million achieved in 2009 thanks to a national scrappage scheme to spur a then-slumping car market. \nPersistent economic growth, high employment levels, solid wages and low interest rates have helped Germany's auto market post a fourth straight significant gain in annual sales, Matthias Wissmann, head of the VDA auto industry association said at a news conference on Wednesday. \n\"A level of between 3.4 and 3.5 million is a historic high,\" Wissmann said. \"Except for the (year of the) scrappage incentives, I can't think of another year\" with such strong demand. \nHowever, with diesel cars' share of overall German registrations locked into decline amid a public discussion about possible driving bans to help fight pollution, car sales may slide by 2 percent next year to slightly below 3.4 million vehicles, Wissmann said. \n\"The debate about driving bans is the only factor that brings about a certain restraint among customers,\" Wissmann said. \nHe said he predicted that the market share of diesel models in Germany would drop below 40 percent on average in 2017 from about 45 to 46 percent last year. \nPressure is growing on Germany to enforce clean air limits as dozens of cities, including Munich and Stuttgart where BMW and Daimler are based, could face penalties for allowing nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels in excess of European Union limits introduced in 2010, the DUH environmental lobby has said. \nWissmann said a positive ruling by Germany's highest administrative court in Leipzig in February could help stop the steady decline in diesel model sales. \nThe Federal Administrative Court is expected to discuss on Feb. 22, 2018 a ruling by a lower tribunal which said diesel vehicle bans are necessary to help meet EU clean air rules.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons":

after Donald Trump\u2019s decision on status of Jerusalem Palestinians burn a poster of Donald Trump in Bethlehem (Nasser Shiyoukhi/AP) \nSchools and shops have closed in the West Bank, as Palestinians protested against President Donald Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. \nPolitical groups have called for protest marches in West Bank town centres at noon on Thursday. \nMr Trump\u2019s dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of US policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. \nThe Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. \nIn recognising Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, Mr Trump was seen as siding with Israel which claims the entire city. \nMeanwhile, Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused Mr Trump of throwing the Middle East into a \u201cring of fire\u201d with his decision on the holy city.

My question is what would be the best job to train for to maintain a cashflow. I can dedicate myself full time to any training whether it be at home or in school. I have two Associate Degrees in Science and Liberal Arts, and I have been teaching myself Python but only for fun. I honestly don't know what the best next step would be. I have been working secluded in a black market for for years and am unaware of what the career landscape is in these modern times. For example, I'm pretty sure truck driving would be a bad choice. If any of you have advice that would be much appreciated. Also I would be happy to answer any weed industry questions if you are curious.\nupdate; Sorry if I seem negative or combative in some of my responses to your suggestions.

GVC owns a raft of brands, including Sportingbet and Foxy Bingo (PA) \nIt would see Ladbrokes Coral shareholders own around 46.5% of the combined group and GVC around 53.5%. \nGVC chief executive Kenneth Alexander is expected to lead the combined group, although the firms said plans for the final management line-up would be worked out over the coming weeks. \nThe firms said: \u201cThe enlarged group would be an online-led globally positioned betting and gaming business that would benefit from a multi-brand, multi-channel strategy applied across some of the strongest brands in the sector. \n\u201cThe enlarged group would be geographically diversified with a large portfolio of businesses across both regulated and developing markets, with the scale and resources to address the dynamics of a rapidly changing global industry.\u201d \nThe talks come after two previous attempts at a deal between the pair, but the latest discussions broke down in the summer over price and ahead of the Government\u2019s gambling review. \nThe final price that GVC is prepared to pay for Ladbrokes depends on the outcome of the review of fixed-odds betting terminals (FOTBs), which could see the maximum stake slashed to as little as \u00a32 from \u00a3100. \nIt comes amid a wave of consolidation in the sector, which has been under pressure pending the review, which is expected to significantly cut earnings from the lucrative betting machines \u2013 dubbed the crack cocaine of gambling. \nLadbrokes completed its \u00a32.3 billion merger with Coral in November last year, but it is understood GVC first approached Ladbrokes over a tie-up when it was finalising the deal. \nGVC said it expects \u201cmaterial synergies\u201d from a merger with Ladbrokes, which it would lay out in any forthcoming firm offer. GVC boss Kenneth Alexander is being lined up to lead the combined group if the deal goes ahead (GVC/PA) \nThe combined group would have beefed up operations across some of the world\u2019s biggest regulated online gaming markets, including the UK, Italy and Australia. \n\u201cThe enlarged group would have strong growth prospects with momentum in its online businesses, potential for material synergies including the use of leading proprietary technology, and the opportunity to select the best of both people and operations,\u201d the firms added. \nLadbrokes has nearly 3,700 bookies on the high street, while Isle of Man-based GVC has a raft of brands after a series of acquisitions, most recently snapping up bwin.party in February last year.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "foxy bing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenneth alexander", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ladbrokes coral", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gvc ladbrokes coral", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gvc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foxy bingo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ladbrokes", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sportingbet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:59.113+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "34cb5c67f83a3cdb379d1b98b61f7ea6a7b58070", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOoPU75KywExkuMJvIdSBAr2ZpdAP4erQGwY_vELS6sHBIOXIc2cVkLUIf6TgHke3A80m00RppccZ5j6a3qAbm214mBF1WB9dRAQsS8KOQwU_g2jbUWjKTiT", "site_full": "smritistravellingboots.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://smritistravellingboots.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Travelling Boots", "title": "Fashion Tips for the Smart Traveller", "title_full": "Fashion Tips for the Smart Traveller", "published": "2015-06-24T04:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 18, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d5192e828b20f67b3934ada011f556db98c7be0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOoPU75KywExkuMJvIdSBAr2ZpdAP4erQGwY_vELS6sHBIOXIc2cVkLUIf6TgHke3A80m00RppccZ5j6a3qAbm214mBF1WB9dRAQsS8KOQwU_pLDIQ1Q8etax5V5bNdUVdI-", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "Prabir Meher", "published": "2017-11-18T10:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "amazing places . thanks for sharing this pictures .

Police have disputed Nasa tallies in the past, saying only a few dozen people died in clashes that rocked Nairobi and several counties in western Kenya.

I know how frustrating it can be when we want answers and support in what we are dealing with and none is given. I understand how vivid and scary nightmares can wake you up in panic allowing for more symptoms to take over as well. In your case, oh I do believe you are experiencing the dreams and the panic and that it is not all in your head. I feel it could be a combination of massive/severe anxiety and/or medication induced. I know when I was on certain medications, the dreams/nightmares were weird, scary and would prompt me to also wake up in a panic, panting, sweating and shaking. Some medications work on a part of our brain that is responsible in our dreaming. I know this to be true because once I was off the medications, the nightmares disappeared. I'd talk with your doctor who prescribes your meds to see what he says. If you are working with a therapist, they too may be able to help you with the aftermath of waking up with these symptoms. That dizzy/weird to explain feelings can be coming from the medication or the rush of adrenaline upon having these dreams. I hope you get more answers and feel less alone in dealing with something most of us experience both good and bad. Stay positive. I know you've been through this for a while now but it will eventually pass and things will get better. :) xx", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:00.036+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f2a402b743ef0f39275721ab10e39fbf561f0933", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRb49YCQbprQVTO7B6fq4Qkdo2X3yZ.pgwceEcS6jR1L2PzNzSttKpKG_p2P88lMZbv2rNvgolkefms8N9cGE3uQLSmZKH0w4ecDJFocIeqlxrBUuyk.1OM", "site_full": "www.desidime.com", "site": "desidime.com", "site_section": "https://www.desidime.com/forums/local-deals-offers", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping"], "section_title": "Find Local Deals &amp; Offers for Restaurants, Fitness, Travel, Shopping, Beauty &amp; more - DesiDime ", "title": "Register for Healthy Day Clinics", "title_full": "Register for Healthy Day Clinics - Local Deals and Offers Forum at DesiDime", "published": "2017-12-07T22:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.188, "main_image": "https://cdn2.desidime.com/logo/Desidime_Logo-1200X630.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9399, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f2a402b743ef0f39275721ab10e39fbf561f0933", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRb49YCQbprQVTO7B6fq4Qkdo2X3yZ.pgwceEcS6jR1L2PzNzSttKpKG_p2P88lMZbv2rNvgolkefms8N9cGE3uQLSmZKH0w4ecDJFocIeqlxrBUuyk.1OM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mds248", "published": "2017-12-07T22:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "Register for Healthy Day Clinics", "text": "https://www.apollospectra.com/healthy-day-c...cs\nRegister now and get complementry consultation worth RS 1000, 50% discount on screening packages.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:00.037+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cf5e7295ebf6836b9c5f289898d4c285fa4d7cb0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS4mlWRaQOV30AHBjwgH78HaLneCKktrsXSJfx6_ulzymPkO28pdl1W20_UOAGQz6_dI_5gU7EKO04COLI1t31WhwLmysaV8_1jb6ES7yTK51JNyxhTlJ4sDWQuSlWN7bs", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "comments : personalfinance", "title": "peacekeeper76 Heads up: Fannie Mae will now be buying and accepting loans made with one credit report frozen.

If you are worried about your credit info being breached but didn\u2019t freeze all three agencies, do that now.", "text": "Why this is important: With the recent Equifax breach, plenty of people have put freezes on their credit reports (for good reason). But if you only froze one, someone can now still take out a loan on your name if they have the rest of your info.\nWhat changed: Until recently, Fannie Mae required all three credit reports to actually report for them to buy a loan from a bank. The change now allows for your report to be frozen with one credit reporting agency, but the other two must be unfrozen.\nWhy this matters: Your local bank might sell the mortgages they originate to Fannie Mae. Many small and even moderately sized banks have investors they sell mortgages to. Fannie Mae is one of the largest investors here. The loan must be originated and underwritten to Fannie Mae\u2019s standards for them to purchase it. This means that Fannie Mae\u2019s guidelines impact your local banks\u2019 guidelines if they sell to them. This change means that other banks will now be allowing this same thing. So if you\u2019re worried about your credit but didn\u2019t freeze it with all three agencies, do that now.\nEdit: source\u2014I\u2019m a technical writer at a bank and am rewriting our internal procedures on what we accept based on the above as I type this.\nEdit 2: I\u2019m not suggesting Fannie Mae originates loans. The thing is that their decisions as an investor will impact how banks do business. Fannie Mae says they\u2019ll take loans that are riskier? Banks that sell to Fannie Mae will start originating those riskier loans because they know they can sell them. This is about Fannie Mae (being a large investor) saying they\u2019ll take loans with one frozen score, so some banks will start accepting that too and not require that it be unfrozen. All I was saying was, if you were concerned but thought freezing one or two was good enough, that\u2019s not necessarily the case.\n submitted by /u/poopsmitherson\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:00.037+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "adad7e41c2a076881716f9afdbe86dcfb9fecb31", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8_DRNYNHvKGwBXjWTOM6I0U79Afshb8Vcrq1xO7vJT9zmUVwf6rhtH", "site_full": "www.55188.com", "site": "55188.com", "site_section": "http://www.55188.com/forum-8-2.html", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "\u0104\u017e\u0161\u00c9\u0118\u0110\u0118\u013e\u0150\u02dd\u0110\u0139\u010e\u02d8\u02dd\u0165\u00c1\u00f7\u00c7\u0159\u0104\u017c - \u013e\u00da2\u0147\u0142 - \u0154\u00ed\u010e\u00eb\u00c2\u0170\u011a\u0142 \u00d6\u0110\u0161\u00fa\u010c\u00cb\u0106\u0159\u00d7\u00ee\u00cd\u00fa\u013e\u00c4\u0161\u00c9\u0106\u0105\u00c2\u0170\u011a\u0142", "title": "\u0104\u017e\u00cb\u017a\u00c2\u02c7\u0104\u017c2017-10-18 \u0165\u00ee\u00d4\u017e\u0118\u0110\u00d6\u013e \u00c1\u02d8\u011a\u013aK\u010e\u00df 3K2 - \u013e\u00da3\u0147\u0142 - \u0154\u00ed\u010e\u00eb\u00c2\u0170\u011a\u0142", "title_full": "\u0104\u017e\u00cb\u017a\u00c2\u02c7\u0104\u017c2017-10-18 \u0165\u00ee\u00d4\u017e\u0118\u0110\u00d6\u013e \u00c1\u02d8\u011a\u013aK\u010e\u00df 3K2 - \u013e\u00da3\u0147\u0142 - \u0154\u00ed\u010e\u00eb\u00c2\u0170\u011a\u0142 \u00d6\u0110\u0161\u00fa\u010c\u00cb\u0106\u0159\u00d7\u00ee\u00cd\u00fa\u013e\u00c4\u0161\u00c9\u0106\u0105\u00c2\u0170\u011a\u0142", "published": "2017-12-06T11:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "CN", "spam_score": 0.012, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 25940, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "377271a6ab686e7f445e69cd5e17e4a5946b85cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8_DRNYNHvKGwBXjWTOM6I0U79Afshb8Vcrq1xO7vJT92bafKDVCebSci6byCI94QKkYUFCmMDmeGTb._m2XW2iRmr.7X_.0P0-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Q\u0141\u00df2917206", "published": "2017-12-07T09:51:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "2017-12-07 \u0165\u00ee\u00d4\u017e\u0118\u0110\u00d6\u013e \u00c1\u02d8\u011a\u013aK\u010e\u00df CYS13 3K2 ZNZ\u0150\u0170\u010e\u00df SAR", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:00.039+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "490ece228880e7ba3ef9ac18a2d54b6a86cdb42c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UdqVxWPWnzo4RDG6TE5AdAuyLNJnIqjs7fh5Ee08YEslxvf1uEVaLtDr.3DTOPTvUYukMPCjqJBPr8WhsG1YGpSbmaxEjFgRq17Yx2ZzADH7GyXreuIfkM_1voHP7dIfDE-", "site_full": "darcnews.com", "site": "darcnews.com", "site_section": "http://darcnews.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "DARC News", "title": "Is There Strength Behind the Numbers For Clean Teq Holdings Ltd (CLQ.AX)", "title_full": "Is There Strength Behind the Numbers For Clean Teq Holdings Ltd (CLQ.AX)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "490ece228880e7ba3ef9ac18a2d54b6a86cdb42c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UdqVxWPWnzo4RDG6TE5AdAuyLNJnIqjs7fh5Ee08YEslxvf1uEVaLtDr.3DTOPTvUYukMPCjqJBPr8WhsG1YGpSbmaxEjFgRq17Yx2ZzADH7GyXreuIfkM_1voHP7dIfDE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Darc News Contributor", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "Is There Strength Behind the Numbers For Clean Teq Holdings Ltd (CLQ.AX)", "text": "Is There Strength Behind the Numbers For Clean Teq Holdings Ltd (CLQ.AX)   \nClean Teq Holdings Ltd (CLQ.AX)\u2019s closing price of $1.475 has closed above it\u2019s Parabolic SAR reading, indicating a potential trend reversal. \nParabolic SAR (or PSAR) is a simple, compact indicator that can provide some useful information when taking into account additional trends and factors. It is not typically recommended, however to use it as a stand-alone to generate trading signals. Since it is time and price based it is not adept at measuring the actual strength of a trend, merely its direction and duration. It is a good idea to use it in conjunction with additional indicators that can help determine the trend\u2019s strength. \nTraders may be keeping a close eye on ATR indicators. The current 14-day ATR for Clean Teq Holdings Ltd (CLQ.AX) is currently sitting at 0.09. The ATR measures the volatility of a stock on a day-to-day basis. The average true range is typically based on 14 periods and may be calculated daily, weekly, monthly, or intraday. The ATR is not considered a directional indicator, but it may reflect the strength of a particular move. \nChecking in on some other technical levels, the 14-day RSI is currently at 48.25, the 7-day stands at 39.61, and the 3-day is sitting at 18.87. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a commonly used technical momentum indicator that compares price movement over time. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold. The RSI may be useful for spotting abnormal price activity and volatility. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. The normal reading of a stock will fall in the range of 30 to 70. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued. A reading under 30 may indicate that the stock is oversold, and possibly undervalued. \nAnother technical indicator that may be a powerful resource for determining trend strength is the Average Directional Index or ADX. The ADX was introduced by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970\u2019s and it has stood the test of time. The ADX is typically used in conjunction with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to help spot trend direction as well as trend strength. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Clean Teq Holdings Ltd (CLQ.AX) is noted at 23.00. Many technical analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. \nThe Williams Percent Range or Williams %R is another technical indicator worth taking a look at. Clean Teq Holdings Ltd (CLQ.AX) currently has a 14 day Williams %R of -66.67. The Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and -100 measuring whether a security is overbought or oversold. The Williams %R is similar to the Stochastic Oscillator except it is plotted upside-down. Levels above -20 may indicate the stock may be considered is overbought. If the indicator travels under -80, this may signal that the stock is oversold. Chart analysts may also use the indicator to project possible price reversals and to define trends. \nClean Teq Holdings Ltd (CLQ.AX) currently   5.33. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal.

It was a game we should have won \u2013 we didn\u2019t, but the attitude and desire was good.\u201d \nCockton\u2019s replacement in the front row, Rory Biggins, made his first XV debut and scored the visitors\u2019 first try five minutes before half time to halve Wigton\u2019s 10-0 lead, although the hosts\u2019 converted try just before the break made Bolton\u2019s uphill task that bit steeper. \nAnother debutant, half-time replacement Ben Cottam, won a penalty soon after the restart, which Joe Speakman kicked. \nThe full-back\u2019s boot was needed again soon after, when Kieran Shacklock scored the try of the match. \nAndrew Wood started the move in the Cherry and Whites\u2019 own 22 and Shacklock evaded three covering defenders to race more than 50 metres to touch down. It got even better for Bolton when captain Rhys Pritchard sneaked in for try number three. Speakman\u2019s conversions meant they led 22-17. \nHowever, two penalties edged Wigton 23-22 ahead before Critchlow incurred the wrath of the referee, who selected him for a spell in the sin-bin following a team yellow card. \nOn his return, the second-row forward was forced off again, this time by injury, and an unconverted try for Wigton set the seal on their win. \nCrouch\u2019s men are back on home turf for their final two games of the year but will be without Cockton, since modern-day concussion protocols require him to sit out two to three matches following a blow. \nAnd in those matches against Tarleton and Aspatria, the coach will put his faith in young players who are still finding their feet in the game, and says many of these \u2018rough diamonds\u2019 can look forward to a good future. \n\u201cWe are in something of a transitional period,\u201d said Crouch. \u201cWe\u2019ve picked up another couple of prospects who will join us for training this week, as well as having Rory and Ben playing in the first team. Rory just doesn\u2019t have the weight of Chris, there\u2019s probably a weight difference of three or four stone, but he played very well at Wigton. \n\u201cWe lost three big, beefy lads from last season and we\u2019ve got some good, young players \u2013 the likes of Ryan McClusky, Joe Speakman, Josh Holmes and Kieran Shacklock aren\u2019t 20 yet. \n\u201cYoung players often make the wrong decisions in games but their attitude is terrific, they just want to go out and play, and they\u2019re getting better and better. The attitude in games and in training is great. We\u2019re not the biggest team in the division so we need to be smarter in our play.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dave crouch", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bolton", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "joe speakman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rhys pritchard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan mcclusky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh holmes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "critchlow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rory biggins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cockton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben cottam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shacklock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wigton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew wood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kieran shacklock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crouch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "speakman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris cockton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louis critchlow", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wigton", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "wigton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tarleton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aspatria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:00.069+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7246dd609851d6464cac9238b75059d70f32aa08", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UdqVxWPWnzo4Xoo3sMZQLr91s3DSmd4U4m1y0WDEOR5fDFg3BnIvz0aWQFY.XZVEXQZYWECCRh6G4ClNBuvYcXHJnxb_k0mAl00avvZjXrb8N16ofWWMfri", "site_full": "darcnews.com", "site": "darcnews.com", "site_section": "http://darcnews.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "DARC News", "title": "Taking a Deeper Look into the Numbers For Coates International (COTE)", "title_full": "Taking a Deeper Look into the Numbers For Coates International (COTE)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7246dd609851d6464cac9238b75059d70f32aa08", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UdqVxWPWnzo4Xoo3sMZQLr91s3DSmd4U4m1y0WDEOR5fDFg3BnIvz0aWQFY.XZVEXQZYWECCRh6G4ClNBuvYcXHJnxb_k0mAl00avvZjXrb8N16ofWWMfri", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Darc News Contributor", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "Taking a Deeper Look into the Numbers For Coates International (COTE)", "text": "Taking a Deeper Look into the Numbers For Coates International (COTE)   \nCoates International (COTE) will be on trader\u2019s radar at the beginning of the upcoming session as the closing price ticked above the Parabolic SAR indicator (PSAR). The PSAR, Developed by Welles Wilder, is designed to determine the point in time when there emerges a better than average probability of a trend switching directions. This is a common tool used by traders and investors to try to gauge potential reversal of a trend. \nThe parabolic SAR is shown on the charts as a series of small \u2018dots\u2019 that are placed either above or below the price. When the price is trending to the upside, the dots are below the price action and when the price is trending to the downside, the dots are above the price action. The basic use of the Parabolic SAR is to buy when the dots move below the price bars (signaling an uptrend) and sell/short-sell when the dots move above the price bars (signaling a downtrend). \nAfter a recent look, Coates International (COTE) has a 50-day Moving Average of 0.00, the 200-day Moving Average is 0.00, and the 7-day is noted at 0.01. A popular tool among technical stock analysts is the moving average. Moving averages are considered to be lagging indicators that simply take the average price of a stock over a specific period of time. Moving averages can be very useful for identifying peaks and troughs. They may also be used to help the trader figure out proper support and resistance levels for the stock. \nTraders may be relying in part on technical stock analysis. Coates International (COTE) currently   113.48. Despite the name, CCI can be used on other investment tools such as stocks. The CCI was designed to typically stay within the reading of -100 to +100. Traders may use the indicator to determine stock trends or to identify overbought/oversold conditions. A CCI reading above +100 would imply that the stock is overbought and possibly ready for a correction. On the other hand, a reading of -100 would imply that the stock is oversold and possibly set for a rally. \nAt the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Coates International (COTE) is 54.83. Many technical chart analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. The ADX is typically plotted along with two other directional movement indicator lines, the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI). Some analysts believe that the ADX is one of the best trend strength indicators available. \nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is one of multiple popular technical indicators created by J. Welles Wilder. Wilder introduced RSI in his book \u201cNew Concepts in Technical Trading Systems\u201d which was published in 1978. RSI measures the magnitude and velocity of directional price movements. The data is represented graphically by fluctuating between a value of 0 and 100. The indicator is computed by using the average losses and gains of a stock over a certain time period. RSI can be used to help spot overbought or oversold conditions. An RSI reading over 70 would be considered overbought, and a reading under 30 would indicate oversold conditions. A level of 50 would indicate neutral market momentum. The 14-day RSI is currently sitting at 85.37, the 7-day is at 84.71, and the 3-day is spotted at 81.59 for Coates International (COTE).

The demographics of my school make me ineligible for the 5 year teacher forgiveness loan.\nI currently have 52k in student loans at 7.5% interest.\nBecause of my teacher salary, my current qualifying payment is $0.

My studio setup is as follows:\n-Shure SM58\n-Shure SM57\n-Focusrite Scarlett 2i2\n-Yamaha HS5 Studio Monitors (Yes, I know they're entry level but I found it decent for starting out on studio recordings.)\nNow, as much as I'd love to mic up my amp for recordings, my living situation makes it impossible to crank up my Randall RM50 to saturate the tone for recording, so I am forced to go with cabinet IR's. As for cabinet IR's, I am using Rosen Digital IR's.\nMy guitar gear can be accessed in my Equipboard page in my signature below.\nThese are some options I've been considering as I'm on a budget (roughly CAD$800 if I have to get a loadbox, I am willing to order online but I won't take a gamble on used items):\nOPTION 1: EFX Send direct into Scarlett 2i2\nThis is what I've seen Colin Scott of CSGuitars do - go from EFX Send of an amp direct into the interface and then re-amp the track with cabinet IR's. In my situation I can split the signal from the Boss DD-20, with the primary signal going into the amp that's turned down for bedroom level monitoring, and the secondary signal going into my Scarlett 2i2 for the raw signal to be re-amped after recording.\nThis is a budget solution as I don't have to get a dedicated loadbox; however I am concerned that I might blow out the Scarlett's preamps with this recording method.\nOPTION 2: Two Notes Torpedo Captor\nWith this option, the tube amp still has a speaker load to rely onto, and I can attenuate the amp's sound through the Captor while the Captor itself does the job on sending the amp's raw signal into the Scarlett 2i2. This is a safer option as I don't have to worry about my RM50's Line level EFX Send signal potentially damaging my audio interface; however the Captor is limited to one speaker ohm only, meaning if I plan to buy any other tube amps in the near future, or if I have other guitarists/bassists coming in to track guitar or bass, then my options are limited in those places.\nSo what would you guys suggest? Is it safe for me to record direct from my amp's EFX Send into the Scarlett 2i2 or would it be best if I got the Two Notes Torpedo Captor?

They're basically the same and with all due respect to your nice home setup, unless you're in an audiophile environment with top of the range gear, the difference isn't noticeable. I would personally find a different mic to the Shure that will compliment it - maybe a Ribbon mic (A nice Ribbon and SM57 has been used on umpteen recordings).\nHaven't reamped with any IRs yet, only reamped directly into Live cabinets as it's easier than manually re recording cabs.

That way you would have a nice chunk to put towards a proper vocal mic (the 58 is a good choice for live but not so much for the studio). And as everyone said, the 57 and 58 are close enough so you could use the 57 for podcasts. I'd recommend looking at \"best condenser mics for under 100/200\" lists depending on budget and get yourself a solid large diaphragm condenser mic. That's just my two cents though.

Back when I had just finished school and starting to do my degree all I had was a soundblaster audigy and an SM58, and it's surprising how far you can take shitty gear when it's all you have available at home and you have to get stuff done.\nI'm a big fan of recording guitars with the SM7B and have not enjoyed working with 57s on guitar (they are a bit raspy sounding for my tastes) and so I think experimenting with stuff for yourself to find your preferences and doing the learning process yourself is really valuable. Always really worth having a decent condensor mic too, because it opens up a massively new array of sounds and flexibility for recording.. An SM57/58 pair is always nice to have but they really only give you a narrow range of opportunity for sounds.

That's why I like recording with a 7B, it's more fool proof and requires less post work and so it saves time getting it to sit nice in the mix. When it comes to speaker simulations for what you're looking for it's really all the work up front to get your sound/settings right and from then onwards it's easy smooth sailing, less work than mics because you don't have to worry so much about room acoustics and minor differences in mic position between sessions changing your sound slightly.\nIn my experience though the speaker emulations have always sounded a bit stiff, I experimented with it a bit when recording my 5150 and In the end I just went back to the pain in the ass of micing it up, though I've never found it easy to get the 5150 sounding where I want it on record. There are pros and cons to all the methods, you just gotta try everything and see what fits the bill for you.\nJust experiment with different stuff, I didn't know an amp could sound great when recorded at low volume until I spent some time working on it.

I'll see what I can do. I'll test the amp sound just by miking it up with an SM57, and if I don't like the results at low volumes then I'll consider using the Captor + Rosen Digital IR combination.

I'm not sure what the deal with them is. They don't have much bass and while there are mic positions that are certainly more \"vintage\", all of them have a lot of presence in the upper mids (the ones that don't sound like they're in a tunnel).\nRosen's Rectifier impulses are more typical, brighter than the Ownhammer demo pack though.

That way you can reamp the preamp, settings, cabinet etc with software and have your guitar signal through the RM50 you want?\nCheck out the recording capabilities of the Laney IRT-Studio - it splits the clean signal before the preamp and then again after the power amp. You can turn off the native speaker emulation as well which is one of few (only one I know of) that can do this so you can use whatever IR you want. There's also a Re-amp send.

I built it by myself, 300/400\u20ac and it works great, i use it to finish studio works and to record my own music project. have 2 friedman, PT20 and smallbox and even if crank the smallbox i can still record without disturbing people. And for who wrote that you don't need to crank a tube amp to get the best sound out of it.. it is true and it is souNOT, for clean stuff maybe volume at 2 or 3 is enough, when you need crunch or rock sound you can still record with the master at 3 but the amp start to sing at 6/7 = lots of volume.. i built my isobox for joke didn't think it could work but the result is great in term or quality and definition. It miss the natural reverb of a big recording room but i can add it in post production with the benefits that i can record guitar at home at any time. If you want i can make a couple of pics. there are a lot of tutorials on youtube.

So far, as far as I know from the YT tutorials I've watched, this is to get the cabinet resonance going.\nUnder most circumstances, you don't WANT to \"get the cabinet resonance going.\" Well-built cabinets are usually resonance-free, because resonance is nearly impossible to control. If you're miking a single speaker, little or no \"cabinet resonance\" is going to come through a close-miked speaker. Yet another case of YT tutorials making it up as they go.

All cabinets have a resonant frequency, as do speakers, and different boxes will change the resonant frequency of the speaker cabinet as a whole. That low resonance affects the mids and highs as well. Our ears are shaped to use phase to determine sound direction and location, and that same sense recognizes and appreciates cabinet resonance.

By Thuso Khumalo Since taking office last month, Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa has put economic revival at the center of his administration. He has gone a step further to state his resolve to re-engage the international community that had long been disengaged by former president Robert Mugabe\u2019s regime. The South African based Zimbabwean Business Forum says having a president with such passion for rebuilding the country\u2019s ailing economy is the best news Zimbabwe has heard in almost four decades. Executive chairman of the forum, Marshall Sankara, says they are already hard at work convincing Zimbabwean business people outside the country and foreign investors to grab the economic opportunities in Zimbabwe. Sankara, who is also a businessman, says the Forum is convinced Zimbabwe is open for business. \u201cWe are very interested and we are going to do some massive investment in Zimbabwe. We are very confident that this regime, under the leadership of Comrade Mnangagwa, is going to loosen investment policies, which were so choking off to investors,\" he said. Sankara's forum seeks to lure $100 million worth of investment by the end of 2018. But Senior Researcher Samukele Hadebe, of the Chris Hani Institute in Johannesburg, says investors will first want to see practical guarantees that Zimbabwe is now a safe investment destination. \u201cThe problem that we have always had was that of policy inconsistency, issues of corruption, personalization of public institutions, issues of fiscal discipline,\" Hadebe said. \"Those are practical things that cost no money, but that people would like to see very soon then we can realize a massive turnaround of the economy.\u201d Many believe ending cash shortages should top the government\u2019s priorities list.

On the day, Ella Pendlebury took second place in the u15 girls\u2019 race. \nThe seniors then took the stage at Marl Pits and Lindsey Brindle was third in the women's race and there were vet category wins for Tony Hesketh at V65 and John Parker at V75. \nWith these wins, Hesketh gained the series' first place and Parker series second place in their age categories. \nAlso in the series, David Milliken (V50) and Steve Williams (V60) both gained second places. \nThe Harriers also turned out in the Manchester Cross Country League. \nJanet Rashleigh was the only female representative but a great run got her the L55 first place. \nThe men maintained a push to keep top-flight status by finishing 13th of 52 teams. \nNick Leigh, in 15th, led the team home followed by Andy Lloyd and Andy Ford, who turned out again on Sunday in the Wadsworth half trog where the latter survived a nasty fall to take 13th place. \nAlso, for fell achievements, Freya Whittle was awarded a \u00a3100 prize by Horwich Rotary Club. \nFord was not the only Harrier to double up this week as Aleks Clayden achieved a personal best at Bolton parkrun as the first u15 home and then turned out at the Marl Pits cross country. \nNot satisfied with that, on Sunday, he took second place in the junior parkrun at Queens Park. \nMeanwhile, Rob Jackson hit the Northern Masters Christmas Trail at Leigh for the 10k in which he achieved joint first place. \nHe also sealed second place in the predicted time event, finishing just nine seconds off his predicted time. \nHarriers members have been fundraising again for a great cause and last week Alastair Murray ran from the Great Barn up Rivington Pike and down again 15 times to achieve a distance of 29.4 miles and a total ascent of 9,183 feet \u2013 a great piece of endurance running raising so far more than \u00a3650 for the Bolton Sunday Street Kitchen to help keep homeless people safe and warm over the cold winter months. \nIf anyone wishes to donate more to this cause go to http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/sunday-street-kitchen-bolton-helping-the-homeless. \nHis wife, Karen, provided nutritional support at the base camp and Murray was joined on his run by other club members on some of the climbs. \nHorwich RMI Harriers results: Kirkby Moor fell race (nr Barrow in Furness) \u2013 7th Dan Gilbert 57:05. \nMACCL XC (university playing fields) \u2013 (women) \u2013 37th Janet Rashleigh 29:46;
