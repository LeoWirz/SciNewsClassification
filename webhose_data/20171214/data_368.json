Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nOver the past few months, as a result of the Harvey Weinstein allegations, there has been an avalanche of accusations and allegations against a host of celebrities, ranging from dodgy texts through to very serious allegations of sexual assault and bullying. \nI believe, without question, that those people who are clearly convicted of serious allegations should have the book thrown at them. \nNo woman or man either for that matter, should ever go to work without being confident that any form of assault or bullying is not on the agenda. And if it ever is, they need to know it will be opposed by all in authority. \nIf these cases are to be taken seriously, there has to be full transparency as far as accused and accuser are concerned, and total fairness for all involved. \nWe must never forget the law states every citizen is innocent until proved guilty - and this quite clearly being ignored in virtually all of the allegations we\u2019ve heard so far. \nWe\u2019ve even seen a Tory MP, Damian Green, and by the way, I could think of a million reasons why he shouldn\u2019t be in his job, being hounded over alleged behaviour which isn\u2019t even illegal! \nTo have legal porn on your work computer, assuming he did, is no different than having a James Bond film. \nNeither are against the law but neither of them should be watched at taxpayers\u2019 expense. \nHowever, ex police officers aided by some media have blasted it in the public realm before an enquiry has even been completed. \nThen there\u2019s Aled Jones. \nI\u2019ve no feelings for him either way, other than he seems a bit of a wimp. \nJones is being forced to stand down from all his BBC duties, after an anonymous accuser, who apparently wasn\u2019t even a work colleague, claims he sent some sex text 10 yrs ago. \nOnce again \u2013 guilty until proved innocent. \nThen comes the sad case of Carl Sergeant, the Welsh Assembly member, who took his own life after being removed from office over claims against him. \nSergeant was suspended by the Labour party and his lawyer claims the party refused to tell him the full nature of the accusations. \nGuilty until proved innocent. \nWe should never lose track of the fundamental principle \u2013 every human being is entitled to be judged innocent until proved guilty. Not the other way around.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nI\u2019m delighted to say there are more and more dance schools opening up for young people. \nSome of them are total rip-offs and should be closed - but let\u2019s leave that side of the industry for another time. \nSo now let\u2019s be totally positive about the good ones. \nThese schools take children and teenagers of all shapes and sizes and it becomes a wonderful part of their lives for exercising, keeping them off the streets, making many new friends, putting structure into their lives and teaching them about competitiveness - plus it makes them feel that they belong. \nI\u2019m thrilled to say more and more boys are going into the dance world. \nThe taboos are being broken - \u201cyou must be gay if you dance\u201d - this is an unbelievable statement and from the stone age. \nWe see on the news regularly football and rugby teams taking up classes to learn the skill of dance, as they can transfer that onto the pitch to improve the game. \nTalking of the guys in the dance world, I recently interviewed Elliott Hanna for a reason, which I will tell you about shortly. \nThe first time I heard about him, he was nine years old and part of a dance double act called Tayluer and Elliott. \nThey were being filmed on Church Street, as they got through to the final top three of a national dance competition on Sky Television called Got To Dance. Many people rang my show and the whole of Liverpool got behind them. \nAs a dance double act on stage, they were superb, but as two young children they used to fight like cat and dog, but when the music struck up, the magic unfolded. \nTayluer the nice young lady, totally trusted Elliott on stage. He would do lifts and throw her everywhere, in the most beautiful choreographed pieces of dance, put together by their dance instructor, Nazene Danielle. \nI was so overwhelmed with what I saw, I went back to Kevin Wood, the boss of the panto that year on the Liverpool Empire. I suggested we use them in the ballroom scene in Cinderella. He loved the idea. \nSo in 2012, Coleen Nolan, Liz McClarnon and me topped the bill with these two amazing children performing just before Cinderella lost her glass slipper. \nThey wowed the audience every night. \nI asked Elliot did he enjoy it? \nHe said: \u201cIt was surreal. It was like a dream come true to work the Liverpool Empire, except for one thing, the ponies that took the magical coach on to take Cinders to the ball, most nights felt obliged to relieve themselves while we stood behind waiting to go on stage.\u201d \nI wanted to interview him after the panto, but couldn\u2019t talk publicly about what was about to happen with the next stage of his career. \nHis parents let me in on the secret and my lips were sealed. He\u2019d been picked to play Billy Elliot in the West End. \nAt nine years old he was the youngest to play Billy. It took a year of training before his first appearance. \nHe said it was amazing but hard work - it took blood, sweat and tears - lots of tears. \n\u201cWe were in London training and schooling and I was terribly homesick. When I went back at weekends to Liverpool, I didn\u2019t want to leave. My whole life was upside down. Looking back at the discipline for the chaperones, it was hard but necessary; and they did keep us safe, as there were a group of children for different parts in Billy Elliot. I missed my schoolmates and family very much. A year later I was ready for my first appearance. 15,000 people were in the audience. I realised after the standing ovation, that\u2019s what all the hard work was for. While I played Billy from nine until the age of 12, I was very sad when it came to an end.\u201d \nI asked Elliot if he had many injuries over the years? \nHe said: \u201cThey called me sicknote in Billy Elliot.\u201d \nI asked what happened after this amazing experience? \nHe told me: \u201cI went back to school. My good friends were still there for me, but there was a lot of jealousy.\u201d \nElliot went on to say that what saddens him most about the world of dance is lots of guys give up their dream, because of the gay taunts, which is so wrong. \n\u201cTo any guys out there, do it, go for it, be the best dancer in the world and follow your dreams. Don\u2019t let anyone stand in your way with the bigotry.\u201d \nSo, what\u2019s next for this young talented teenager? \nWell, at 14, he wants to move towards acting. When he reaches the age of 16, he wants to move to London, as all the castings and auditions are there.

Around 252km in diameter, the metallic \u201cM-class\u201d asteroid 16 Psyche is the target of NASA\u2019s next mission to the belt of giant rocks that encircles the inner solar system. And the space agency now plans to visit it much sooner than originally planned. \nNot only has the launch has been brought forward one year to the summer of 2022, but NASA\u2019s scientists have also found a way to get to Psyche (pronounced SYKe-ee) much faster by taking a more efficient trajectory. The new route means the Psyche spacecraft won\u2019t have to swing around the Earth to build up speed and won\u2019t pass as close to the sun, so it needs less heat protection. It is now due to arrive in 2026, four years earlier than the original timeline. \nThe main aim of the journey to Psyshe is to gather more information about our own solar system. Psyche is one of many wandering members of the asteroid belt. Unlike the rest of its rocky neighbours, Psyche appears to be entirely made of nickel and iron, just like the Earth\u2019s core. This, together with its size, has led to the theory that it might be the remains of the inside of a planet. \nAsteroids are made up of primitive materials , leftovers from the dust cloud from which our solar system originated. Different types of asteroids resemble the various steps it took to form planets from this dust cloud. This means they reveal a lot about the origin and evolution of our solar system . Scientists think Psyche could be what\u2019s left of an exposed metal core of a planet very similar to Earth. \nWe actually derive much of our knowledge about asteroids and the evolution of planets from the study of meteorites . Many asteroids and comets are primitive protoplanetary bodies accumulated from the same dust cloud our solar system originates from. As these protoplanetary bodies collide, gravity pulls them together into ever-larger bodies. Eventually these bodies become big and hot enough to partially melt, allowing heavy materials such as iron to sink to the core \u2013 and lighter material such as silicon to rise to the surface. \nThis process, known as differentiation , explains why Earth and other planets such as Mercury, Venus or Mars have an iron core and silicon-rich mantle and crust. The 16 Psyche asteroid is thought to be the leftover iron core of a planet stripped of its mantle in a giant collision. \nBut many questions regarding the formation of Psyche remain. How do you strip a planet of its mantle only leaving the core? Perhaps there is an alternative formation mechanism of an iron-rich body that does not involve differentiation? Psyche may once have been molten and, if so, did it cool from the inside out or from its surface to the core? \nAlso, Earth\u2019s magnetic field comes from a liquid outer core circling around a solid inner core. Did these processes occur on Psyche and create a magnetic field? What elements other than iron accumulate in a core? And how does the surface geology of an iron body look compared to a rocky or icy body? Avoiding Collisions \nThere are other reasons for visiting asteroids. For one thing, possible collisions with Earth can have devastating effects. The impact of a 15km-wide asteroid approximately 65m years ago is linked to the extinction of the dinosaurs . And the explosion of the 30m diameter Chelyabinsk asteroid over Russia in 2013 led to injuries and damage on the ground. We need to know as much as possible about the composition and physical make-up of asteroids to devise the best ways to defend our planet. \nAsteroids also provide resources. Those containing water or other valuable materials may act as stepping stones for human exploration of the solar system. And asteroids crossing Earth\u2019s orbit may become convenient targets for mining operations, providing materials that are running out on Earth and potentially taking environmentally detrimental extraction methods off Earth. Companies including Planetary Resources and countries like Luxembourg have already started to pursue these ideas in earnest. \nThe Psyche spacecraft will carry four instruments to gather as much information about the asteroid as it can: a camera, a gamma-ray spectrometer to record what chemical elements are there, a magnetometer, and a radio gravity experiment. The data these devices collect should help us work out if Psyche is the frozen core of a former planet or simply a lump of unmelted metal. If it is a core, then it might help us determine exactly what\u2019s at the centre of our own planet. \nLindy Elkins-Tanton, the lead scientist of the mission, probably summarised it best: \u201cWe learn about inner space by visiting outer space\u201d . \nChristian Schroeder is Senior Lecturer in Environmental Science and Planetary Exploration at University of Stirling. \nThis article was originally published in The Conversation .

Contributed Use this content by Kristen Booth \nARTISTS are encouraging young people in regional and rural areas to delve into their creative sides to battle mental health issues. \nAccording to the Queensland government, people who live and work in these areas can experience additional pressures such as social isolation and lack of employment opportunities. \nThese are all risks that can cause damaging effects on both parents and the children, including mental health issues and depression. \nSandy McLean is a full-time Central Queensland artist, based in Rockhampton, best known for her portraits of Australian people and animals, using bright and bold colour to bring her subjects alive and help tell the story. \nKnown as the Outback Artist, Ms McLean started the Art House in 2015 to encourage people to de-stress naturally and to be creative. \nThrough the Art House, and in partnership with the Black Dog Ball Committee, Ms McLean created a program for kids who had become disengaged, suffered anxiety, and just needed an outlet. \n\"Working with the Black Dog kids, I would encourage them to paint out their feelings and put it on the canvas,\u201d she said. \n\"The first few would be very dark and I would be trying to get them to lighten up. Once they use colour, their whole mood has changed. \nMs McLean said she started the program because there was nowhere that kids could go and just do art at their own pace. \n\"There is no pressure. I got them started and left them alone to have fun,\u201d she said. \n\"Art is so successful for kids with problems. They can just do what they like and it's just fun - if they want to paint something strange, they can. \n\"Kids were coming that were off the radar, they didn't like sport, they weren't good at it, it just wasn't their thing, but being creative was. \n\"A lot of kids who were autistic would just thrive.

may apply", "text": "Comments \nGermany\u2019s Max Planck Society of research institutes has launched a women-only program of tenure-track positions to improve its gender balance and stop rivals poaching its best female scientists. \nThe Lise Meitner excellence program, named after the pioneering early-20th-century physicist, is one of several women-only hiring initiatives that some observers believe are becoming more common while the proportion of women in top research positions remains stubbornly low. \nChristina Beck, a spokeswoman for Max Planck\u2019s network of 83 institutes, said that the program was being launched because \u201cthe competition for highly talented female scientists is increasing all over the world, while the pool of excellent women is not really growing.\u201d \n\u201cOther institutions successfully recruit the best of our female scientists at group leader level,\u201d she said. \nBacked by more than 30 million euros ($35.5 million), the society will create up to 10 five-year research group leader positions annually for the next four years. Unlike the network\u2019s previous women-only initiative to recruit group leaders, which ended in 2015, these positions will be on the tenure track, meaning that recipients get the chance to make their positions permanent at the end of the period. \nGrietje Molema, president of the Dutch Network of Women Professors and a professor at the University of Groningen, said that women-only programs were getting more common in Europe and called the move by Max Planck a \u201cgood step forward.\u201d \n\u201cAffirmative action\u201d was an \u201cessential part\u201d of tackling the underrepresentation of women in research, she said. \nIn 2003, Groningen started offering Rosalind Franklin Fellowships -- some of which have been co-funded by the European Union -- which grant female researchers placements of up to six years. Toward the end of the fellowship, fellows are assessed and, if successful, promoted to associate professor with tenure. After a further four to seven years, they are assessed again, with the chance to become full professors. \nThe Technical University of Delft also offers women-only fellowships at the assistant, associate or full professor level. \nBut women-only recruitment drives were not enough, Molema argued. \u201cThese programs are fantastic, but you have to fix the system,\u201d she said. \nOne problem was that mainly male senior academics tended to promote \u201ca copy\u201d of themselves to top positions, leaving women behind, she said. \nLouise Morley, director of the Center for Higher Education and Equity Research at the University of Sussex, acknowledged that \u201cany positive discrimination intervention is always controversial as critics argue that it is in opposition to merit. However, when any social group is so underrepresented, some focused actions are necessary.\u201d \nThe most recent statistics from the European Commission show that only small steps toward gender equality have been made on the higher rungs of the academic promotion ladder. Women represent 47 percent of Ph.D. graduates, but just 21 percent of academics at the highest level, according to She Figures 2015, with the proportion of female researchers dropping the higher the position. \nGermany has a below-average proportion of female researchers at the top level (17.3 percent), as do the Netherlands (16.2 percent) and Britain (17.5 percent). The best performers are Macedonia (66.7 percent), Malta (44.5 percent) and Croatia (38 percent). \nAt Max Planck, the proportion of female group leaders has risen from 21.6 percent in 2006 to 34.6 percent now, Beck said.

It is illegal under the 2014 Hunting Act. \nLevels of hare coursing increase significantly after harvest, when large areas of arable land are cleared. \nAnyone with information about hare coursing should call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Not sure I can vividly remember the difference given to us by Madam Gladys in our History of Art class but I will try. Interior Decor refers to arrangement of items in a space in order to make the outlook more appealing; while Interior Design is the art and science concerned with space planning, zoning according to functionality and creating an aesthetically pleasing space that suits the users while enhancing their productivity. Decor focuses primarily on aesthetics; Design focuses on functionality and then aesthetics which affect productivity.\nWhen you look up the definition of Interior Design online, it has the word decoration tied to it. The truth is that, the two job descriptions have some similarities but one isn\u2019t entirely the other. A designer can do decor, but a decorator can\u2019t design. Interior design is a systematic process.\nMany people use the terms \u201cinterior design\u201d and \u201cinterior decorating\u201d interchangeably, but these professions differ in critical ways. Interior design is the art and science of understanding people\u2019s behavior to create functional spaces within a building. Decoration is the furnishing or adorning of a space with fashionable or beautiful things*. In short, interior designers may decorate, but decorators do not design. Interior designers apply creative and technical solutions within a structure that are functional, attractive and beneficial to the occupants\u2019 quality of life and culture. Designs respond to and coordinate with the building shell and acknowledge the physical location and social context of the project. Designs must adhere to code and regulatory requirements and encourage the principles of environmental sustainability. The interior design process follows a systematic and coordinated methodology\u2014including research, analysis and integration of knowledge into the creative process\u2014to satisfy the needs and resources of the client.\nExcerpt from NCIDQ page \u201c Differences Between Interior Design & Decorating \u201c.\nCalifornia-based Interior Designer Caitlin Campbell \u2013 owner of Symmetry Designs \u2013 explains the difference this way:\n\u2026the biggest difference is that the interior designer typically has a number of other issues on his or her mind. For instance, when it comes to floor coverings, an interior decorator will probably be responsible for choosing the type, color, texture, and pattern. The interior designer, on the other hand, will make the selection based on those criteria, with an additional eye towards the appropriateness of type, usage, sound transference, acoustic properties, flammability, off-gassing properties, static electricity requirements and flammability.\nInterior Design Process \nYes, there is a process to follow when doing Interior Design; just like any other art, there is need for order. Time is spent in so much thought, we go to nature to seek inspiration, we watch people do what they do, we literally get into a zone just to come up with a concept. This works for some people; for others, the last minute adrenaline rush is the best inspiration, ha ha!\nThe stages of the process will differ from designer to designer. Take a trip through company websites and you will see how they have all outlined \u2018their\u2019 interior design process. The number of stages is between five to eight again depending on the breakdown; the content is however the same. My favorite of the stages is concept/design development, so much fun to conceive ideas and bring them to life.\n1. Client Consultation During the programming phase the client\u2019s needs and objectives are identified. Questions regarding the specific function(s) of the space, who will be using the space and furniture and equipment requirements will be discussed. Measurements and photos are also taken at this time.\n2. Schematic Design In the schematic design phase, space planning and furniture layouts are developed. Circulation patterns and minimum clearances are considered and applied to the floor plan. Rough sketches and elevations are created, preliminary furniture and finish ideas are developed and then presented to the client for review and revision.\n3. Design Development After final approval of the schematic design, the designer develops floor plans, elevations and other related items in greater detail. Colors and finishes are refined, furniture, fabrics and equipment are selected and cost estimates are prepared. The resulting design is presented to the client for review, revision and final approval.\n4. Construction Documentation In the first phase, the specific details of the work to be completed are documented.

If you are really concerned about it, do a Blackstone Oil Analysis. Good advice!! You will be surprised what a valid oil analysis can tell you about the internal condition of an engine. The buildup on newer motors is primarily due to inferior fuel quality and under loading (lugging) of the engine. Especially on the tiptronic cars. I personally manually shift my Tip (paddles) on my 2013 A4 2.0T for this very reason.

In September, the A\u2019s announced that they wanted to build the new, 35,000-seat stadium on a district-owned 15-acre property near Oakland\u2019s Laney College, which is one of Peralta\u2019s four two-year institutions. \nThe Athletics\u2019 plan promised to address displacement of residents and small businesses and to create new affordable housing and well-paying jobs. The team also proposed opportunities for partnerships on mixed-use developments that would help generate revenue for the district. \nBut faculty groups, students and community organizations have been vehemently opposed to the proposal. \n\u201cWe\u2019re all really excited,\u201d said Jennifer Shanoski, president of the Peralta Federation of Teachers and a chemistry instructor at Merritt College. \u201cEspecially in these times when people feel so powerless with everything happening to us all the time. Here\u2019s an instance where good old-fashioned organizing and grassroots organization worked.\u201d \nIn a team statement released Wednesday, the A\u2019s said they were \u201cshocked\u201d by the board\u2019s decision not to move forward. A's STATEMENT: We are shocked by Peralta\u2019s decision to not move forward. All we wanted to do was enter into a conversation about how to make this work for all of Oakland, Laney, & the Peralta Community College District. We are disappointed that we will not have that opportunity. \u2014 Oakland Athletics (@Athletics) December 6, 2017 \nThe news also caught Oakland leaders by surprise. Oakland remains fiercely determined to keep the @Athletics in Oakland. It is unfortunate the discussion w/ Peralta ended so abruptly, yet we're committed, more than ever, to working with the A\u2019s and our community to find the right spot in OAK for a privately-financed ballpark. \u2014 Libby Schaaf (@LibbySchaaf) December 6, 2017 \nJowel Laguerre, the district\u2019s chancellor, said the board didn\u2019t make its decision specifically because of opposition from the campus groups, but because they want to focus on assessing the needs of the college and seeing what other partnerships are available. \n\u201cThe district will build on its shared governance model to reimagine the district\u2019s needs and the resources to meet them. We will develop a robust and inclusive internal engagement process to assess our needs and partnerships aligned with our mission. The Board of Trustees will continue due diligence in determining the costs and benefits of potential development,\u201d the board\u2019s statement said. \nIn an interview with Inside Higher Ed , Laguerre pointed out that Peralta has challenges with its infrastructure and wants to focus on better addressing the housing and food-insecurity needs of its students. \n\u201cThe board is really focused on the long-term future of the district and not necessarily the opposition that came up for something that was not well detailed,\u201d Laguerre said. \nA lack of details helped keep faculty and students from supporting a ballpark on college property. \nThe A\u2019s \u201capproached the district and administration well, but there was not a lot of transparency and openness with faculty, staff and students,\u201d Shanoski said. \u201cThey tried to do these sort of listening tours, but there was never any information being provided.\u201d \nLaguerre said there wasn\u2019t anything for people to be against because the proposal wasn\u2019t a project yet, just a concept. \n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to say yes or easy to say no but more difficult to say, \u2018Let\u2019s think about this and how can this happen,\u2019\u201d Laguerre said. \u201cEven though we\u2019re not using the Oakland A\u2019s project to ask those questions, that\u2019s what we\u2019re asking. How can we use the resources we have and what kind of partnerships can we develop?\u201d \nFor the different groups on campus, the A\u2019s couldn\u2019t sufficiently address concerns around the potential impacts of a new ballpark on the college and surrounding area. \nCommunity and faculty groups raised concerns on issues ranging from the effect of construction and game noise on classes to displaced housing and gentrification in the neighborhoods surrounding the college. \n\u201cWe didn\u2019t make a knee-jerk reaction,\u201d said Donald Moore, president of the Laney Faculty Senate and an anthropology professor. \u201cPart of it was listening to the Oakland A\u2019s and getting a bunch of supportive comments and no meat behind it. No substance.\u201d \nMoore said whenever anyone raised concerns about traffic or displaced businesses, the team would make reassuring statements about mitigating any problems the ballpark would bring, but they did not provide details or research to explain how they would solve those problems. \nLaguerre said some of the issues faculty raised, like noise concerns, could have been addressed once the proposal was farther along in planning. But the experience of receiving an offer has helped the college learn how to deal with development and partnership proposals, he said. \nMeanwhile, many people around Oakland are eager to keep the team in the city, especially after the Oakland Raiders received approval from the National Football League to move to Las Vegas in 2019. Prior to selecting the college\u2019s land, the A\u2019s considered a waterfront site or a new stadium near their current home at the Oakland Coliseum. \nMoore said with the Raiders leaving for Las Vegas and the Golden State Warriors abandoning nearby Oracle Arena for San Francisco, the A\u2019s could have the Coliseum to themselves to redevelop and improve that neighborhood. \n\u201cWe want to keep the A\u2019s in Oakland, as well,\u201d Laguerre said. \u201cI believe in and stated we need to do everything we can to keep the Oakland Athletics in Oakland, but it\u2019s not just Peralta\u2019s job to do that.

There\u2019s a window in front of me; it\u2019s still light outside, even though the dusk is as gray as the afternoon was. We\u2019ve had a few cloudy days in a row here, with rain falling off and on. \nIt\u2019s been a quiet day. I\u2019ve done some laundry, helped Kailey take care of her birthday-guinea-pig (our first actual needs-to-exercise and have-attention pet), read quite a bit. I\u2019ve been reading through the book of John again. I come back to John again and again; I love to hear Jesus\u2019 voice in this gospel. When my heart feels a little shadowed, it\u2019s His words that leave no room for darkness. \nSo when I read John 7:46 today, I had to laugh at what is maybe the understatement of all time. The Pharisees were trying to get local officers to detain Jesus and they wouldn\u2019t do it. \u201cNo man ever spoke like this Man,\u201d they said. \nThey couldn\u2019t know how deeply true this was, how wholly right they were. \nNo man ever spoke like this Man , for there had never been a man like Him. Jesus was a son of man, yes, but also the Son of God. Before the creation of the world, He was there. Through Him, it was all made. Through Him, we were made. \nAnd He spoke the heart of His Father into the world, into us. He spoke forgiveness. Healing. Peace. Freedom. Love. His words were power. His words were glory. His words changed everything. \nAnd on this regular day that\u2019s turning quickly into night, this quiet Thursday, or whatever sort of day it might be while you\u2019re reading these words\u2026 He is still speaking to me and to you. \nMaybe now is the time to slow down, to ask Him what He\u2019s saying, to listen for His voice. If you need kindness, if you need Truth, if you need grace\u2026 if you need love that doesn\u2019t falter and hope that doesn\u2019t fail ~ His voice is like no other voice. His words are like no other words.

They are proud to exhibit their latest innovative, new generation Rockfon Mono Acoustic elegant render, on Stand 78 at the 2018 Architect@Work show, London in January. Unlike traditional monolithic, flat surfaces, Rockfon Mono Acoustic controls reverberation by offering outstanding Class A sound absorption, thanks to its stone wool core. This is one of the reasons it is a preferred solution for leading architects as a contemporary, high performance, versatile alternative to traditional gypsum and plaster. The addition of marble powder helps create the smoother, whiter, more refined acoustic surface that will enhance any interior. Rockfon Mono Acoustic offers true versatility. It can be installed on sloping, flat or curved surfaces, either in a suspension grid or mounted directly on existing ceilings or walls. Its timeless, monolithic look is suitable for renovation projects as it complements the character and original architecture of historical buildings. For new builds, it can be installed in smaller rooms or large atriums as seamless spans, ceiling islands and walls. Multi-award winning The Word in North Shields architect FaulknerBrowns Senior Director Steve Dickson explains why Rockfon Mono Acoustic was specified: \u201cIt really was a natural progression for us as we\u2019d used the product successfully in a previous project. We wanted a monolithic product that is also Class A rated acoustically, so it was perfect.\u201d The monolithic surface is extremely bright, offering 99 per cent light diffusion and 87 per cent light reflection. This ensures a uniform spread of natural light, reducing the need for artificial light, cutting energy costs. It can also be specified in any colour, offering true creative freedom. In the Boathouse function room at world-class sporting and events venue Dorney Lake, S&Y Architects specified Rockfon Mono Acoustic to create a unique \u2018wave\u2019 ceiling design. \u201cThis was an unusual ceiling design and required a clever solution. Not only could Rockfon Mono Acoustic create this unique look, it also offered the acoustic control necessary for a large reverberant space. The finished look is perfect for the building and its setting.\u201d The system allows for easy incorporation of light wells, lighting, air conditioning, ventilation systems and inspection hatches, and offers Class A2 fire protection. The tiles are dimensionally stable at up to 100% relative humidity and can be installed in temperatures ranging from 0\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C, allowing installation before windows are fully sealed. Rockfon provides technical support and training courses for certified installers to ensure a high-quality finish and performance. All Rockfon products are backed with a 15-year guarantee and are fully recyclable. The Rockfon team have unrivalled expertise and knowledge when it comes to finding the perfect acoustic and aesthetic solutions for any interior design. They look forward to meeting you on Stand 78 at the Architect at Work Show to discuss how they can help turn your design into a reality.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rockfon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rockfon mono acoustic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve dickson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rockfon mono acoustic", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorney lake", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:18.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6b6849dee1f5baac38038892b5dd613e4145d611", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p10yln1njePV6Tg3aatwdBwoqSEnqqx4Y", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/m/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/m/ - Mecha - 4chan", "title": "/exvs/ - Gundam Versus and EXVS General", "title_full": "/m/ - /exvs/ - Gundam Versus and EXVS General - Mecha - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-06T18:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 20, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3577954d73e6be4818f27fa9ed852ef1b24a4b6f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p10yln1njePV6Tg3aatwdB.p6uE07yvwJH_irIBxEZxQ-", "ord_in_thread": 14, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T07:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>16078741\ncheck rewards which are available for you, there must be Free (0 point) purchase which looks like a theme but actually code for theme and 3 DLC\nsorry was awhile may remember some things incorrectly, but there is certanly should be reward you can \"purchase\" for zero point related to Gundam Versus, it should be one code, maybe it says there or in PSN that it is a theme but it got all 3 DLC suits too", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:18.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2f2fedd43d9fcaf31cc41587794c7839c6df9c98", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.uMj_Qa.Vf.R4myIJSuYjIuiQzIW_ikUv20R5t3kiFiJ2kSdcvNut8T_iqiBK99hYyNX4tCjB1sN_XkCXkIArXVcljpFGdIN6X8wxWzU82DQJIg65o2SmRsWfSPDJ66Jtzb9Iq4j8Dh8QhhlqAvhlZ4WnIVP4n3.Q-", "site_full": "www.netmagmedia.co.uk", "site": "netmagmedia.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.netmagmedia.co.uk/feed", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "architects"], "section_title": "netMAGmedia Ltd", "title": "Investec goes into bat with Westbourne Capital Partners on Lord\u2019s scheme, with \u00a346mn facility", "title_full": "Investec goes into bat with Westbourne Capital Partners on Lord\u2019s scheme, with \u00a346mn facility", "published": "2017-12-07T11:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2f2fedd43d9fcaf31cc41587794c7839c6df9c98", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.uMj_Qa.Vf.R4myIJSuYjIuiQzIW_ikUv20R5t3kiFiJ2kSdcvNut8T_iqiBK99hYyNX4tCjB1sN_XkCXkIArXVcljpFGdIN6X8wxWzU82DQJIg65o2SmRsWfSPDJ66Jtzb9Iq4j8Dh8QhhlqAvhlZ4WnIVP4n3.Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Shelley Collyer", "published": "2017-12-07T11:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "Investec goes into bat with Westbourne Capital Partners on Lord\u2019s scheme, with \u00a346mn facility", "text": "Thursday, 7th December 2017 Investec goes into bat with Westbourne Capital Partners on Lord\u2019s scheme, with \u00a346mn facility Investec Structured Property Finance (\u201cInvestec\u201d) announces it has agreed to provide a \u00a346 million financing facility to Westbourne Capital Partners (\u201cWCP\u201d), a leading developer of high-quality residential homes in London, for the acquisition of a prominent 2-acre site in St John\u2019s Wood, North London. The finance package will support WCP through acquisition and planning, as it explores a number of options to vary the existing planning permission for 128 residential units, in this prime London neighborhood. There are a number of options for the land including the delivery of a luxury retirement scheme, delivery of student housing, or working in partnership with local hospitals to provide either much needed office space, or a step-down facility, which allows patients to leave hospital but still receive full time medical care. The development occupies one of London\u2019s most sought after sites, on the border of Regent\u2019s Park and adjacent to the world-famous Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground. Additionally, the Wellington Hospital Platinum Care Unit is less than 500 metres away. It benefits from excellent transport links with the West End easily reached by road and tube. Simon Brooks at Investec Structured Property Finance commented: \u201cDespite wider market uncertainty, we continue to be proactive in supporting our clients where they see opportunities. By leveraging our long-standing relationships, moving quickly and being innovative, we are able to offer clients both certainty and commerciality.\u201d \u201cThe opportunity to collaborate once again with Westbourne Capital Partners on this transaction complements this approach and we look forward to working with them to take the scheme forward through the planning process next year and delivering London another exciting development.\u201d Johnny Sandelson, Partner at Wellesbourne Capital Partners, added: \u201cWe are pleased to be acquiring a site which offers huge potential for a number of different land uses and which we are confident of being able to extract considerable value.

The new Sentinel Eliminator Vortex300 Filter has not only been independently verified to collect more magnetic debris on continuous pass than any other compact filter on the market , but is also the company\u2019s most compact, robust, and easy to install and service filter to date. What\u2019s more, the Eliminator Vortex300 filter eliminates all of the major problems installers face with most other brand filters, such as leaks and difficult handling, instead answering the call for a powerful magnetic filter with exceptional build quality, leak-free design, and compact size. Standing just 202mm tall and 70mm wide, the Eliminator Vortex300 Filter has a remarkably slim profile and short distance from pipework. Its petite size, along with in-line installation and 360 o rotating T-piece, make the Eliminator Vortex300 filter incredibly quick and easy to fit, saving installers time on the job. Servicing is just as simple, with installers having the flexibility to either flush the unit when time is short, or wipe it clean after showing collected debris to the homeowner. Once fitted, installers and homeowners can rest easy thanks to the filter\u2019s robust construction, which is engineered and tested to meet Sentinel\u2019s exacting quality standards. For example, the Eliminator Vortex300 filter boasts a pioneering leak-free design and lifetime dual seals which are pressure-tested on every single unit. So confident is Sentinel in the reliability of the Eliminator Vortex300 filter that it comes with a 10-year warranty as standard. The filter\u2019s formidable performance is thanks to its one-of-a-kind Vortex Core and powerful neodymium magnet assembly, which enable the Eliminator Vortex300 to outperform all competitor compact filters with regard to continuous magnetic collection. Inside, circulating water flows around a special axis to reduce water flow rate and turbulence, features which improve magnet separation, increases retention, and enables non-magnetic debris to fall out of flow. In addition, should the filter become full it cannot block and will not affect system operation. Daniel Cheung, UK Trade Marketing Manager for Sentinel explains, \u201cThe Eliminator Vortex filter takes all of the features installers loved about our previous generation filters, and combines them with powerful magnetic filtration and our unique Vortex Core. The filter is based on extensive research with installers, who reported leaks and installation and servicing space to be the biggest issues they face with other brand filters.

Norbord\u2019s CaberBoard flooring range is the UK\u2019s best-selling chipboard flooring product, its handy dimensions allowing ease of handling and its robust tongue-and-groove edging ensuring a secure and even surface. Today things are moving on. As the housing market continues to grow strongly, tradesmen are obliged to look for methods of completing projects faster and more efficiently. Consequently, more of them are looking beyond the standard CaberFloor P5 panel and choosing Norbord\u2019s advanced CaberDek and CaberShieldPlus products. Both CaberDek and CaberShieldPlus use the same P5 moisture-resistant particleboard but also feature further added benefits meaning the floor can be laid even before the roof is installed. CaberDek has a non-slip protective film to prevent damage to the board from following wet trades \u2013 such as plastering and painting. The film takes all the dirt and damage away with it, leaving a pristine floor surface ready to accept carpet or other finish. CaberShieldPlus has a tough, waterproof coating permanently bonded to both top and bottom surfaces of the board giving the builder confidence that CaberShieldPlus will stand up to most heard wearing jobs during the costruction phase. When CaberDek or CaberShieldPlus is installed with Norbord\u2019s CaberFix range of adhesives \u2013 Joint&Joist , T&G PVA , D4 or Pro Kit \u2013 a CaberBoard floor will produce a high quality, long-lasting, squeak-free chipboard floor \u2013 and in double-quick time. CaberShieldPlus, flooring that keeps you building even with the roof off New from Norbord, CaberShieldPlus is the ideal flooring solution when building in Britain\u2019s unpredictable climate. Based on Norbord\u2019s popular moisture-resistant CaberFloor P5 tongue-and-groove particleboard flooring panel, CaberShieldPlus is specially designed to withstand exposure to wet conditions. Yet, unlike Norbord\u2019s other protected flooring product CaberDek, which features a peel-able film on the top surface, CaberShieldPlus has protection on both sides, not just the exposed upper surface. The top surface features a permanent non-slip coating that not only prevents damage to the board but also ensures a safe working platform. The underside is protected with the smooth coating that not only protects against damage but also makes the board easy to slide into position. For added durability, the coating applied to CaberShieldPlus is not designed to be peeled off after completion but is bonded permanently on both sides of the panel and waterproof. With CaberShieldPlus, fast-track build programmes won\u2019t be derailed by rain, sleet or snow. BBA-approved for up to 42 days\u2019 continuous exposure to the elements when used with CaberFix D4 adhesive, the new board lets builders carry on building even with the roof off. The easy-to-handle 2,400mm x 600mm tongue-and-grooved panels are available in 18mm and 22mm thicknesses and are colour-coded to make it easy to identify the top surface. Ideal for domestic new-build and refurbishment projects, as well as many commercial applications, CaberShieldPlus is delivered in packs of 80 (18mm gauge) or 66 (22mm). CaberDek flooring leads the pack While most new houses have concrete ground floor slabs, the vast majority of developers opt for timber suspended floors for first and second-storey levels; and the majority choose Norbord\u2019s CaberDek. CaberDek is one of Norbord\u2019s flagship quality flooring products.It is made from the same moisture-resistant particleboard as the standard Caberfloor P5 but has a protective non-slip film applied to its upper surface. In most new-build projects, the upper floors of a house will be installed before the roof goes on with the inevitable result that the new floor is left open to the elements for days or even weeks. CaberDek\u2019s protective film prevents rain and frost damage to the new floor surface as well as providing a safe non-slip working surface for the construction team. CaberDek can be left exposed like this for up to 42 days without risk of damage. Even after the building is weather-tight, the floor surface remains protected from following trades such as plastering and painting. When work has finished, the protective film is simply peeled off to reveal a pristine floor ready for covering. CaberDek comes in easy-to-handle 2400mm x 600mm panels produced in thicknesses of 18mm and 22mm. Suitable for fixing to traditional sawn timber or engineered-timber joists, including metal-web joists, it can be fixed with nails, screws or, for the best results, with Norbord\u2019s own specially-formulated adhesives. Many builders now employ the CaberFix Pro Kit, a powerful sealing and fixing system for installing CaberDek flooring. This system consists of CaberFix T&G adhesive, CaberFix Joint&Joist adhesive and CaberFix Tape . CaberFix T&G is specially formulated to produce strong bonds between adjacent panels along the tongue-and-groove joint. CaberFix Joint&Joist is a high-strength polymer adhesive which remains flexible after curing and is designed to fix a CaberDek floor to the supporting joists. Replacing mechanical fixings, CaberFix Joint&Joist speeds up installation and produces a floor which is guaranteed free of squeaks and creaks. Its flexibility also contributes to noise attenuation, thus aiding in the floor\u2019s conformity with Part E of the Building Regulations governing the passage of noise. CaberFix Tape seals the joints to prevent moisture degrading the T&G adhesives. For floors which are likely to be exposed to the elements during freezing conditions, Norbord\u2019s special CaberFix X-Treme tape is recommended. CaberBoard launches particleboard campaign Norbord is stepping up its particleboard promotional effort with a new campaign to publicise its high-performance CaberBoard flooring range. Magazine adverts, point-of-sale displays, leaflets, mailers, a new website page and viral ads combine to spread the word about Norbord\u2019s market-leading flooring panels. Featuring the, now-familiar, family of dogs that have been appearing regularly in Norbord publicity, the campaign is aimed at housebuilders and the merchant trade with a focus on the three core products of CaberFloor P5, CaberDek and CaberShieldPlus. CaberFloor P5 is the UK\u2019s leading brand of moisture resistant particleboard flooring and is widely used in both new-build and refurbishment projects. CaberDek is Norbord\u2019s most specified weather-protected flooring panel, featuring a peelable non-slip protective film to prevent soiling and water damage until following trades are finished, when the film is simply peeled off to reveal a clean floor surface. For maximum weatherproofing during the construction process, CaberShieldPlus is the one to beat. With a permanently-bonded protective coating on both top and bottom surfaces to prevent moisture ingress, CaberShieldPlus will keep the building going even with the roof off. The eye-catching publicity material also promotes CaberFix D4, the specially-formulated adhesive that uses fewer mechanical fixings to deliver a solid, non-squeaking floor structure. In all cases, the emphasis is on the CaberBoard range\u2019s reputation for durability, moisture resistance and ease of use. And just like the loyal canine friends featured in the adverts and flyers, Norbord\u2019s particleboard range is one you can trust. Norbord\u2019s new chipboard flooring guide does all the work A simple guide to choosing the most suitable flooring products from Norbord\u2019s impressive portfolio has been developed for use by merchants and installers alike. The guide has been designed as a tear-off sheet on point-of-sale material on racking in merchant and timber yards; to be included in the company\u2019s flooring collateral including brochures; and as a downloadable link on Norbord\u2019s website \u2013 www.norbord.co.uk . The three panel options \u2013 CaberFloor P5, CaberDek and CaberShieldPlus \u2013 are detailed and advice given dependent on whether or not the floor needs to be protected against the elements (CaberDek), or needs a protective coating (CaberShieldPlus). Once the flooring panel has been selected, advice on fixing and installation is next. For silent floors and minimal mechanical fixings, there is a choice of CaberFix T&G PVA for T&G joints or Caberfix D4. In addition, guidance for the use of the CaberFix ProKit, with or without the CaberFix X-Treme tape, steers the specifier in the right direction.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "norbord", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cabershieldplus", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "norbord", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "t&g", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caberfix joint&joist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "t&g pva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caberfix t&g", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "norbord", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:19.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "19cd685a0ab074f6b98d05c60b46ccbbcb04a83a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.uMj_Qa.Vf.R4myIJSuYjIuiQzIW_ikUs9GIJltQD.w9H12OjXa2XWSzqZ90GGztECSs9kUypKmg--", "site_full": "www.netmagmedia.co.uk", "site": "netmagmedia.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.netmagmedia.co.uk/feed", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "architects"], "section_title": "netMAGmedia Ltd", "title": "The rise of smart buildings", "title_full": "The rise of smart buildings", "published": "2017-12-07T10:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "19cd685a0ab074f6b98d05c60b46ccbbcb04a83a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.uMj_Qa.Vf.R4myIJSuYjIuiQzIW_ikUs9GIJltQD.w9H12OjXa2XWSzqZ90GGztECSs9kUypKmg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sue Benson", "published": "2017-12-07T10:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "The rise of smart buildings", "text": "Thursday, 7th December 2017 The rise of smart buildings \nKeith Carey of Salto Systems takes a look at the trends having a significant impact on access control, and how they are putting smart systems at the heart of how buildings will be operated in the future. \nThere is a lot of talk in the industry right now about the rise of \u2018smart buildings\u2019, but products that deliver buildings that are smart to own, operate and manage are already available. \nAn access control system is sometimes seen as a small part of the overall building but in fact it is absolutely central to how the owner will operate that building. It needs to work with other integrated sub systems including CCTV, alarms and fire to provide effective and time-saving management of all online, offline and wireless systems including access points and applications via, where possible, one software package. \nThe key for the architect and their client is to select an access control solution that balances security with accessibility, and advanced technology with affordability. By embedding high performance electronic access control into their building infrastructure, architects can ensure the building owner or operator can protect their people, assets and building while providing world-class facilities. It\u2019s about realising tomorrow\u2019s keyless buildings today with innovative thinking and advanced technology. \nCloud technology \nCloud technology is steadily growing in the access control market, but what are the benefits of using it? The success of the cloud is growing fast, and this has given rise to new perspectives in the industry. Many commercial clients are recognising the advantages that cloud solutions can offer especially when you incorporate the right security measurements. We saw its potential early and were among the first manufacturers to bring an advanced cloud-based electronic locking solution to the access control market. \nThe versatility cloud access control can bring to a client \u2013 particularly small offices, retailers and the serviced apartment industry \u2013 is considerable. It provides functionality and performance with a flexible management system that requires no software installation and negates the need for complex IT infrastructure. All you need is an online device with an internet connection to make access control a simple and secure solution for clients to manage keys, users and doors across multiple locations \u2013 enabling full control of who can access what, when and where at all times. \nMobile technology \nFrom an access control point of view mobile means you can send a key electronically to a smartphone. This replaces the need to carry a fob or smart card. One of the fastest growing users of this is the hotel industry where a guest makes their booking online and receives their key \u2013 via secure encrypted technology \u2013 on their phone. The app on the phone and the key sent to that app gives them access to all the doors they will need to use while on-site and at the end of their stay the key deletes off their phone automatically. \nIs there a future for access control in the Internet of Things? \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is undoubtedly an exciting opportunity for all access control companies, allowing devices to be usefully connected like never before. Today, our world is generally becoming \nincreasingly connected. The importance of access control in IoT will grow as IoT devices become more widespread and building systems become smarter and more connected. \nThe proliferation of devices which can be and are connected to the internet \u2013 building security, cameras, heating systems and doorviewers \u2013 will continue to grow, changing the way we live, work and play, and driving the increased adoption of smart connected access control solutions in the years to come. \nAccess control\u2019s role in the rise of the smart home \nOver time electronic locks will rise in popularity. We have seen this happen in commercial markets in the last decade, and now focus is moving to the residential market. \nMobile technology is key in the smart home and IoT connectivity will help companies to rapidly drive forward into this market. \nKeith Carey is marketing manager at Salto Systems", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "keith carey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "salto systems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cctv", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:19.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5aaf568b074595c38b74ce08ef77e66499e2f4ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.uMj_Qa.Vf.R4myIJSuYjIuiQzIW_ikUvqWc2uagcRpOHjVr4Ribxba0zoo_blmWYsORmUUkBuDtf3Is.36EQEdp34zgJB9hFLr9nj638_Yw--", "site_full": "www.netmagmedia.co.uk", "site": "netmagmedia.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.netmagmedia.co.uk/feed", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "architects"], "section_title": "netMAGmedia Ltd", "title": "Innovative heating transforms Sussex Development", "title_full": "Innovative heating transforms Sussex Development", "published": "2017-12-07T10:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5aaf568b074595c38b74ce08ef77e66499e2f4ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.uMj_Qa.Vf.R4myIJSuYjIuiQzIW_ikUvqWc2uagcRpOHjVr4Ribxba0zoo_blmWYsORmUUkBuDtf3Is.36EQEdp34zgJB9hFLr9nj638_Yw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Shelley Collyer", "published": "2017-12-07T10:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "Innovative heating transforms Sussex Development", "text": "Thursday, 7th December 2017 Innovative heating transforms Sussex Development Housing developer, Sandrock, was keen to make its West Sussex development more energy efficient. It enlisted the help of The Gas Saving Company to design a new Home energy centre, including Alpha Heating Innovation\u2019s FlowSmart, to provide a high performing and energy saving heating and hot water system. Chris Farrell, inventor of GasSaver and owner of The Gas Saving Company, is an expert when it comes to energy efficiency. He saves his customers money by assessing their current designs and then reworking them. In the case of Sandrock, it opted to replace its traditional boiler system with The Gas Saving Company\u2019s patented Home energy centre in its West Sussex development of two, four-bedroom timber framed homes. This meant they were able to remove over \u00a36,500 of unnecessary solar PV, which also freed up over 2m3 of internal space by removing the need for large hot water cylinders. Alpha\u2019s Flowsmart offers the energy efficient benefits usually associated with a combi boiler while maintaining a high performance capability, making it a perfect component of the Home energy centre. FlowSmart works by sending cold mains water to the GasSaver, which is pre-heated using reclaimed flue gases, before diverting it to the copper coil heat exchanger in the thermal store. This is then further heated by the surrounding hot water from the primary system, before a blending valve brings the water down to an optimum temperature of 30\u00baC before it enters the boiler. This mechanism allows the boiler to satisfy heavy water demand for a sustained period of time, without any detrimental impact on the flow rate. Chris Farrell commented, \u201cOur Home energy centre has a modular design suitable for all sizes of homes, including underfloor heating, and multi-bathroom properties requiring pumped hot-water circuits.\u201d \n\u201cOne of the benefits of the Home energy centre is that for new build developments it provides the highest SAP rating, so I needed a boiler that could work seamlessly with the system and Alpha\u2019s FlowSmart offers that capability.\u201d Adam Barker, Managing Director at Sandrock, said, \u201cWe were already familiar with the impressive SAP ratings a system like this could offer because we used a similar set up at our Balls Yard residential development in Crawley. However, the Alpha FlowSmart and Home energy centre provided above and beyond our expectations. The SAP report showed we were under the required Target Emission Rate, which was a great achievement.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gassaver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sandrock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam barker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris farrell", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sussex development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sussex development housing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the gas saving company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gas saving company", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "balls yard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crawley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west sussex", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:19.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a16e688fe376478b8aa1ee30ceb0668d997af0d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQOY2Vu62HdS2fx3k67ipt6upNUj_7ZtN4DD0LAm4RiyaxhnjOHVCeRZ6r1ndA4gdsLUs1e4vWYa0E8kSXSdkOvAczjVer05J8-", "site_full": "article.wn.com", "site": "wn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.wn.com/English/keyword/africa", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WN.com - Africa News", "title": "POLITICO UNVEILS 2018 \u2018POLITICO 28\u2019", "title_full": "POLITICO UNVEILS 2018 \u2018POLITICO 28\u2019", "published": "2017-12-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5594, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a16e688fe376478b8aa1ee30ceb0668d997af0d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQOY2Vu62HdS2fx3k67ipt6upNUj_7ZtN4DD0LAm4RiyaxhnjOHVCeRZ6r1ndA4gdsLUs1e4vWYa0E8kSXSdkOvAczjVer05J8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "POLITICO UNVEILS 2018 \u2018POLITICO 28\u2019", "text": "POLITICO UNVEILS 2018 \u2018POLITICO 28\u2019 Posted , 2017-12-07 Email this page POLITICO 's European edition, a joint venture between POLITICO and Axel Springer , unveiled today the POLITICO 28 Class of 2018: the list of doers, disrupters and dreamers who will transform European life, politics and ideas in some way in the upcoming year.

The company has purchased a SBZ 122 3-axis CNC from global machining experts elumatec. The SBZ is one of the most popular and respected aluminium profile machining lines in the world, internationally renowned for its efficiency, reliability and outstanding overall performance. The acquisition comes as York-based Solinear put plans in place for a major expansion over the next few years. Design Manager Jack Dwyer comments, \u201cI\u2019m delighted to be able to say that Solinear is recognised as a leader in its field. We design innovative, environmentally-conscious louvre and solar shading systems that lead the market in function, aesthetics and quality.\u201d \u201cBut we want to significantly increase our turnover in the next five years \u2013 and we need world-class technology to help us do that. That\u2019s why we chose elumatec. Over decades, their products have been tried and tested by fabricators all over the world \u2013 and today, they come backed with the best software support in the business.\u201d Alongside acquiring the SBZ 122 itself, Solinear have also purchased eluCad, the market-leading machine programming software from elusoft, elumatec\u2019s software development arm. eluCad dramatically simplifies the programming of machining centres. Rather than requiring users to input complex code, the product can be operated by quickly and easily entering a few key pieces of data, and the machine will do its work. Alternatively, operators can input free-form drawings for the machine to follow \u2013 a function that\u2019s exceptionally useful for companies like Solinear, which produces unconventionally shaped products that are completely bespoke. Phil Heavey, Managing Director of elumatec UK commented: \u201cWe\u2019re delighted that a company of Solinear\u2019s calibre has seen the benefits of working with elumatec.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s fabricators don\u2019t just want machines \u2013 they want comprehensive production systems that can seamlessly integrate with their PCs, laptops, tablets and smartphones. With elumatec and elusoft, that\u2019s exactly what they get.\u201d \u201cWe look forward to a long and successful relationship with Solinear in the years to come.\u201d For more information visit www.solinear.co.uk or call 01347 879046 (York office) or 01572 720449 (Leicestershire office).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "phil heavey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "solinear", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dwyer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "solinear", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leicestershire", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:19.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6b6849dee1f5baac38038892b5dd613e4145d611", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p10yln1njePV6Tg3aatwdBwoqSEnqqx4Y", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/m/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/m/ - Mecha - 4chan", "title": "/exvs/ - Gundam Versus and EXVS General", "title_full": "/m/ - /exvs/ - Gundam Versus and EXVS General - Mecha - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-06T18:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 20, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "821323ea887cdb5af6cca7aa66f3e23fcff89eb4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p10yln1njePV6Tg3aatwdBxFcdsPDrJmKrQJUB2W5VZw-", "ord_in_thread": 19, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T12:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "WD GM Sniper II and Aegis preview videos are out\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPj g6GdbNyY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8n dtqSxHpk\nI'm going to play the shit out of the WD sniper.

Morrie Craig, a longtime professor of veterinary toxicology at Oregon State University, will appeal his faculty-backed termination to the institution\u2019s Board of Trustees. The specific allegations against Craig, who did not respond to a request for comment, have not been made public. But the university has said, in relation to his case, that it takes seriously \u201call complaints of bullying and sexual harassment.\u201d \nCraig was accused in May, and he testified on his own behalf during a two-day hearing on the case overseen by a special committee of Oregon State\u2019s Faculty Senate, according to The Oregonian . That committee recommended Craig\u2019s dismissal for cause in October, and the university soon notified him of his termination. \nAppeals of faculty-backed termination decisions are rare, in part because terminations of tenured professors remain unusual. But Craig reportedly petitioned a county court to review the decision. A judge said he had no jurisdiction over the campus, however, so Craig pursued a last-ditch appeal option: going before the board. \nSteve Clark, university spokesperson, declined to share details of the case, but said via email that Oregon State has \u201cexplicit policies regarding such actions, including for faculty.\u201d Policies on bullying and harassment consider the severity of allegations, as well as allegations that are less severe but occur over a long period of time, he said. \nBrett Sokolow, executive director of the Association of Title IX Administrators, said Wednesday that whether faculty members challenge terminations, in court or internally, remains something of a \u201cmixed bag.\u201d Some of the \u201creally guilty ones,\u201d or those who are most privacy conscious, will not, he said, while those who feel \u201cwronged\u201d or who are unwilling to admit misconduct are more likely to challenge their terminations. \nYet Sokolow said he has noticed an increase in contestations of late, \u201cperhaps because we are seeing an increase in those who are being terminated instead of given a quiet exit.\u201d Previously -- as recently as a year ago -- hushed buyouts and departures for professors found to have committed misconduct were \u201cthe norm,\u201d he said. But things have shifted and the faculty member \u201clooking to make a quiet exit is not going to have that option as readily now.\u201d \nEarlier this month, the University of Virginia confirmed that John Casey, author and Henry Hoyns Professor of English, won\u2019t be teaching in the spring. Casey, who is on a preplanned sabbatical this term, did not respond to a request for comment. But he\u2019s been placed on leave next semester, when he was set to lead two graduate courses, pending a university investigation into multiple complaints from students. He\u2019s been publicly accused of inappropriately touching students, commenting on what they\u2019re wearing, using profanity to refer to women in readings and ranking female students based on attractiveness. \nAnthony de Bruyn, university spokesperson, told Inside Higher Ed that Virginia \u201cis committed to ensuring a safe, nondiscriminatory educational and work environment and takes seriously any allegation of conduct that would violate university policy prohibiting sexual and gender-based harassment.\u201d \nEven on campuses that have seen faculty departures over harassment, student advocates say they want more -- more training for employees and students, and more protections for students who report alleged misconduct. Students at San Jose State University, for example, on Tuesday held a party and rally to celebrate the recent resignation of Lewis Aptekar , a longtime professor of counseling education found by the university to have harassed a graduate student by repeatedly asking her out on dates and asking about her relationship status. Another student later made similar claims, which the university said could not be substantiated. \nElisa Stewart, Aptekar\u2019s attorney, told Inside Higher Ed earlier this year that after an investigation into his conduct in 2016-17, Aptekar was cleared of wrongdoing by a \u201cthoughtful, diligent and unbiased process with adequate protections in place to protect all the parties.\u201d An earlier, 2015 investigation was \u201cflawed, and consequently, the result is not reliable,\u201d she said. \nAptekar wasn\u2019t terminated; he resigned in exchange for $75,000, according to university records, after he criticized how the university handled his case. But students nevertheless celebrated what they perceived to be a win for their cause. \nValerie Lamb, a graduate student in education counseling at San Jose State who helped Students Against Sexual Harassment, or SASH, organize the rally, said the campus group is seeking \u201cjustice\u201d for professors who engage in harassment. One aim is to get professors found to have committed misconduct terminated, she said, and the other is to serve as \u201csafe space\u201d for students affected. Lamb said SASH and other advocates also hoped to benefit from the media attention surrounding sexual misconduct, in terms of effecting a more positive climate and possible policy changes -- no more \u201cslaps on the wrists\" for harassers. \nThe university said in a statement that it currently requires all faculty, staff and administrators to complete training on avoiding and combating sexual harassment annually, via a two-and-a-half-hour online course. The training includes case studies from the California State University system and is compliant with system executive orders prohibiting discrimination, harassment and retaliation, sexual misconduct, relationships between employees and those over whom they have significant authority, domestic violence, and stalking.

a pan-industry initiative to establish the future roles and responsibilities of network companies. \nThe move will help reduce the cost of running the network to customers and provide new opportunities for businesses and communities to offer flexibility services to local network operators. \nFlexibility services include businesses and consumers increasing electricity generation, or choosing to adjust their electricity consumption up or down to support balancing of supply and demand in real time in response to a financial incentive provided to them by an agreement with a network operator. \nThe figure of \u00a317bn is based on analysis conducted by Imperial College London and The Carbon Trust for the smart systems and flexibility plan published by the government and Ofgem in July. The research concluded the use of smart grids and flexibility services could create between \u00a317bn and \u00a340bn of energy systems benefits by 2050. \nThe report also states that network companies will also \"rapidly increase the use of competitive markets\" over the next six years, under the current RIIO ED-1 price control period. \nDavid Smith, CEO of Energy Networks Association, said: \"Our energy networks have a great track record of delivering for households, businesses and communities when it comes to network reliability, reducing costs to the bill payer and driving forward new investment in our infrastructure. \n\"This announcement builds on that, as our energy market rapidly changes. It is about creating a system that creates a platform for a whole range of new energy technologies and services that not only allows network companies to manage the system more effectively but give other organisations the chance to benefit from that, whether that be directly or indirectly.\" \nRichard Harrington MP, Minister for Energy & Industry, added: \"Upgrading our energy system to make sure it is fit for the future is a key part of our Industrial Strategy and the Smart Systems Plan published in July sets out what we will do to make that happen. \n\"A smarter, more flexible energy system will create opportunities to reduce energy costs, increase productivity and put UK businesses in a leading position to export smart energy technology and services to the rest of the world.\" \nDermot Nolan, chief executive of Ofgem, said: \"We welcome this commitment by network companies to create new markets for flexibility services following the joint publication of the Smart Systems and Flexibility Plan by Ofgem and the Government in July. \n\"Flexibility is key to the transition to a smarter energy system which saves consumers money on their energy bills. We will work with the energy industry, Government and consumer groups to make sure that these new services are delivered in whatever way works best for consumers.\" DISCUSSION ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ofgem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dermot nolan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard harrington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david smith", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "smart systems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ceo of energy networks association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carbon trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "imperial college london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "low carbon network innovation conference", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minister for energy & industry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "energy neworks asociation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ofgem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "great britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republic of ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:21.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a6826efbc0ff07d7608c64ecb8e329adb584056", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT24HtM.evS4PR9ev_ReY02l3.KHT4gzGVaoMDCN9nitMZolIiotWCmOSvyMQrNnoOqqIXmtlBn1kCi09ENg4u_Qg0dUx.RnWiIyzvSDvw6hpi7N89TNIWc", "site_full": "networks.online", "site": "networks.online", "site_section": "https://networks.online/feed/rss", "site_categories": ["computer_networking", "tech"], "section_title": "The most recent articles", "title": "Automation technology reduces length of power cuts", "title_full": "Automation technology reduces length of power cuts", "published": "2017-12-07T10:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://networks.online/w-images/d7072141-69f8-427a-99b4-f3f56abdff7b/2/ElectricityDistributionPowerLine-350x250.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3a6826efbc0ff07d7608c64ecb8e329adb584056", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT24HtM.evS4PR9ev_ReY02l3.KHT4gzGVaoMDCN9nitMZolIiotWCmOSvyMQrNnoOqqIXmtlBn1kCi09ENg4u_Qg0dUx.RnWiIyzvSDvw6hpi7N89TNIWc", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "AlecPeachey@fav-house.com (Alec Peachey)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "Automation technology reduces length of power cuts", "text": "power cuts New technology that helps reduce the length of power cuts is being used across the East, South East and London. \nThe country's biggest electricity distributor UK Power Networks has invested in state-of-the-art control systems that redirect power supplies quickly when power cuts happen. \nThe company has gradually increased its use of the innovative Automated Power Restoration System (APRS) technology in recent years and it is now the benchmark for other similar companies across the country. \nThe company has a total of 5,720 high voltage circuits now fitted with the APRS switching logic which represents 92% of the firm's total high voltage circuits. When a high voltage faults occurs APRS instructions remotely control switches to open or close to restore supply to as many customers as possible. UKPN has a total of 30,500 high voltage substations with remotely controlled switches. \nWhen the system detects any problem on the local cables and electricity substations, it uses satellite communications to instantly choose the most suitable alternative cable circuit and switch supplies across, without manual intervention. \nResidents' lights go off for just a few minutes while the technology does its job. The original fault can then be investigated and resolved by engineers while the power is routed round the properties affected by the fault. \nUK Power Networks control systems and automation manager, John Duller, said: \"We have strived to make our control systems and automation ability industry-leading, and we are feeling the benefits of this innovative work now. \n\"We were the first electricity distributor to introduce APRS in 2015 and now have the largest deployment of automation in the UK with more than 92% coverage across our regions.\" DISCUSSION", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john duller", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ukpn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "automated power restoration system", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk power networks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aprs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:22.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "11daa529a54eb78df193c7da920591499bec03ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_vICvFC2R3yo5rYLKcsHvc4YxkSLJkokbgay3EFliw0QLUt._bTFczY6SllYWSTu7ET7Zcg3ZdcT7yhc7fK34EHy27z.dK9xj0yoXnvL9Ktp7U_qWwkNdjzvFUXy.HYYI9qSuPX67RYzoMbZmcHwqkvhBUp04OOhFsSGCds9DWuIMC0mkkL22UeyR78P5BJAc-", "site_full": "www.wiltsglosstandard.co.uk", "site": "wiltsglosstandard.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.wiltsglosstandard.co.uk/news/northwilts/rss/", "site_categories": ["media", "business", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard | North Wilts news", "title": "North Wilts Comment: Funding inequality is wrong when public services are being cut", "title_full": "North Wilts Comment: Funding inequality is wrong when public services are being cut", "published": "2017-12-07T08:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.wiltsglosstandard.co.uk/resources/images/5460508/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "11daa529a54eb78df193c7da920591499bec03ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_vICvFC2R3yo5rYLKcsHvc4YxkSLJkokbgay3EFliw0QLUt._bTFczY6SllYWSTu7ET7Zcg3ZdcT7yhc7fK34EHy27z.dK9xj0yoXnvL9Ktp7U_qWwkNdjzvFUXy.HYYI9qSuPX67RYzoMbZmcHwqkvhBUp04OOhFsSGCds9DWuIMC0mkkL22UeyR78P5BJAc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T08:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "North Wilts Comment: Funding inequality is wrong when public services are being cut", "text": "0 comments \nCOUNCILLORS representing north Wiltshire residents are right to call for fairer funding for the people of this county. \nTime and time again, public services are being cut and the very people who pay for those services are suffering the most. \nFoodbank usage is on the rise, bus services are being reduced, parking fayres are increasing, and hospitals, emergency services and schools are under ever increasing pressure. \nSo why should people in Wiltshire be given such a raw deal in receiving about half the funding for these services that people in London do?

There's no such thing in an Irish house at Christmas. We love it! iStock. Ireland, like most countries, has a number of Christmas traditions that are all its own. \nMany of these customs have their root in the time when the Gaelic culture and religion of the country were being suppressed, and it is perhaps because of that they have survived into modern times. We have a look at some of the best traditions that you can bring into your own homes this holiday season. The candle in the window 6 Getty images. The placing of a lighted candle in the window of a house on Christmas Eve is still practiced in Ireland today. It has a number of purposes but primarily, it was a symbol of welcome to Mary and Joseph as they traveled looking for shelter. The candle also indicated a safe place for priests to perform mass, as during Penal Times, this was not allowed. A further element of the tradition is that the candle should be lit by the youngest member of the household and only be extinguished by a girl bearing the name 'Mary,' if possible. The laden table 6 Getty images. After the evening meal on Christmas Eve, the kitchen table was again set and on it were placed a loaf of bread filled with caraway seeds and raisins, a pitcher of milk and a large lit candle.\nThe door to the house was left unlatched so that Mary and Joseph, or any wandering traveler, could avail of the welcome. The Wren Boy procession 6 Hunting the wren on St Stephen's Day. Image: WikiCommons. During Penal Times , there was once a plot in a village against the local soldiers. They were surrounded and were about to be ambushed when a group of wrens pecked on their drums and awakened the soldiers. The plot failed and the wren became known as 'The Devil's bird'. On St Stephens day, a procession takes place where a pole with a holly bush is carried from house to house and families dress up in old clothes and with blackened faces. In olden times, an actual wren would be killed and placed on top of the pole. This custom has to a large degree disappeared but the tradition of visiting from house to house on St. Stephens Day has survived and is very much part of Christmas. Decorations 6 Getty images. The placing of a ring of holly on doors originated in Ireland as holly was one of the main plants that flourished at Christmas time, giving the poor ample means with which to decorate their dwellings. All decorations are traditionally taken down on Little Christmas (January 6) and it is considered bad luck to take them down beforehand. Traditional Gaelic salutation 6 The Gaelic greeting for \"Merry Christmas\" is \"Nollaig Shona Duit,\" which is pronounced as \"null-ig hun-a dit.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joseph", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st stephens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "penal times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:22.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3cc01c8f1237eaa9bd53f2455c5d118819cd7298", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/umBmlSSxw9xde1x1OawU.MkfBL.jqqvrjCGpFtk5.YrlZVYVAEuUQZ9gP3JHffpwysVCiFTYT3h3.Ndap0QEdySbOI3sFXXefydmlM_G1UIwPVD_LWtlSg--", "site_full": "xitsongalyrics.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://xitsongalyrics.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Xitsonga Lyrics", "title": "Who is Nsuku Baloyi?

Upon our arrival up a long unpaved driveway the property has old cars, trucks and motorcycles parked on the grounds. It looks more like a junk yard or wrecking yard opposed to looking like a B&B. However the property in its day was quite charming but the owner has left the property go downhill and refuses to put any money into upkeep and maintenance. The swimming pool was green with algae and full of leaves, the hot tub was not working and the heater cover lid was totally sun rotten. The patio furniture near the pool and spa was quality but unfortunately the cushions were soiled and stained with dry rot from the Arizona intense sun and the steel furniture needs to be painted or replaced. Our room was equipped with a decent king size bed on a stained concrete painted floor with a dirty area rug underneath the bed that needed to be shampooed with a very tiny partial bath including a small sink vanity with 2 burned out lights over the mirror and a toilet with very low water pressure and a toilet seat that was chipped, cracked and worn out. We did not stay for breakfast and had I NOT prepaid this room on Expedia we would have checked out before checking in!

I know better than to be entertained by the Big Guy.  So I bug Tonya.  She will yell at me and that is EXCITING.  I will try to crawl on her lap.  More yelling.  When she raises her voice, I know that I've got her attention. \n\nA few times, she has held up the zapper collar remote.  Since I don't know if I've got the collar on, I behave rather quickly. \n\nYesterday I had a good day.  I didn't eat one XMas ornament.  I was so proud of myself.  Tonya gave me a treat for not damaging the tree. \n\nIt was raining yesterday.  They wanted me to go outside.  I didn't see the need.  Well that didn't work out in my favour.  I had to go outside till I proved that I peed and then they would let me come in again. \n\nThe Big Guy has been doing this Vlogmas thing.  He tries to be funny.  Not sure that he succeeds.  But he's been posting a video every day now.  He says that he has 23 more videos to go.  So that is 23 more subjects he needs to think about.  Perhaps he should make a list of topics.   \n\nI seen that the Big Guy took out pork steaks for supper.  That means that I don't get any.  They never feed me pork.  Steak, yes, chicken yes.  Pork, no. \n\nThere is a wee bit of snow in the forecast for this weekend.  I love the snow.  But the Big Guy hates the snow.  He doesn't mind the rain too much.  He says that because he doesn't have to shovel the rain. \n\nBye bye fur now.
