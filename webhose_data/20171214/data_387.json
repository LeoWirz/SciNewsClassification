The win moves the Bonnies to 6-2 on the season, while Canisius slips to 4-5 with the loss. Reese's 31 points came after the Miami, Fla., native went 10-for-17 from the field, 5-for-10 from 3-point range and 6-for-7 from the charity stripe. He also dished out two assists and grabbed two steals in 39 minutes of action. Three other Griffs scored five points each in the loss, including sophomore , who ended the night with four assists, two boards and a steal. The difference in the game on Wednesday night was turnovers, as the Griffs were charged with 19, which St. Bonaventure turned into 27 points. The Bonnies also went 13-for-14 from the free-throw stripe in the victory, while Canisius shot 65.2 percent (15-for-23). The Bonnies used a 9-0 run over the span of 1:50 midway through the second half to take a 55-33 lead, capped a by a 3-pointer from the left wing by senior guard Jaylen Adams following a Canisius turnover. The Griffs were able to battle back and cut that lead to four at 57-53 with 9:41 left, but St. Bonaventure pushed its hold back to a dozen at 67-55 with 5:41 left to play. Five points from Reese and three-straight makes at the free-throw line by Crumpton put Canisius within four at 67-63 with 3:46 left to play, but the Bonnies sealed the victory by going 6-for-6 from the line in the game's closing 2:52, while the Blue and Gold struggled down the stretch with three misses from behind the arc and a turnover in the contest's final 2:25. Adams scored a season-high 20 points in the win for the Bonnies, while sophomore forward Josh Ayeni added 15 points to the winning effort for the visiting team. St. Bonaventure shot 45.9 percent from the field, but hit on just 26.7 percent (4-for-15) of its tries from 3-point land for the night. The Bonnies held a 33-32 advantage on the glass, with junior LaDarien Griffin grabbing a game-high 10 rebounds. Reggie Witherspoon 's Postgame Comments \"This was a hard-fought rivalry game tonight. Give St. Bonaventure credit, that's a good, well-coached team. They played well and got some scoring from guys who are not necessarily known as their top offensive threats. In the end, we turned it over way too much. I'm proud of the effort tonight, but we did not have the poise to go along with that effort. When you dig yourself a hole with 19 turnovers, that's 19 possessions where you can't score. And then they came down and scored 27 points off our turnovers, that was the difference right there.\" Game Notes \u2022 This was the 166th all-time meeting between the two long-time rivals. St. Bonaventure now leads the series 100-66. \u2022 The Bonnies were playing in the Koessler Athletic Center for just the seventh time in series history, and the win on Wednesday was the program's third in the building. \u2022 Reese is the first Griff to score 30 points or more in a home game since former Griff Kassius Robertson had 30 points in a win over Marist Jan. 14, 2017. \u2022 Crumpton's 15 points allowed him to move past former Griffs Andy Anderson and John McCarthy on the school's career scoring list. He now ranks 23rd all-time with 1,161 career points. Up Next Canisius will return to the road on Saturday, Dec. 9, when the Golden Griffins travel to play at Evansville.

Panama, however, was particularly vulnerable to an attack on its capital. Nearly half of Panama's population lived in Panama City or Col\u00f3n, and the canal drove most economic activity. The canal-based service sector (commerce and associated jobs) dominated the economy, playing a much larger role than agriculture and industry. \nTherefore, a single nuclear attack was able to totally disrupt the functioning of the Republic of Panama. The capital was left in ruin and the canal was not serviceable. The Panamanian government had been fragile at the time of the attack; General Manuel Noriega was in charge of the armed forces, but it was not clear who held real power in the government. The destruction of the capital and the canal overwhelmed the government's ability to cope with the situation. \nRural Panama immediately faced a massive humanitarian crisis as refugees left the canal region in both directions. Eastward, they confronted the imposing Dari\u00e9n jungles, where many soon died in the terrible conditions of the camps. To the west, Panama's agricultural land, refugees had slightly better chances. Nevertheless, troubles were numerous. The sheer number of displaced people was too much for the towns and villages of western Panama to accommodate. Many refugees kept moving, and where they stayed, they often pushed out the previous residents. The domino effect of displacement stretched to the Costa Rican border and beyond. \nIn this environment, power often fell to those with the most guns. Near the capital, groups of Americans fought Noriega's Panamanian Defense Forces for control of what was left of the country's center. Further west, heavily armed drug traffickers, deprived of their supplies and their markets, had nothing left but their weapons and their brutality and began to exploit the local population. They competed with military elements and carved out pockets of territory for themselves. The to-and-fro of the fighting among these factions was complex and does not need to be recounted here. As violence gripped Panama, local civil authorities struggled to protect their citizens, whether by seeking outside help, making peace with powerful armed groups, or resisting them. \nFor a number of reasons, this situation has never stabilized. Strong government continues to elude western Panama. A few local statelets, however, have emerged as islands of stability despite all odds. Because of continued pressure from guerrillas and a lack of regional support, their existence remains in jeopardy. Costa Rica has long sought to play the role of referee in the region and has consistently supported local initiatives, but it has also been racked by its own problems and often been unable to lend a hand. Colombia's territorial ambitions in western Panama have hurt its reputation with the locals and hurt its ability to coordinate the region. Panamanians have made numerous attempts to re-establish a national government, but to date none have succeeded. Local states in western Panama Current political map of Panama. Members of the Third Federation are colored a darker shade of violet. David Edit \nDavid (officially, San Jos\u00e9 de David) was Panama's third largest city and the country's agricultural center. Though low-lying and hot, its hinterland, the province of Chiriqu\u00ed, is full of comfortably cool highlands. David is also the major city farthest from the canal and closest to Costa Rica; for all these reasons, it has appeared well situated to be the center of a revived Panamanian state. Outsiders frequently point to David as a potential future capital of Panama. \nLike the rest of the region, after the war David was flooded with refugees. As the last stop before Costa Rica, David faced especially acute issues of overpopulation and sanitation. City and provincial leaders, sensing that their town was likely now the largest in Panama, organized a provisional government with the help of some national officials who were among the refugees. As the \"Provisional Government of the Republic of Panama\", David appealed to Costa Rica for aid late in 1983. Costa Rica helped absorb some of the refugees and helped David establish a network of field hospitals and semi-permanent camps. \nAt the same time, David made contact with Manuel Noriega and his Panamanian Defense Forces. Chiriqu\u00ed province had been Noriega's strongest base of support, and the provisional government there felt that support from the strongman would improve their chances of success. They informed him that they had formed a new national government and provisionally named him President, a title he had never held before. Noriega sent a detachment of troops to David but would not leave the central part of the country, where he was desperately trying to maintain his position around Col\u00f3n and Penonom\u00e9. The troops arrived in 1984 and helped the David government keep order in the refugee camps. Most communities in the western end of Panama, including the Ng\u00e4be-Bugl\u00e9 nation, recognized David as the new national capital. \nThese promising signs did not translate into long-term stability. Within a year, Noriega was dead. In 1985 the Costa Rican government was forced to flee its own capital as the Nicaraguan Civil War spilled across its northern border. David's legitimacy as a national capital had depended on links with both the general and the foreign ally; now, both were gone. Deprived of resources, David found itself unable to care for its inflated population, and many moved westward into the now lawless Costa Rican borderland. \nThe civilian government and the military (the detachment sent by Noriega in 1984) relied on one another to maintain power in and around David. But their relationship was not always harmonious. At several points, military officers took direct control of the administration. \nCosta Rica's civil war ended in 1993. Over the next two years, its unity government brought its border with Panama back under control. Costa Rica's next step was helping western Panama find stability; otherwise, the republic could not hope to maintain its own frontier. From their point of view, David remained the provisional capital of the country. However, the city was clearly in no position to directly control anything outside Chiriqu\u00ed province. Moreover, it was going through a period of military rule, and Costa Rica did not trust the officers in charge to lead Panama's government. \nThe joint Arias-Cuadro government in Costa Rica promised to aid David, but only if the military rulers returned the city to civilian control. Successive Costa Rican administrations continued this policy, and it has helped David remain in civilian hands. Democracy was only partially restored, however. In many ways, the ruling clique of 1983 remain in charge today. Elections have taken place only sporadically. \nThe office of President has remained vacant since Noriega's death. Since then, David has only rarely made claims to be the legitimate successor to Panama. It is essentially a city-state with a wide hinterland. It led by a Governor and a legislature representing the city and surrounding settlements. The Panamanian flag is still flown, and David's laws are always enacted \"in the name of the Republic of Panama\". The city has been the center of every major reunification effort within the country. It has never declared independence but is acknowledged as a sovereign state by Costa Rica and some other nations around the world. \nDavid's territory currently comprises most of the old Chiriqu\u00ed province, plus some highlands to the north. Bocas Edit \nBocas, or Bocas del Toro, is a town on an island in the Chiriqu\u00ed lagoon on the Caribbean side of the isthmus. Of all the Panamanian survivor states, it has the longest and closest relationship with Costa Rica. Costa Rica began sending aid to the town, which was the capital of Bocas del Toro province, in 1983. They remained in contact, mainly by boat, even after the Costa Rican government relocated to Lim\u00f3n in 1985. \nBocas Town maintained control over the islands of the archipelago and some of the adjacent coastline, but lost contact with most of the interior, which was overrun by various armed groups, including former drug traffickers. When these threatened Bocas' narrow strip of the mainland in 1990, it needed help from Costa Rica's small, fledgling militia. Three years later, Costa Rica had a unity government and an army. Bocas and the unity government drew up articles that esentially made the city-state a Costa Rican protectorate. \nToday, Bocas enjoys a basically healthy democracy. Its relationship with Costa Rica is as close as ever, and every so often someone will talk about annexation. A large majority of Bocatore\u00f1os are against becoming Costa Rican; however, they would rather become Costa Rican than Colombian, and if Colombia ever tried to make good on its claims to all of Panama, it is likely that Bocas would not hesitate to join its western neighbor. Changuinola Edit \nChanguinola is a town lying between Bocas del Toro and the Costa Rican border. It became an independent city-state in 1998 after a joint military operation by Costa Rica and David defeated the \"narcocrats\" in power there. Neither David, Costa Rica, nor Bocas were able to occupy and control this territory directly, so they instead helped locals organize a new government. Civil government took over in 2000, and while corruption is a continuing problem, Changuinola remains a stable democracy. \nIn the years since, treaties with Bocas and David have granted Changuinola control over significant portions of the forested highlands in the interior of the isthmus. It is currently involved in an ongoing dispute with Costa Rica, which still occupies about a third of its de jure territory. CR claims its military needs these positions to outflank Limonese rebels in its own Caribbean coastland. Ng\u00e4be-Bugl\u00e9 (Guaym\u00eda) Edit \nTraditional social structures helped the indigenous Ng\u00e4be and Bugl\u00e9 people, collectively called the Guaym\u00ed, to weather the nuclear war fairly well. Most refugees in 1983 followed the Pan-American Highway that passes south of their core lands. In 1984 delegates gathered in the town of Chichica and declared the formation of a new comarca to govern their peoples' affairs until the Panamanian government could be restored. \nThe David provisional government worked through the new comarca and passed a bill delineating its boundaries. Political instability in David after 1985 caused the Ng\u00e4be and Bugl\u00e9 to drift away from its control. It has existed as a basically independent nation ever since. \nLike the Kuna, Ember\u00e1, and Wounaan people at the other end of the country, traditional language and culture have held the Guaym\u00ed people together throughout the postwar chaos. In general, the nation has cooperated willingly with its neighbors, but due to a territorial dispute with Bocas over lands on the coast, it has chosen to stay out of the most recent federation. \nThe official name of the state is The Comarca of the Ng\u00e4be and Bugl\u00e9 Peoples , but informally many outsiders call it Guaym\u00eda . Azuero Edit Azuero's flag suggests the flag of Panama. The diamond is a stylized map of the peninsula. \nAzuero is a peninsula shaped like a tilted square about 100 km on a side, jutting southward into the Pacific. It was traditionally the \"Heart of Panama\", the center of the country's traditional rural culture, which combines Spanish and Pre-columbian elements. Azuero was also where, in the village of Los Santos in 1821, Panamanians signed their country's first declaration of independence from Spain. Before the war, the peninsula relied on agriculture, in particular the cattle industry. In fact, large swaths of Azuero were heavily deforested to make more grazing land, with disastrous results - with the trees gone, the sea winds took most of the soil from the deforested areas. Two small cities, Chitr\u00e9 and Las Tablas, were the main population centers. Politically, Azuero was divided into two provinces and a part of a third. \nConditions after Doomsday tested the famous welcoming, generous attitudes of the inhabitants. The largest number of refugees followed the Pan-American Highway toward Costa Rica, but a fair number took the southern spur - the Carretera Nacional - into Azuero. To help maintain order, local officials asked the military to come into the peninsula. The troops turned out to be far more concerned with drafting refugees and locals to use as cannon fodder against their rivals, than with helping local authorities. \nIn towns and villages, people began to take matters into their own hands. An organized revolt took shape, led by former provincial leaders in both cities, who did their best to keep the revolt under their control. A deep sense of betrayal, together with a mistrust of city people, both refugees and military, shaped the movement. Within three years, most armed factions had left Azuero, unable to contend with this organized movement of citizens and local governments. \nIn 1988 delegates met in Los Santos in the same building where independence had been declared in 1821. They declared the formation of a new Rep\u00falica de Azuero - the only community in Panama to take this step. The new republic would govern the peninsula until a new national regime emerged in Panama \"which embodies the principles of freedom, equality, and the spirit of the Panamanian people.\" \nGiven these roots, Azuero has emerged as a stable and secure, yet stubbornly isolationist successor state. It has been an inconsistent supporter of the different federations led by David since 1991. Its cooperation is seen as essential for any locally-driven reunification project, not only because of its firm control of its territory, but also for its food resources. The republic's government sponsored a diversification of agriculture in the late 80s and early 90s, which finally helped to feed its people. Reforestation has been less successful, and especially near the seashore many doubt whether the man-made desert can ever be replanted. \nAzuero is defended by a militia, service in which is a firm requirement of citizenship. A village-based democracy has emerged, but society remains rigidly divided into two classes: Azuere\u00f1os - residents of the peninsula as of August 1983, and their descendants - and Refugiados and their descendants. The rights of the latter are greatly restricted, and their interests are represented in the legislature by a separate, weaker house. Las Tablas is the current seat of government. \nIn many ways, life in Azuero goes on much as it did before. Its citizens see it as a lifeboat for Panamanian culture and folklore and have maintained many of the colorful traditions that existed before the war. Most modern contrivances have disappeared from the peninsula. The revolutionary government hoarded almost all remaining fuel to use for reconaissance airplanes based in the small airports at Las Tablas and Pedas\u00ed, at Azuero's southeastern corner. Veraguas Edit \nVeraguas can be considered the most successful of Panama's \"warlord states\". While civil authority has broken down in most of Panama, a relatively calm block of land exists in the former Veraguas province near Santiago, the old provincial capital. Power changed hands many times during the 80s and 90s, but the current regime has been in power for almost ten years. Many of its leaders are former American soldiers from the Canal Zone, allied with some Panamanian armed elements. \nVeraguas participated in the first two Panamanian Federations, which gave it some legitimacy in the eyes of the rest of the country. Islas de las Perlas Edit \nThough located in eastern Panama, the Pearl Islands were for a time part of the network of west Panamanian communities. Dependent on fishing and tourism, the islands fared badly when the visitors stopped coming and the waters became polluted by the nuclear attack on the capital. However, they were spared the refugee flood that caused crises everywhere else in the country. By the end of the 1980s, the Pearls were a fairly successful self-governing community. They joined the Second Federation as a step toward uniting with a restored Panama. \nThis period of tranquil independence ended in 2003, when the strategic significance of the islands suddenly became clear. The Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand occupied the Pearls and began to build a base. The archipelago potentially commanded the Gulf of Panama and the Pacific entrance of the newly rebuilt Canal. The Oz-Kiwi forces were forced to leave the islands when they ran low on supplies. But Colombia, Ecuador , and Venezuela did not want to leave them unguarded. They annexed the Pearl Islands to the Canal Zone, jointly ruled by the three builder nations. \nThe Pearl Islands' representative government is still in place, the only part of the Canal Zone to enjoy local autonomy. When South America built a naval base, they did not bother asking for the citizens' approval, but most of them were happy for the protection, afraid of another invasion. Five years later, the military is the main employer in the Islas de las Perlas. Smaller Settlements Edit \nOutside these larger communities, power continues to shift back and forth among various petty warlords. One settlements of note is Penonom\u00e9 , at the center of the isthmus about 100 km from the old capital. Penonom\u00e9 was the chief prize in the chaotic civil war that followed the government's collapse, and the military factions considered it the future capital of the country. Noriega made his base there for a period, followed by the American remnants and other rogue groups that arrived still later. Today the town is largely in ruin but is still the center of a small local economy. El Valle is a village in the highlands east of Penonom\u00e9 whose cool climate has made it an exporter of food to much of central Panama.

In this Nov. 21, 2017, photo provided by the Montefiore Health System, Dr. Tova Koenigsberg at The Montefiore Einstein Center for Cancer Care in New York shows an example of a traditional mammogram scan. \nBy LAURAN NEERGAARDAP Medical Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens. \n___ \nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Bryant Democracy of objects . Are wholes better than parts? Is a RNA molecule in the same bill of rights as Bucksminsterfullerene (C 60 )? Aristotle, a hero for Bryant (and this writer) would definitely vote against democracy in favor of an aristocracy of objects. In this paragraph (DO, p. 52), Bryant addresses a correlationist 1 objection to his argument. A second line of argument holds that it is impossible to intelligently think a world without men because, in the very act of thinking such a world, we are picturing ourselves present to this world. What's the big deal? In physics there is a world without humans. Take the Lagrange/d'Alembert formula: \u03a3 (F i \u2212 m i a i ) \u22c5\u03b4r i = 0 Each letter here symbolizes what Bryant, following philosopher of science Roy Bhaskar calls \"intransitive objects\". F is the total force, m i is the mass, (Locke, a correlationist in Bryant's book, would agree that \"mass\" is independent of correlations, i.e., a \"primary quality\" independent-of-sense-experience). a i is the acceleration, \u03b4r i is the displacement of the particle, Particles are part of a bigger system, i.e., the universe. From his entrance in the Encyclopedie : It is undeniable that all the bodies of which this universe is made up form a single system, whose parts are interdependent and whose interrelations derive from the harmony of the whole. 2 D'Alembert would agree with Bhaskar's idea of \"open systems,\" as long as by \"open\" we understand not observed yet . (...) the universe is only a vast ocean on whose surface we perceive a few more or less large islands whose connexion with the continent is hidden from us . 3 If there is more science to be discovered, there is more to know of science, that is, more future experiments to be performed, more theories to be proposed, more relations between theories (for example, evolutionism now vs. evolutionism in 1900s). This is not what Bryant necessarily has in mind. By \"open\" he means \"... those where the powers of objects are either not acting or are disguised or hidden by virtue of the intervention of other causes.\" (DO, p. 48). I have a problem with this characterization. Let's take it bit by bit: \"powers of objects are either not acting.\" A power has to always act. Power is acting. A non-acting power is acting (think of dark matter). By presenting the object as not acting, we liberate the object from the constraint of possible (thought?) The thesis here is that every picture of the world includes ourselves in the picture. However Quentin Mellissoux has convincingly argued such a line of argument leads to a conclusion that the thought of our own death is unintelligible or that we are necessarily immortal. For if it is true that we cannot think the world without thinking our presence to the world , then it follows that even the thought of our own death requires the presence of our thinking, thereby undermining the possibility of dying. Wait. Thinking a world without me in it is logically & causally possible. For instance, a sunset in the late Cambrian era seeing from Gondwana. True, it's my thought, but my thought refers to a fact (regardless of our conceptual scheme to refer to it). Take thinking my after-death, which is precisely Decartes' move in his sixth meditation. Descartes would laugh at the idea that from the fact that the thought of our death requires the presence of our thinking, thinking it undermines the possibility of dying: (...) [T] he difference between the body of a living man and that of a dead man is just like the difference between, on the one hand, a machine or other automaton (that is, a self- moving machine) when it is wound- up... and, on the other hand, the same watch or machine when it is broken. 4 The motions of a particle or of a rigid body may be either \"free\" or \"constrained\"; that is, it may be at liberty to move in any manner in obedience to the applied forces or torques, or there may be present material barriers which limit its linear motion to a certain path or surface, or its rotation to a certain axis. this is the world of physics, a sort of non-correlationist world. Since anything I will ever experience is a correlation, how can we get to the objects of science if not by observation? Who says that my eye observing (nervous bits of data) and my mental states (neural macroactivity) are not in a sense object-independent? coming back to DNA and politics: a DNA molecule contains phosphorus as part of its skeleton, a DNA molecule is functionally more complex than phosphorus taken as a part, so, DNA is politically more worthy than P 15 . My proposition makes sense both from a human-centered and non-human-centered point of view. 5 DNA is structurally more complex than phosphorous. Is a planet on the same political footing as cosmic dust? A neuron at a par with a mind?

Lolita has influences from certain time periods but is it's own thing and it has so much variation. A petticoat is necessary for most lolita coords but a petticoat does make any dress lolita. I don't think skirt length is a defining factor anymore since brands seem to be experimenting with it more and more while it still being lolita.\nI think it's a combination of the petticoat, acceptable skirt length and the overall aesthetic, details and modesty etc. that makes a coord lolita because like you said lolita is it's own thing. It takes inspiration from a lot of things but it's modernised in a sense. It has it's own guidelines and overall aesthetic that differentiates it from looking like it's a direct copy of something else.\nTo make a retro substyle of lolita, I think it'd have to be similar to the way that sailor lolita has nautical motifs and aesthetic, or the way hime is a derivative of sweet lolita and hime gyaru but they're still both clearly lolita and the main pieces are always lolita. You couldn't just use a random 50's dress, which will probably have nice tailoring but not much else, not to mention usually lower necklines and plain flared skirts that just aren't lolita for obvious reasons.\nLolita is it's own cohesive thing because even across varying substyles, it still has the same attention to detail, lace trims, decorations, illustrative border prints etc. To make a 50's substyle you'd have to take lolita main pieces that have the right aesthetic and style your hair, makeup and accessories accordingly. You could even do this with honey cake for example. I think the defining factor is the main piece still being lolita and the overall coord sticking to the rules of lolita. To make it as you say 'feel like clothes' the way lolita does, it'd still have to objectively be lolita.

Rahman is also accused of assisting Imran in terror planning. \nThe two were arrested in London and Birmingham on Nov. 28 by the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command. \nOpen office for peace talks, Taliban told \nKABUL -- An Afghan government-mandated peace council on Wednesday urged the Taliban to open an office in the capital Kabul and join peace talks to end the country's 16-year war. \nThe council said in a statement that it wouldn't set any preconditions for negotiations and will let the insurgent group choose its own preferred methods for paving the way to talks. \nThe latest push for peace with the Taliban, which now controls or contests more than 40 percent of Afghanistan, comes after President Donald Trump in August revealed his new strategy for the nation in a bid to resolve America's longest war that has cost thousands of lives and about $120 billion. \nTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed did not respond to multiple calls for comment, but the group has repeatedly rejected all calls for peace talks until their top condition is met: the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan. \nHungarian charged with spying on EU \nBUDAPEST, Hungary -- A Hungarian member of the European Parliament has been indicted for allegedly spying on the European Union, Hungarian prosecutors said Wednesday. \nProsecutors didn't identify which country Bela Kovacs was purportedly spying for but earlier said that Hungary's counterintelligence service had been alarmed by his regular contacts with Russian diplomats and monthly visits to Moscow. \nAccording to the indictment, \"the parliamentary representative carried out his spying activities in the interests of a foreign state and on behalf of the secret services.\" \nCharges filed by the Chief Investigative Prosecutor's Office against Kovacs, from the far-right Jobbik party, also include fraud totaling $24,900 stemming from the fictitious employment of interns in the EU parliament in 2012 to 2013. \nKovacs, who has been a member of the EU parliament since 2010, worked and studied in Russia for many years. \nKovacs denied the charges, saying he welcomed the opportunity to clear his name in court. He said he was immediately leaving his party. \nBolivia loosening abortion restrictions \nLA PAZ, Bolivia -- Bolivian lawmakers voted Wednesday to ease the country's tight restrictions on abortions, shrugging aside opposition from religious groups. \nThe Legislative Assembly vote will allow \"students, adolescents or girls\" to have abortions up to the eighth week of pregnancy. Abortion in Bolivia currently is allowed only when the woman's life is in danger, in the case of a malformed fetus or in cases of rape or incest. Illegal abortion carries a prison term of up to three years. \nPresident Evo Morales has said he'll sign the measure, despite opposition from Catholic and Evangelical churches in the country. \nHealth Minister Ariana Campero said abortion is the third-leading cause of maternal death in Bolivia, and the government has estimated that more than 80,000 clandestine abortions occur each year in the country. \nA Section on 12/07/2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wigglesworth brit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed aqib imran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bela kovacs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kovacs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rahman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ariana campero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evo morales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naa'imur zakariyah rahman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "imran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zabihullah mujahed", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "democrat-gazette", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taliban", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jobbik party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "westminster magistrates' court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la paz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "legislative assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metropolitan police counter terrorism command", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hungary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.  london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bolivia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "birmingham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kabul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "downing street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu  budapest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kabul", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:02.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a12acd728c2ab2353059975bfd818c40b22da3a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWZ5Qwe35OYZIMOsW6fut9dFEfao0KOtyO9vz_rSNN2QDJFPZDIyYnNe1GKgOEWS4-", "site_full": "www.blowoutforums.com", "site": "blowoutforums.com", "site_section": "https://www.blowoutforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=6", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "BASKETBALL - Blowout Cards Forums", "title": "Am I unreasonable?

The North's spokesman said Pompeo provoked the country by \"impudently criticizing our supreme leadership which is the heart of our people.\"\n\"The large-scale nuclear war exercises conducted by the U.S. in succession are creating touch-and-go situation on the Korean peninsula and series of violent war remarks coming from the U.S. high-level politicians amid such circumstances have made an outbreak of war on the Korean peninsula an established fact. The remaining question now is: when will the war break out,\" the spokesman said.\n\"We do not wish for a war but shall not hide from it, and should the U.S. miscalculate our patience and light the fuse for a nuclear war, we will surely make the U.S. dearly pay the consequences with our mighty nuclear force which we have consistently strengthened.\"\nThe comments were carried by the official Korean Central News Agency late Wednesday, hours after the United States flew a B-1B supersonic bomber over South Korea as part of a massive combined aerial exercise involving hundreds of warplanes.\nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the Guam-based bomber simulated land strikes at a military field near South Korea's eastern coast during a drill with U.S. and South Korean fighter jets.\n\"Through the drill, the South Korean and U.S. air forces displayed the allies' strong intent and ability to punish North Korea when threatened by nuclear weapons and missiles,\" the South Korean military said in a statement.\nB-1Bs flyovers have become an increasingly familiar show of force to North Korea, which after three intercontinental ballistic missile tests has clearly moved closer toward building a nuclear arsenal that could viably target the U.S. mainland.\nThe five-day drills that began Monday involve more than 200 aircraft, including six U.S. F-22 and 18 F-35 stealth fighters.\nNorth Korea hates such displays of American military might at close range and typically uses strong language to condemn them as invasion rehearsals. It has been particularly sensitive about B-1B bombers, describing them as \"nuclear strategic\" although the planes were switched to conventional weaponry in the mid-1990s.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "n. korea", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mike pompeo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pompeo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "foreign ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korean central news agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joint chiefs of staff", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korean peninsula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:02.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a12acd728c2ab2353059975bfd818c40b22da3a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWZ5Qwe35OYZIMOsW6fut9dFEfao0KOtyO9vz_rSNN2QDJFPZDIyYnNe1GKgOEWS4-", "site_full": "www.blowoutforums.com", "site": "blowoutforums.com", "site_section": "https://www.blowoutforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=6", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "BASKETBALL - Blowout Cards Forums", "title": "Am I unreasonable?

Stephen Connelly, director of Cleave and Company, said the intense media attention has been \"a bit of a shock.\" He added: \"We're not going to be making replicas of it. If you want a ring, then we'll design you a different one.\" Harry has said he sourced a diamond from Botswana for the yellow gold engagement ring, which also features smaller diamonds that had belonged to his mother, Princess Diana. The couple is getting married at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle in May. \n\u2022 Kiss co-founder and entrepreneur Gene Simmons has a new book out in which he hopes to reveal the principles of being rich and powerful. He doesn't offer a quick fix, writing that people need to have to wake up early, dress better, turn off the TV and study. \"I want to shake you up and tell, you a real harsh truth: The world doesn't need you,\" he said. \"The only way you're going to become rich and powerful is if you stand up on your hind legs. You're only going to get the respect you demand.\" On Power is part guidebook, part self-help manual, with several profiles of people Simmons thinks we should admire, like media mogul Oprah Winfrey and business titan Warren Buffett. His advice to gaining wealth is simple: Think of a good idea, start a limited liability partnership in the home, use social media and deduct the costs from taxes. But he also advises people to keep their old jobs until the rewards flow in. If they don't? Simmons said declare bankruptcy and \"then you can start again.\" Simmons is brutal in his advice, writing that women need to choose between a career or a family and that men need to get rid of any worthless friends. Above all, he says, don't listen to the self-esteem movement or be politically correct. \n\u2022 AARP the Magazine says its Movies for Grownups Awards will be televised for the first time next year, when Helen Mirren will receive its lifetime achievement honors. The magazine announced Wednesday that Mirren will accept the Career Achievement Award at a ceremony on Feb. 5. The 17th annual Movies for Grownups Awards will premiere on PBS on Feb. 23. Mirren says she is \"greatly honored\" by the award, adding that she considers film a high art form and \"the ultimate mirror up to nature.\" She joins previous Career Achievement honorees, including Morgan Freeman, Susan Sarandon, Robert Redford and Sharon Stone. AARP established its Movies for Grownups series in 2002 to celebrate and recognize filmmaking for audiences with \"a grown-up state of mind.\" In this Nov. 14, 2017 photo, Kiss frontman Gene Simmons poses for a portrait in New York to promote his book, \"On Power.\" In this Nov. 11, 2017 file photo, Helen Mirren arrives at the 9th annual Governors Awards in Los Angeles. \nA Section on 12/07/2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "diana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meghan markle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mirren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gene simmons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharon stone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert redford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morgan freeman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "susan sarandon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen connelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oprah winfrey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helen mirren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simmons", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap/matt dunham in", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aarp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pbs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleave and company", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kensington palace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "botswana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. george's chapel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "windsor castle", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:02.046+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "702e7f22b28f2fb1153b02c227b1aea5b00ebbdf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.7UpMpnRMPcGUw5xT2j2fHvcTy5k90T2Why1fReuj4xi.gttzMmhbGdTYtN5P4rC7TMRHflBE9MOu5ICq8H0FTsG_27wF_prBXPfyWgYnUAHsW5OtMfZesWSS3I2Hn8589qRORmA5pt8zRx4c883jHpAB.jCIZMsg-", "site_full": "www.travelandtourworld.com", "site": "travelandtourworld.com", "site_section": "http://www.travelandtourworld.com", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale"], "section_title": "Travel and Tour World \u2013 Tourism, Airline, Destination, MICE, Gobal Travel Market, Hotel news that you will find only over here.", "title": "Authentic Melbourne experiences immerse AIME buyers in the culture capital", "title_full": "Authentic Melbourne experiences immerse AIME buyers in the culture capital", "published": "2017-12-07T11:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "702e7f22b28f2fb1153b02c227b1aea5b00ebbdf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.7UpMpnRMPcGUw5xT2j2fHvcTy5k90T2Why1fReuj4xi.gttzMmhbGdTYtN5P4rC7TMRHflBE9MOu5ICq8H0FTsG_27wF_prBXPfyWgYnUAHsW5OtMfZesWSS3I2Hn8589qRORmA5pt8zRx4c883jHpAB.jCIZMsg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Andrea Das", "published": "2017-12-07T11:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "Authentic Melbourne experiences immerse AIME buyers in the culture capital", "text": "Authentic Melbourne experiences immerse AIME buyers in the culture capital Published on : Thursday, December 7, 2017\nTen specially curated City Experiences will immerse Hosted Buyers in Melbourne\u2019s renowned culinary and entertainment scene, and unique urban culture at the Asia-Pacific Incentives and Meetings Expo (AIME) in February 2018.\nFollowing the success of the City Experiences in 2017, Melbourne Convention Bureau (MCB) has once again partnered with a selection of venues, accommodation providers and attractions across the business events sector to offer an exclusive selection of tours.

Hence, their reliance on lies and propaganda. But people of Gujarat have made up their mind this time,\" Patel tweeted. \n\n\"Putting up fake posters and orchestrating a rumour campaign shows the utter desperation of the BJP. Fearing defeat, do they have to rely on such dirty tricks? I have never ever been a candidate for the CM and will never, ever be.\" \nHe said the \"misinformation campaign by the BJP\" showed that they know they were going to lose Gujarat elections. \nGujarat is considered to be the BJP's Hindutva lab where other parties are chary of projecting Muslim issues. \n(This story has not been edited by Social News XYZ staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)
