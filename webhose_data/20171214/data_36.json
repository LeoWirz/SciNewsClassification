A biological product can be a virus, antitoxin, vaccine, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, or analogous product, or any therapeutic serum used for the treatment of a disease in humans. These biological products were developed from multicellular systems comprising of plants, animals, unicellular organisms and a mammalian cell. Biological products are composed of sugars, nucleic acids or combination of both.Report overview @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/biologi... During the 20th century, the world witnessed many great discoveries in the biological product manufacturing industry. One of the first biological products to be introduced in the U.S. market was a blood protein known as Factor VIII which was first sold in 1966.The first FDA approved modern biological product designed for human therapeutic use was insulin; the approval was given in 1982.During 1985, FDA approved human growth hormone (HGF).The manufacturing of biological product differs from product to product; the process involves product-specific process consideration. One very important step involved in biological product manufacturing is controlled the environmental control of particulate and microbial contamination of the biological product production facility. The difference between biological products and conventional drug are, the biological product is heat sensitive and are prone to cross-contamination. Therefore they require a contaminant free environment during manufacturingBiological product manufacturing facilities use analytical and process development capabilities for the developing and scaling up the process for increased production maintaining the quality of the biological product. The implementation of such process control assist the Phase 1 clinical studies which focus on the product safety and efficacy. The biological product manufacturing is governed by many various regulatory authorities which make it harder for products approvals, because of overlapping opinions and other redundancies. Therefore to bring all regulatory authorities under one roof, the international conference on harmonization of technical requirements was formed in 1990 for the registration of pharmaceuticals for human use. The ICH has helped biological product manufacturers to register and develop a better quality product which is safe and more efficient.The biological products are produced in three ways: by developing ways to achieve commercial production of the substance to be used, by gene alteration of the molecule and finally by developing an entirely new substance. Some of the tools used by modern day researcher in the manufacturing of biological products are recombinant DNA and monoclonal antibodies. Recombinant DNA involves altering of the DNA chain of one organism with desired DNA molecule to produce a novel biological product. Monoclonal antibodies were developed from single cell cultures using cloning techniques; these were designed to fight against toxins, viruses, and cancer cells. The first genetically engineered biological product approved for use in the U.S. was a vaccine for hepatitis-B which was approved in 1986, in the same year, other biological products like therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (MAB\u2019s) and alpha interferon\u2019s were approved.Request to sample report @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/13591 The biological product manufacturing strictly follows GMP (Good manufacturing practices) rules for all production process from beginning to the last step for biological product manufacturing. These guidelines imply to the change in facility, manufacturing processes and other guidelines regarding clinical trials of the biological product related to its safety and purity. The major drivers for biological product manufacturing market increase in population, increasing the incidence of chronic diseases and increased government initiatives.By regional presence, global biological product manufacturing market is segmented into five key regions viz. North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia-Pacific-Pacific, and the Middle East & Africa. The region of North America is a forerunner in biological product manufacturing market globally mainly because of strong product development, technological advancements and increasing the population. The North America market is closely followed by Europe and Asia-Pacific. The region of Asia Pacific is an emerging market for referral management system mainly because of increasing proficiency in IT skills and growing healthcare expenditure in the region.The leading players in the referral management market are Novartis AG, F.Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Merck & Co., Inc., Bayer AG, Lonza, China Biologic Products, Inc., Pfizer Inc., Sanofi, GOLDEN WEST BIOLOGICALS, Inc., Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Amgen Inc.Buy now @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/checkout/13591 About UsPersistence Market Research (PMR) is a third-platform research firm.

One year ago, on November 30 2016, airBaltic became the launch customer for the Bombardier CS300 when they received the first example off the production line. The jet airliner would become the key to success for the airline from Latvia. AirBaltic\u2019s CEO Martin Gauss states that the CS300 definitely meets the carrier\u2019s expectations.\nAirBaltic is soaring to new heights with the CS300 According to Gauss more passengers are choosing to fly with the CS300. The CS300 makes it possible for airBaltic to open up new routes. Since the introduction of the new airliner, airBaltic already announced more than 20 new routes.\n \nOn November 30, 2016 airBaltic received its first CS300. Photo: airBaltic The CS300 has proven to be a reliable, economical, and comfortable airliner for the passengers and crew. The first aircraft, registration YL-CSA, has already flown more than 150,000 passengers on more than 1,300 flights. After the first aircraft airBaltic received 6 more CS300s. A total of 20 aircraft have been ordered by airBaltic. The last aircraft will be delivered by the end of 2019. The CS300 will replace the carrier\u2019s old Boeing 737s. Enjoy this video of an airBaltic B737 and its successor the CS300 landing during a storm at Amsterdam Airport. Video courtesy of Jerry Taha Productions .\nBombardier C-Series Orders Trickle In Today there are only two airlines in the world flying the C-Series: airBaltic and Swiss. Swiss airlines is flying both the CS100 as the CS300 with a total of 20 aircraft in active service. Korean Air will be the third airline to fly the CS300 before the end of 2017. The South-Korean order includes 10 aircraft and purchase rights for an additional 10 aircraft.\n \nKorean Air will be the third airline to fly the CS300.

Bombardier also announced at the show that it has signed a letter of intent for up to 24 CS300s with EgyptAir in Cairo. This includes 12 CS300s with purchase rights for an additional 12 aircraft.\n \nEgyptAir ordered the CS300 on November 14, 2017 at the Dubai Airshow. Image: Bombardier About C-Series Aircraft The Bombardier C-Series is a family of narrow-body, twin-engine, medium range jet airliners, designed by Canadian manufacturer Bombardier Aerospace. The CS100 (108 to 133- seat) made its maiden flight on September 16, 2013 and entered service on July 15, 2016 with Swiss Global Airlines. The CS300 (130 to 160-seat) flew for the first time on February 27, 2015 and entered service with launch customer airBaltic on December 14, 2016. When it entered service, the CS300 saw 21% lower fuel burn, replacing B737-300s with a dependability above 99% and 25% lower costs than the RJ100 for the CS100.\nThe C-Series is the only aircraft optimized for the 100 to 150-seat market segment, which drives the aircraft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s phenomenal economic proposition and performance, opening up new opportunities for single-aisle aircraft operation. The C-Series aircraft is manufactured by the C-Series Aircraft Limited Partnership, an affiliate of the Bombardier Commercial Aircraft segment of Bombardier Inc.\nComprised of the CS100 and the larger CS300 aircraft, the C-Series family represents the fusion of performance and technology. The result is aircraft that deliver unmatched performance and economics in the 100 to 150-seat market segment and an 18 per cent lower cost per passenger, making them the ideal candidates to complement larger single-aisle aircraft. Airlines can now operate routes that were previously not profitable or even possible.\nA great view on the airBaltic CS300 Cabin Interior that offers comfortable large seats, larger windows and more space.\u00c2 \u00c2 \u00c2 Photo: airBaltic  \nBombardier has created a new standard in cabin design and flexibility to ensure an unrivaled passenger experience. The aircraft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s larger seats, overhead bins and windows deliver a wide-body feel that offers passengers unparalleled comfort in a single-aisle cabin.The passengers\u2019 and pilots\u2019 feedback is positive for the cabin and flight controls.\n \nThe amazing and high-tech CS300 cockpit.

Here is an airBaltic CS300 departing from Amsterdam Airport to its home base airport in Riga, Latvia. Video courtesy of Jerry Taha Productions .\nHow does the Airbus-Bombardier Partnership relate to the Boeing-Bombardier Dispute?\u00c2 \nOn October 16, 2017 Airbus and Bombardier announced a partnership on the C-Series program, with Airbus acquiring a 50.01% majority stake for no outlay, with Bombardier keeping 31% and Investissement Qu\u0102\u0160bec 19%. When the deal closes in the second half of 2018, Airbus will assist in marketing and servicing.\nAirbus\u2019 supply chain expertise should save production costs, but headquarters and assembly remain in Quebec while U.S. customers will benefit from a second assembly line in Mobile, Alabama. Airbus did not pay for its share in the program, nor did it assume any debt. Airbus insists that the company has no plan to buy out Bombardier\u2019s stake in the C-Series program. Bombardier would remain a strategic partner after 2025. The plan is to expand in an estimated market of more than 6,000 new 100-150 seat aircraft over 20 years. Airbus CEO Tom Enders and Bombardier CEO Alain Bellemare assured that this factor did not drive the partnership, but negotiations began in August, after the April 2017 filing and the June decision to proceed and, as a result, Boeing was suspicious.\nBoeing\u2019s battle over Bombardier is indirectly related to its feud with Airbus. Boeing claims Bombardier received illegal support for its C-Series airliner, when the province of Quebec took a 1 billion dollar stake in the troubled programme. This support helped Bombardier to agree a mega order for 75 CS100s with Delta Airlines on April 28, 2016. Although\u00c2 Delta has 75 CS100 jets in order with an option for an additional 50 planes,\u00c2 expect the airline to switch some of its order to the larger CS300 down the road.\u00c2 With a range of more than 3,500 miles, the CS100 allows Delta to operate routes its smaller jets had not been able to reach before. The jets are expected to be based in New York and Los Angeles.\n \nDelta\u00c2 ordered the CS100 on April 28, 2016. They will enter service next spring. Image: Bombardier Bombardier has been a global leader in business and regional jets, but the C-Series is the first product from the Canadian manufacturer to compete against Boeing and Airbus in the mainline market. This was a major financial gamble for Bombardier, with a program price tag of 5.5 billion dollar. Since its inception more than 10 years ago, there has been a series of development delays and slow sales. Even as Bombardier struggled to close a sale, they were credited with building an aircraft that\u2019s one of the most capable on the market today in terms of efficiency and ability, besting Boeing and Airbus. With the Delta order, Bombardier has the blockbuster deal it needed to validate the attractiveness of the C-Series to other prospective buyers.\nAn interesting thing about the Boeing-Bombardier case is that Boeing hasn\u2019t really seen any influence by Delta\u2019s purchase of the C-Series. The jets are smaller than Boeing\u2019s smallest aircraft, the 737. They are simply targeting different markets.\nSo how does the Boeing-Bombardier battle relate to Airbus? Perhaps the U.S. giant doesn\u2019t want to see another potential competitor supported in the same way that has allowed Airbus to come from nothing in the seventies to being an equal rival today. Since the nineties Airbus has been a true rival for Boeing.\nSince then it seems like most people either love the American or European aircraft manufacturer. In my case I simply enjoy both Boeing and Airbus and I certainly believe the two largest aircraft manufacturers in the world will keep forcing one another to manufacture more and better quality aircraft, when you look at performance, fuel efficiency, comfort, and low-noise engines, like Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner, but also Airbus\u2019 A320neo and A350. As a\u00c2 result aviation will be soaring to new heights in the future.\nAnd now we also have the Bombardier CS100 and CS300 to enjoy.\u00c2 A magnificent and unique aircraft that will fly at more and more places around the globe in the years to come.\nThe post Bombardier\u2019s CS300 Celebrates First Year Of Service appeared first on Avgeekery.com - News and stories by Aviation Professionals

KC-46A Pegasus aerial refueling tanker took off from Paine Field at Boeing\u2019s plant at Everett in Washington. The flight lasted some three hours and thirty minutes, during which the two Boeing test pilots and crew climbed to 39,000 feet and executed the FAA-approved operational tests on the engines, flight controls, and environmental systems. After the flight the jet underwent post-flight instrumentation checks and inspections.\nOfficial US Air Force photograph All is not well with the KC-46 program though. Boeing had been committed to delivery of the first production variant of the new tanker to the United States Air Force (USAF) before the end of the 2017 calendar year. The expected delivery date has slipped to an as yet undetermined date in 2018. Six prototype KC-46As have been built and flown since September of 2015, accumulating more than 2,200 flight hours and 1,600 refueling transfers.\nOfficial US Air Force photograph The KC-46A prototypes have already passed gas to General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons , Boeing F/A-18 Hornets , Boeing AV-8B Harriers , Boeing C-17 Globemaster IIIs , Fairchild Republic A-10 Warthogs , and have passed gas to and received gas from Boeing KC-135R Stratotankers , Boeing KC-10 Extenders , and other KC-46 Pegasus prototypes. Testing with other current military aircraft such as Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptors , F-35 Lightning IIs , and Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirits has not yet been completed.\nOfficial US Air Force photograph The development of the KC-46A has been a political and fiscal soap opera right from the beginning. Without slogging into the painful details, suffice it to say that in this day and age it\u2019s highly unusual for a program to be as far off both schedule and expectations as the KC-46A program has been. But the jet can carry ten percent more fuel than the KC-135 and about 33 tons of cargo in a larger \u201cwide body\u201d fuselage. The new tanker also sports an advanced electronic flight instrumentation system (EFIS)-equipped flight deck by Rockwell-Collins.\nImage courtesy Rockwell-Collins The Pegasus is equipped with dual wing-mounted drogue reel pods and a single rigid boom refueling system. This allows multiple simultaneous \u201cplugs\u201d of aircraft using the probe and drogue refueling method (primarily US Navy and Marines aircraft along with many foreign allied types) or refueling receptacles primarily used by the USAF. KC-46As are also equipped with infrared countermeasures along with defensive electronic warfare equipment. The jet can even be configured to carry 114 passengers or litter patients when pressed into service as a medical evacuation aircraft.\nOfficial US Air Force photograph There are two issues in particular that need to be sorted out. The rigid boom refueling arm has experienced several un-commanded extensions when aircraft receiving fuel have detached from it, which could cause damage to the receiving aircraft\u2019s skin surface- not good for any aircraft but especially for stealthy types. The KC-46\u2019s high frequency (HF) radio utilizes the aircraft\u2019s skin as an antenna, which can cause electrical arcing and sparking- not good for a tanker carrying tons of fuel at high altitude. Initial production aircraft may lack the wing-mounted drogue reel pods too.\nImage courtesy Boeing The total USAF buy of KC-46As is expected to be 179 airframes. Several foreign customers have expressed interest in the KC-46. Italy, Japan, and Colombia already operate tanker versions of the commercial 767-2XX airframe, with Japan and Brazil on the order books. The USAF KC-46As will replace the veteran Boeing KC-135E Stratotankers . The USAF has said that the KC-46A fleet will train at Altus Air Force Base (AFB) in Oklahoma. The first operational KC-46A units will be based at McConnell AFB in Kansas and Seymour-Johnson AFB in South Carolina along with Pease Air National Guard Base (ANGB) in New Hampshire. Eventually some ten to twelve bases will host KC-46A units.\nOfficial US Air Force photograph The post The Pegasus: The First Production KC-46A Tanker Has Flown appeared first on Avgeekery.com - News and stories by Aviation Professionals .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "boeing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "altus air force base", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boeing kc-135e stratotankers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us navy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usaf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boeing f/a-18 hornets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lockheed martin f-22 raptors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pegasus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seymour-johnson afb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us air force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states air force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northrop grumman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "general dynamics f-16 fighting falcons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "efis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pease air national guard base", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcconnell afb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rockwell-collins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "colombia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paine field", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oklahoma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fairchild republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new hampshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "everett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south carolina", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:08:49.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f8725c6ab3c8ce84adf23c654d425cb9055b9f6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrLy261h1DEZCzViK0mqtzfD9MsJ6lpg0qw3_.3nAiT1axVqwj1uU92F.RbJSZapHNXT5ojp9HfgRnYYTS6ddd4", "site_full": "tourainissime.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://tourainissime.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Tourainissime \u00c2\u0160", "title": "Mise \u0102 jour du 07/12/2017", "title_full": "Mise \u0102 jour du 07/12/2017", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f8725c6ab3c8ce84adf23c654d425cb9055b9f6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrLy261h1DEZCzViK0mqtzfD9MsJ6lpg0qw3_.3nAiT1axVqwj1uU92F.RbJSZapHNXT5ojp9HfgRnYYTS6ddd4", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Christian (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "Mise \u0102 jour du 07/12/2017", "text": "Chan\u0102\u00a7ay L'ancien presbyt\u0102\u00a8re (1765).

But many corporations pay far less, or nothing at all, because of the many tax loopholes and special breaks they enjoy. This report documents just how successful many Fortune 500 corporations have been at using loopholes and special breaks over the past eight years. As lawmakers look to reform the corporate tax code, this report shows that the focus of any overhaul should be on closing loopholes rather than on cutting tax rates.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note a key piece of this report\u2019s methodology. The report only includes corporations that were consistently profitable over the eight-year period from 2008 to 2015. In other words, if a firm had a loss in even one year, it is excluded from this report. By leaving out corporations that had losses (which means they wouldn\u2019t pay any tax), this report provides a straightforward picture of average effective tax rates paid by our nation\u2019s biggest and consistently profitable companies. Two hundred and fifty-eight Fortune 500 companies were consistently profitable in each of the eight years between 2008 and 2015. Most of these companies were included in our February 2014 report, The Sorry State of Corporate Taxes , which looked at the years 2008 through 2012. There are new companies in the report, including Netflix, which entered the Fortune 500 after 2013. In addition, some companies were excluded from the study because they lost money in 2013, 2014 or 2015.\u201d \nSome Key Findings: \u201cAs a group, the 258 corporations paid an effective federal income tax rate of 21.2 percent over the eight-year period, slightly over half the statutory 35 percent tax rate.\u201d \u201cEighteen of the corporations, including General Electric, International Paper, Priceline.com and PG&E, paid no federal income tax at all over the eight-year period. A fifth of the corporations (48) paid an effective tax rate of less than 10 percent over that period.\u201d \u201cOf those corporations in our sample with significant offshore profits, more than half paid higher corporate tax rates to foreign governments where they operate than they paid in the United States on their U.S. profits.\u201d \n\u201cThese findings refute the prevailing view inside the Beltway that America\u2019s corporate income tax is more burdensome than the corporate income taxes levied by other countries, and that this purported (but false) excess burden somehow makes the U.S. \u201cuncompetitive.\u201d \nOther Findings: \u201cOne hundred of the 258 companies (39 percent of them) paid zero or less in federal income taxes in at least one year from 2008 to 2015.\u201d \u201cThe sectors with the lowest effective corporate tax rates over the eight-year period were Utilities, Gas and Electric (3.1 percent), Industrial Machinery (11.4 percent), Telecommunications (11.5 percent), Oil, Gas, and Pipelines (11.6 percent), and Internet Services and Retailing (15.6 percent). Each of these industries paid, as a group, less than half the statutory 35 percent tax rate over this eight-year period.\u201d \u201cThe tax breaks claimed by these companies are highly concentrated in the hands of a few very large corporations. Just 25 companies claimed $286 billion in tax breaks over the eight years between 2008 and 2015. That\u2019s more than half the $527 billion in tax subsidies claimed by all of the 258 companies in our sample.\u201d \u201cFive companies \u2014 AT&T, Wells Fargo, J.P. Morgan Chase, Verizon, and IBM \u2014 enjoyed more than $130 billion in tax breaks during the eight-year period.\u201d \nRecommendations for Reform: \u201cCongress should repeal the rule allowing American multinational corporations to indefinitely \u201cdefer\u201d U.S. taxes on their offshore profits. This reform would effectively remove the tax incentive to shift profits and jobs overseas.\u201d \u201cLimit the ability of tech and other companies to use executive stock options to reduce their taxes by generating phantom \u201ccosts\u201d these companies never incur.\u201d \u201cHaving set \u201cbonus depreciation\u201d on a path toward expiration at the end of 2019, Congress should take the next step and repeal the rest of accelerated depreciation, too. At a minimum, lawmakers should resist calls to expand these tax breaks by allowing for the immediate expensing of capital investments.\u201d \u201cReinstate a strong corporate Alternative Minimum Tax that does the job it was originally designed to do.\u201d \u201cIncrease transparency by requiring country-by-country public disclosure of company financial information, including corporate income and tax payments, through filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\u201d \nINTRODUCTION \n\u201cFor the first time in more than three decades, comprehensive corporate tax restructuring is a serious possibility in Washington. Republican leaders in Congress and President Donald Trump have each put forward corporate tax plans that would cut the corporate tax rate by as much as half. This misguided consensus is largely the result of a long-term aggressive push by corporate lobbyists on Capitol Hill to reduce the federal corporate income tax rate, based on the claim that our corporate tax is uncompetitive and high compared to other developed nations.\u201d \n\u201cThis study takes a hard look at federal income taxes paid or not paid by 258 of America\u2019s largest and most profitable corporations in the eight years between 2008 and 2015 \u2014 and compares those tax payments to the foreign taxes that a multinational subset of these same companies pay on their activities in the rest of the world. The companies in our report are all from Fortune\u2019s annual list of America\u2019s 500 largest corporations, and all of them were profitable in the United States in each of the eight years analyzed. Over eight years, the 258 companies in our survey reported total pretax U.S. profits of more than $3.8 trillion.\u201d \n\u201cWhile the federal corporate tax law ostensibly requires big corporations to pay a 35 percent corporate income tax rate, the 258 corporations in our study on average paid slightly more than half that amount: 21.2 percent over the 2008 to 2015 period. Many companies paid far less, including 18 that paid nothing at all over the entire eight-year period.\u201d \n\u201cWe also find that for most of the multinationals in our survey \u2014 companies that engage in significant business both in the United States and abroad \u2014 the U.S. tax rates these companies paid are lower than the rates they faced abroad. More than half of the multinationals in our survey enjoyed lower U.S. tax rates on their U.S. profits than the foreign tax rates they paid on their foreign profits.\u201d \n\u201cThere is wide variation in tax rates paid by the companies surveyed. A quarter of the companies in this study paid effective federal income tax rates on their U.S. profits close to the full 35 percent official corporate tax rate. But almost one-fifth paid less than 10 percent. One hundred of these profitable companies found ways to zero out every last dime of their federal income tax in at least one year during the eight-year period.\u201d \n\u201cThere is plenty of blame to share for today\u2019s sad situation. Corporate apologists will correctly point out that loopholes and tax breaks that allow corporations to minimize or eliminate their income taxes are generally legal, and stem from laws passed over the years by Congress and signed by various presidents. But that does not mean that low-tax corporations bear no responsibility. The tax laws were not enacted in a vacuum; they were adopted in response to relentless corporate lobbying, threats and campaign support.\u201d \nThe good news is that the corporate income tax can be repaired. The parade of industry-specific and even company-specific tax breaks that weaken the corporate tax can \u2014 and should \u2014 be repealed. This includes tax giveaways as narrow as the NASCAR depreciation tax break and as broad as the manufacturing deduction. High-profile multinational corporations that have shifted hundreds of billions of their U.S. income into tax havens for tax purposes, without engaging in any meaningful activity in those tiny countries, will stop doing so if Congress acts to end indefinite deferral of U.S. taxes on their offshore profits. \u201d \n\u201cThis study is the latest in a series of comprehensive corporate tax reports by Citizens for Tax Justice and the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, beginning in 1984. Our most recent prior report, issued in 2014, covered corporate taxes in 2008 through 2012. The methodological appendix at the end of the study explains in more detail how we chose the companies and calculated their effective tax rates. The notes on specific companies beginning on page 56 add more details.\u201d \nWHO\u2019S PAYING CORPORATE TAXES \u2014 AND WHO\u2019S NOT \n\u201cOn paper at least, federal tax law requires corporations to pay 35 percent of their profits in federal income taxes. In fact, while some of the 258 corporations in this study did pay close to the 35 percent official tax rate, the vast majority paid considerably less. And some paid nothing at all. Over the eight years covered by this study, the average effective tax rate (that is, the percentage of U.S. pretax profits paid in federal corporate income taxes) for all 258 companies was only 21.2 percent.\u201d \nOverview: \n\u201cThe table on this page summarizes what the 258 companies paid (or didn\u2019t pay) in effective U.S. income tax rates on their pretax U.S. profits.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201c30 companies paid effective eight-year tax rates between zero and 10 percent. Their average effective tax rate was 6.9 percent.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cEven worse is that 18 companies paid less than 0 percent over the eight-year period. Their effective tax rate averaged -4 percent.\u201d \n\u2022\u201d 66 companies (about a quarter of the companies in this report), paid effective eight-year tax rates of more than 30 percent. Their average effective tax rate was 33.6 percent.\u201d \nA more detailed look: \n\u201cDuring the 2008-2015 period, eight-year effective tax rates for the 258 companies ranged from a low of -27.9 percent for PEPCO Holdings to a high of 47.3 percent for Molina Healthcare. Here are some startling statistics: \u201d \n\u2022\u201d 100 of the 258 companies paid zero or less in federal income taxes in at least one year from 2008 to 2015. Fifty-eight of these companies enjoyed multiple no-tax years, bringing the total number of no-tax years to 246. In the years they paid no income tax, these 100 companies earned $336 billion in pretax U.S. profits. But instead of paying $118 billion in federal income taxes, as the 35 percent corporate tax rate requires, these companies generated so many excess tax breaks that they reported negative taxes (often receiving tax rebate checks from the U.S. Treasury), totaling $32.1 billion. These companies\u2019 \u201cnegative tax rates\u201d mean that they made more after taxes than before taxes in those no-tax years.[1] \n\u2022 \u201c18 of these corporations paid less than nothing in aggregate federal income taxes over the 2008-15 period. These companies, whose pretax U.S. profits totaled $178 billion over the eight years, included: Pepco Holdings (\u201327.9%), PG&E (\u201314.5%), International Paper (-7.7%), Priceline.com (\u20134.4%), General Electric (\u20133.4%), and Ryder System (\u20132.7%).\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cIn 2015, 29 companies paid no federal income tax, and received $1.46 billion in tax rebates. In 2014, 28 companies paid no income tax, and received $1 billion in rebates. In 2013, 32 companies paid no income tax, and got $3.9 billion in rebates. (See Appendices with year-by-year results.)\u201d \n\u2022 \u201c83 of the 258 companies paid less than half the 35 percent statutory corporate tax rate for the eight-year period. And more than two-thirds of the companies, 181 of the 258, paid effective tax rates of less than half the 35 percent statutory corporate income tax rate in at least one of the eight years.\u201d \nTHE SIZE OF THE CORPORATE TAX SUBSIDIES \n\u201cOver the 2008 to 2015 period, the 258 companies earned more than $3.8 trillion in pretax profits in the United States. Had all of those profits been reported to the IRS and taxed at the statutory 35 percent corporate tax rate, then the 258 companies would have paid $1.3 billion in income taxes over the eight years. But instead, the companies as a group paid just more than 60 percent of that amount. The enormous amount they did not pay was due to hundreds of billions of dollars in tax subsidies that they enjoyed.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cTax subsidies for the 258 companies over the eight years totaled a staggering $527 billion, including $50 billion in 2008, $65 billion in 2009, $74 billion in 2010, $79 billion in 2011, $65 billion in 2012, $72 billion in 2013, $70 billion in 2014, and $52 billion in 2015. These amounts are the difference between what the companies would have paid if their tax bills equaled 35 percent of their profits and what they actually paid.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cMore than half of the total tax-subsidy dollars over the eight years \u2014 $286 billion \u2014 went to just 25 companies, each with more than $5.4 billion in tax subsidies.\u201d \n\u2022\u201d AT&T topped the list of corporate tax-subsidy recipients, with more than $38 billion in tax subsidies over the eight years.\u201d \n\u2022\u201d Other top tax subsidy recipients included Wells Fargo ($31.4 billion), J.P.Morgan Chase ($22.2 billion), Verizon ($21.1 billion), IBM ($17.8 billion), and Exxon Mobil ($12.9 billion).\u201d \nTAX RATES (AND SUBSIDIES) BY INDUSTRY \n\u201cThe effective tax rates in our study varied widely by industry. From 2008 to 2015, effective industry tax rates (for our 258 corporations) ranged from a low of 3.1 percent to a high of 32.7 percent.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cGas and electric utility companies enjoyed the lowest effective federal tax rate over the eight years, paying a tax rate of only 3.1 percent. This industry\u2019s taxes declined steadily over the eight years, from 12.8 percent in 2008 to1.8 percent in 2015. These results were largely driven by the ability of these companies to claim accelerated depreciation tax breaks on their capital investments. None of the 25 utilities in our sample paid more than half the 35 percent statutory tax rate during the 2008 to 2015 period.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cOther low-tax industries, paying less than half the statutory 35 percent tax rate over the entire 2008 to 2015 period, included: Industrial Machinery (11.4%), Telecommunications (11.5%), Oil, Gas & Pipelines (11.6%), and Internet Services & Retailing (15.6%).\u201d \n\u2022\u201d Only two of the industries surveyed paid an effective tax rate of 30 percent or more over the full eight-year period.\u201d \n\u201cEffective tax rates also varied widely within industries. For example, over the eight-year period, average tax rates on oil, gas & pipeline companies ranged from 1.2 percent for Oneok up to 33.3 percent for CVR Energy. Among aerospace and defense companies, eight-year effective tax rates ranged from a low of 5.4 percent for Boeing up to a high of 27 percent for General Dynamics. Pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly paid only 17 percent, while its competitor Biogen Idec paid 35.3 percent. In fact, as the detailed industry table starting on page 36 of this report illustrates, effective tax rates were widely divergent in almost every industry.\u201d \nThe difference in tax rates between companies, even within the same industry, demonstrates how loopholes in our tax code can create huge economic distortions by giving some companies a tax advantage over their competitors. \nTax Subsidies by Industry: \n\u201cWe also looked at the size of the total tax subsidies received by each industry for the 258 companies in our study. Among the notable findings:\u201d \n\u2022\u201d 55 percent of the total tax subsidies went to just four industries: financial, utilities, telecommunications, and oil, gas & pipelines \u2014 even though these companies only enjoyed 35.5 percent of the U.S. profits in our sample.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cOther industries receive a disproportionately small share of tax subsidies.

We have not yet come to any conclusion on these issues, but we are taking such allegations very seriously and are examining them in depth.\u201d\nBut the UN human rights chief, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, challenged the council, insisting that the possibility of genocide was real.\nZeid, a Jordanian prince, cited the longtime segregation, exclusion and discrimination faced by the Rohingya. He referred to allegations of killings by grenades, shootings at close range, stabbings and \u201cthe burning of houses with families inside.\u201d He noted that Rohingya see themselves as a distinct ethnic group.\n\u201cGiven all of this, can anyone rule out that elements of genocide may be present?\u201d Zeid asked. \u201cUltimately, this is a legal determination only a competent court can make.\u201d\n\u201cBut the concerns are extremely serious, and clearly call for access to be immediately granted for further verification,\u201d he added, decrying how Myanmar\u2019s government has rebuffed UN monitors.\nMyanmar\u2019s army began what it called \u201cclearance operations\u201d on Aug. 25 following an attack on police posts by Rohingya insurgents. Refugees arriving in Bangladesh said their homes were set on fire by soldiers and Buddhist mobs, and some reported being shot at by security forces.\nZeid said actions by Myanmar\u2019s government to \u201cdehumanize\u201d the Rohingya minority were likely to fan more violence and affect more communities across the region.\nMyanmar\u2019s ambassador in Geneva, Htin Lynn, denied any state efforts at \u201cdehumanization\u201d of the Rohingya, saying it \u201ccould be an act of extremist individuals.\u201d\n\u201cMy government is doing everything possible to deter these extremist acts,\u201d he said.\nWith his government in the spotlight, the ambassador said the priority should be on returning displaced people to Rakhine.\nZeid, however, said no repatriation of Rohingya to Myanmar should occur without \u201csustained human rights monitoring\u201d to ensure they can live safely.\nHe said Myanmar authorities had refused to give his office access to Rakhine, and that he had instead sent three teams to Bangladesh to monitor the situation and interview refugees.\nThe council\u2019s resolution broke little new ground other than calling for Zeid\u2019s office to report on Myanmar\u2019s cooperation with UN rights investigators.\nIt passed 33 to 3 \u2014 China, the Philippines and Burundi voted against it \u2014 with nine abstentions. Two delegations in the 47-member council were not present.\nIniyan Ilango of the group Forum Asia said the session, which was sought by Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh with the support of dozens of other countries, showed the widespread concern about the Rohingya.\n\u201cWhile this is welcome, there is more the body could have done,\u201d he said of the resolution, such as demanding safeguards for Rohingya who might return home under a repatriation deal between Bangladesh and Myanmar.\nIlango said the human rights council \u201cfailed to respond adequately\u201d to the unfolding crisis at its September session, and said it could do more \u201cin the face of one of the worst human rights tragedies of our times.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c2331c80577629d61c24129d5d6beeb5?s=70&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g", "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c2331c80577629d61c24129d5d6beeb5?s=140&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://www.egyptindependent.com/un-myanmars-rohingya-likely-faced-crimes-against-humanity/", "http://twitter.com/share?text=UN:"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zeid ra\u2019ad al-hussein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marzuki darusman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rohingya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilango", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iniyan ilango", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darusman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zeid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "htin lynn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "human rights council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buddhist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rohingya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forum asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "myanmar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bangladesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burundi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geneva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rakhine", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:08:51.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e6e07e2a8befa73a27e50d267da4863328e50789", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSSy6HxA3tYt7Wlh1YtVii2oM0BUMpjRIxSci9F7NvQNputSbIPXPU0BNEx5JtoWySRyAZfpxv4.g--", "site_full": "endsofastring.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://endsofastring.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Inside my Dream. \u2013 endsofastring", "title": "Inside my Dream.", "title_full": "Inside my Dream.", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e6e07e2a8befa73a27e50d267da4863328e50789", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSSy6HxA3tYt7Wlh1YtVii2oM0BUMpjRIxSci9F7NvQNputSbIPXPU0BNEx5JtoWySRyAZfpxv4.g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "endsofastring", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "Inside my Dream.", "text": "I was in Santorini, Greece..when I first saw him. And all I could think in my head was,\u201dWe\u2019re gonna be a movie\u201d.\nHe glanced at me, and then, uninterested, looked out at the Russian girl party who\u2019d arrived to join a cruise. A week long cruise, around Greece. This cruise was the reason I\u2019d come to Greece. It was my first solo trip. It had been going as I\u2019d thought and fantasized about since I was 15. I\u2019d secretly worked during college days, and hid that I was doing a part time job from each one of my friends. I\u2019d saved up the cash..and after that, begged mom to let me go. I needed time alone. I wanted to complete my bucket list, on which this cruise was number one.\nAs a teen, I\u2019d thought I would find my love on this cruise. The movies made me embroider my thoughts about a perfect man. This dream became such a part of me that it began haunting me. An Australian guy, my dreams would show me him. Having brown hair, and looks to die for, having a strong magnetic field around him, attracting girls as he\u2019d walk by. Smirking when he\u2019d know he got me. And then his laugh would blur. And I\u2019d wake up, horrified. Getting a stranger in my dream. I would panic how easily such a guy could destruct me.\nAll this while, I couldn\u2019t take off my eyes..that guy, standing right in front of me, had those eyes. They were the eyes I\u2019d seen in my dreams. I shrugged the thought off, thinking it to be my melodramatic effect when I see a hot guy. Then I thought about yesterday. The plan to Greece, it was all sudden. I\u2019d gotten a new phone number so only my mom could reach me, and know I was okay. I\u2019d left my phone back at home, thinking this to be a break..from life. So I could be myself, and leave everything away from mind, for a while. Suddenly, I felt something down. My anklets were making sounds. I saw, there was a cute dog playing with them, I felt happy to see it. It was strange how much I felt. Like I had all the emotions of the world, all the feelings dumped into one single person.\nI was laughing, looking at the furry dog. I bent down and tickled it a bit. It liked me. Then an attractive voice said,\u201dHis name is Hashtag.\u201d Trying to be cool, I said, \u201cHashtag cool\u201d. Then I looked up, and I froze. I couldn\u2019t see his face.

2025", "text": "Press release from: Persistence Market Research Ophthalmic laser is medical device that uses a laser beam source to target the ophthalmic cells to treat ophthalmic disorders. The laser is a source of directional, monochromatic, coherent light that is precisely focused onto a minor spot. This ophthalmic laser source is a suitable tool for several therapeutic procedures and clinical diagnostic procedures. Ophthalmic Laser is used for various ophthalmic disorders procedures such as retinal photocoagulation, laser trabeculoplasty, laser iridotomy, posterior capsulotomy, and cataract surgery. Ophthalmic laser systems consist of a laser cavity, laser module, cooling system, and laser pump that is coupled to a slit-lamp biomicroscope. Other laser-energy delivery systems include intraocular probes, indirect ophthalmoscopes, and interfaces for operating microscopes. The laser used in the ophthalmic device depends on the disease condition. For instance, green laser is usually used for photocoagulation in diabetic retinopathy.Report overview @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/ophthal... Technology advancements such as in optical coherence tomography, increases the accuracy of ophthalmic laser surgeries. In addition, this optical coherence tomography helps in analyzing the progression of retinal diseases through quantitative data to assess retinal abnormalities. Increasing prevalence of chronic disorders that includes ophthalmic disorders, growing initiatives for treatment of vision impairment, rising geriatric population with ophthalmic problems and increasing regulatory approvals for new products are some factors that are expected to boost the growth of the global ophthalmic lasers market. However, the high cost of ophthalmic laser therapies hampers the adoption among the end users and lack of skilled practitioners which are expected to restrain the growth of the global ophthalmic lasers market.The ophthalmic lasers market has been segmented by product type, by application, by end user and by geography. In terms of products, the ophthalmic lasers has been categorized into photo-disruption lasers, photo-coagulation lasers, and selective laser trabeculoplasty. The selective laser trabeculoplasty product segment is expected dominate the global ophthalmic lasers market in terms of value during the forecast period. Application segments include glaucoma surgery, diabetic retinopathy, cataract surgery, and other ophthalmic diseases. Cataract surgery and diabetic retinopathy application segment are expected to dominate the market in terms of value through 2024. End user for ophthalmic laser has been categorized into hospitals, ophthalmic clinics and ambulatory surgical centres. Hospital end user segment is the major market contributor for the global ophthalmic laser market owing to increase in the cataract surgery and glaucoma surgery. Request to sample report @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/13579 Geographically, North America accounts for a significant share in the market in terms of revenue for ophthalmic lasers owing to extensive research and development activities and early adoption of new technologies in the region. Presence of developed healthcare organization and promising government initiatives in implementing ophthalmic lasers in ophthalmic disease management and presence of reimbursement would further propel the ophthalmic lasers market growth during 2016-2024. Europe is estimated to be the second largest market in the global ophthalmic lasers due to increased ophthalmic diseases surgeries and implementation of high healthcare concerns in the region. Moreover, rising geriatric population with ophthalmic disorders enhance the market in the region. Asia Pacific is expected to increase at rapid pace in upcoming years owing to the improving healthcare infrastructure and the increasing patient awareness levels for ophthalmic laser treatment options. However, increasing number of hospitals and ophthalmic clinics in emerging economies such as China, and India are providing immense growth opportunities for the ophthalmic lasers market. Latin American countries such as Mexico and Brazil are expected to have considerable potential for driving the market growth due to increasing healthcare expenditure and evolving medical structure.The major players operating in this market include Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Novartis AG, Ellex Medical Lasers Ltd, Abbott Medical Optics, Inc, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Lumenis Ltd., Topcon Corporation, Nidek Co., Limited, Ziemer Ophthalmic Systems AG among other significant players worldwide.Buy now @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/13579 About UsPersistence Market Research (PMR) is a third-platform research firm.

At this very moment Bitcoin is about to break $15,000 a coin. The thing is that blows my mind the most is this big conversation was not that long ago just a few months. Bitcoin Started the year out at a price of around $1000.00. Folks invested at the beginning of the year who have held through now have made 15x in profit. \nI believe cryptocurrency and bitcoin will be and are becoming quickly the global currency of the future. The thing is technology is now moving at such a fast pace, where it once took years to see change, we have gone to months, weeks and now days. Every single day, growing fast hour by hour technology is expanding, new ideas are seeing the light, planting seed and sprouting jungles of information. \nSome people were expecting these huge spikes in bitcoin, but many didnt see it coming this fast, the growth hitting this quickly. Bitcoin is at the verge of Viral and soon to be on the tongue of near ever person alive. The change of the monetary system is a lot bigger than many people realize. When transactions are sent globally instantly the entire planet changes drastically. \nIts my thought we havent seen anything yet!

Spencer/Sherlock I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s friendship or slash I just find it fun. I\u2019ve read a few and I\u2019ve really enjoyed them.2.

We cannot solve our problems by making the same failed assumptions and repeating the same failed strategies of the past. Old challenges demand new approaches. \nMy announcement today marks the beginning of a new approach to conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. \nIn 1995, Congress adopted the Jerusalem Embassy Act, urging the federal government to relocate the American embassy to Jerusalem and to recognise that that city \u2014 and so importantly \u2014 is Israel\u2019s capital. This act passed Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and was reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago. \nYet, for over 20 years, every previous American president has exercised the law\u2019s waiver, refusing to move the US embassy to Jerusalem or to recognise Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital city. \nPresidents issued these waivers under the belief that delaying the recognition of Jerusalem would advance the cause of peace. \nSome say they lacked courage, but they made their best judgments based on facts as they understood them at the time. \nNevertheless, the record is in. \nAfter more than two decades of waivers, we are no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. It would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result. \nTherefore, I have determined that it is time to officially recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nWhile previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering. \nI\u2019ve judged this course of action to be in the best interests of the United States of America and the pursuit of peace between Israel and the Palestinians. \nThis is a long overdue step to advance the peace process and to work towards a lasting agreement. \nIsrael is a sovereign nation with the right like every other sovereign nation to determine its own capital. Acknowledging this as a fact is a necessary condition for achieving peace. \nIt was 70 years ago that the United States, under President Truman, recognised the State of Israel. Ever since then, Israel has made its capital in the city of Jerusalem \u2014 the capital the Jewish people established in ancient times. \nToday, Jerusalem is the seat of the modern Israeli government. It is the home of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, as well as the Israeli Supreme Court. It is the location of the official residence of the Prime Minister and the President. It is the headquarters of many government ministries. \nFor decades, visiting American presidents, secretaries of state, and military leaders have met their Israeli counterparts in Jerusalem, as I did on my trip to Israel earlier this year. \nJerusalem is not just the heart of three great religions, but it is now also the heart of one of the most successful democracies in the world. \nOver the past seven decades, the Israeli people have built a country where Jews, Muslims, and Christians, and people of all faiths are free to live and worship according to their conscience and according to their beliefs. \nJerusalem is today, and must remain, a place where Jews pray at the Western Wall, where Christians walk the Stations of the Cross, and where Muslims worship at Al-Aqsa Mosque. \nHowever, through all of these years, presidents representing the United States have declined to officially recognise Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. In fact, we have declined to acknowledge any Israeli capital at all. \nBut today, we finally acknowledge the obvious: that Jerusalem is Israel\u2019s capital. This is nothing more, or less, than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It\u2019s something that has to be done. \nThat is why, consistent with the Jerusalem Embassy Act, I am also directing the State Department to begin preparation to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. \nThis will immediately begin the process of hiring architects, engineers, and planners, so that a new embassy, when completed, will be a magnificent tribute to peace. \nIn making these announcements, I also want to make one point very clear: This decision is not intended, in any way, to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement. \nWe want an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians. \nWe are not taking a position of any final status issues, including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem, or the resolution of contested borders. Those questions are up to the parties involved. \nThe United States remains deeply committed to helping facilitate a peace agreement that is acceptable to both sides. I intend to do everything in my power to help forge such an agreement. \nWithout question, Jerusalem is one of the most sensitive issues in those talks. The United States would support a two-state solution if agreed to by both sides. \nIn the meantime, I call on all parties to maintain the status quo at Jerusalem\u2019s holy sites, including the Temple Mount, also known as Haram al-Sharif. \nAbove all, our greatest hope is for peace, the universal yearning in every human soul. With today\u2019s action, I reaffirm my administration\u2019s longstanding commitment to a future of peace and security for the region. \nThere will, of course, be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement. But we are confident that ultimately, as we work through these disagreements, we will arrive at a peace and a place far greater in understanding and cooperation. \nThis sacred city should call forth the best in humanity, lifting our sights to what it is possible; not pulling us back and down to the old fights that have become so totally predictable. \nPeace is never beyond the grasp of those willing to reach. \nSo today, we call for calm, for moderation, and for the voices of tolerance to prevail over the purveyors of hate. Our children should inherit our love, not our conflicts. \nI repeat the message I delivered at the historic and extraordinary summit in Saudi Arabia earlier this year: The Middle East is a region rich with culture, spirit, and history. Its people are brilliant, proud, and diverse, vibrant and strong. \nBut the incredible future awaiting this region is held at bay by bloodshed, ignorance, and terror. \nVice President Pence will travel to the region in the coming days to reaffirm our commitment to work with partners throughout the Middle East to defeat radicalism that threatens the hopes and dreams of future generations. \nIt is time for the many who desire peace to expel the extremists from their midst. It is time for all civilized nations, and people, to respond to disagreement with reasoned debate \u2014 not violence. \nAnd it is time for young and moderate voices all across the Middle East to claim for themselves a bright and beautiful future. \nSo today, let us rededicate ourselves to a path of mutual understanding and respect. Let us rethink old assumptions and open our hearts and minds to possible and possibilities. \nAnd finally, I ask the leaders of the region \u2014 political and religious; Israeli and Palestinian; Jewish and Christian and Muslim \u2014 to join us in the noble quest for lasting peace. \nThank you. God bless you. God bless Israel. God bless the Palestinians. And God bless the United States. Thank you very much. Thank you. \nDonald Trump is the US president. \nFull text of Donald Trump\u2019s speech on Jerusalem \u2013 AFP   7, 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "truman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haram al-sharif", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "afp follow on facebook print this post  here", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "knesset", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israeli supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "temple mount", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states of america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al-aqsa mosque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western wall", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:08:53.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "57e9064c9791c274d897ac2995fb158bf96c038c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkd6Ay60oCLGDgKA6tcjIqX3qZAZhb8sKUKbVBtV0V0Y_KsJJvAG7A4tp0p51zCRqS.eljHyyu8_3yOUwkjdwGor0LEWw_Zm.tw-", "site_full": "www.americanbankingnews.com", "site": "americanbankingnews.com", "site_section": "http://feeds2.feedburner.com/AmericanBankingNews", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "American Banking News", "title": "Reviewing Cidara Therapeutics (CDTX) and Its Rivals", "title_full": "Reviewing Cidara Therapeutics (CDTX) and Its Rivals", "published": "2017-12-07T10:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cidara-therapeutics-inc-logo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "57e9064c9791c274d897ac2995fb158bf96c038c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkd6Ay60oCLGDgKA6tcjIqX3qZAZhb8sKUKbVBtV0V0Y_KsJJvAG7A4tp0p51zCRqS.eljHyyu8_3yOUwkjdwGor0LEWw_Zm.tw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ABMN Staff", "published": "2017-12-07T10:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "Reviewing Cidara Therapeutics (CDTX) and Its Rivals", "text": "230 2.71 \nCidara Therapeutics currently has a consensus target price of $13.85, suggesting a potential upside of 78.71%.

Electro-diagnostics equipment are employed to study the electrical conduction or activity of muscle and nerve impulse. These devices help practitioners or physicians for their recommend diagnosis for patients such as myopathy, neuropathy, neuromuscular junction disorder, and plexopathy. Major electro-diagnostic study includes nerve conduction studies (NCS), somatosensory evoked potential studies (SSEPs), and electromyography (EMG). The study of nerve function is performed by NCS, which is done by the application of electrical impulses through electrodes placed on the skin. Electromyography is carried out by a small needle electrode which is inserted into various muscles of the body to reveal the status of the muscle\u2019s electrical activity.Report Overview and TOC @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/electro-diagnostics-ma...

These medications are prepared based on the practitioner\u2019s prescription wherein, the individual ingredients are mixed together as per the suggested dosage form, and strength. The trained pharmacists are approved to personalize the medicine for the patient meeting their specific needs such as strengths, dosage forms, flavors, and exclusion of ingredients for which the patient is allergic or sensitive. However, compounded drugs are not FDA approved, indicating that FDA does not inspect the safety and the effectiveness of these drugs. This responsibility is held by the state boards of pharmacy, who verify that the state-licensed pharmacies manufacture compound drugs comply with conditions of section 503A of the FDCA. For the purpose of inspection, compounding pharmacies are segmented into sterile and non-sterile facilities. Report Overview and TOC @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/compounding-pharmacy-m... The growing patent expiries is one of the primary growth driving factor in the compounding pharmacy market. The shortage of drugs in the U.S. as reported by the U.S. FDA and also the similar shortages globally; the various advantages of compounding drugs such as the customization according to the patients\u2019 needs contribute to the growth of the market. However, lack of efficient regulations in place in various regions, might lead to adulterated drugs being sold in the market, which might negatively impact the market. The compounding pharmacy market can be segmented on the basis of product type, therapeutic area, distribution channel, and region. On the basis of product type, the compounding pharmacy market can be segmented into oral medications, topical medications, suppositories, and others. The oral medications can be further segmented into capsules, tablets, suspensions, lozenges, and others. The topical medications can be further segmented into creams, gels, ointments, and others. On the basis of therapeutic area, the market can be segmented into pain medications, hormone replacement therapies, dermatological applications, and others. On the basis of distribution channel, the market can be segmented into compounding pharmacies, and traditional stores. On the basis of product type, topical medications are anticipated to record significant growth in the forecast period, owing to the growing demand for dermatological applications and rising market for hormone replacement therapies. Request brochure @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag... Hormone replacement therapy is anticipated to be the growing application in the forecast period, owing to their growing application in the treatment of various diseases such as cancer, and also in maintaining the hormonal levels in menopause. On the basis of distribution channel, compounding pharmacy stores which are approved by state regulatory bodies are anticipated to record robust growth in the forecast period. Geographically, the market can be segmented into five regions, including North America, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Europe, and Middle East & Africa. North America was the leading region in the compounding pharmacy market. It is anticipated to be the highest revenue contributor in the forecast period.

Asia Pacific is anticipated to record highest CAGR growth in the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to the growing pharmaceutical awareness among people, increasing geriatric population, and expansion of infrastructural facilities, among others.

The Prime Minister said in his opening address,\u201cFirst, the Imperial House Council meeting held on December 1 decided on the view that the date of putting into effect the Special Measures Law on the Imperial Household Law, which will be the date of abdication of His Majesty the Emperor, should be April 30, 2019. Based on this view of the Imperial House Council, the Government will swiftly enact a cabinet order stipulating the day the Special Measures Law is to enter into effect. We will put forth every possible effort to ensure that the abdication of His Majesty the Emperor and the accession of His Highness the Crown Prince to the Imperial Throne takes place without incident amidst the good wishes of the Japanese people, and I ask for everyone\u2019s cooperation. Last week, North Korea conducted the launch of what is believed to be a new type of intercontinental range ballistic missile. The Government stayed fully abreast of the developments related to the missile and prepared for all possible contingencies as part of our crisis management. It is totally unacceptable that North Korea has conducted this outrageous act, in complete disregard of the strong and unanimous will of the international community to find a peaceful resolution. We immediately lodged a strong protest against North Korea, and together with the United States and the Republic of Korea (ROK), we requested the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to convene an emergency meeting. At the same time, I held telephone talks with President Trump and President Moon, respectively. We shared the view that we will further strengthen pressure on North Korea, encourage a greater role by China, and closely collaborate at the UNSC and other fora. In order to cause North Korea to change its policies, we will create a situation in which the international community unites through resolute diplomacy to step up the pressure on North Korea to the maximum, such that North Korea is the one that seeks dialogue. I confirmed with President Trump and President Moon that there is absolutely no change in this policy. This month, Japan assumed presidency of the UNSC. On December 15, we will hold a UNSC Ministerial Meeting on the North Korea issue. Japan will take the lead on initiatives in the international community through this kind of activity. Japan will not give in to any provocative action. We will step up the pressure to the maximum in collaboration with the international community. I am determined to continue to maintain a high level of vigilance and protect the lives and peaceful livelihoods of the people under the robust Japan-U.S. Alliance. We will carry out revolutions in productivity and human resources development to overcome one of the greatest challenges facing us, the declining birthrate and aging population. To that end, I would like to compile a new economic policy package as early as this week. Detailed reviews of this package are now under way by fully taking into account the proposals I received from the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan (LDP) and Komeito, respectively, on November 24. We are also working to formulate this fiscal year\u2019s supplementary budget and next fiscal year\u2019s budget toward the end of the year. We are furthermore approaching the finalization of the tax system reform. These are all work we cannot finish without discussions and deliberations in the ruling parties. For the first time in 16 years, the Japanese economy has seen growth for seven quarters in a row. I ask for the understanding and cooperation of the ruling parties in order to further ensure a firm growth trajectory of the economy, and make sure we exit deflation. In order to meet the commitments entrusted to us by the people of Japan in the last general election, I will implement and produce results on each of the policies we promised during the election, based on the strong coalition that has formed between the LDP and Komeito. I would like to ask for your continued cooperation on this.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "liaison mee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shinzo abe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "united nations security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal democratic party of japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "komeito", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "imperial house council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ldp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unsc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan-u.s. alliance", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republic of korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:08:55.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "af69f1bdab1c15e6b1538e4464e3ea091f0576cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWZbUob3tSExZGq_kXlRF8cFLZaRKI79odNth4eugL.zqNTbtcEUIj1i9RCT_5hGuudfO9H9LQ.oAvOLE.S3oRao", "site_full": "hotmusictvnetwork.com", "site": "hotmusictvnetwork.com", "site_section": "http://hotmusictvnetwork.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Hot Music TV Network", "title": "Dj Lui \u2013 New Electro & House Mix 2016 #26", "title_full": "Dj Lui \u2013 New Electro & House Mix 2016 #26", "published": "2017-12-07T01:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "af69f1bdab1c15e6b1538e4464e3ea091f0576cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWZbUob3tSExZGq_kXlRF8cFLZaRKI79odNth4eugL.zqNTbtcEUIj1i9RCT_5hGuudfO9H9LQ.oAvOLE.S3oRao", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Hot Music TV", "published": "2017-12-07T01:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "Dj Lui \u2013 New Electro & House Mix 2016 #26", "text": "Home \u00bb old school house music blog \u00bb Dj Lui \u2013 New Electro & House Mix 2016 #26 Dj Lui \u2013 New Electro & House Mix 2016 #26   old school house music blog December 6, 2017 0 1 Views \nHey Guys my Name is Daniel David im from Germany\u2026Hit that like Button if you enjoy \ud83d\ude42 More Mixes Comming soon\u2026 SUBSCRIBE for more!!!! \nNo Hate comments plizz im just a beginner \ud83d\ude42 \nLike my Pages: \nThank you for the Wallpaper Bro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PIV7nYtpNQoL3qkyL6DMA \nTracklist: \n01.

AP National News Video More>> More >> \nGRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) - A Michigan sports doctor is getting the first of three prison sentences that will likely keep him locked up for decades for assaulting female gymnasts and possessing child pornography. \nFederal prosecutors are seeking a 60-year sentence Thursday for Larry Nassar, who had more than 37,000 images of child porn on electronic devices. Separately, he'll be sentenced in state court in January for molesting gymnasts with his hands. \nNassar, 54, worked at Michigan State University and at USA Gymnastics, the Indianapolis-based group that trains Olympians. \n\"Underneath this veneer lurked a predator,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Sean Lewis said. \nOlympians Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney and Gabby Douglas say they were victims when Nassar worked for USA Gymnastics and accompanied them at workouts or international events. \nNassar is a \"monster\" who \"left scars on my psyche that may never go away,\" Maroney said in a letter to U.S. District Judge Janet Neff. \nIn a court filing, defense lawyers said Nassar \"deeply regrets the pain that he has caused the community.\" \nThe child pornography was discovered last year when Nassar was being investigated for assault. \nAside from the criminal cases, more than 100 women and girls are suing Nassar. Michigan State and USA Gymnastics are defendants in many of the lawsuits.

Some of the trending applications of facial injectable include facial rejuvenation and bio-engineering of the facial skin, raising scar depressions and many other. Even though the surgical rejuvenation has been the choice of treatment by people, surgeons now a days are preferring facial dermal fillers as a complementary to surgical procedures such as face lift.

A planning application would be required as part of the project in any event. \n\u201cThe Cabinet report gave authority for officers to progress key elements of the project so that subject to financial approval there would be no delays in implementation and delivering the improvements. \n\u201cThe planning application will not be considered until after full Council has made its decision and the call in process has been completed.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "helen dyke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigel knowles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcus hart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dyke", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kidderminster hub", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cabinet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kidderminster \u2018hub", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "town hall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aggborough", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kidderminster town hall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "green street", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:08:56.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e8d4ef101a576732d8989b856a98e2ae9c76aa6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhq6SKsx4lXFwV2cpxf1UI5jorip1NvAhd0X6J.1p25mkcYyVxksSM7OnXv2g5Tl2n6Q--", "site_full": "www.thestudentroom.co.uk", "site": "thestudentroom.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/forumdisplay.php?f=512", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Public sector -

empanelment for delivery of public cloud services by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology By Express Computer on December 7, 2017 \nAmazon Web Services (AWS) today announced that Amazon Internet Services Private Limited (AISPL), an Indian subsidiary of the Amazon Group which undertakes the resale and marketing of AWS Cloud services in India, has achieved full Cloud Service Provider (CSP) empanelment, and successfully completed the STQC (Standardization Testing and Quality Certification) audit from the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) for cloud services delivered from the AWS Asia Pacific (Mumbai) Region. This certification sees AISPL join a list of approved providers that meet pre-defined government standards of quality, availability, and security. With 52 global security certifications, attestations, assurance programs, and quality audits already achieved, such as ISO 9001, SOC1, SOC2, SOC3, and more, AWS is the first global cloud service provider to earn this status in India. \nStarting today, government customers can develop their own terms and conditions to procure AWS Cloud services. The empanelment process includes compliance with new global security standards and guidelines ISO 27017 and ISO 27018. For more information on the various security and compliance certifications that AWS has achieved, visit Amazon Compliance. \nMeitY advises government bodies and departments to procure cloud services only from the empaneled and audit-compliant CSPs. This includes departments under Central, State, and local Governments, Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs), autonomous institutions, statutory bodies, and Nationalized Banks within India who can now use AWS for their workloads. Government organizations can take advantage of the best-in-class technology from AWS Cloud to drive transformation, and to deliver highly innovative citizen-centric services at lower cost through flagship programs such as Digital India, Skill India, and Smart Cities. AWS offers fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, IoT, networking, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), and more, from 44 Availability Zones across 16 geographic regions globally. \n\u201cWe are pleased that AWS is the first cloud computing portfolio with true global scale to announce full empanelment by India\u2019s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. The Government of India has been driving the mission to promote e-Governance for empowering citizens, and enabling access to digital and cloud-enabled services for its nodal agencies and public sector organizations. The empanelment of the AWS Cloud is paving the way for innovation so that government bodies can serve citizens more effectively, achieve scientific breakthroughs, reach broader constituents, and invest more time and resources into their core missions,\u201d said Peter Moore, Regional Managing Director, Amazon Web Services, Public Sector \u2013 Asia Pacific based in AWS Singapore office. \u201cWe are excited to deepen our engagement with central, state, and local governments, and public sector bodies in India to offer them the broadest suite of cloud services, and a transformational approach to accelerate the deployment of digital services in the country.\u201d \nAWS public sector customers in India include Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), CSC e-Governance Services (set up by the Ministry of Electronics & IT), Gujarat Technical University, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), and Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati. \nQuality Council of India (QCI) is a non-profit autonomous society committed to promoting and protecting the interests of the nation and its citizens by propagating, adopting, and adhering to quality standards in all important spheres of activities. By using AWS, Quality Council of India has expedited the accreditation process of its various projects. \u201cWe chose AWS as the technology platform for their massive economies of scale, support for open standards, and highly secure infrastructure. We have been able to scale and simplify our accreditation processes by leveraging AWS and by using the breadth of their advanced cloud services like Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and many more. This has helped us greatly in our mission,\u201d said Dr. Ravi P. Singh, Secretary General, QCI. \u201cWe congratulate AISPL for completing the stringent STQC audit and becoming empaneled by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). The optimization that AWS Cloud provides has reduced costs, and boosted the security of data within India \u2013 which is one of the prime concerns for many of our clients. I am happy that what QCI started a few years ago has now been recognized by the government and its clients through this empanelment.\u201d \nEstablished in 1994, The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati is the sixth member of the IIT fraternity. Within a short period of time, IIT Guwahati has built world class infrastructure for carrying out advanced research, with state-of-the-art scientific and engineering instruments. Dr. Sethi\u2019s project research team leveraged GPU-based Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to develop a predictive model for prostate cancer recurrence in prostatectomy specimens. \u201cWe congratulate AISPL for completing STQC audit and becoming empaneled by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). Hyper-scale cloud platform such as AWS enables educational institutes to increase the speed of research, and reduce time-to-results by running high performance computing (HPC) in the cloud, and scaling to larger numbers of parallel tasks rapidly than would be practical in many on-premises environments,\u201d said Dr. Amit Sethi, Associate Professor, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati. \nThe Government of Andhra Pradesh (AP) has formed seven different \u2018Missions\u2019 to drive double-digit growth for the State, and to make AP among the most developed states in the country. The Knowledge and Skills Mission was created to provide trained and skilled manpower to all other Missions. \u201cThe Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) has been working with AISPL in its mission to provide a skilled workforce across high-priority and emerging sectors, fostering entrepreneurship and innovation. We congratulate AISPL for their empanelment with MeiTY, and for successfully completing the STQC audit,\u201d said Mr Ghanta Subbarao, Founder and Director of APSSDC. \nICT Academy is an initiative of the Government of India in collaboration with the State Governments and Industries. ICT Academy is a not-for-profit social enterprise, the first of its kind pioneer venture under the Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) model that endeavors to train higher education teachers and students to develop the next generation of teachers and industry-ready students. ICT Academy has been working with AISPL to provide AWS Cloud skills to several thousands of graduating youth among its member academic institutions across India. \u201dWe are happy that AWS Cloud has achieved the MeitY\u2019s empanelment, which enables us to accelerate AWS Cloud awareness and skill adoption across a larger number of youth in the country,\u201d said M. Sivakumar, Chief Executive Officer, ICT Academy. \n\u201cData Security Council of India (DSCI) appreciates the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology\u2019s (MeitY\u2019s) policy to promote cloud adoption in government by empaneling cloud service providers. This will help accelerate the migration of Government Departments and agencies to the cloud,\u201d said Rama Vedashree, CEO, Data Security Council of India. \u201cThe STQC Accreditation reassures users. Additionally, conformance to industry best practices and security standards fosters trust, and will fast track cloud adoption in India.\u201d \nSince the launch of AWS Asia Pacific (Mumbai) Region in June 2016, more than 120,000 active customers including Tata Motors, NDTV, Lupin, Future Group, and Shoppers Stop have adopted AWS Cloud for a broad range of applications such as e-governance applications, website hosting, big data analytics, mobile applications, e-commerce platforms, mission critical business applications such as SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft, among many other use cases. \nAmazon Internet Services Private Limited (AISPL), an Indian subsidiary of the Amazon Group which undertakes the resale and marketing of AWS Cloud services in India, as well as provision of training and other professional services for customers in India, has applied for and been granted the full empanelment from MeitY.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

In my opinion, with science especially biology practicing just helps you structure your answer, and may help you recall what you have done. However, with chemistry as well as knowledge there is a lot of calculations involved and with physics you may need to apply some mathematics formulas.

safety at Copcut Lane and Pulley Lane crossroads on A38 after two crashes in 10 days Show caption 4 comments \nFRESH calls for action to improve the safety of a stretch of road near Droitwich have been made after two crashes in 10 days. \nPolice were called to reports of a three-car collision on the A38 in Martin Hussingtree near the crossroads with Copcut Lane and Pulley Lane on November 24. \nA blue Toyota Aygo, a white Citroen DS3 and a black Skoda Oktavia were involved in the crash, with ambulance crews also on the scene. \nThis followed a crash on the same road between the junction with Copcut Lane and Pershore Lane on November 14. \nA spokeswoman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: one ambulance attended the latter incident and \u201ctreated a woman in her 20s who had sustained neck and back pain\u201d. \n\u201cShe was given pain relief before being immobilised and taken to Worcestershire Royal Hospital for further checks,\u201d she said. \nThe two crashes have once again raised questions about the potential levels of traffic on the road, once the controversial Yew Tree Hill development is completed. \nMatt Capewell wrote on Facebook : \u201cMore traffic equals more accidents but I suppose until there\u2019s a fatality the council and developers will continue to ignore the issue.\u201d \nPaul Smith added: \u201cEvery week now.\u201d \nThe scheme, which involves developers Persimmon, Barberry and Redrow, \nwill feature 500 homes, a 200-bed care unit facility, a community centre, cafe and other facilities in a village-style estate. \nThe new homes are being built on two sites \u2013 one on land at Pulley Lane, Newlands Road and Primsland Way, and the other north of Pulley Lane and Newland Lane. \nThe scheme has proved controversial from the beginning, with a public campaign to block it over infrastructure issues leading to the council refusing the scheme in 2013 before it was overturned at appeal. \nRichard Morris, Worcestershire county councillor representing Droitwich West, said: \u201c[WCC department for] Highways are working with the developers on that junction and the widening of Pulley Lane. \n\u201cI\u2019m fighting and pushing constantly, looking for solutions in terms of that crossroads and Pulley Lane. \n\u201cThere are concerns about increases in traffic once the houses are all built. \n\u201cThere will be a significant increase in the volume as the development increases. \n\u201cOf course, it is a main artery if the M5 is closed,\u201d he added.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

Let us provide him with information to say we want this done and so forth. Let us capitalise on this window so that we move forward as a nation,\u201d said Mr Muderedzwa. \n\u201cAll stakeholders need to engage and common dialogue is needed to achieve improved living standards for our people.\u201d \nHe acknowledged negative sentiments about the business environment in Zimbabwe and calls for reform by different stakeholders. The chair advised business associations to utilise Parliament to push their interests, which includes oversight on the executive and other public entities. \nHe said the informal sector in particular, deserved audience with Government as they are a major economic player and yet continue to be side-lined at policy and institutional levels. \nDuring the meeting informal cross border traders drawn from different countries in Sadc, accused governments of neglecting them as some accused state entities of harassment. \nThe informal traders said the tax regime in the region was harsh for their operations. They said they were not guaranteed of security at borders where they are exposed to robbery, corruption and harassment by officials and molestation of female traders. \n\u201cIf you have all these concerns, organise yourselves and petition Parliament, which will investigate these and take appropriate action. \n\u201cThis is one way of addressing your issues. Informal traders should not be harassed or molested. The police, immigration departments and others also need to reform in compliance with the new dispensation and improve public service,\u201d said Mr Muderedzwa. \nHe said his committee has begun engagement with relevant authorities to facilitate opening of more entry and exit points on the border for smooth movement of informal cross border traders. \n\u201cWe are saying why not establish informal cross border exit and entry points as part of the new dispensation. Zimra levies are also part of the discussion and we are keen to see your issues addressed. \n\u201cWhat is important is for you to come forward.

AP National News Video More>> \nBy TOM WITHERSAP Sports Writer \nCLEVELAND (AP) - The play is called \"Chicago,\" named after a game-winning shot LeBron James made in the playoffs to beat the Bulls. \nIt worked like a charm again in Cleveland. \nJames drained a 3-pointer with 15 seconds left and finished with 32 points as the Cavaliers tied a franchise record with their 13th straight win, 101-95 over the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday night. \nJames, who changed his sneakers three times, also had 11 rebounds and nine assists, helping the Cavs rally from a 14-point deficit in the third quarter to remain unbeaten since Nov. 11. His decisive 3-pointer in the final minute over JaKarr Sampson came after James went to the bench during a timeout and told coach Tyronn Lue to run a play for him. \n\"Was going to run a different play and then Bron said, 'I want Chicago.' So I said, 'OK,'\" Lue said. \"We got it to him and he made a big shot.\" \nAfter catching the inbounds pass, James took a dribble to his left and then stepped behind the line and knocked down his fifth 3-pointer. \n\"It felt good,\" said James, who finished 12 of 18 from the floor. \"I was able to get the laces where I wanted them and I got enough space, I created enough space with the step-back away from JaKarr and I was able to let it go. It felt good the whole time.\" \nCleveland, which also won 13 straight in the 2008-09 and 2009-10 seasons, will try to break the team record Friday at Indiana. \nThis one wasn't easy. The Kings gave the Cavs everything they had, but couldn't contain James in the clutch. That's been the case for nearly every team that has faced the three-time champion, who is shooting with a confidence rarely seen in his career. \n\"He's amazing,\" said Kyle Korver, who opened the fourth quarter with three straight 3-pointers to give Cleveland the lead. \"He's just demanding the ball. He's like, 'Give me the ball, we're about to win.' And, I've been around some guys who've had amazing years. I've been playing with him and Derrick (Rose) when he was MVP. Allen Iverson when I was young. \n\"But he's taken this to a whole new level. It's amazing to have a better than a front-row seat, because I'm usually on the court next to him somewhere. I'm glad he's on my team.\" \nZach Randolph had 18 points and 10 rebounds and Buddy Hield added 17 points for the Kings. Sampson grabbed 16 rebounds in his first start this season. \nWhile Cleveland's win streak is impressive, James said he won't consider anything special until the Cavs nearly double it. \n\"Twenty-five,\" he said when asked where the streak needs to get to before becoming significant. \"Because you're getting close to 33 (Lakers 1971-72), that's the all-time record. We ain't nowhere near close. We got close in Miami. We got to 27 and lost to Chicago.\" \nThanks to James and another Chicago, the Cavs roll on. \nROSE REFLECTS \nCavs guard Derrick Rose spoke to his teammates before the morning shootaround, two days after returning to the team from a self-imposed hiatus. Rose has been dealing with a sprained ankle and the 2011 NBA MVP's latest injury had him re-considering his future. \nLue didn't provide any specifics about Rose's comments, but said his teammates were glad to have him around again. \n\"It was just good to have him back and hear him talk because he's not a big talker,\" Lue said. \"He's a quiet guy. But just hearing what he had to say and then just seeing how everyone was welcoming him back and was happy he's here.\" \nSAMPSON START \nSampson, who was born in Cleveland and went to the same high school as James, didn't know he was starting until he arrived at the arena. Then he learned he was guarding James. \n\"I knew it was going to be a challenge,\" he said. \"I look at moments like this, it was fun. You want to make as few mistakes as possible, and make that guy work. LeBron's one of the best players in the league so you've got to make everything tough on him. That's what I tried to do, but we came up short.\" \nTIP-INS \nKings: G Frank Mason scored a season-high 15. ... C Willie Cauley-Stein (strained lower back) didn't play after getting hurt on Saturday against Milwaukee. Cauley-Stein is also expected to sit out Friday's game at New Orleans. \nCavaliers: F Tristan Thompson scrimmaged along with G Isaiah Thomas, who is nearing his debut with Cleveland after being sidelined with a hip injury. While it's still not clear when Thomas will play, Thompson, who has missed 17 games since Nov. 1 with a strained left calf, could be back in the floor in days. \"I'll be ready to return when the front office and them (the medical team) say I'm ready to return,\" Thompson said, purposely being vague. \"I gotta stay in my lane like LaVar Ball said.\" ... Cleveland has made at least 10 3-pointers in 13 straight games and scored at least 100 in 18 in a row. \nUP NEXT \nKings: Wrap up four-game trip at New Orleans on Friday. \nCavaliers: At Indiana on Friday.
