Yet to us, this man has crossed the line by collaborating with his political enemies of a few decades,\u201d he said. \nNajib had also accused the PPBM chairman of trying to safeguard his personal interests by joining the opposition camp. \n\u201cWhen will Najib feel enough is enough as far as Mahathir-bashing goes? There was nothing presidential about the Umno president\u2019s speech today,\u201d Zaid said. \nZaid, who was a minister under the Abdullah Badawi administration, also said there was nothing of substance presented during the general assembly so far. \n\u201cFor a party that dreams of being in power for another 1,000 years, it is bereft of anything remotely connected with lives of the people. \n\u201cNo economic and social policies both short and long term were put forward. Neither was any hopes raised for Malaysians to cling to (in Najib\u2019s speech today),\u201d he said. \nZaid, who is a DAP member, then called out Najib for his \u201ctacit approval\u201d of the \u201cviolence\u201d and other actions by some Umno leaders. \n\u201cAny president of Umno worth anything would feel embarrased by the violence and crass behaviour of leaders such as Noh Omar and Jamal Yunos. But there is not a word from Najib (against such behaviour). \n\u201cI believe such actions and more Mahathir-bashing will not end simply because Najib is insecure,\u201d Zaid said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zaid ibrahim", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "zaid", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "najib", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "razak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahathir mohamad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahathir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noh omar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamal yunos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdullah badawi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "umno", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "petaling jaya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umno general assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ppbm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "putra world trade centre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuala lumpur", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:03.033+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a75bd1d05161546987726bc0fcb82b8fb0f68aba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwrlKEagknWD2k4gGKhKwFCf27y01aD_KnXgarDqIF1_f22uQt7s3mH0DvSwG57FMQ-", "site_full": "forums.d2jsp.org", "site": "d2jsp.org", "site_section": "http://forums.d2jsp.org/forum.php?f=204", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Football &amp; Rugby - d2jsp Forum", "title": "Help Me Find My Fantasy Trophies", "title_full": "Help Me Find My Fantasy Trophies - d2jsp Topic", "published": "2017-12-07T02:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46006, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f93fc95a502fde0d3db7ce4f036a8e3410079a70", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwrlKEagknWD2k4gGKhKwFCf27y01aD_KnXgarDqIF1_f22uQt7s3mHvnYU6x44X2246RzMbIpKiA--", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "MilkMaid", "published": "2017-12-07T05:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Since you're all Pats fans, why not make the losers trophy have to do with Eli?

I want to surprise everyone this christmas with a winners & losers trophy!\nI need help finding the pieces for the trophy- preferable a statue, figurine, or premade trophy- which will be mounted on a base. I can take care of the plaques and base, but I want to find a nice and sizeable \"head piece\" for each trophy. I've been looking on amazon, ebay, etsy, and a bunch of other sites. Figured someone here might have experience. If I end up choosing your trophy I'll give you a nice fg reward. And don't worry, I'll be posting the finished pieces in this thread before the 25th, so you know I wont be cheating anybody.\nWINNER: \"The GOAT\" - I want to find a nice either wooden carved or bronzed or metallic Goat with a sexy rack of horns on it. This will be for the winner, since we are all pats fans, I think the \"goat\" is appropriate.\nLOSER: \"The Goodell\" - I want a clown. Think of the roger goodell clown nose that barstool sports did. Obviously, we won't be able to find exactly this. But a portrait of a clown or some type of clown statue that can be mounted on a base and will do just fine.\nReference pics:\nPrice range would be up to $100 per figure. Again, it doesn't have to be a complete trophy. As long as it is a nice statue, figurine, sculpture, carving or whatever, I can mount it to a base and get plaques on my own.\nIf you have any better ideas, suggest them, Thanks!\nThis post was edited by Zigity on Dec 6 2017 06:54pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://images.replacements.com/images/images2/china/C/P0000015364S0165T2.jpg", "http://www.skylightstudiosinc.com/wp-content/uploads/PA191038.jpg", "https://img1.etsystatic.com/218/0/6180084/il_570xN.1352281755_xbzd.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:04.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a75bd1d05161546987726bc0fcb82b8fb0f68aba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwrlKEagknWD2k4gGKhKwFCf27y01aD_KnXgarDqIF1_f22uQt7s3mH0DvSwG57FMQ-", "site_full": "forums.d2jsp.org", "site": "d2jsp.org", "site_section": "http://forums.d2jsp.org/forum.php?f=204", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Football &amp;

It said: 'On 10 October 2017, through no fault of the company, the company's then nominated adviser, ZAI Corporate Finance Limited had its status as a nominated adviser removed. 'As the company had not confirmed a replacement nominated adviser by 19 Oct 2017, AIM temporarily suspended trading in the company's shares. 'On the same day, the Ivrea Court in Turin, announced on its website, that it had found in favour of a petition by the Court Prosecutor to wind up Clear Leisure's Italian subsidiary, Mediapolis srl. 'Despite the original claim against Mediapolis, which triggered the petition having been settled by the company, the court, surprisingly, elected not only to continue with the petition but also found in favour of the prosecutor. 'Following this, on 21 Nov 2017, the company announced that having received and carefully studied the formal judgment, the Company and Mediapolis jointly appealed the Court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision. 'On 17 Nov 2017, the company was very pleased to announce that it had appointed SP Angel as nominated adviser and joint broker, as a consequence of which, trading in the company's ordinary shares recommenced on the same day.' Executive chairman and chief executive Francesco Gardin said: 'Since mid-May, following the winding up demand on Mediapolis by the Ivrea Court Prosecutor and more recently the loss of the licence by our former Nomad, with the urgent need to select and appoint a new Nomad, the company's Board has been forced to focus on a number of unexpected events. 'While this has inevitably consumed substantial time allocation and prioritisation on these matters, all other business has been carried out in parallel. 'We wish to thank our shareholders for their continuing patience and look forward to reporting further, positive results in 2018.'

He was offended and I felt ashamed. It was like as if I was trying to switch my fault on him. Well I went to the doctor finally and he said that most probably I had my skin damaged with some underwear made of artificial fiber that I wore on hot days and therefore got some micro wounds. Then some infection got into the skin and caused the warts to appear. He prescribed Podofilox and I started the treatment immediately. This medication is great! Helped me quickly and effectively. My boyfriend understood my problem and was no longer angry with me. And when the treatment course was over and all the genital warts were gone I decided never to wear synthetic underwear any more, only cotton panties.

We are all learning more than we care to know about the nature of human beings and the functions of morality. \nFor this, we are indebted to Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein, Louis C.K., Bill O'Reilly, Roy Moore, Al Franken, John Conyers, Matt Lauer and many others \u2014 notably, let us not forget, Donald Trump. \nSome of these names came as no great surprise, but other charges hit like a lightning bolt from a clear sky. If your daughter or sister is at risk of being molested by George H.W. Bush or Garrison Keillor, can we have confidence she'd be safe with Tom Hanks? Mitt Romney? The Dalai Lama? \nIn this teachable moment, some important lessons are new, at least to many men, such as: Women, who have made such great progress in so many areas, still endure soul-sapping abuses on a regular basis. It's a surprise to discover how many grotesque ways male offenders devise to torment their victims. \nBut much of what we have seen merely confirms truths that are so fundamental they can easily be forgotten. For example: \n1) Power corrupts. What almost every one of those implicated has in common is that success delivered him into a position where lesser mortals felt obliged to do his bidding. So rarely does anyone tell these titans \"no\" that they come to assume that no one has the right to. \n2) We often see what we want to see. Many Republicans who denounced Bill Clinton's lechery voted for Trump, who boasted about groping women and walking in on undressed beauty pageant contestants. Then there are the Democrats who apply far tighter standards today than when President Clinton was under siege. \nFor some of us, selective morality is the only morality. \n3) Shame is useful. Seeing the sudden immolation of important figures for their vile deeds, men who might be tempted to transgress will be frightened into propriety. \"There are several good protections against temptation,\" said Mark Twain, \"but the surest is cowardice.\" \n4) People are complicated. \"Today\" co-host Savannah Guthrie commended Lauer's accusers for coming forward but said, \"He is my dear, dear friend and my partner, and he is beloved by many, many people here.\" Maybe she's a hypocrite who let her relationship with him blind her (see point 2). Or maybe he has fine qualities \u2014 and concealed his terrible faults from many of those around him. \nDuring his public career, George H.W. Bush typically exhibited dignity and restraint. But now we learn he also pawed women who were in no position to object. Does that mean he's a complete fraud? Or does it mean he is afflicted by dark traits that sometimes overcome his better ones? \nCosby, Weinstein and Trump have severe, pervasive character defects that make their virtues, if any, immaterial. But unalloyed villainy is not the norm even among those who do bad things \u2014 and those of us who have refrained from doing those bad things should not be too certain of our invulnerability to vice. \nThe public disgrace of so many men should be welcomed because it signals an overdue shift in our moral codes and standards of conduct. Those are useful in guiding the bad, the good and everyone in between. \nSteve Chapman blogs at http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chapman.

Peck reviewed data available to those who subscribe to the NIC MAP client portal Wednesday in a blog post .\nOverall, CCRC occupancy hit a cyclical low in the second quarter of 2013, when the rate was 89.5%, she said. Since then, however, occupancy has been improving, although in the third quarter it was 20 basis points below the second-quarter high of 91.2%.\nRegarding types of communities, Peck said that not-for-profit CCRCs are leading for-profit communities when it comes to occupancy. In fact, the difference in rate between the two is near a recent high, she said, with the rate at not-for-profits at 92.3% versus 87.4% at for-profits.\nAnd although occupancy for CCRCs with entrance fees has hovered around 92% for the past eight quarters \u2014 and that's where it was in the third quarter, Peck said \u2014 occupancy at rental CCRCs is trending downward and was at 89.2% in the most recently completed quarter. The two types of communities are experiencing one of the widest gaps in occupancy recorded, she said.\nRental CCRCs saw negative inventory growth in the third quarter after two quarters of peak or near-peak levels. This community type has had only two quarters with positive annual absorption since the second quarter of 2015, Peck said.\n\u201cNegative growth is often a result of units being taken off line and may reflect units being combined into larger residences or shifted to assisted living,\u201d she said.\nRead the blog post here .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.nic.org/blog/ccrc-lpc-market-trends-3q2017/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lana peck", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ccrc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nic map", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national investment center for seniors housing & care", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccrcs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:07.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5be8eabc94c0dd0060c7d2a27d58803ddd2f6e80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2HT48I_PlzDc", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/co/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/co/ - Comics &amp; Cartoons - 4chan", "title": "/swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics", "title_full": "/co/ - /swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics & Cartoons - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T05:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 493, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "609ec070325e77c6ebb05d9880a96f3fe39be1c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2O8Y28vcGd_1DLTp7q5izGY-", "ord_in_thread": 471, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T12:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>97332828\n>I think it says a lot that Disney isn't even waiting for 8 to come out before saying they're doing something entirely unconnected to it and that'll be their main focus instead of 9 or saying they'll continue that era.\nIt certainly says something, but I can't puzzle out what.\nHappiness with Rian's work?
