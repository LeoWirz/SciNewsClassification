Received: 27 October 2017 / Revised: 28 November 2017 / Accepted: 4 December 2017 / Published: 7 December 2017 No Abstract With the rapid development of information technology in hotel booking context, it is no doubt that many hotels consequently enhance the needs of integrating information technologies into their overall business operations. In this study, we developed a research model which consists of perceived value, trust toward a third party online booking site, and trust toward hotels, and tested it by using partial least square techniques. Survey data were collected from 307 individuals who have prior experiences on making a reservation using third-party online booking sites. Based upon our findings, we found that the perceived value, which was affected by both price and quality, was positively related to individuals\u2019 intention to book. We also found that both trust toward third-party online booking sites and trust toward hotels, which was influenced by online review, have positive impacts on individuals\u2019 intention to book. The implications of these findings for both research and practice are discussed.

To explore this lack of engagement with health advice, we conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with pet rat owners and analysed them using a grounded theory approach. The findings from these interviews suggest that rat owners construct their pets as different from wild rats, and by elevating the rat to the status of a pet, the powerful associations that rats have with dirt and disease are removed. Removing the rat from the contaminated outside world moves their pet rat from being \u2018out of place\u2019 to \u2018in place\u2019. A concept of \u2018bounded purity\u2019 keeps the rat protected within the home, allowing owners to interact with their pet, safe in the knowledge that it is clean and disease-free. Additionally, owners constructed a \u2018hierarchy of purity\u2019 for their pets, and it is on this structure of disease and risk that owners base their behaviour, not conventional biomedical models of disease.

Received: 12 October 2017 / Revised: 3 December 2017 / Accepted: 4 December 2017 / Published: 7 December 2017 No Abstract The CH 4 -CO 2 replacement method has attracted global attention as a new promising method for methane hydrate exploitation. In the replacement process, the mechanical stabilities of CH 4 and CO 2 hydrate-bearing sediments have become problems requiring attention. In this paper, considering the hydrate characteristics and burial conditions of hydrate-bearing cores, sediments matrices were formed by a mixture of kaolin clay and quartz sand, and an experimental study was focused on the failure strength of CH 4 and CO 2 hydrate-bearing sediments under different conditions to verify the mechanical reliability of CH 4 -CO 2 replacement in permafrost-associated natural gas deposits. A series of triaxial shear tests were conducted on the CH 4 and CO 2 hydrate-bearing sediments under temperatures of \u221220, \u221210, and \u22125 \u00b0C, confining pressures of 2.5, 3.75, 5, 7.5, and 10 MPa, and a strain rate of 1.0 mm/min. The results indicated that the failure strength of the CO 2 hydrate-bearing sediments was higher than that of the CH 4 hydrate-bearing sediments under different confining pressures and temperatures; the failure strength of the CH 4 and CO 2 hydrate-bearing sediments increased with an increase in confining pressure at a low confining pressure state. Besides that, the failure strength of all hydrate-bearing sediments decreased with an increase in temperature; all the failure strengths of the CO 2 hydrate-bearing sediments were higher than those of the CH 4 hydrate-bearing sediments in different sediment matrices. The experiments proved that the hydrate-bearing sediments would be more stable than that before CH 4 -CO 2 replacement.

It's Wednesday night in Washington, and we're watching to see if House conservatives will agree to back a short-term government funding bill before the end of the week. \n\nTHE BIG STORY \nNet neutrality supporters are predicting that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will have a hard time defending its decision to repeal the landmark rules in court. \nThe agency, led by Republican Chairman Ajit Pai, will vote next week on scrapping the 2015 net neutrality rules, which prevent internet service providers from blocking or slowing down websites or creating internet \"fast lanes.\" \n\"The draft order seems to say that the FCC is no longer interested in exercising its responsibilities as an expert agency,\" Jonathan Sallet, a former FCC general counsel under the Obama administration, said in a call with reporters Wednesday. \n\"I do not believe a court of appeals will uphold this order,\" he added. \nWhy does this matter? Advocates are already preparing to go to court to challenge the ruling, which hasn't even happened yet. The rules have survived legal challenges in the two years since they've taken effect, and supporters are already promising to sue to try to overturn Pai's plan if it passes as expected. \nPai's rationale: Pai voted against the net neutrality rules as a minority member of the commission in 2015, and has since been arguing that they are too heavy-handed and stifle innovation. He's also made the case that web companies like Facebook and Google are bigger threats to internet freedom than the internet providers governed by the FCC rules. \nRead more from Harper Neidig here . \n\nON TAP FOR THURSDAY \nThe Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee holds a hearing to examine implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act, focusing on progress and the path forward for medical innovation. \nThe House Energy and Commerce environmental subcommittee holds a hearing on \"The Mission of the Environmental Protection Agency,\" with EPA chief Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott Pruitt Overnight Regulation: Net neutrality supporters predict tough court battle | Watchdog to investigate EPA chief's meeting with industry group | Ex-Volkswagen exec gets 7 years for emissions cheating Overnight Energy: Watchdog probes Pruitt speech to mining group | EPA chief promises to let climate scientists present their work | Volkswagen manager gets 7 years for emissions cheating Scott Pruitt's year of environmental destruction MORE testifying. \nThe House Committee on Natural Resources has a hearing: \"Transforming the Department of the Interior for the 21st Century\" \nThe House Homeland Security Committee holds a hearing on \"Examining the Department of Homeland Security's Efforts to Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction.\" \nThe House Oversight Committee has a hearing on \"Oversight of IT and Cybersecurity at the Department of Veterans Affairs\" \n\nREGULATORY ROUNDUP \nEnvironment: The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) inspector general said this week it will investigate Administrator Scott Pruitt's April meeting with a coal mining industry group. \nDemocrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee released a letter Wednesday from Inspector General Arthur Elkins Jr. that confirmed the office \"will review the single meeting between EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and the National Mining Association in April 2017.\" \nAn Office of the Inspector General spokesperson confirmed the letter to The Hill on Wednesday. \nPruitt met with the mining group in April and reportedly urged association members to tell President Trump to pull the United States out of the Paris climate deal. \nCritics of the meeting, including Democrats and liberal groups, say a request like that from a Cabinet member violates anti-lobbying laws for government officials. \nDevin Henry has the full story here . \n\nTransportation: The White House budget office is preparing for the possibility of a government shutdown as Republican leaders scramble to reach a funding deal by the end of this week. \nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB) officials held a conference call with federal agencies on Dec. 1 to ensure that they are planning for a potential funding lapse. Current money runs out midnight on Friday. \nSuch calls are required exactly one week before funding expires, OMB said, regardless of whether that scenario seems likely or not. \nMelanie Zanona has more here . \n\nCybersecurity: The House Science, Space and Technology Committee is pushing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to reveal which agencies have not fully complied with deadlines in a broad effort to identify and remove all Kaspersky Lab products from computers. \nLawmakers fear that Russian intelligence agencies have co-opted the Moscow-based firm's products in espionage operations. DHS ordered all agencies on Sept. 19 to identify Kaspersky products on their systems and develop a plan to remove them within 60 days. \nA DHS representative had testified at a Nov. 14 hearing before the committee that the vast majority of agencies were compliant with the directive, though some smaller agencies without the resources to search for Kaspersky products were unable to meet the deadline. \nJoe Uchill has the story here . \n\nEnvironment: California's Democratic attorney general slammed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Wednesday, accusing the agency of insufficient transparency and policies that hurt the state under President Trump. \nAt a National Press Club event in Washington, Xavier Becerra \n\"The issue of the administrator of the EPA refusing to provide documents under the Freedom of Information Act, as he is required by law, is, I believe, an absolute abuse of power and discretion,\" Becerra said. \nRead Timothy Cama's full story here . \n\nEnvironment: A former manager at Volkswagen was sentenced to 84 months in prison on Wednesday for his role in the company's emissions cheating scandal. \nOliver Schmidt, a German resident, pleaded guilty in August to charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States, commit wire fraud and violate the Clean Air Act. \nA federal judge on Wednesday ordered him to serve seven years in prison and pay a $400,000 fine for this role in connection with the emissions scandal. \nFederal officials in 2015 uncovered a Volkswagen effort to bypass emissions limits for hundreds of thousands of its diesel-fueled vehicles by installing software allowing them to emit more pollution than federal guidelines permit. \nDevin Henry has more here . \n\nElizabeth Ann Warren Overnight Regulation: Net neutrality supporters predict tough court battle | Watchdog to investigate EPA chief's meeting with industry group | Ex-Volkswagen exec gets 7 years for emissions cheating Overnight Tech: Net neutrality supporters predict tough court fight | Warren backs bid to block AT&T, Time Warner merger | NC county refuses to pay ransom to hackers Avalanche of Democratic senators say Franken should resign MORE (D-Mass.) says she supports the Department of Justice's lawsuit to block AT&T's merger with Time Warner. \nIn a speech Wednesday, Warren said the $85 billion proposed deal is the type of large merger that poses a threat to competition and consumers. \n\"By bringing together one of the nation's leading content distributors and one of the world's largest TV and entertainment companies, this merger invites higher prices, fewer choices and worse service for consumers,\" the Massachusetts senator said at an event with the left-wing think tank Open Markets Institute in Washington, D.C. \nBut she also expressed concerns about the DOJ's independence under President Trump. \n\"At the same time, the Justice Department's move rings alarm bells.

For the fourth year in a row, Berlin has topped the table of the 31 best European cities for real estate investment and development in 2018, according to a forecast published by the Urban Land Institute and PwC. \nThe annual \u2018Emerging Trends Europe' study ranks Europe's leading cities for overall investment and development prospects in 2018. With Berlin heading the list, Germany accounts for four of the top six leading cities, with Copenhagen (in a tie with Frankfurt for second place) and Madrid in fifth place. Munich came fourth and Hamburg sixth. \nThough values in the German capital have rocketed over the past year, the ULI and PwC researchers found that respondents believe the growth in Berlin is sustainable, supported by a rising population and a vibrant technology sector. \nThe survey of over 800 European real estate professionals also suggested that Copenhagen has been driven by a strong residential investment, while Madrid\u2019s office rental surge has been helped by Spain\u2019s 3% growth in gross domestic product. \nWith an improving macroeconomic outlook for the eurozone and less political instability, combined with real estate's continued attractiveness as an asset class, respondents were more optimistic than last year about their European business prospects. About half predict that profits and head-counts will increase next year, while 42% expect business confidence to increase, a 10% jump. \nEquity and debt are expected to be just as plentiful in 2018, despite the threat of rising interest rates, while this year\u2019s high levels of investment are forecast to continue. \nThe fact that German cities once again took four of the top 10 spots in the report's score card of prospects 'is no surprise' says the report\u2019s section discussing Markets to Watch. 'Germany has been steady state for a long time now. With Berlin, people truly believe it\u2019s going to become a major city', one respondent in the survey says. \nThe issue of Brexit looms large in respondents' outlooks, with one respondent quoted, \u201cThe UK has had a growth premium over Europe. That growth premium has gone now.\u201d Although few question London's long-term status as a destination for global capital, the report says, \"There is a strong consensus that it will be at least partly responsible for both investment and values falling in the UK during 2018.\" \nLondon came in 27 th on the list, and bottomed the rankings table, based on change expected in rents and capital values. It is the only city in the survey that is expected to depreciate in both areas. \nThe survey concluded that investors don\u2019t believe London will have too much to offer over the next couple of years, having reached the peak in asset pricing and rental values, despite remaining a safe haven for Asian investment. \nThe influence of technology is having a major impact on, particularly, logistics \u2013 again the Number 1 sector for investment and development prospects for 2018, based on the growth in online retail activity. Niche residential sectors, such as student housing, senior living and healthcare also feature strongly on investors' priorities for next year. \nAnother key trend from the survey is the rise of the flexible office sector and co-working - much more than simply property buzzwords but, as the interviews in the full study reveal, a workplace phenomenon whose influence has taken hold of the European industry in a profound way since last year\u2019s report. \n\u201cCollaboration between tenant and landlord will be more and more crucial,\u201d says one interviewee. \u201cThere will be more mobility and intelligent ways to book space. As landlords, we have to cater for that,\u201d says another. At the very least, co-working and the rapidly changing demands of occupiers are forcing the industry to confront the issue of obsolescence and, as one asset manager suggests, \u201cIt will be with the bigger buildings and landlords where the disruptive force is going to be more keenly felt.\" \nLooking like a loser is retail, with many respondents reporting how they are shying away from the sector, which is subject to long-term restructuring effects. Out-of-town shopping centres ranked last out of the 23 sectors which were ordered by their prospects next year; retail parks were placed 20th and city centre shopping centres came only slightly higher in 16th place. \nIn another important study, the annual LaSalle E-REGI Index 2017, Berlin was the city that made the highest leap upwards in the rankings in terms of investor sentiment. The E-REGI (European Regional Economic Growth Index) identifies the European regions and cities with the best economic growth prospects, by approximating the relative strength of future occupier demand for real estate in the medium term. The study's main focus is on the 100 major city-regions with more than 500,000 inhabitants and all national capitals. The study attaches a score to each region based on its medium-term economic growth prospects, its level of wealth and the quality of its business environment \u2013 relative to the European average. \nThe study this year identified four groups of cities across Europe \u2013 the Consistent , the Affluent , the Movers and the Aspiring . This is based on the performance of cities over the past 18 years of E-REGI history. As LaSalle stress, these groupings can have major implications for investment strategies across Europe. \nAlthough London regains top position from Paris, the outlook there remains hampered by Brexit uncertainties. Paris is next, based on its high Human Capital score and the reduction of uncertainty following Emmanuel Macron's election and decisive government majority. Stockholm, Istanbul, Dublin and Luxembourg follow. \nThe big German cities performed well, with the economy outpacing expectations, but capacity constraints including a shortage of skilled labour are holding it back from even better performance. Munich reached 7th position and Frankfurt moved up two places to 19th position. Berlin stands out as strongest improver in Germany reaching 13th position, its highest rank ever, on the back of an improving Human Capital score.

Received: 13 November 2017 / Revised: 30 November 2017 / Accepted: 2 December 2017 / Published: 7 December 2017 No Abstract Since the discovery of the anti-diabetic effects of zinc (Zn) complex, we synthesized several Zn complexes and evaluated their effects using the KKA y type 2 diabetes mouse model. Recently, we demonstrated that organo-chalcogen (sulfur and selenium) Zn complexes elicit strong anti-diabetic effects. In this study, we treated leptin-deficient ob/ob mice with organo-chalcogen Zn complexes, and evaluated the resulting anti-diabetic effects in a mouse model of diabetes arising from pathogenic mechanisms different from those in KKA y mice. C57BL/6J ob/ob mice orally received either bis (3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4(H)-pyran-4-thiono)Zn, [Zn(hmpt) 2 ] or bis (3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4(H)-pyran-4-seleno)Zn, [Zn(hmps) 2 ], daily for 28 days. Both Zn complexes elicited potent blood glucose-lowering effects and improved HbA1c values. Moreover, glucose intolerance improved as evidenced by the oral glucose tolerance test, and fasting plasma insulin levels decreased in both types of Zn complex-treated mice. Zn concentrations in the liver and pancreas of [Zn(hmpt) 2 ]-treated mice and in the pancreas of [Zn(hmps) 2 ]-treated mice were increased, respectively. The results suggest that the present Zn complexes mainly exerted an anti-diabetic effect in the liver or pancreas. This study is the first to demonstrate that potent Zn complexes elicit anti-diabetic effects in not only KKA y but also ob/ob mice via a normalizing effect on insulin secretion and fasting blood glucose levels.

Received: 23 November 2017 / Revised: 4 December 2017 / Accepted: 6 December 2017 / Published: 7 December 2017 No Abstract Here we present two cases of human infection with cowpox virus with distinct clinical courses. A series of clinical photographs documents lesion progression over time. In the first case\u2014an unvaccinated young veterinary assistant\u2014a pustule was treated locally with cortisone. The lesion turned into a large ulcer accompanied by severe lymphadenitis. Based on her close contact to a sick stray cat, infection with cowpox virus was assumed and confirmed by virus isolation, PCR, and serology. The clinical course took up to eleven months until healing of the wound was complete. Transmission of cowpox virus from the cat was likely because a skin swab was PCR-positive and the cat had a high titer of anti-orthopoxvirus antibodies. In contrast, a rather mild clinical course of cowpox was confirmed in a 49-year-old male farmer vaccinated against smallpox. Only a small eschar developed, and wound closure was complete after 6 weeks.

Jackson is set to release his debut EP  No Fear  on  Friday, February 2, 2018 . David Hanley , Founder and President of Dream Label Group/Dream Records states,  \u201cWe at DREAM could not be more excited about the signing of Restine Jackson. We are also honored to serve the incredible vision & ministry of Restine Jackson. We pray that many lives will be reached through this amazing project! Watch for many exciting upcoming releases in the future from Dream Gospel & The Platform Agency!\u201d Jackson\u2019s story begins in the Motor City, the birthplace of Motown. His love affair with music started at his father\u2019s church, where he began playing at the age of 4. His multiple musical talents were hard to ignore and he studied classical piano and honed his impressive vocal skills. He became an instrumentalist extraordinaire, proficient with the organ, keyboards, drums, guitar, as well as the piano. Later he morphed into a phenomenal songwriter, producer, music composer and choir director. During his time as a student at Sherwood High School in Sandy Spring, MD, he was recognized for his talents when he won the Gold Medal in Music Composition at the NAACP\u2019s ACT-SO Competition. As the head of  Restine Jackson & Grace , he\u2019s appeared in concert with top names including  Mary Mary ,  Yolanda Adams ,  Vickie Winans ,  Ricky Dillard & New G ,  Deitrick Haddon & The Voices of Unity  and many others. Many were introduced to this musical sensation on television shows like BET\u2019s  Teen Summit  and  Bobby Jones Gospel . It\u2019s no surprise that this Morgan State University graduate is igniting the Gospel music industry with his contemporary, yet diverse style of praise and worship. His captivating musical impact will be felt on his forthcoming EP release. His relevant approach to today\u2019s generation is apparent in his previous projects, all on his late father\u2019s record label, Wondrous World Records ,including his debut  Brighter Day ,  Praise Party \u2013 Live In D.C. , which spawned the national radio hit, \u201cI Command My Soul To Bless The Lord,\u201d followed by  Restine Jackson \u2013 Live at Living Waters  and  I\u2019m Free . Music has been at the center of much of what Restine does and he\u2019s been inspired by all genres of music. But for this man of God, it\u2019s Gospel music that\u2019s closest to his heart. Urban One\u2019s DC\u2019s Praise 104.1 FM radio announcer  Cheryl Jackson  states,  \u201cRestine has always had a fresh and unique approach to sharing the gospel in music. His forthcoming new music adds maturity to this winning combination!\u201d About Dream Label Group: DREAM RECORDS | DREAM LABEL GROUP was founded in 2008 to provide artists with a genuine approach to how real artist development should be done.
