Inaugurating the Ambedkar International Centre here a day after the nation observed his December 6 death anniversary, Modi said the government had realized Baba Saheb's dream of an inclusive India that gives equal opportunities to every citizen irrespective of caste, creed and faith. Read: A question of faith as Rahul Gandhi visits Gujarat's Somnath temple \"You will be surprised to know that some 60 per cent beneficiaries of the government's self-employment loan scheme that transformed the meaning of jobs in the country are Dalits, backwards and tribals. Till now, some 9.75 crore loan (applications) have been accepted and people have been given credits worth over Rs 4 lakh crore,\" Modi said. \"Political parties who have been seeking votes in the name of Babasahib won't even know that. Anyway, such people nowadays cannot remember Baba Saheb but are seeing Baba Bolenath,\" he said, apparently referring to the political row kicked by Gandhi's visit to the famous Somnath temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, in Gujarat. \"Attempts to erase Baba Saheb Ambedkar's role failed, he has been more influential in the minds of people, much more than the family (Gandhi family) for which all this was done,\" he added. Ahead of the Gujarat assembly polls, Gandhi's visit to the temple hogged headlines last week as BJP supporters on social media accused the Congress leader of lying about being a devotee of Lord Shiva after it was reported that he had registered as a non-Hindu in the temple. Even the BJP sought clarification from him. \"Why should there be a secretive air around Rahul Gandhi? He is one of the most important political persons in the Indian scenario. For Rahul Gandhi and Congress, religion is a matter of convenience and not devotion. Rahul Gandhi must answer this,\" said the BJP's Sambit Patra. At the inauguration of the Ambedkar centre, the prime minister said his vision of New India by 2022 was the one \"Ambedkar had dreamed about\". \"Everyone with get equal opportunities, equal rights. An India free from the shackles of casteism. An India that moves ahead with the power of technology. An inclusive India that moves ahead with all and developes with all.\" He said centre for Socio Economic Transformation was also a part of this vision and \"will be an important centre for research on social and economic issues and will function as a think-tank for inclusive growth, and related socio-economic matters\". The Prime Minister said the country was indebted to Ambedkar for his contributions to nation-building. \"The government wants more and more people, and especially the youth, to learn about his vision and ideas.\" Quoting from Ambedkar's address to the Constituent Assembly in December 1946, the Prime Minister said despite his struggles, the author of India's constitution had an inspirational vision for the nation to overcome its problems. \"We have still not been able to fulfil the vision of Ambedkar. Today's generation has the capability and the potential to eradicate social evils. We should make our political democracy, a social democracy as well. \"Over the last three to three and a half years, the union government has worked towards fulfilling this vision of social democracy. Initiatives taken by the Government include Jan Dhan Yojana, Ujjwala Yojana, Swachh Bharat Mission, insurance schemes, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and the recently launched Saubhagya Yojana.

Loss of ATP13A2 function causes a combination of lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction that affects multiple neuronal populations. This study expands the clinical spectrum of ATP13A2-associated neurological disorders from HSP to juvenile-onset Parkinsonism. Estrada-Cuzcano et al., Brain 2017 #Mitochondrial DNA #Genome Architecture #Plant Growth In addition to the nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts in plant cells also contain genomes. Recently, Jonas Blomme of the Dirk Inz\u00e9 Lab (VIB-UGent Center for Plant Systems Biology) discovered a new protein associated with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in Arabidopsis, namely SWIB5. This protein influences mtDNA architecture and homologous recombination both under normal and genotoxic conditions. Gene expression and mutant phenotypic analysis suggests a link between organellar genome maintenance and cell proliferation. Blomme et al., Plant Cell 2017 #Tau #Presynaptic function Lujia Zhou and Joe McInnes of the Patrik Verstreken Lab (VIB-KU Leuven Center for Brain & Disease Research) showed that pathogenic Tau binds to synaptic vesicles via its N-terminal domain and interferes with presynaptic function. Pathological Tau mutants lacking the vesicle binding domain still localize to the presynaptic compartment but do not impair synaptic function in fly neurons. This presynaptic role of Tau may be important in the early phases of pathology in various Tauopathies and could be exploited therapeutically.Zhou et al., Nature Communications 2017 #Phosphorylation #Aurora #Microtubule bundling The multiple functions of the highly conserved Aurora kinases are determined by the wide variety of their substrates. Joanna Boruc of the Daniel Van Damme Lab (VIB-UGent Center for Plant Systems Biology) identified the microtubule bundling protein MAP65-1/PRC1/Ase1 as one of the first genuine plant Aurora substrates. Phosphorylation of MAP65-1 by Aurora affects cell division timing in plants via the regulation of its microtubule bundling capacity in concert with other mitotic kinases. Boruc et al., Plant Physiology 2016 #Y-secretase #Amyloid #Alzheimer A team led by Luc\u00eda Ch\u00e1vez Guti\u00e9rrez and Bart De Strooper (VIB-KU Leuven Center for Brain & Disease Research) showed that familial Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) mutations in PSEN or APP destabilize the interaction between \u03b3-secretase and APP, thereby promoting the generation of longer A\u03b2 peptides. Similarly, destabilization of complexes by temperature or detergent promotes the release of longer, more amyloidogenic A\u03b2. This work suggests that environmental factors may increase AD risk, and provides the theoretical basis for the development of \u03b3-secretase/substrate-stabilizing compounds for the prevention of AD. This research also attracted the attention of our national television. Szaruga et al., Cell 2017 #N-terminal proteomics #Proteogenomics #Ribosome profiling Proteogenomics is an emerging interdisciplinary research field where proteomics is used to discover unannotated proteincoding genome regions. Making use of N-terminal proteomic data, together with Petra Van Damme of the Kris Gevaert Lab (VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology), Patrick Willems of the Frank Van Breusegem Lab (VIB-UGent Center for Plant Systems Biology) reported the discovery of novel proteoforms in Arabidopsis thaliana. By performing ribosome footprinting on the same samples, additional support of translation was obtained. The proposed N-terminal proteogenomic pipeline can facilitate the discovery of translational initiation sites in any genome, thereby aiding genome annotation. Willems et al., Molecular & Cellular Proteomics 2017 #Alzheimer\u2019s disease #ABCA7 #Nanopore sequencing The ABCA7 gene is a recently discovered and important risk factor of late-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Particularly protein truncating mutations are directly involved in the pathogenesis. With the use of long-read Oxford Nanopore sequencing, the lab of Kristel Sleegers, part of the Christine Van Broeckhoven research group (VIB-UAntwerp Center for Molecular Neurology) identified novel alternative splicing in ABCA7 mutation carriers. These splicing events have the ability to mitigate the deleterious effects of ABCA7 mutations, which can be potentially harnessed towards a cure of AD. De Roeck et al., Acta Neuropathol 2017 #Protein-protein interaction #MAPPI-DAT #Data analysis MAPPI-DAT is an automated data management and analysis software, developed as a collaboration between Surya Gupta of the Lennart Martens Lab and the Jan Tavernier Lab (both of the VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology). MAPPI-DAT provides an end user-oriented, user-friendly means to handle high-throughput protein-protein interaction data from highly parallel MAPPIT cell microarray experiments. MAPPI-DAT storesthe acquired data alongside the experimental meta data, and automates the processing of this data to obtain a final list of true positive interactors. Gupta et al., Bioinformatics 2017 #Inflammation #Myocardial Infarction #Dendritic Cells Peripheral tolerance is crucial for avoiding activation of selfreactive T cells to self-antigens. Sterile tissue injury can break peripheral tolerance, but it is unclear how autoreactive T cells get activated.Katrien Van der Borght of the Bart Lambrecht and Hamida Hammad Lab (VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research) demonstrate that myocardial infarction induces the priming of Th1/Th17 autoreactive CD4+ T cells specific for cardiac selfantigen \u03b1-myosin in the heart-draining lymph node through the maturation and migration of conventional dendritic cells type 2 (cDC2). Autoreactive T cell activation may initiate cardiacautoimmunity and promote adverse cardiac remodeling. Van der Borght et al., Cell Reports 2017 #Retrosplenial cortex #Hippocampus #Place cell activity Researchers of the Vincent Bonin Lab (NERF - imec, KU Leuven and VIB) and the McNaughton Lab (Colorado State University) discovered place-cell-like activity in the retrosplenial cortex. Hippocampal place cells (important for spatial memory and navigation) have a sparse firing pattern, which maximizes information storage in memory networks. The retrosplenial cortex is closely connected with the hippocampus and has also been linked to spatial behavior. Combining genetic labeling of cortical neurons and highly sensitive live microscopy, the two areas were found to use similar neural codes, but their activity is driven by distinct environmental/behavioral factors. Mao et al., Nature Communications 2017 #Bacterial persistence #Structural biology #Toxin-antitoxin modules Toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules play an important role in the generation of bacterial persister cells, which are tolerant to several classes of antibiotics. While the ccdAB operon on the F plasmid of E. coli is a well-characterized TA module, its autoregulation processes remained poorly understood. Alexandra Vandervelde of the Remy Loris Lab and the Rouslan Efremov Lab (VIB-VUB Center for Structural Biology), together with the Jurij Lah Lab (University of Ljubljana), combined structural biology with biophysics and computational modeling to uncover the molecular mechanism underlying the ratio-dependent transcription regulation of this operon. This involves a unique repressing complex which spirals around the operator. Vandervelde et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 2017 #Odor localization Jos\u00e9 Esquivelzeta Rabell of the Sebastian Haesler Lab (NERF - imec, KU Leuven and VIB) developed a new method to measure the high-frequency respiration that characterizes the sniffing behavior of mice. Using infrared thermography, the team registered inhalation and exhalation patterns in a non-invasive manner and compared what happened when mice were presented with either novel or familiar smells. Mice actively orient their nostrils toward previously unexperienced smells at a remarkable speed: within the very first sniff. The anterior olfactory cortex, the first site of convergence between left and right olfactory inputs, plays a key role in the orientation process. Esquivelzeta Rabell et al., Current Biology 2017 #Amyloids #Ucleation #Curli Together with a team, Mike Sleutel of the Han Remaut Lab (VIB-VUB Center for Structural Biology) used a novel microscopy method to examine bacterial amyloid formation in real time.

CEO Klaus Sch\u00e4fer and CFO Christopher Delbr\u00fcck made the announcement during an investor event on Thursday. For the first time, earnings forecasts for 2018 have also been given: Despite the lapse of the earnings contribution of the disposed share in gas field Yuzhno Russkoye as well as the insurance payment for Berezovskaya 3 Uniper expects adjusted EBIT of between \u20ac0.8 and \u20ac1.1 billion. In addition, the company plans to increase the dividend by 25 percent for next year. For 2018, ~\u20ac310 million shall be distributed to shareholders, and \u20ac250 million shall be distributed for the current year, as already announced. If the supervisory board and the Annual General Meeting support the proposal, this would mean a dividend increase of 25 percent for the second time running. Until 2020 the dividend shall increase on average by 25 percent per year.\nUniper CEO Klaus Sch\u00e4fer: \"We are delivering on our promises. In its first two years, Uniper has reorganized its portfolio and the company as a whole. We've made the company more robust by lowering annual costs and by divesting ourselves of activities that aren't part of our core business. We've improved our cash flows. And recently we concluded the sale to OMV of our stake in the Siberian gas field Yuzhno Russkoye.\nUniper is ready for its next phase, during which we'll be directing our attention t o specific growth segments.\"\nUniper CFO Christopher Delbr\u00fcck: \"We have done everything we announced with respect to earnings performance and dividends and will continue to do so going forward. Uniper has demonstrated outstanding performance on the stock market and presents a great opportunity for investors. Our shareholders will be able to share in this positive trend by continuing to earn significant dividends. These should not only be paid out on a sustainable basis; they shall also increase on average by 25 percent per year through 2020. We will take advantage of any financial scope for new investments in a disciplined manner. We are still clearly aiming at a rating goal of\nBBB (flat).\"\nStrategic update concludes first phase of company restructuring\nThe update on the company's strategic direction released today is the result of a strategy process during which medium and long-term trends relevant to Uniper were analyzed and measured. It is possible to gauge numerous developments with a high degree of probability until the middle of the next decade. Uniper expects, for example, that the focus of European policy makers on climate goals will mean that security of supply will become a scarce commodity.\nAccording to CEO Klaus Sch\u00e4fer, Uniper's power plants, storages, pipelines, and trading positions could allow the company to profit considerably from this situation going forward. Its strong position in the gas industry, in particular, could provide the company with competitive advantages. Outside Europe, demand is growing for reliable and efficient supplies of energy as well as related services. By playing an active role in global energy trading, it will be possible to exploit price differences and trends in demand.\nKlaus Sch\u00e4fer: \" Despite continued focus on Europe, we will be paying close attention to the US and Asia in particular - more than we have previously. In all our activities, we want to make optimal use of the opportunities our portfolio presents and selectively expand on them. Growth will occur in an essentially organic fashion. The thorough analysis conducted as part of assessing our strategic direction also clearly showed us that Uniper as an independent enterprise with a strongly cross-linked and valuable portfolio is very well positioned and has excellent prospects vis-\u00e0-vis the competition.\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements based on current assumptions and forecasts made by Uniper SE management and other information currently available to Uniper. Various known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors could lead to material differences between the actual future results, financial situation, development or performance of the company and the estimates given here.

Indiatimes.com", "text": "Shivani Shrivastava December 07, 2017 The New Year is almost here and it\u2019s time to contemplate the year that was, right? So, before you start making the same old new resolutions for 2018, perhaps we could help you introspect and come up with a new bunch of resolutions. Here are a set of questions you need to ask yourself and once you are through, you would have answered 17 questions that\u2019ll help you be a better person in the coming year. Let\u2019s start, shall we? 1. Did you genuinely thank someone without having a second thought? 2. Did you manage to have a fancy schmancy dinner without feeling compelled to Instagram it? \nDaily Buzz 3. How often do you apologise for the mistakes you make, intentionally, unintentionally? 4. Do you love your job? \nGiphy 5. When was the last time you tried to make someone else happy with small or big gestures? 6. Do you worry about what others think about you? \nTenor 7. When did you take your last trip? 8. Have you ever helped a stranger in need? \nGiphy 9. When was the last time you dressed for yourself without seeking validation? 10. Do you have any photos on your phone that you clicked just for the purpose of being in the moment, and not for social media? \nGiphy 11. When was the last time you laughed, without any inhibitions? 12. Did you hold the door for someone, impulsively? \nImgur 13. Do you love yourself? 14. What\u2019s that one thing you\u2019d want to change about 2017? \nImgur 15. Did you try to fix a broken relationship? 16. What did you accomplish in 2017? \nTenor 17. Are you happy? So what we are saying is don\u2019t try to overhaul your life overnight. It doesn\u2019t work that way. Take baby steps and you\u2019ll see the changes yourself.

TranSlice Layout \u2013 Pixel Film Studios Effects \u2013 FCPX Transitions \nThis New Transition has 30 easy to use layouts. ALISO VIEJO, Calif. (PRWEB) December 07, 2017 Translice Layout from Pixel Film Studios allows users to transition from one scene to the next while displaying multiple media types. Translice Layout offers total control over frame color, transition timing, editable text, and much more. Translice Layout also allows the addition of text to display messages between shots. Translice Layout is designed for Final Cut Pro X versions 10.3.4 and newer. Translice Layout from Pixel Film Studios gives users the ability to transition from one scene to the next in a whole new way. Translice Layout includes 30 easy to use layouts designed for any media type. Creating multiple layouts within transitions has never been easier. Each Layout includes a kinetic style camera movement, text intro & exit animations, overlays, and more.. Translice Layout gives users multiple placeholders to apply media within each preset. FCPX users can apply still images into each Drop Zone for slide shows, or videos for interesting transitions. Every drop zone includes saturation controls, allowing the user to give each transition a classic black & white feel instantly. Translice Layout gives users two variations of each included preset. Every preset has a variation that includes Motion Blur for added realism, and one without for quicker render and export times. In addition, FCPX users also have the ability to place fully-editable text anywhere on-screen, displaying messages between each shot. Translice Layout is a transition tool built for Final Cut Pro X. As an FCPX transition tool, Translice Layout is simply applied between clips on the timeline, and stretched to the appropriate length. Each preset includes controls located in the FCPX inspector, in result, allowing users to have the ability to make further adjustments easily.

Read (Adds quotes) GAZA, Dec 7 (Reuters) - The powerful Palestinian Islamist group Hamas called on Thursday for a new uprising against Israel after U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. \u201cWe should call for and we should work on launching an intifada in the face of the Zionist enemy,\u201d Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said in a speech in Gaza. Haniyeh, elected the group\u2019s overall leader in May, urged Palestinians, Muslims and Arabs to hold rallies against the U.S decision on Friday, calling it a \u201cday of rage\u201d. \u201cLet December 8 be the first day of the intifada against the occupier,\u201d he said. Israel and the United States consider Hamas, which has fought three wars with Israel since 2007, a terrorist organisation. It does not recognise Israel\u2019s right to exist and its suicide bombings helped spearhead the last intifada, from 2000 to 2005. \u201cWe have given instruction to all Hamas members and to all its wings to be fully ready for any new instructions or orders that may be given to confront this strategic danger that threatens Jerusalem and threatens Palestine,\u201d said Haniyeh. \u201cUnited Jerusalem is Arab and Muslim, and it is the capital of the state of Palestine, all of Palestine,\u201d he said, referring to territory including Israel as well as the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Haniyeh called on Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to withdraw from peacemaking with Israel and on Arabs to boycott the Trump administration. \u201cIt should be announced that the so-called peace agreement was buried, once and for all, and that there is nothing called a partner for the Palestinians in peace,\u201d he said. Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, upsetting the Arab world and Western allies alike.

At the beginning of a weight loss journey it is easy to be enthusiastic, but after a few days or weeks you can lose motivation. What things make it easy for some people to lose weight and keep it off? How do these people lose weight so successfully? What is the trick?\n\nIn order to effectively drop pounds, you must first understand your goals. What do you want your weight loss to do for you? Do you want to drop a few sizes? Is a certain weight the one you are after? Is a healthy body your goal?\n\nCharting your progress can be a great way to remind yourself of the results you\u2019re getting, and stay motivated. Implement a weight loss diary in which you can record every food and beverage you consume. Before you go to bed each night, calculate your calories for the day to ensure that you are not taking in more than your recommended daily total. Record your weekly weight in the same journal. The use of a graph is a great visual motivator in your weight loss journal.\n\nMaking decisions about what to eat while you are hungry is not a wise choice. In order to avoid those last minute food decisions, you should plan what you are eating ahead of time and always have healthy snacks available. Bringing your own lunch from home will help you save money and eat healthier.\n\nIf losing weight is really important to you, then you need to focus on both diet and activity. Pick an activity you love and include it as part of your exercise routine. Whether you join a sports team, sign up for some dance lessons, or find ways to work out with friends, it\u2019s important to keep your workouts entertaining. Using creativity is a great way to help you achieve fitness goals.\n\nYou won\u2019t eat junk food if there isn\u2019t any in the house. If you want to control your unhealthy eating, ensure that your kitchen is stocked with healthy alternatives like fruits and veggies. Try to make fat-laden food choices as inaccessible as possible by making sure they are not in your house.\n\nNo one can lose weight for you. You will feel more at ease if you have the support of your friends and your family. Having a supportive network keeps you from losing focus or becoming upset, plus can give you a social way to enjoy healthy foods. Do not give in to the allure of the snack cake. Call on your friends for some motivation and inspiration when you are feeling insecure and need some help staying on track.\n\nClick Learn The Story ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:33.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2d5eef2f4213b1bd685999cd2955eb0540ba25b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7uRf5_gCYodY9FpGO8DR.Ok_YLuGmjyHrN.OR9ZTtWZ0lAMh.1RfeOVvbnTVAn.39fWGL1X1aum7wMl70YrsYC7bBPjVsicsd79NBoMyi4E3PtULx6A_ib", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/politics/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Political Talk | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "BREAKING: DOJ investigators have over 10,000 Strzok texts | Page 4", "title_full": "BREAKING: DOJ investigators have over 10,000 Strzok texts | Page 4 | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T06:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b92002c0716070dece60971be9f7fe9590d57f76", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7uRf5_gCYodY9FpGO8DR.Ok_YLuGmjyHrN.OR9ZTtWZ0lAMh.1RfeOVvbnTVAn.39fWGL1X1aum7wMl70YrsYC7bBPjVsicsd79NBoMyi4EzL6Dui9TXOnkQwxS..AzrI-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "alphaandomega", "published": "2017-12-07T06:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: :\nTranslation- 10,000 text messages discussing the wrongdoings of the Trump investigation and those that have been uncovered.\nActually the more important thing to consider is the texts he had that were sent by someone else (received by him) and what kind of bias do they have?

We express strong dissatisfaction and opposition,\u201d said Zhang Shuili, a senior military official in China\u2019s western battle zone command, according to a Defence Ministry statement. \u201cChina\u2019s border defence forces took a professional and responsible attitude in conducting an inspection of the device,\u201d Zhang said, adding that the military would resolutely defend national sovereignty and security. It said only that the drone crashed in \u201crecent days\u201d and did not give a location. China and India have tried to develop two-way ties in recent years but there is still deep distrust over the border dispute. In June, July and August, Indian and Chinese troops had been confronting each other at the Doklam plateau near the borders of India, its ally Bhutan and China in the most serious and prolonged standoff in decades. The two sides agreed to an \u201cexpeditious disengagement\u201d of troops there about a week before Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met in an effort to mend ties at a summit hosted by China in September. In November, China criticised a visit by Indian President Ram Nath Kovind to the remote state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims, saying China opposed any activities by Indian leaders in disputed areas.

FILE PHOTO - Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev visit the Resurrection New Jerusalem Monastery at Istra, outside Moscow, Russia November 15, 2017. Sputnik/Alexei Nikolsky/Kremlin via REUTERS Medvedev was referring to a March presidential election in which incumbent Vladimir Putin is standing for re-election. \u201cThis is politics,\u201d said Medvedev, in comments broadcast on state television. \u201cThe decision was made in the run-up to the presidential elections in our country, aiming to create a certain mood in our society. Abroad, they understand very well the importance attached in our country to high achievement in sports. For millions of our people, the decision was a heavy blow.\u201d Medvedev, addressing the government, said that allegations that Russia had run a state-sponsored doping programme were \u201can outright lie.\u201d Medvedev\u2019s comments came a month after Putin suggested that doping bans against some Russian athletes who competed at the 2014 Sochi Games were an attempt to sow discontent ahead of next year\u2019s presidential elections. The IOC on Tuesday banned Russia from the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics after evidence emerged of \u201cunprecedented systematic manipulation\u201d of the anti-doping system but left the door open for some Russians to compete as neutrals if they demonstrate they have a doping-free background. Putin said on Wednesday that Russia would not prevent its athletes from competing in Pyeongchang as neutrals, damping down calls from some Russians to boycott the Games. Russia is expected to make a final decision on its stance regarding the IOC ban at a meeting of Russian Olympic authorities next week. In the weeks ahead of the decision, the IOC banned more than 20 Russian athletes for life from the Olympics as a result of an investigation into the alleged tampering of Russian athletes\u2019 positive tests by laboratory and security officials at the 2014 Sochi Games. Russian authorities have never acknowledged the state\u2019s alleged role in the scandal but have pledged to work with international sports bodies to help curb the use of performance-enhancing drugs in the country. Russia\u2019s athletics federation, Paralympic Committee and national anti-doping agency RUSADA remain suspended over doping scandals.

The Olympic and Paralympic designs, which celebrate the themes of harmony, diversity and resilience, were unveiled by pupils at a Tokyo elementary school. After a bungled rollout of the official Olympic logo that led to it being scrapped following accusations of plagiarism, local organisers have left the selection of the Tokyo 2020 mascots in the hands of schoolchildren. From Dec.11 to Feb.22, pupils at every elementary school across Japan \u2014 and Japanese schools overseas \u2014 will choose their favourite design, with each class casting a single vote. The winner will be announced on Feb.28. The competing mascots are instantly recognisable as \u201cMade in Japan,\u201d ranging in appearance from sci-fi cool to a glum-looking fox closer in spirit to the country\u2019s beloved \u201cyuru-kyara\u201d (soft characters). Design A\u2019s futuristic blue-checked design with pointy ears and oversized eyes evokes Japanese manga, while Olympic organisers revealed it has a \u201cstrong sense of justice\u201d and can apparently move faster than light. Its Paralympic cousin, meanwhile, sports red checks derived from cherry blossoms and possesses the ability, helpfully, to \u201ctalk with stones and the wind.\u201d Design B pairs a cartoon hybrid of a \u201clucky\u201d cat and a fox draped in a red flame-like cloak with a blue lion-dog of the type seen guarding Japanese shrines \u2014 the common thread between them big round eyes resembling disco lights. Olympic Mascot B also \u201cloves to take naps underneath the sunlight,\u201d said Japanese organisers, adding that it \u201cgives happy energy to people by touching them with its tail.\u201d The softer appeal of Option C, meanwhile, brings together a fox looking less than overjoyed at being decorated in prehistoric \u201cmagatama\u201d beads and a red raccoon looking a little bemused by all of the commotion. Tokyo organisers will hope to make smooth progress on the mascots to build on recent momentum following a series of public relations disasters. Last month, Tokyo opened its first new permanent venue for the 2020 Olympics \u2014 a welcome boost after plans for the main stadium were torn up by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe two years ago over its $2 billion price tag. Designs for the official Games emblem were then scrapped amid a plagiarism row. There was more bad news in October when Olympic organisers admitted that prolonged summer rain had brought high levels of bacteria to a venue earmarked for triathlon and open water swimming. While Tokyo has taken successful measures to reduce costs, the International Olympic Committee has urged local organisers to try to further cut its current $12 billion Games budget.
