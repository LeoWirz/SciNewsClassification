George Rhodes keeps his eye on the ball as former England legend Ian Bell looks on. Alex Abrahams was on fine form for the Ian Bell masterclass. Les Reid 7 th Dec, 2017 Updated: 7 th Dec, 2017 \n\u201cChallenge yourself, but play for the love of the game,\u201d was Ashes legend Ian Bell\u2019s advice to West Midlands youngsters as England toiled down under. \nAnd, in an interview with the Observer, the five-times Ashes-winning superstar and Warwickshire batsman admitted it was \u201cstrange\u201d not to be part of the action in Australia, facing hostile 90mph bowling and 90,000 crowds. \nThe 35-year-old Ian Bell MBE \u2013 who was born in Coventry and grew up in Dunchurch \u2013 spoke while coaching aspiring future Ashes hopefuls during a community initiative by West Midlands and Warwickshire-based organisation Complete Cricket. \nIts head coach David Smith says: \u201cOur aim is to try and create not just a love of the game, but boys and girls that go on to play for Warwickshire and England. For them to learn from a legend of the game is a unique opportunity.\u201d \nIt follows an alarming 26 per cent fall in monthly adult cricket participation over a decade, from 380,300 to 278,600 in 2015/6 (Sport England figures). The game is sentimentally considered \u2018quintessentially English\u2019 and integral to the national psyche, but is a bigger deal in India and Austrailia. \nIn 2005, \u201cAshes fever\u201d, a series in which Bell took part, swept the country and sparked a fleeting renaissance, with impromptu games springing up in seemingly every park. \nToday, Bell is clear about where the path to renewed resurgence begins, amid a heavily promoted new England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) scheme targeting children as young as five, called All Stars Cricket. \nSpeaking with 10 to 14 year olds at Solihull College, he said: \u201cEnjoy every minute of it. Being a cricketer is a fun life. It\u2019s about having fun with your mates. Challenge yourself but have fun too.\u201d \nThe former Princethorpe schoolboy adds: \u201cI was 13 or 14 when I wanted to be a cricketer. Warwickshire was a successful side when I was growing up. My mum and dad took me to a Lord\u2019s final. \n\u201cI wasn\u2019t very good at football,\u201d he says, despite attending Coventry City\u2019s youth centre of excellence. \nHaving last year captained Warwickshire to a one-day cup victory at the \u2018home of cricket\u2019 Lord\u2019s, where the original \u2018Ashes urn\u2019 permanently resides, Bell remains a tangible inspiration for those born after that great Ashes home series 12 years ago. \nWill Gilbert, 11, from Shirley, recently saw Bell play against Lancashire while Dan King, 10, from Dorridge, says: \u201cI\u2019ve seen him play live in the T20 finals.\u201d \nAsked if he\u2019d spotted any budding Ian Bells or Joe Roots, Bell told us: \u201cThere\u2019s a few, yes. It\u2019s nice to come here and see kids of that age that want to play cricket and there\u2019s a lot of talented players here. The guys at Complete Cricket do a fantastic job. \n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to try and pass on information and I\u2019ve always tried to be a decent role model as a Warwickshire player.\u201d \nHe says such youth development work is \u201creally important\u201d for increasing participation, adding: \u201cWe are fighting in this country with football which is obviously massive. \n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see kids that love the game, which is nice as a professional, because it takes you back to where you started out. it\u2019s nice to remind yourself of why you play the game in the first place.\u201d \nAsked what more was needed to rejuvenate the game, he says: \u201cWhen we won the Ashes in 2005 it was on terrestrial television. \n\u201cYou can\u2019t fault the money that comes in from Sky and BT. But in Australia, they have the Test Match, the Big Bash (the franchise T20 short form of the game in which Bell successfully appeared earlier this year for Perth Scorchers) all on terrestrial television. Their access to seeing their heroes and superstars is in every house in the country. \n\u201cWith T20 franchise cricket coming into this country eventually (planned for 2020), that will help, when hopefully you can rely on not just England but a domestic format to sell out stadiums. The guys here will hopefully go to Edgbaston and see four or five world-class players on a regular basis through a franchise tournament. \n\u201cCricket\u2019s the number-one sport in Australia and India, that\u2019s what you\u2019re fighting against. We\u2019re fighting against football and rugby but there\u2019s a fantastic job being done at the grassroots level by Complete Cricket here, nurturing, encouraging and making guys enjoy cricket, so hopefully we\u2019ll see future Joe Roots coming though.\u201d \nAsked if it was getting more difficult to equally enthuse youngsters over practising a traditional trademark Ian Bell cover drive, as opposed to a T20-style scoop or slog sweep, he said: \u201cCoaching is getting more complicated. There are three formats to play now. \n\u201cWhen I grew up, you worked very hard at the longer format of the game and you adjusted to one-day cricket. Now some kids growing up maybe don\u2019t want to play test cricket but T20 cricket. As a coach you have to be flexible and find out the strength of the youngster you are working with. \n\u201cYou have to go with it. Test cricket was the pinnacle when I was growing up, but that\u2019s not the case anymore. People can play T20 cricket for ten years now and make a career out of it. As a youngster there\u2019s more options and that\u2019s really exciting. \n\u201cT20 is a great way in, and the ECB have to look after Test cricket. Watching the Ashes has made me excited again watching test cricket. We have to look after the Ashes and make sure it is the pinnacle of people\u2019s careers.\u201d \nAsked if he was missing it, he says: \u201cI\u2019m doing a bit of media work on it in this country and it\u2019s been fascinating to watch. \n\u201cIn a way it\u2019s been strange because it\u2019s the first Ashes series I haven\u2019t been involved in since 2005. But it\u2019s nice to be home with a young family and watching it from a distance.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ian bell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "les reid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "will gilbert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe roots", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george rhodes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shirley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex abrahams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ian bell coaching", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "solihull college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales cricket board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coventry city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perth scorchers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warwickshire", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "dunchurch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lancashire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edgbaston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sport england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austrailia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coventry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west midlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:26.030+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0aa6087265b02aa9a87977a36a4a4235687aad42", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRTQTEVMv5vudD7QznwkTp1r6MBVDMObZ2QDF6JzrKegLeuYzIwyFNt4WKND33TpPcvB5HkEIRA17Ttfg1lyEzMWsqKI.uDnQDFeVRWaA7vuv3RIP9Chv2RMSzmwdBWEUpbi_TDuMULRw--", "site_full": "www.concordregister.com", "site": "concordregister.com", "site_section": "http://www.findata.com/News/Latest/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FinData - Latest News", "title": "Above the Rising Trendline Are Shares of Ashland Global Holdings Inc (ASH)", "title_full": "Above the Rising Trendline Are Shares of Ashland Global Holdings Inc (ASH)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "NZ", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0aa6087265b02aa9a87977a36a4a4235687aad42", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRTQTEVMv5vudD7QznwkTp1r6MBVDMObZ2QDF6JzrKegLeuYzIwyFNt4WKND33TpPcvB5HkEIRA17Ttfg1lyEzMWsqKI.uDnQDFeVRWaA7vuv3RIP9Chv2RMSzmwdBWEUpbi_TDuMULRw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "Above the Rising Trendline Are Shares of Ashland Global Holdings Inc (ASH)", "text": "Above the Rising Trendline Are Shares of Ashland Global Holdings Inc (ASH) December 7, 2017 Newswire \nAshland Global Holdings Inc (ASH) moved -1.19% in the most recent session, touching a recent bid of 70.40. Current price levels place the shares above the rising trendline. \nA principle of technical analysis is that once a trend has been formed (two or more peaks/troughs have touched the trendline and reversed direction) it will remain intact until broken. That sounds much more simplistic than it is! The goal is to analyze the current trend using trendlines and then either invest with the current trend until the trendline is broken, or wait for the trendline to be broken and then invest with the new (opposite) trend. \nOne of the basic tenets put forth by Charles Dow in the Dow Theory is that security prices do trend. Trends are often measured and identified by \u201ctrendlines.\u201d A trendline is a sloping line that is drawn between two or more prominent points on a chart. Rising trends are defined by a trendline that is drawn between two or more troughs (low points) to identify price support. Falling trend-s are defined by trendlines that are drawn between two or more peaks (high points) to identify price resistance. \nSharp investors may be looking to examine the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. Developed by Larry Williams, this indicator helps spot overbought and oversold market conditions. The Williams %R shows how the current closing price compares to previous highs/lows over a specified period. Ashland Global Holdings Inc (ASH)\u2019s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R is sitting at -57.62. Typically, if the value heads above -20, the stock may be considered to be overbought. On the flip side, if the indicator goes under -80, this may signal that the stock is oversold. \nAnother technical indicator that might serve as a powerful resource for measuring trend strength is the Average Directional Index or ADX. The ADX was introduced by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970\u2019s and it has stood the test of time. The ADX is typically used in conjunction with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to help spot trend direction as well as trend strength. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Ashland Global Holdings Inc (ASH) is noted at 26.15. Many technical analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. \nInvestors may use various technical indicators to help spot trends and buy/sell signals. Presently, Ashland Global Holdings Inc (ASH) has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -45.06. The CCI was developed by Donald Lambert. The assumption behind the indicator is that investment instruments move in cycles with highs and lows coming at certain periodic intervals. The original guidelines focused on creating buy/sell signals when the reading moved above +100 or below -100. Traders may also use the reading to identify overbought/oversold conditions. \nTaking a look at other technical levels, the 3-day RSI stands at 16.40, the 7-day sits at 41.85 and the 14-day (most common) is at 52.32. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an often employed momentum oscillator that is used to measure the speed and change of stock price movements. When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. This measurement is based on closing prices over a specific period of time. As a momentum oscillator, the RSI operates in a set range. This range falls on a scale between 0 and 100. If the RSI is closer to 100, this may indicate a period of stronger momentum. On the flip side, an RSI near 0 may signal weaker momentum. The RSI was originally created by J. Welles Wilder which was introduced in his 1978 book \u201cNew Concepts in Technical Trading Systems\u201d. \nKeeping an eye on Moving Averages, the 50-day is 68.13, the 200-day is at 64.00, and the 7-day is 72.52 for Ashland Global Holdings Inc (ASH). Moving averages have the ability to be used as a powerful indicator for technical stock analysis. Following multiple time frames using moving averages can help investors figure out where the stock has been and help determine where it may be possibly going. The simple moving average is a mathematical calculation that takes the average price (mean) for a given amount of time.

by Foxy Bingo owner GVC (PA) 0 comments \nGambling giant Ladbrokes is in \u201cdetailed\u201d talks over a takeover by online rival and Foxy Bingo owner GVC in a deal worth up to \u00a33.9 billion. \nGVC \u2013 which also owns Sportingbet and PartyCasino \u2013 has tabled a cash-and-shares approach valuing Ladbrokes at 160.9p a share, with loan notes on top worth an extra 42.8p a share. \nThe

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite). Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., meets with reporters after House Republicans held a closed-door strategy session as the deadline looms to pass a spending bill to fund the government by week's end, on Capitol Hill... \nBy ALAN FRAMAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Congress seems set to prevent a weekend government shutdown, but lawmakers and President Donald Trump still have longer-range disputes to settle over spending, immigration and other issues before they can declare budget peace. \nWith many on both sides deciding a headline-grabbing federal closure would be a political blunder - at least for now - the House planned to approve legislation Thursday financing federal agencies through Dec. 22. The Senate seemed ready to follow. Without legislation, many agencies would run out of money after midnight Friday and grind to a close. \nThe two-week spending measure is aimed at giving both parties' bargainers more time to reach longer-term budget decisions. To jumpstart that negotiating, Trump and congressional leaders were meeting Thursday to try reaching agreements. \nThe prospects for successful White House talks were buffeted Wednesday when the impulsive Trump blurted to reporters that a shutdown \"could happen.\" He blamed Democrats, saying they want \"illegal immigrants pouring into our country, bringing with them crime, tremendous amounts of crime.\" \nLast week, an unexpected attack by Trump on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., prompted the two Democrats to skip a bargaining session that was planned then. \nThis time, the White House smoothed the waters by following up with a more peaceable, written statement. It praised Pelosi and Schumer for choosing to \"put their responsibility to the American people above partisanship\" and said Trump was anticipating productive talks between \"leaders who put their differences aside.\" \nLater, the White House issued another statement indicating Trump would sign the two-week spending extension. It also laid out administration budget goals, saying money for the military including missile defense and security along the border with Mexico \"must be prioritized in a long-term funding agreement.\" \nFor Republicans, a shutdown would put a humiliating bookend on a year in which they've controlled the White House and Congress with little to show for it. They want the public to focus instead on the GOP's prized $1.5 trillion tax bill, which party leaders hope to send Trump by Christmas. \nThe two-week spending bill also makes money available to several states that are running out of funds for the Children's Health Insurance Program. That widely popular program provides medical care to more than 8 million children. \nEven the head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, whose members have been threatening to oppose the temporary spending measure, predicted passage. \n\"No one wants a shutdown, including Freedom Caucus members,\" Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told reporters. \nThe roughly 30-member caucus has been trying to win promises from leaders of spending curbs and quick passage of a full-year defense budget in exchange for backing the short-term bill. Without support from many of them, Republicans would need votes from Democrats to push the temporary spending measure through the House. \nWhile many Democrats seemed likely to oppose the short-term bill, enough were expected to support it in the Senate to allow its passage there. They know they'd still have leverage on subsequent bills needed to keep the government running. \nRepublicans control the Senate 52-48 and will need at least eight Democratic votes for passage. \nDemocrats have been using their leverage to insist on spending boosts for health care, infrastructure and other domestic programs that would match increases Republicans want for defense. \nDemocrats are also seeking an agreement to extend protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children. Trump ended safeguards against deportation three months ago but has expressed an openness to restoring them. \n___ \nAP reporters Andrew Taylor and Ken Thomas contributed.

While these injuries can seem debilitating, meeting with a chiropractor could be a great option. A chiropractor could provide you with a range of different services that can help you better decipher your pain and begin the recovery process.\n\nConsultation\n\nIn the first visit with the chiropractor, he or she will usually perform a comprehensive examination to determine what the nature of an injury is, and why it could be causing pain or related symptoms. The neck, back and spinal column will be assessed for injuries which would lead to pain. The information gathered from the evaluation will help the doctor to determine what is wrong and how it could best by resolved.\n\nTherapy and Recovery\n\nThe therapy plan which is developed in consultation with the chiropractor is implemented to assist the patient to recovery. The recovery plan is customized to fit the needs of a particular patient.\n\nSome of the most common forms of therapy will include working to realign your spine, providing you with a full back massage that triggers the weaker muscles and joints and even working on exercises that will help to build back up your muscles. The length of the therapy process will vary but will end up providing you with a stronger back, neck, and spine and reduced pain.\n\nOngoing Therapy\n\nThe consultation and therapy sessions with the chiropractor usually will also include suggestions for rebuilding the back and neck muscles for the future. Some of these techniques can include exercises to further strengthen the injured area. The exercises can be maintained even after the chiropractic therapy sessions have ended. A healthier body will be less likely to experience injuries in the same area. Stronger muscles and better posture improve overall health and wellness.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are looking for info concerning a personal injury , come to our web pages today.

I messed with the flux settings on my computer because it gets dark so goddamn early, and with the night-shift trying to read pdfs made me downright catatonic, but then I didn\u2019t fix it back when I was done working for the night, and allowed myself to play sims and watch stargate for an hour before bed. this whole week has been challenging in a way that made me want to shove in the dumbest, most inane yet pleasant input into my head, as like, a counterbalance, and somehow that lead to watching the beginning of Stargate SG-1 , a truly terrible show that I can\u2019t explain why I\u2019m fond of. I like a lot of shitty television, but usually I have a better explanation \u2014 hell, even Stargate: Atlantis (which is a better show, but still bad) I can explain what I see in it. SG-1, no fuckin clue. I watched it in high school, on really terrible illegal streams, and only ever bits and pieces of it. But I started at the start this time, and maybe I\u2019ll get all the way through this time, through ten seasons of the immaculate garbage \u2014 not likely, but who knows. Maybe it will strike me differently this time, maybe I\u2019ll be able to explain what\u2019s good about it (besides Sam, Sam\u2019s amazing, but that\u2019s so obvious, it goes without saying.) Last time I was watching this I was a child and hadn\u2019t thought about how racist it was to say that aliens built the pyramids \u2014 stupid, yes, I saw that, but wasn\u2019t aware of the underlying p-r-o-b-l-e-m-a-t-i-c implications at play. I\u2019m so much smarter now. I\u2019m in grad school. I\u2019m writing papers that aren\u2019t trash, not at all, and especially not if the trash in question we\u2019re comparing them to is Stargate SG-1. That\u2019s actually a comforting thought.

More than half reported engaging in fellatio within the past year, but only 8% of females and 9% of males said they used a condom. \n\u201cMany young adults do not perceive they are at risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection,\u201d said Erin Moore, a professor of human sexuality at Stetson University in DeLand, Florida, who was not involved with the study. \nOral sex is less likely to spread sexually transmitted infections than vaginal or anal intercourse, she said, but the risk remains. \n\u201cIf people are not going to use condoms consistently, then the most important thing they should do is get tested for sexually transmitted infections and make sure their partners get tested before engaging in oral, vaginal, or anal sex,\u201d Moore said in an email. \nHolway and Hernandez suggest that doctors discuss the potential for sexually transmitted infections with young patients. Interactive workshops about safe sex practices on college campuses are also valuable education tools, the authors write. \nMany American schools provide no sex education or just abstinence-only sex education, discouraging all sexual contact until marriage without teaching prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, Moore said. \n\u201cKeep in mind that, less than 20 years ago, some states still had \u2018sodomy laws\u2019 that made engaging in oral sex illegal,\u201d Moore said. The US Supreme Court ruled sodomy laws unconstitutional in a Texas case in 2003. \nThough the main findings of the study were expected, results about race and maternal education sparked interest in additional research. \nBlack youths were less likely to engage in oral sex, the study found, but they were significantly more likely to use a condom. Previous studies have shown that black youths also are more likely to use condoms during intercourse, according to the report. \nFemales whose mothers had higher levels of education were more likely to have performed or received oral sex and were more likely to have had two or more oral sex partners in the past year. The finding led researchers to speculate that \u201chigher goals may lead young women to engage in oral sex in place of vaginal sex, particularly if they view intercourse as a riskier sexual activity with more severe consequences (e.g., pregnancy) that could derail future plans.\u201d \nMoore was intrigued by the researchers\u2019 hypothesis that maternal education could be related to young women having a goal-oriented mindset that may lead to oral sex instead of vaginal sex. \n\u201cPrevious research highlights that college students tend to be more concerned about experiencing pregnancy than contracting a sexually transmitted infection,\u201d she said. \u201cA child is viewed as a much more life-changing event.\u201d \nThe study focused exclusively on condoms and fellatio and did not examine the recommended use of dental dams during cunnilingus. But prior research shows that people rarely, if ever, use dental dams. \nIncreasing the use of barrier methods during cunnilingus could help to decrease the rate of oral human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and possibly the incidence of HPV-related cancers. Roughly one in nine US men have oral infections of cancer-causing HPV. \nHPV is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases. Most infections don\u2019t cause symptoms and go away on their own. But the virus can cause cancers of the throat, anus, penis, cervix, vagina, and vulva, as well as genital warts and lesions in the upper respiratory tract. \nOther STDs that can be passed on from oral sex include gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes, and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stephanie hernandez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erin moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hernandez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giuseppina valle holway", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "university of tampa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stetson university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "journal of adolescent health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:29.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "18d36d48e518fa0f48693ef194f33f6dccb1dada", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_h8_u0E_dTBi_EyuROJGSDSp8NrEsrhb7VB3nYjY.ubF3nht5IsCnS4aG5iTau.TE-", "site_full": "www.golfmk7.com", "site": "golfmk7.com", "site_section": "http://www.golfmk7.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=28", "site_categories": ["vehicles", "auto_parts", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "GTI Engine / Drivetrain / Exhaust / Tunes - GOLFMK7 - VW GTI MKVII Forum / VW Golf R Forum / VW Golf MKVII Forum", "title": "SAE Code: P21F900 - Combust Measurement System. 2, Bank 1, Very rich with idle speed.", "title_full": "SAE Code: P21F900 - Combust Measurement System. 2, Bank 1, Very rich with idle speed. - GOLFMK7 - VW GTI MKVII Forum / VW Golf R Forum / VW Golf MKVII Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T01:51:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 84272, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "38cc3f460c8081523a709df5cf7a25355d6a681a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_h8_u0E_dTBi_EyuROJGSDSp8NrEsrhb7VB3nYjY.ubF3nht5IsCnSLYn0tLxBOP0RDC6olDnHLA--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Reggie Enchilada", "published": "2017-12-06T02:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Check to make sure that the battery is charged.

His decisive 3-pointer in the final minute over JaKarr Sampson came after James went to the bench during a timeout and told coach Tyronn Lue to run a play for him.\"Was going to run a different play and then Bron said, 'I want Chicago.' So I said, 'OK,'\" Lue said. \"We got it to him and he made a big shot.\"After catching the inbounds pass, James took a dribble to his left and then stepped behind the line and knocked down his fifth 3-pointer.\"It felt good,\" said James, who finished 12 of 18 from the floor. \"I was able to get the laces where I wanted them and I got enough space, I created enough space with the step-back away from JaKarr and I was able to let it go. It felt good the whole time.\"Cleveland, which also won 13 straight in the 2008-09 and 2009-10 seasons, will try to break the team record Friday at Indiana.This one wasn't easy. The Kings gave the Cavs everything they had, but couldn't contain James in the clutch. That's been the case for nearly every team that has faced the three-time champion, who is shooting with a confidence rarely seen in his career.\"He's amazing,\" said Kyle Korver, who opened the fourth quarter with three straight 3-pointers to give Cleveland the lead. \"He's just demanding the ball. He's like, 'Give me the ball, we're about to win.' And, I've been around some guys who've had amazing years. I've been playing with him and Derrick (Rose) when he was MVP. Allen Iverson when I was young.\"But he's taken this to a whole new level. It's amazing to have a better than a front-row seat, because I'm usually on the court next to him somewhere. I'm glad he's on my team.\"Zach Randolph had 18 points and 10 rebounds and Buddy Hield added 17 points for the Kings. Sampson grabbed 16 rebounds in his first start this season.While Cleveland's win streak is impressive, James said he won't consider anything special until the Cavs nearly double it.\"Twenty-five,\" he said when asked where the streak needs to get to before becoming significant. \"Because you're getting close to 33 (Lakers 1971-72), that's the all-time record. We ain't nowhere near close. We got close in Miami. We got to 27 and lost to Chicago.\"Thanks to James and another Chicago, the Cavs roll on.ROSE REFLECTSCavs guard Derrick Rose spoke to his teammates before the morning shootaround, two days after returning to the team from a self-imposed hiatus. Rose has been dealing with a sprained ankle and the 2011 NBA MVP's latest injury had him re-considering his future.Lue didn't provide any specifics about Rose's comments, but said his teammates were glad to have him around again.\"It was just good to have him back and hear him talk because he's not a big talker,\" Lue said. \"He's a quiet guy.

Associated Press \nWith a bill like a duck but teeth like a croc's, a swanlike neck and killer claws, a new dinosaur species uncovered by scientists looks like something Dr. Seuss could have dreamed up. \nIt also had flippers like a penguin, and while it walked like an ostrich it could also swim. That's the first time swimming ability has been shown for a two-legged, meat-eating dinosaur. \nThe tiny creature, only about 18 inches (45 centimeters) tall, roamed 75 million years ago in what is now Mongolia. Its full curled-up skeleton was found in a sandstone rock. \n\"It's such a peculiar animal,\" said Dennis Voeten, a paleontology researcher at Palacky University in the Czech Republic. \"It combines different parts we knew from other groups into this one small animal.\" \nIn a study released Wednesday by the journal Nature , Voeten and coauthors named it Halszkaraptor escuilliei (HAHL-shka-rap-tor ES-key-lay-ee) or \"Halszka\" after the late Polish paleontologist Halszka Osmolska. \nPaleontologist Kristi Curry Rogers of Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, who didn't participate in the study, called it \"a pretty crazy chimera: a swan neck and dinosaur body, but with a mouthful of tiny teeth and hands and feet that look like they might be good for swimming.\" \nIts mashup body let it run and hunt on the ground and fish in fresh water, said study co-author Paul Tafforeau. He's a paleontologist at the ESRF , known as the European Synchrotron in Grenoble, France, a powerful X-ray generator where numerous tests were made on the fossil. \nLead author Andrea Cau, a paleontologist at the Geological Museum Capellini in Bologna, Italy, said he was at first highly suspicious about the fossil's authenticity, both because of its appearance and the fact that the rock containing the skeleton had been smuggled out of Mongolia and left in a private collector's hands. \n\"I asked myself, 'Is this a real, natural skeleton, or an artifact, a chimera? If this is a fake, how could I demonstrate it?'\" Cau said in an email. \"Assuming it was a fake instead of starting assuming that the fossil is genuine was the most appropriate way to start the investigation of such a bizarre fossil.\" \nSo researchers used the Synchrotron to create three-dimensional images of the fossil, which showed the creature was indeed a single animal and not a concoction built up from several sources. For example, an arm hidden in the rock perfectly matched the visible left arm, and lines indicating growth matched up across the bones. \nEven though the creature wasn't dreamed up by Dr. Seuss, it got a blessing from a Dr. Sues. \nHans Sues, a paleontologist at the Smithsonian Institution who wasn't part of the research, praised the work and said it \"shows again how amazingly diverse dinosaurs were.\" About Us", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "seth borenstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul tafforeau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seuss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dennis voeten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "halszka osmolska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hans sues", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristi curry rogers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrea cau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "voeten", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nature", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palacky university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macalester college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smithsonian institution", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bologna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mongolia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "czech republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grenoble", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. paul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geological museum capellini", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:30.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a959ef2cee323f26f39c9dcd6b94e89bae497f74", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3LPFP4Swsmhw9SeAuo4gV18yv6VGXkQ1d4PlOZ7qzUKVfoqPlBJAk9h6jJ5ejeaB_oMrWFJlJ33hYMk7VPckPOC", "site_full": "ergasiaedo.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://ergasiaedo.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "\u0395\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u0395\u03b4\u03ce\u039a\u03b1\u03b9\u03a4\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1", "title": "Clinical Trials Manager", "title_full": "Clinical Trials Manager", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a959ef2cee323f26f39c9dcd6b94e89bae497f74", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3LPFP4Swsmhw9SeAuo4gV18yv6VGXkQ1d4PlOZ7qzUKVfoqPlBJAk9h6jJ5ejeaB_oMrWFJlJ33hYMk7VPckPOC", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "\u0395\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u0395\u03b4\u03ce\u039a\u03b1\u03b9\u03a4\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1 (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "Clinical Trials Manager", "text": "University College London -

Not quite at joint film fest", "text": "Dogs and cats living together! Not quite at joint film fest   12:30 PM Leanne Italie - Associated Press \nThe creator of a film festival celebrating dogs has taken a surprising step: cats. \nBut Tracie Hotchner, a pet wellness advocate via books, podcasts and radio shows, isn't going full-on \"Ghostbusters\" \u2014 \"dogs and cats living together. Mass hysteria!\" She's screening a medley of shorts about cats on Saturday in New York, then will take her feline fest on the road, followed by her 3rd annual NY Dog Film Festival on Sunday. \nTo be clear. This isn't one of those internet-cutesy fests like the cat meme-heavy one at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. While some of the selections are humorous, these are films made by actual filmmakers, as opposed to people looking to go viral with their pets as video props. \nThe dog fest, Hotchner said, grew out of the social media popularity of pets. \n\"I'm not a fan of animal videos,\" she explained. \"I find that animal videos online tend to have a shaming quality. It's just not my cup of tea. I'm celebrating the relationship with humans, the bond.\" \nFor both cats and dogs, some of the films are scripted, some animated and some are documentaries, like the one by Mary Zournazi, \"Dogs of Democracy.\" Her 58-minute film highlights the life of a street mutt in Athens named Loukanikos, who became a four-legged symbol of the anti-austerity protests in Greece after showing up on the front lines and facing down authorities alongside the humans. \nZournazi, who teaches sociology in New South Wales, Australia, knew nothing about the dogs until she first arrived in Athens in 2014. \n\"It was a really tense time because of the austerity measures,\" she said from Australia. \"The crisis was in full swing. I fell in love with the dogs immediately. They led me to think about that relationship with the people who take care of them.\" \nZournazi's project is as long as these films get. Some are as short as a minute. All are intended to inspire, Hotchner said from Bennington, Vermont, where she lives. \n\"I'm a little allergic to cute,\" Hotchner said. \"My universe is all about education.\" \nThere are no awards, but her dog fest has been selling out since 2015, she said. Tickets were selling well for all slates heading into the weekend at the School of Visual Arts, which has a 530-seat theater. \n\"Many people have never been to a film festival. They're not trying to see the next Martin Scorsese. The first year was word of mouth and people were flying in,\" Hotchner said. \nSo why add cats? And why on separate days? \n\"It's sort of a merger but it's a schizophrenic merger,\" Hotchner joked. \"Cats are not little dogs. And cat people aren't necessarily dog people.\" \nShe said she started with dogs \"because it honestly didn't cross my mind that there could be a decent movie about a cat.\" Hotchner was pleasantly surprised when she went in search of film fodder. \nIn the 8-minute \"Scaredy, the Cat,\" for example, New York City filmmaker Markie Hancock celebrates the life of a feral cat taken on to be a ratter at some public clay tennis courts in Riverside Park. The problem was she turned out to be scared of rats \u2014 and most people, yet she has forged a close bond to a small handful, going so far as to wait for some to show up at their regular times. \nHancock stumbled on Scaredy while making a longer film about Dorian Rence, a violist for the New York Philharmonic who cares for a feral cat colony in some train tunnels not far from the tennis courts. \n\"Most of the people who care for Scaredy don't even play tennis,\" Hancock said in an interview. \"But they all go down there to feed and take care of her. I love that free exchange with no commerce involved, no technology involved. It's people in a public space who are connecting with each other. I think animals really just bring us together.\" About Us", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "leanne italie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorian rence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tracie hotchner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin scorsese", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hotchner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "markie hancock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zournazi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hancock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary zournazi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "loukanikos", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york philharmonic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "school of visual arts", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vermont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walker art center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new south wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "riverside park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minneapolis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bennington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:30.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0cf245aa3394349781be398ab8e13fa67d6c26c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mtwpVP3F9EOzqP8qg136iZk", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/co/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/co/ -

In the book, Graham draws primarily on Gallup data to argue American happiness is faltering as a rational response to growing inequality. \nAmong Graham's most striking finding is, as she puts it, \"markers of well and ill-being, ranging from life satisfaction to stress, are more unequally shared across the rich and the poor in the U.S. than they are in Latin America, a region long known for high levels of inequality.\" Low-income Americans are particularly skeptical that hard work will improve their economic situation. \nBlanchflower and Oswald wanted to see if other data sources corroborated Graham's findings. They first turn to the General Social Survey (GSS), a nationally-representative survey administered every several years and used frequently in social science work. The GSS data show, unambiguously, that Americans' evaluations of their own happiness has been falling in recent years. \nThe decline is visible across multiple demographic groups. Declines have been steepest among Americans with the least education, and the happiness gap between the most-educated and least-educated Americans has nearly doubled since 1972. \nBlanchflower and Oswald note the GSS data show similar trends for Americans' feelings about their finances - everyone is less optimistic about money relative to 1972, but optimism has dropped particularly sharply among the least-educated. They call these disparities a form of \"psychological inequality,\" which is both a reflection of actual monetary inequality and a driver of it - after all, it's difficult to improve your financial situation if you don't believe your financial situation can be improved. \nAs another marker of psychological distress, Blanchflower and Oswald look at cross-country data on the experience of pain. In 2011, the International Social Survey Programme asked respondents in over 30 nations how often they had experienced bodily aches and pains in the past month. \nAmericans were the most likely to report frequent pain, with 34 percent saying they experienced it \"often\" or \"very often.\" The average across all countries surveyed was just 20 percent. \n\"As the US is one of the richest countries in the world, and in principle might be expected to have one of the most comfortable lifestyles in the world, it seems strange - to put it at its mildest - that the nation should report such a lot of pain,\" Blanchflower and Oswald write. \nAware that some of this could be attributable to question translation issues or cultural differences (for instance, Americans may just be more predisposed to complain about pain than members of other nations), the authors ran the numbers controlling for age, gender, marital status, labor force status and education. The United States remained an outlier even when these factors were accounted for. \nThe nation's relatively stingy social safety net may be one factor contributing to this exceptionalism. Many Americans still lack access to health care, which is available universally in most other wealthy nations. The expense of health care, even for those who have insurance, could mean Americans experiencing aches and pains are more likely to tough it out and forego treatment, relative to people in other countries. \nIn the United States, health issues remain a major contributor to financial insecurity, meaning they likely contribute to some of the declining happiness and financial pessimism seen in the other research surveyed by Blanchflower and Oswald. \nAll told, the data underscore how country-level material wealth can be a poor indicator for the well being of its inhabitants.

The rally, called  \u201cTurun Harga Minyak, Turun Najib\u201d  (Lower Fuel Prices, Topple Najib), will take place on Dec 31, at 11pm, starting at Sogo, Kuala Lumpur, and will end at Dataran Merdeka, Nik Nazmi said. Aside from their calls to lower fuel prices and topple Najib, he said, the group wants the prices of goods and the cost of living as well to be lowered.  The group, which consists of members of Pakatan Harapan Youth as well as other youth NGOs, is targeting an attendance of 5,000 people for the rally. \n\nNik Nazmi ( photo ), who is also PKR Youth chief, said the group has planned several activities leading up to the rally to promote it, beginning this Friday, where it will distribute flyers at Masjid Negara after Friday prayers. The group also intends to hold pre-rallies on Dec 16 and 23 at Sogo at 3.30pm and is inviting all youths to join in the activities, he said. Turun Turun  also rejects the government\u2019s excuse that increasing fuel subsidies will only burden the country\u2019s economy. \u201cThe country will not be burdened by subsidies, but it is burdened by the wasteful spending that is often reported in the Auditor-General\u2019s Report,\u201d Nik Nazmi said. Fuel prices have been steadily increasing for six weeks, peaking at RM2.38 per litre for RON95, RM2.66 for RON97 and RM2.25 for diesel on Nov 15. However, the week after that, fuel prices dropped by eight sen per litre for both RON95 and RON97, while diesel prices dropped two sen to RM2.23. The latest fuel prices are RM2.29 per litre for RON95, RM2.57 for RON97 and RM2.21 per litre for diesel. The weekly fuel price system was implemented on March 30, and is determined by global oil prices based on the Mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS) and the ringgit\u2019s strength against the US dollar.- Mkini ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "turun tur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turun najib", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turun harga minyak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "- mkini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nik nazmi nik ahmad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nik nazmi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "najib", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turun turun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "topple najib", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sogo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakatan harapan youth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "platts singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "masjid negara", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "dataran merdeka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuala lumpur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:32.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db90c6c0ae6ec51ca981c4a6361f86fd120fa7fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFrs_JeU7DwSo16SLL6uqm7e4Y0CX3A55nvWo9RpItQKAAevY1jtl29Gof2CvyQ.wqq4s9wk6guJMx1vW.lo.oaOyXK0abgKKxU-", "site_full": "geoffjames.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://geoffjames.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Confessions of an Ageing Motorcyclist", "title": "A good day on the road gets even better", "title_full": "A good day on the road gets even better", "published": "2017-12-07T05:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7a15efe862c64c849675fc54956b9c20f15491d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFrs_JeU7DwSo16SLL6uqm7e4Y0CX3A55nvWo9RpItQKAAevY1jtl29Gof2CvyQ.wqq4s9wk6guJMx1vW.lo.oaOd90GU9uyeAyTrOTGoZWljA--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Andrew Thomson", "published": "2017-12-07T07:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlMv5givwQ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:32.000+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15122677, "moreResultsAvailable": 15122577, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512639272000&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 640}
