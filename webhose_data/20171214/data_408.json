The deal is the Hong Kong investor's first purchase in the UK.

The building is let to Lloyds Banking Group, which has occupied the building since it was constructed. \nChen Chang Wei, Chairman of Hengli Investments Holding (Group) Limited, comments: 'This is a brilliant outcome after a lot of careful research and site inspections. As this is such a rare commercial property, we are particularly happy to have reached a swift mutual agreement with the seller, closing the tender in only a month. We will continue to consider any remarkable property investment opportunities locally and internationally.' \nDaniel Hesketh, director in the central London investment team at Savills, adds: '25 Gresham Street offers a rare opportunity to acquire not only one of London's trophy assets, being a modern, prime located office in the City of London, but also the UK headquarters for one of the country's leading financial institutions, with long term secure income.' \nSavills plc published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained

For the stage based on the game in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U , see Super Mario Maker (stage) . For the Nintendo 3DS port of the game, see Super Mario Maker for Nintendo 3DS . Super Mario Maker Wii U Pro Controller \nSuper Mario Maker (tentatively called Mario Maker when announced at E3 2014) is a game creator application for the Wii U which allows players to insert blocks , enemies , items , and more from the Super Mario Bros. series to create and share their own 2D Super Mario levels. The game was announced at E3 2014 and was released in September 2015 (originally set to be released in early 2015), as part of the 30th Anniversary of Super Mario Bros. [1] \nThe eShop version of the game requires at least 1.4 GB [2] of storage memory to be downloaded. Additionally, 152 different Mystery Mushroom costumes are available in the game, but the player can unlock them without scanning the proper amiibo by completing the 100 Mario Challenge. [2] \nAlso, while the game typically uses the GamePad , the Wii Remote , Wii Classic Controller , and Wii U Pro Controller are also usable. [2] \nA port of this game was released for the Nintendo 3DS in December 2016. \nStarting on November 7, 2017, the Miiverse service was terminated by Nintendo. While players can still upload their courses online, they can no longer submit comments on them. Contents 18 References Pre-title screen animations \nEach day the startup screen has a different animation associated with getting Builder Mario off the screen. All the objects are in Super Mario Bros. style. Sunday - Luigi enters in, shoots a fireball at Builder Mario causing him to fall off, and then runs across the screen. A bunch of characters (including Peach ) and a \"Happy Sunday\" (\"Today is Sunday\" in PAL versions) banner are also shown on top of the logo alongside text saying, \"Let's get making!\" Monday - A Koopa Shell goes across the screen hitting Builder Mario causing him to fall off the screen. Tuesday - A Magikoopa appears and turns Builder Mario into a Goomba which walks off the screen. Wednesday - A Super Mario Bros. style platform with wings carries Builder Mario off. Thursday - Three Goombas enter in, pick up Builder Mario and carry him off while tribal music plays. Friday - A Gnat picks up Builder Mario, but a fly swatter swats it causing Builder Mario to fall off the screen. ( NOTE: At the beginning, in English versions, the day of the week is called \"Flyday\", but after the gnat has been swatted the word falls with Builder Mario and is called Friday.) Saturday - A Thwomp falls on Builder Mario causing him to fall off the screen and then raises back up. Title screen The title screen of Super Mario Maker . The screen goes into a sepia tone after the player clicks on the letter K. \nIn a similar fashion to Mario Paint , the title screen is highly interactive. [3] A randomly generated stage will appear, and players have the option to choose \"Create\" and edit the stage, or \"Play\", to choose either Course World or 10 Mario Challenge. Players can even complete the stage before starting. When pressed, each letter will cause a different effect on the game title screen. SUPER : Five Super Stars will appear and a random voice or voices will shout \" Super Mario Maker \". M - The letter M flips upside down and spells Super Wario Maker , and a Mystery Mushroom with a Wario costume appears (in the Super Mario Bros. game style only). In addition, Wario will taunt the player. A - The letter A will summon a cluster of multi-colored stars to fall behind in the background. All enemies and shells present on the screen will be defeated. A train whistle can also be heard. R - The legs of the letter R will extend and will shoot a shower of coins, similar to a Bill Blaster shooting coins. A cash register sound will also play. I - The parakeet from Nintendo DSi Sound , which appears in the recording option, will appear and sit on top of the letter I, making it look like a lowercase I. Like in the application it debuted in, it will also record any sounds, and repeat them with a different effect. The parakeet will leave after a while. O - The letter O will summon a Koopa Clown Car ( Junior Clown Car in the New Super Mario Bros. U style). M - The second M will summon an empty Buzzy Beetle Shell or Spiny Shell , and either can be worn as a helmet. An explosion sound can be heard. A - Touching the second A will cause it to act like a rocket, with an intercom counting down before it shoots off; it will return soon after. It also clears all items and enemies on screen. K - The letter K will turn the screen into a sepia tone. The music for the title will also turn into an 8-bit variation. Pressing the K again will revert the screen back to normal. E - Touching the letter E will summon a Springboard for Mario to use. An oriental drum can be heard. R - The second R will extend like the first R, turn around and summon either an empty Goomba's Shoe or a Yoshi Egg (depending on the game style). If there are two Yoshis, any more Eggs summoned will hold a Super Mushroom . When using Yoshi , an extra drumbeat will be added to the title screen music. Clicking randomly on the screen will summon a Goomba , Koopa or, rarely, a Bowser . Dragging the stylus on the screen will produce a stream of magic dust, similar to how Kamek powers up an enemy in the Yoshi's Island and New Super Mario Bros. games. Gameplay \nThe game is set up so that players can design their very own 2D Super Mario courses. They are able to set up and edit the length and width of the stages, the course's theme, and game styles, and are able to use various objects, items, and enemies. Players are able to switch between editing and playing their created stages, and can easily make any changes using the tools provided. An outline mode can also be used to show Mario's movements and to make positioning objects easier. \nThe game starts with only one row of course elements, as the game features an unlocking system, in which a set of elements will be available for the next day, so long as they spend at least five minutes using the tools they have. As part of a Day 1 patch, however, the elements can be made available immediately by spending enough time placing elements on the course. Players can also add sound effects to their courses using the SFX frog (which uses the frog icon from Mario Paint ). These effects happen when Mario walks over them in the play mode, with some effects generating visuals. Players can even record their own sound effects and add them to the game. However, these custom sound effects are replaced with a generic parrot/chicken squawk when uploaded to Course World. [4] \nPlayers can save up to 120 different courses onto their Wii U profile. [2] They can be found in Coursebot , the course selection screen. Locally saved and downloaded courses can be arranged into worlds, which are set up like in Super Mario Bros. , with four courses per world. There is no way to upload courses in worlds; players can only upload single courses. Sample courses \nBelow is the full list of all the 68 [5] sample courses that are in the game. The sample courses that are in worlds 1 and 2 are unlocked as the player unlocks new course sets. The sample courses that are in worlds 3 through 16 are used in the 10 Mario Challenge. The world 17 courses are unlocked after the player has completed all the 10 Mario Challenge sample courses. World No. The four game styles used in the game. The six course styles used in the game. \nThe game gives players the option to choose the game and course styles from various 2D Mario games. [6] There are four game styles and six course styles to choose from. Each game style retains its respective gameplay elements and physics from its base game. For example, Mario cannot carry items in the Super Mario Bros. style, can triple and wall-jump in the New Super Mario Bros. U style, and is able to throw Koopa Shells upward in the Super Mario World style only. Each game style has its own exclusive elements, such as Yoshi being available in the Super Mario World and New Super Mario Bros. U styles, but is replaced in Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 3 styles by the Goomba's Shoe , as well as its exclusive power-ups and end-goals. Changing a course theme changes the assets, objects and the music of the edit mode to appropriately share the theme. These game and course themes include: \nGame Styles \nText in bold indicates styles/themes usable from the start of the game.

Blocks (wings remain visible) Koopa Troopas (look and act like Koopa Paratroopas ) Lakitus Lava Bubbles (work like Zigzag Lava Bubble ) Magikoopas Moving platforms (makes them move in waving paths) Munchers Spike Tops (look like Spiky Parabuzzies ) Spinies (shoot spines) A big Paragoomba, along with normal-sized Goombas. \nThe following objects can be made huge by dragging Super Mushrooms onto them: Bloopers Dry Bones Goombas Goomba's Shoes (Mario can ground pound to break blocks; stiletto form can break Brick and Hard Blocks) Hammer Bros. (turns into Sledge Bros.) Koopa Troopas Yoshi Eggs Bill Blasters, spawning coins and a Cheep Cheep. \nPlayers can make ? Blocks, Brick Blocks, Note Blocks, Bill Blasters, Lakitus and Warp Pipes spawn one of the following objects, by dragging one of the following objects onto one of the former objects (whether huge, winged, both, or neither): 1-Up Mushrooms \nThe following objects can be made to move along Tracks by dragging them onto one: ? Blocks Dry Bones (In Fish Bone form, they won't target Mario.) Fire Bars Flimsy Lift (will only start moving when Mario steps on it; moves slightly slower) Goombas Koopa Clown Cars (only empty. Will disconnect when entered) Lava Bubble POW Blocks (Can be grabbed) Propeller Mushrooms Unchained Chomps (will dangle from rail and swing realistically) Wigglers \nNote: Any object on a track, when winged, will move faster. A Chain Chomp, riding a Koopa Clown Car. \nThe following objects can be put into Koopa Clown Cars . The car will resize to fit the enemy, if it does not fit. A Koopa Clown Car with an object will chase Mario. Bill Blasters Boos (Clown Car stops moving when looked at) Bowsers (Bowser will sometimes throw Bob-ombs while Bowser Jr. tosses Koopa Shells.) Cannons A Piranha Plant, riding a Lakitu's Cloud. \nThe following objects can be put into Lakitu's Clouds : 1-Up Mushrooms Boos (Will still move when looked at) Bowsers POW Blocks (Can be grabbed) Propeller Mushrooms Thwomps (will destroy cloud and fall as usual when Mario is near) Unchained Chomps (will not lunge at Mario) Wigglers \nThe following objects can press P Switches : Bowsers Giant Enemies Stacked Wiggler, a Bill Blaster, and a Magikoopa. \nThe following objects can be stacked on top of each other (when not on rails or in Koopa Clown Cars): Bill Blasters Boos (not possible in Stretch form) Bowsers Buzzy Beetles (not while in shell form) Cannons Dry Bones (not Fish Bones) Goombas Magikoopas (won't teleport when stacked) Munchers Spinies (not while in shell form) Thwomps \nEach course layer has limits for how many objects can be placed. [20] Block objects: 2,000 Includes: Coins, Ground, Tracks, and Spike Traps. Platform objects: 200 Warp Pipe warp objects: 10 Power-up objects: 100 Enemy and other action objects: 100 Enemies: Goombas, Koopa Troopas, Piranha Plants, Lakitus, Spinies, Bill Blasters, Bloopers, Cheep Cheeps, Hammer Bros, Buzzy Beetles, Thwomps, Lava Bubbles, Rocky Wrenches, Bob-ombs, Spike Tops, Boos, Dry Bones, Magikoopas, Munchers, Wigglers, and Chain Chomps. Action objects: Lifts, Trampolines, Lava Lifts, Fire Bars, POW Blocks, Burners, Cannons, P Switches, Goomba's Shoes / Yoshi Eggs, Junior Clown Cars, Grinders, and One-way Barriers. NOTE: Same restrictions apply to all shaken versions as well. Bowsers and Bowser Jrs. do not count as enemies, while Lakitus count as two (Lakitu and the cloud). Arrow objects: 100 Door objects: 4 sets (8 total) Bowsers/Bowser Jrs.: 3 Checkpoint Flags: 2 (one per area) Pink Coins: 10 (five per area) \nNOTES: Power-up and enemy objects placed inside blocks do not count towards their respective object limits. Game modes \nIn addition to the Course Maker, Super Mario Maker features two game modes: 10 Mario Challenge, and Course World. 10 Mario Challenge \nIn 10 Mario Challenge , the goal is to clear eight randomly-selected sample courses with up to ten lives. Players can obtain up to three 1-Ups in each course, but must be able to complete the course to collect them. As many as 56 different sample courses appear in this mode, and they'll be added onto the Coursebot's sample courses list when completed. \nWhen the player plays 10 Mario Challenge for the first time, the eight courses that appear are predetermined, and will never change until the player has completed 10 Mario Challenge once. Course No. Pipeline to the Other Side 2 8 1-4 Remix (Castle) \nAfter the player has completed 10 Mario Challenge for the first time, any courses that appear in the 10 Mario Challenge will be chosen at random, instead of being predetermined. Course World \nCourse World is Super Mario Maker 's dedicated way to share course creations with the rest of the user base. The sharing system is similar to what was done with Pushmo World and the later games in the Mario vs. Donkey Kong series . Uploading courses is limited to 10 at first, but players will be able to earn the ability to upload more when they are given more stars by players. \nIn order to share a course online, players must be able to complete it, and have access to Miiverse . Players can download, play, and even alter courses made by other players, but they are unable to re-upload those altered courses to the online servers, as to avoid issues of stealing. Once a course is uploaded, players can comment on it, and/or choose to give it a star if they liked it. \nPlayers can also bookmark courses on the official Super Mario Maker Bookmark website, then access the bookmarked courses in the courses section of Course World. \nIt should be noted, however, that uploaded courses that haven't received at least one star within a set amount of days can end up being removed from the Super Mario Maker servers without any warning. The Miiverse posts for the courses will only be removed if the player deletes the courses; if deleted by Nintendo, the Miiverse posts will still be present, but the course IDs will not work. Lastly, any courses that are deleted by Nintendo are blocked from being uploaded again, regardless of whether they get updated. \nAs part of the 1.20 version update , an \"Event Courses\" section has been added to the Course World. Event Courses allow players to play courses created by Nintendo, and potentially obtain Mystery Mushroom costumes as well. Medals \nWhenever players receive stars, they'll earn medals, based on how many stars are earned. Below are all the medals that the player can get, along with the star requirements needed to get them. Even if a course gets deleted, the stars remain. Goomba: Receive 1 star. Koopa Troopa: Receive 50 stars. Allows the player to upload up to 20 courses. Piranha Plant: Receive 150 stars. Allows the player to upload up to 30 courses. Spiny: Receive 300 stars. Allows the player to upload up to 40 courses. Cheep Cheep: Receive 500 stars. Allows the player to upload up to 50 courses. Blooper: Receive 800 stars. Allows the player to upload up to 60 courses. Lakitu: Receive 1300 stars. Allows the player to upload up to 70 courses. Bowser: Receive 2000 stars. Allows the player to upload up to 80 courses. Toad: Receive 3000 stars. Allows the player to upload up to 90 courses. Princess Peach: Receive 5000 stars. Allows the player to upload up to 100 courses. 100 Mario Challenge \nCourse World also features a variant of 10 Mario Challenge, known as 100 Mario Challenge, which gives the player 100 lives to clear a certain number of user-created courses; 8 courses on Easy; 16 courses on Normal and Expert; 6 courses on Super Expert. Courses marked as the selected difficulty (based on clear percentage) are used. Unlike with 10 Mario Challenge, players can save their progress while playing the 100 Mario Challenge, and they can choose to skip a selected course to try another one instead. At first, only the Easy and Normal difficulty levels can be selected, but players can unlock the Expert difficulty by completing the Normal difficulty 100 Mario Challenge at least once, and if they clear Expert once, then the players will unlock the Super Expert difficulty. \nClearing 100 Mario Challenge rewards the player with a random Mystery Mushroom costume. However, there is a limit to how many costumes can be unlocked on a single difficulty level; this in return, means that the player has to complete all the difficulty levels a certain number of times in order to unlock every random costume in the game. \nPrior to the release of update version 1.40, without using any amiibo, the player could unlock up to 95 different Mystery Mushroom costumes in 100 Mario Challenge. The unlock limits were originally as follows: Easy: 20 clears Normal: 45 clears Expert: 30 clears \nAs of version 1.40, additional costumes have been added onto 100 Mario Challenge, which also increases the unlock limits for each difficulty level (except Easy). Normal: 48 clears Expert: 34 clears Super Expert: 5 clears \nIf the player uses any amiibo to unlock the costumes, then the unlock limit for each difficulty level decreases, depending on which amiibo figures were scanned. Also, when the players have unlocked all the Mystery Mushroom costumes at a certain difficulty level, a notice will appear to notify them. Differences from original games \nAlthough the recreations are mostly faithful, each style has some minor differences from its source material (disregarding console limitations, etc.). Some of these changes bring one or more styles in line with others, although this is not universal (for an example of a difference that remains, Koopa shells cannot be picked up in Super Mario Bros. style). General The HUD for all four styles is laid out like the HUD from New Super Mario Bros. U , with the coin counter on the left and the score and time counters in the top-right. An in-game \"second\" on the timer is actually one second, rather than 0.4, 0.6 or 0.7 seconds. Mario reverts to Super Mario in all styles if he is hit as Fire Mario , Raccoon Mario , Caped Mario or Propeller Mario . In the original Super Mario Bros. , Super Mario World and Japanese Super Mario Bros. 3 games, he reverted directly to Small Mario (although in SMW , he could have a replacement power-up stored in the Item Storage , which is absent here). Similarly, if a \"second tier\" power-up is grabbed as Small Mario , he will go straight to the appropriate form instead of only growing to Super Mario , as in Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 3 . As in New Super Mario Bros. U , Mario cycles between his normal and Fire Mario forms when he obtains a Fire Flower and a rainbow cycle when he collects a Super Star . Previously, in Super Mario Bros. , Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World , whenever Mario collected a Fire Flower or a Super Star, he cycled through a set series of different palettes (Mario's current palette and the three current palettes of the other sprites in Super Mario Bros. & Super Mario Bros. 3 ; the palettes of Mario, Fire Mario, Luigi & Fire Luigi in Super Mario World ). Bowser cannot throw hammers ; Bowser Jr. (with wings) has that option instead. However, a Hammer Bro or winged Bowser Jr. can be put on Bowser's head to simulate this. All castle areas end with a boss bridge and an Axe , even in Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World styles (where the original games featured boss fights such that the boss had to be directly defeated to progress). It is possible to jump over the Goal Pole , Axe or Giant Gate ; whereas the original games treated these as touching the goal. The player must now directly touch the goal to complete the course. Anything which happens after touching the Goal Pole, Goal Panel , Giant Gate or Axe is purely cosmetic - Mario does not need to enter the fortress or progress off-screen. Gates and Goal Poles are found inside ghost houses rather than outside. In the Super Mario World and New Super Mario Bros. U styles, Yoshi can be used in the Ghost House , Airship & Castle themes, despite never appearing in or even being allowed in those courses. New Yoshi drum beats were added to match the music. Similarly, new Yoshi drum beats were added to the New Super Mario Bros. U Underwater music, since Yoshi did not appear in underwater courses in either New Super Mario Bros. U or New Super Mario Bros. Wii (where most of the music of New Super Mario Bros. U originated). Thwomps can be stood on, but Mario will take damage unless he is in a Goomba's Shoe or riding a Yoshi. The Ghost House and Airship themes are available in all four styles (Airships didn't appear in Super Mario Bros. or Super Mario World . Ghost houses didn't appear before Super Mario World . As such, new music has been composed for these themes, arranged to fit the styles of the original games [21] .) Interestingly, the Airship's Ground and Semi-Solid Platforms in the Super Mario Bros. style are in a metallic color scheme and design as opposed to wooden and ropey, and the Ghost House's Ground and Semi-Solid Platforms are in turquoise and gray for the Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 3 styles respectively to be consistent with the original games' palette color limitations. Lakitu's Cloud in the Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 3 styles is wider and can be ridden on, consistent with the Super Mario World and New Super Mario Bros. U styles. Mario can swim better underwater when holding an item in all styles that allow carrying items, as in the original Super Mario World . Semi-Solid Platforms in the second phase while using the Ground theme in the Super Mario Bros. , Super Mario World , and New Super Mario Bros. U styles are darker versions of the solid Ground elements. A new cutscene for the 100 Mario Challenge on Normal and Expert difficulties depicting Mario rescuing Peach is created, in the style of arches and a clear daytime sky, and Peach's quote is \"Thank You Mario, You're My Hero!\". The style of the arches are the same in the Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World styles, but toned slightly differently. Also, the alternate cutscene where Mario encounters Toad after clearing the 10 Mario Challenge or the 100 Mario Challenge on Easy difficulty, Toad does not thank Mario, but instead acts more serious about the situation where Peach has been taken to another castle. The Doors now only send Mario to another section within same area, while the Warp Pipes are the only means of transporting him from the main area to the sub-area and vice-versa. When a Monty Mole pops out, its cutout isn't shown. The points of Skewers in the mainstream series were pointed, as the name of the obstacle would suggest. In Super Mario Maker , the points are flattened. They will only cause the course to rumble if coming into contact with Ground, Semi-Solid Platforms, Mushroom Platforms, and Spike Traps. Mushroom Platforms can now be used in the underwater course theme, consistent with other themes, but with stalks in the forms of scales and the caps inside out. 3-Up Moons which were once present in Super Mario World and New Super Mario Bros. U do not exist. Instead, the players reserve up to three extra lives if they clear the course by collecting 1-Up Mushrooms within the course on the 10 Mario Challenge and 100 Mario Challenge. Big Boos who were present in the latter two games do not appear. Instead, Boo Buddies can be enlarged with a Super Mushroom and retain their physical appearances, consistent with other game styles. Lava in the Castle theme in all four styles are across the entire course and at the very bottom and in front of all course elements that can be placed there, instead of being between solid platforms and various heights. Super Mario Bros. The screen can scroll backwards, allowing the player to backtrack, and auto-scrolling is present as an option. The player gets extra height from jumping on an enemy, just like all games since Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels . Hitting blocks and bricks with shells will cause them to break or otherwise react as if Mario were to hit them, consistent with the other styles. Mario can jump through moving platforms and mushroom platforms, as in later games. Beanstalks only work within the sub-level and cannot be used to send a player to Coin Heaven . Visually, beanstalks now have Piranha Plant heads on their tops, making them consistent with other styles. Lava in the Castle theme is animated and trampolines make sounds when Mario jumps on them, much like in the other styles and Super Mario Bros. Deluxe . The Underwater theme is completely underwater, consistent with other game styles. All shells now have spinning sprites. Enemies and ? Blocks do not have different color schemes in underground or castle levels, except for Munchers, Chain Chomps, Bob-ombs, Buzzy Beetles and Bullet Bills, which would otherwise blend in with the black background. Weird Mario , Costume Mario and Goomba's Shoes did not exist in the original game. No timer event exists to trigger fireworks after completing a stage, although a firework SFX exists and can be triggered by Mario walking from the Goal Pole if the level designer includes them. The Underground, Underwater and Castle backgrounds have been given extra details (statues, railings, skeletal remains, seaweed, etc.), when originally only the Overworld had such. This also extends to the Ghost House and Airship backgrounds (lanterns, grandfather clocks, bolts, small flags, etc.), which didn't feature extra background details when shown off at E3 2015. P-Switches and Warp Doors are now present. The Warp Doors in this game's style are similar in appearance to the Super Mario All-Stars version of Super Mario Bros. 3 's doors, but in green. Boss music can now be played, but is taken from Super Mario Bros. 3 's Enemy Battle theme. ( Super Mario Bros. had no boss theme) For similar reasons, the P-Switch's music is taken from Super Mario Bros. 3 . Palette color restrictions do not necessarily apply to newly-created sprites, including the Peach and Daisy costumes (some of the options through the Mystery Mushroom) which feature their signature blond/orange hair and pink/orange dresses. Super Mario Bros. 3 As part of the use of the New Super Mario Bros. U HUD layout, the Power Meter is placed under the coin counter in the top left of the screen, rather than below the playing area. Raccoon Mario can defeat Dry Bones , similar to Cape Mario 's mechanics in the Super Mario World style. Fire Flowers are colored red, rather than white or blue. When Mario touches the goal , he doesn't get a card, as they do not exist in Super Mario Maker . Instead, he receives points for whatever that was displayed in the roulette at the time he touches it. A Super Mushroom is worth 100 points, a Fire Flower is worth 800 points, while a Super Star is worth 4,000 points. A 1-Up Mushroom is added to the roulette to give Mario a chance at getting an extra life instead of points. As of their introduction, Checkpoint Flags can be used in this style, when in the original, checkpoints were not available, due to the shorter level length. Bowser hops backward and forward between ground pounds, rather than merely hopping in place. Mario can exit a Goomba's Shoe by pressing the R or ZR Buttons, as with the Yoshi mechanics in the other styles, rather than being stuck in the shoe until damage is taken. P Switches can be carried, as in Super Mario World . Mario cannot go into the background when ducking on a White Block platform. Instead, Mario will do a short hop in-place and a noise will play. [22] The following power-ups present in the original game are not included: Frog Suit , Tanooki Suit , Statue Mario , Hammer Suit and P-Wing . Instead, the Frog Suit and Statue Mario now serve as Mystery Mushroom costumes in the Super Mario Bros. style. However, Weird Mario in any of the power-ups all present in the original game will appear if the player repeatedly taps the normal Warp Door in Edit Mode. Warp Doors which were originally doorless entryways are swing-open doors based from the Western Super Mario Bros. 2 . The Key Doors prior to unlocking with the Key depict the keyholes in the center as opposed to below the door knob, consistent with other game styles. The Boom Boom and Koopaling Boss music is the only music played for a boss theme. The Enemy Battle music is instead used for the Super Mario Bros. style. When Mario rescues Peach in this game's style after beating the 100 Mario Challenge on Normal or Expert, Peach stands still and does not have her crying pose. Big Goombas split into two normal sized Goombas when jumped on, consistent with other styles. Mushroom Platforms actually take the form of real mushrooms. Originally, there were Wooden Platforms that would take the shape of the latter. Super Mario World There is no Item Storage . The players cannot clear the course just by passing through the Giant Gate ; they must touch the tape. Touching the tape at the very top results in a 1-up, similar to the flagpole in New Super Mario Bros. . Goal Stars do not exist. Instead, Mario receives points equal to one hundred times the number of stars displayed when touching the tape. He can get either 500, 1,000, 2,500 or 4,000 points depending on where the tape is. When Mario passes through the Giant Gate while the Bonus Game theme plays, the ending fanfare will be from this Bonus Game. Upon clearing the Giant Gate , Mario stops and turns to face it, rather than continuing to walk away from it. And if he walks to his ending mark after touching the tape, he will retain his \"peace sign\" pose until the screen transitions. After the course clear fanfare, the whistle sound effect and the iris transition, used in the original game to take the player back to the map, is not implemented. The Midway Gate is replaced by the Checkpoint Flag , as used in the other styles. This is because the Midway Gate is one block wider than the Checkpoint Flag. However, after touching this flag, the sound of the Midway Gate is used. Bowser now features a new sprite that more closely resembles his modern design than his sprite in the original game. He can also be used outside of the Koopa Clown Car, consistent with the other styles. When in a Koopa Clown Car, Bowser will throw Bob-ombs instead of Mechakoopas , as with Bowser Jr.'s second fight in New Super Mario Bros. U . This is also due to the Mechakoopa's lack of presence in the game. Bowser Jr. will throw Green Koopa Shells when in a Koopa Clown Car. The Koopa Clown Car has been scaled down to the size of a Junior Clown Car. Yoshi cannot change Red Koopa Shells into fireballs after eating them. This is consistent with New Super Mario Bros. U , as well as due to the lack of Yellow and Blue Koopa Troopas. Instead, when Yoshi eats a Lava Bubble, he spits three fireballs, similar to the original Red Koopa Shell fireballs. Yoshi can eat fire from a Rocket Engine or Fire Bar and release a single fireball. Yoshi will no longer swallow items that are in his mouth after a set period of time. Yoshi can eat hammers and spit them out. This is consistent with New Super Mario Bros. U . Yoshi can eat coins . This is consistent with New Super Mario Bros. U In the original game, the players got a 1-up for finding a Yoshi Egg when they already had a Yoshi, but in this game, another Yoshi hatches. If two Yoshis are present, the egg hatches into a Super Mushroom if the player is Small Mario , a Fire Flower if Super Mario , a Cape Feather if Fire Mario and a 1-Up Mushroom if Cape Mario . Like Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2 , New Super Mario Bros. Wii , New Super Mario Bros. U and the latter's corresponding style, Yoshi has collision detection, which means Mario will \"push\" him if he runs into him. Yoshi's sprite has green arms, instead of the orange arms in the original. The green is also of a brighter tone, thus making him resemble his Super Mario Advance 2 sprite. P Switches turn Used blocks into Coins and vice-versa in the original game, but here they turn Rotating Blocks into coins. This is consistent with Super Mario Bros. 3 and New Super Mario Bros. U , in which P Switches turn Brick Blocks into Coins ( Rotating Blocks are the Super Mario World equivalent to Brick Blocks ). Also, the P-Switch time limit is shorter, consistent with other game styles. When Mario goes through doors while carrying a P-Switch or Koopa Shell, it does not disappear. Enemies do not transform into coins when Fire Mario's fireball hits any enemy, consistent with the other Mario games. Grinders, Lava Bubbles and Boos cannot be spin jumped on without taking damage. When spin jumping on enemies that get destroyed, Mario will do a maximum height jump off of it, instead of just destroying it. Fishbones home in on the player, as in the New Super Mario Bros. series. Jumping Piranha Plants are taller. This is to keep consistent with the other styles. Bob-ombs and Munchers have more detailed sprites. In the original game, when Mario loses a life, he goes into his death pose, but it isn't animated until he starts flying upwards. In Super Mario Maker , his death pose is now animated from the moment he dies onward. When the timer reaches the last 100 seconds in the original game, the music speeds up uninterrupted while the warning simultaneously plays. In this game, however, the music stops as the warning plays, then restarts with the faster tempo. This is consistent with the other styles. Warp Doors actually open when Mario enters them as opposed to the screen pixelating. The Boo Circle had a mixture of three different Boos in the original, while in this game they are all the same. The P-Balloon power-up is not included. Lakitu's cloud remains and can be hijacked after killing him in any way - in the original game, jumping on Lakitu caused the cloud to disperse. Mushroom Platforms have slim stalks like in Butter Bridge 1 but are lighter toned and have red and yellow cap variations, consistent with the other game styles. Originally, green was the only color for the caps of the Mushroom Platforms. Berry Bushes do not carry Berries, which are absent from the game, and are part of the background in the Ground theme and are not available for course elements. Urchins are absent, but this game style's Underwater theme's Spike Traps take the form similar to those enemies. P Doors are a recolored version of regular Warp Doors (instead of having their own pattern) and have a P emblem on them while active, and have framed lines while inactive, consistent with the other game styles. Originally, there were no framed lines where the P-Switch doors should be. When Mario rescues Peach in this game's style after beating the 100 Mario Challenge on Normal or Expert, she does not kiss him at all. Skewers, which were first introduced in this game have a completely new design and go vertically and/or horizontally, corresponding with other game styles. Mario can now pass through them, but will still sustain damage while doing so. Toad appears in this game's style for the first time, but only in the cutscene after clearing the 10 Mario Challenge or the 100 Mario Challenge on the Easy difficulty. On a side note, the \"Egg Is Rescued\" song plays during this cutscene. New Super Mario Bros. U The HUD is solid white (except for the score, which is solid black) as in New Super Mario Bros. Wii and the beta version of New Super Mario Bros. U instead of the metal opaque color from the final version of the base game. The Goal Pole base was wider than one block in the original game, as well as in reveal build at E3 2014, but it is only one block wide here. Additionally, after jumping off the pole, Mario enters the castle without doing his victory animation, but he'll still say \"Oh yeah, Mario Time!\" before entering. The goal pole will not play the original Super Mario Bros. course clear music when the last two digits on the timer are the same. Yoshi enters the fortress with Mario after touching the goal pole while riding him, rather than Mario leaving him behind and Yoshi waving goodbye. Carriable objects cannot be carried above Mario's head, only at his side like in New Super Mario Bros. and New Super Mario Bros. 2 . Stars don't appear when Monty Moles bump into other ones. The 1-Ups sound has changed. P-Switches can be carried. P-Switches are dark blue rather than cyan. Bowser can destroy breakable blocks with his body and his fire. When eating a fire-based enemy (Fire Piranha Plants and Lava Bubbles), Yoshi will spit out three fireballs instead of one. Yoshi can eat Hammer Bros. Yoshi can swim underwater. Mario can now Spin Jump on Piranha Plants and other spiked enemies. Big Dry Bones can be knocked out simply by Spin Jumping on top of it, instead of having to Ground Pound them (Ground Pounding still has the same effect). When attacking Dry Bones, their heads do not fly off their bodies. Fish Bones do not collapse if they collide into each other. Bullet Bills do not collide with each other. Spin jumping near a flower does not produce a coin. The sprites used here are actually in 2D, rather than the 3D models used in New Super Mario Bros. U (except Mario, Yoshi, Bowser and Bowser Jr.). In part because of this: Some animations have fewer frames compared to the animation's equivalents in said game. Flowers and grass are stationary; they do not move when Mario touches them. Objects and enemies do not dance to the music. Mario does not look directly at any enemies or items whenever he's near them. The face on Lakitu's Cloud doesn't turn when flying, instead facing the screen at all times. There is no cheering or applause during chains of 1-Ups. The following power-ups present in the original game are not included: Super Acorn , P-Acorn , Ice Flower , Mini Mushroom , and Penguin Suit . Grinders were not present in the original game. Obsolete Prior to the 1.20 update on November 4, 2015, power-ups in ? Blocks or Brick Blocks couldn't have status dependency (or couldn't be edited to change depending on Mario's status). For example, a Fire Flower placed in block wouldn't change into a Super Mushroom while Mario was in small form. From 1.20 onward - although the default remains non-status-dependent - dragging a Super Mushroom onto a Fire Flower, Super Leaf, Cape Feather, or Propeller Mushroom will make them show a small mushroom in their lower-right corner. The combined item is status-dependent and can be placed into a block as normal. Prior to the 1.30 update, P-switches were orange rather than blue in the Super Mario Bros. & New Super Mario Bros. U styles, and showed a ? rather than P in the latter case. Updates \nThe following is a list of updates that Super Mario Maker has received. Version 1.01 \nReleased September 10, 2015, Nintendo provided an official description of the update: [23] Added a small Easter egg when making courses. Added a secondary method for unlocking Course elements faster. Adjustments have been made to make for a more pleasant gaming experience. \nWith this update, course sets are unlocked sooner than was planned during development. This is achieved by placing at least 500 items in the Course Maker after all new items are used from a delivery. Version 1.10 \nReleased September 23, 2015, an official description was provided: [23] Note: This update requires about 223MB of storage space. Adjustments have been made to make for a more pleasant gaming experience. \nThis update adds support for official Nintendo courses, including inserting into the game's data the message, \"This course was uploaded by Nintendo, so it cannot be reported.\" . [24] Courses made by Mary O. and Yamamura with this designation were added on, October 14, October 20, and November 4 (the latter before the V1.20 update). [25] [26] [27] Version 1.20 \nReleased on November 4, 2015, update version 1.20 added some new features to the game: [28] [29] Up to two Checkpoint Flags (one for each Sub Area) can be placed onto courses by shaking an arrow sign to add a checkpoint to the course, and before uploading, the player must be able to clear the course from the checkpoint, as well as normally. Flags have rotation arrows, rotating at 45\u00b0 angles. They do not require anchoring and can hover in free space. Players can place a Super Mushroom on top of a power-up to make it status-dependent (if the player is Small Mario, the item is a Super Mushroom, but if they are Super Mario, the item is whatever the mushroom was placed on). By shaking a Muncher enough, Watinga will spawn from it in addition to the flies, and hitting him will allow players to play a more difficult version of Gnat Attack. Completing the hard version of Gnat Attack will unlock the Fighter Fly Mystery Mushroom costume. In the Course World menu, an \"Official\" tab was added to the Makers section, which allows players to find courses created by Nintendo. An Event Courses button were added to the Course World menu, allowing players to access special courses for partners outside Nintendo. These courses can unlock new Mystery Mushroom costumes based on something pertaining to the partner involved. Those that do are clearly marked by a Mystery Mushroom next to the course title. The first six Event Courses were released: Ship Love , Super Bakarhythm Land , Arino Maker , Arino Maker Returns , New! Arino Maker and Tri Force Heroes . For a complete list of event courses, see List of official Super Mario Maker\u200e courses . \nSome additional adjustments have also been made: Players can now skip the segment between courses and the intro in the 10/100 Mario Challenge by pressing \"A\". Players can also skip the loading when Marios are setting up before playing a course for the first time. Some glitches that were present in the previous updates have been fixed. \nCosmetic changes: The \"Featured\" tab and the \"Up & Coming\" tab in Course World's Courses section were renamed \"Highlights\" and \"New Arrivals\" respectively. An easter egg was added to the Course Maker where the player is able to knock on a Warp Door by tapping it. Knocking it enough times causes Weird Mario to answer it in one of five poses, each different depending on the game style. If the player doesn't knock enough times then a loud knocking sound will be heard answering. Version 1.21 \nReleased November 12, 2015, the only official note is that Adjustments have been made for a more pleasant gaming experience [23] Version 1.30 \nReleased on December 21, 2015.

The \"World Record\" and \"First Clear\" are also added for each course in Course World. \nNew Elements: 3 new elements have been added to the game. Shaking a Koopa Clown Car will transform it into a Fire Koopa Clown Car. This will enable it to shoot fire. Shaking a Warp Door will transform it into a P Warp Door. The doors will only be usable when a P switch is activated. Shaking a Grinder will turn it into a Bumper. This donut-shaped object will bounce anything away that touches it. \nCosmetic changes: The ? Switches in the New Super Mario Bros. U theme are now blue P-Switches. This was possibly changed to be consistent with Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World .

Version 1.31 \nReleased December 28, 2015, the only official note is that Adjustments have been made for a more pleasant gaming experience [23] Version 1.32 \nThis was an update solely to \"Fix a[n unspecified] glitch occurring in \u201cCreate\u201d mode\", which had led to the online portion of the game being taken down for maintenance for twenty hours on the 28th of January 2016 [30] . Version 1.40 \nAn update has been released on March 9, 2016, which adds several new features to the game. [31] These include a Super Expert difficulty level for 100 Mario Challenge, along with new Mystery Mushroom costumes. The new Mystery Mushroom costumes can be unlocked by completing the Normal, Expert, and Super Expert difficulty levels, with some of the costumes being exclusive to the Super Expert difficulty level. \nFour new course creating elements have also been added: Shaking a Thwomp will transform it into a Skewer . They will extend to crush Mario at regular intervals and can be positioned horizontally. Shaking a P Warp Door will transform it into a Locked Door. The doors are only usable when unlocked by a Key . Shaking a P-Switch will transform it into a Key. They can be carried to Locked Doors to unlock them, and if one is dragged onto an enemy, it will be dropped when that enemy is defeated. Shaking a Coin will transform it into a Pink Coin . They act similarly to Red Coins , and if all within a course are collected, a Key will appear. \nThree new restrictions on giving out stars were implemented: If a player tries to star a course using another Nintendo Network ID on the same Wii U console as the user who uploaded the course, the game now gives a message telling the player they cannot do that. Players cannot star courses unless they have beat or failed at said course at least once; if the player opens up the interface with the star touch button on it without doing so, the icon will be faded out and un-clickable. Players cannot star more than 100 courses within 24 hours of real life time. Version 1.41 \nReleased March 17, 2016, the only official note is that Adjustments have been made to make for a more pleasant gaming experience.

This update (ver1.43) must be downloaded and applied in order to use the Internet features of Super Mario Maker. \nIn addition, the Mystery Mushroom \" Costume Collection \" the player has obtained can now be viewed directly from the Main Menu, with the Notifications, Options and Manual buttons being slightly shrunk to allow it to fit. \nWhen choosing costumes by tapping the Mystery Mushroom can

Latest revision as of 03:41, 7 December 2017 Mario Strikers Charged Alternate box art used for PAL regions Developer(s) Wii Remote and Nunchuk \nMario Strikers Charged (also known as Mario Strikers Charged Football in Europe and Oceania, and as Mario Power Soccer in South Korea) is a Wii game and the sequel of Super Mario Strikers . This game places a higher emphasis on individual character attributes, by not only assigning stats, but by also giving team captains a Super Ability and the Mega Strike , an opportunity to score up to six goals. Meanwhile, a team itself can be composed of several different Mario species, each with also unique attributes including Skillshots . The game, as its predecessor, also stylistically differs from most Mario games with more realistic sci-fi tones, from the menu interface to the stage designs, in contrast to the more common bright and whimsical cartoon themes. \nIn addition to the local single-player and multiplayer modes, the game also features online regional multiplayer, which uses the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection . Unlike most games that have Wi-Fi features, Mario Strikers Charged 's game data can be copied (but not moved) onto an SD card. However, all Wi-Fi related data cannot be copied. Contents Rules of Strikers and Game Play [ edit ] The title screen for the North American version. Mario performs a Mega Strike in The Vice . \nAs mentioned above, Mario Strikers Charged is based on street football . However, the sport played is much more physical. Two teams of four (not counting goalie) face off against each other to kick the ball into the goal within the time limit ranging from two to five minutes (three as the default amount). They may also choose to compete to reach a certain amount of goals first.When the time runs out, whoever has the most goals (or the next goal, if sudden death occurs) wins the match. If the score is tied at the end of the set amount, the current music will change and the alarm will sound, signaling sudden death. Overall, the game has become much harsher as time has passed. Because of this, players now wear protective gear. Players may utilize various strategies, such as items or special powers, to get ahead. The information regarding use of items and special aspects of stadiums are found in their respective sections in this article. Teams and Player Roles [ edit ] \nEach team is headed by a captain, supported by three offensive/defensive sidekicks and one goalie. Two teams face each other with the aim to score the most points. Points are scored by shooting the ball past the goalie and into the goal. The captain is the leading member of any team and possesses both a Super Ability and a Mega Strike . While often an afterthought, sidekicks are crucial to the game. Knowing which position a sidekick is best at (such as defense or offense) can make or break a game. Goalies, or keepers as they are known in the European version, are the final line of defense. They are permitted to use their hands to block goals, but often are forced to use their bodies to do so. Shots and Skills [ edit ] \nEach type of player has different types of skills available to them. Captains and sidekicks share many of the same abilities, but goalies use a completely different move set. Players use the standard Wii Remote and Nunchuk Attachment set-up to play the game. Basic Captain and Sidekick Skills [ edit ] Players use the standard Wii Remote and Nunchuk Attachment to control their teams. \nMovement/Dribbling: When on the Nunchuk Attachment is pressed, while the captain is not in possession of the ball, the player will move in the corresponding direction. If the captain is in possession of the ball, they will dribble instead. Advanced players can press to kick the ball in front of the character ( chipping ), losing possession, but slightly charging the ball (see more ). \nDeke: An advanced skill for the player with the ball, pressing allows players to fake in that direction, dodging opponents moving in for the tackle or steal. This move allows players to dodge the slide tackles of others as well as maintain the ball's charge for extended periods of time. \nPass: The basic offensive skill, passing the ball from one player to another is critical in avoiding opponents. Also, passing the ball charges it up, meaning that it is easier to score goals once the ball has been repeatedly passed between members of the same team. is used for passing. While not confirmed, it is presumed that the pass can be altered to match a player's style. Such alterations include the lob shot and the stylized midair skills performed by the receiver. \nShoot: A more powerful version of the pass, shooting is for scoring goals. The game automatically targets the goal from the player\u2019s current position when is pressed. Shots can be charged by holding to increase their chances of success. Players can pull off fancy flip shots to shoot if they hold as they receive passes. \nClear: When a player has the ball on their side of the field, pressing allows them to kick the ball to the other side of the field. This technique is effective in situations where the player is crowded by opponents. \nSwitch Players: If a character on one's team has the ball, the player automatically takes control over them, and can change characters by passing. However, when one's team does not have possession of the ball, players may switch characters at will with a press of . This move also works when two players control the same team and their team is in possession of the ball. The player without the ball may swap characters as he or she pleases. \nSlide Tackle: Performed in the same way faking is performed, this move allows players without the ball to steal the ball. Less powerful than the Body Check, it is still a worthy move as players are given immediate possession of the ball afterwards. \nBig Hit: By shaking the Wii Remote, a player can pull of the most devastating tackle in the game. However, this move does not give the user immediate control over the ball. \nMega Shakedown: When a captain begins a Mega Strike (see below), the opposing player can move the meter by shaking the Nunchuk. This makes lining up the meter especially difficult, and may improve a player's chance of deflecting the Mega Strike. Directly attacking the captain is more useful, but the option is not always available. \nUse Items: By pressing , any player may use an item in the team's inventory. Items that activate a captain's Super Ability (see below) can only be used by the captain. Details about the items available are provided in the Items section of this article. Special Captain Skills [ edit ] Mario attempting a Mega Strike. \nMega Strike : More powerful than the standard shot, a Mega Strike is performed when a captain fully charges their shot. To perform this move, the player holds to charge until a meter appears. Through proper timing, the player determines the number of balls as the meter swings to the left (from 3-6, increasing from 4 as it goes left, but overshooting the 6 area results in a 3). When the meter moves back towards the right past the original starting point, proper timing determines ball speed (the small orange area is the fastest, while the surrounding green areas are faster than the gray areas). After the shot specifics have been determined, the captain launches into the air, powers up further and then slams the ball towards the goalie, who then attempts the Mega Strike Block. \nSuper Ability : Each captain may obtain a character-specific item during the course of a game. Pressing the button activates the item. If the player is not playing as the Captain, the computer performs the move instead. Super Abilities are the most devastating when used to free up a captain for the Mega Strike. The background music changes when Mario or Luigi activates their Super Ability. Special Sidekick Skills [ edit ] \nSkillshot : Much like a Mega Strike, the SkillShot is performed by holding down until charging is complete. The resultant shot is coupled with an attack on the goalie. Depending on the sidekick, the shot will be different. Goalie/Keeper [ edit ] Kritter prepares to block an incoming Mega Strike. \nPass: The basic move of the goalie when in possession of the ball, a pass does nothing more than put the ball back into play. \nPunt: The goalie's version of the clear, it allows him to move the ball far away from the goal. This move is effective if the opposing team is surrounding the goal. \nBody Check: Goalies are automatically brutal. If opponents remain in the goalie box too long or make contact with the goalie while he holds the ball, he attacks either by kicking or hitting them. \nMega Strike Block: When a Mega Strike is performed by the captain of the opposing team, it is up to the goalie to block as many balls as possible. The player assumes a first-person view from the goalie\u2019s eyes and moves the to move the hands of the goalie, represented by two hand icons. When a ball approaches, pressing deflects and destroys it. Depending on the speed of the balls set in the opposing Mega Strike, the player has a few seconds for each ball or less. Metallic Ball [ edit ] Yoshi prepares to kick the metallic ball. In this purple state, the ball is the weakest. \nIn previous Strikers tournaments, a ball resembling the traditional soccer in appearance and physics was used. However, for this Strikers tourney, a new, metallic ball is used. \nThe ball tracks how many times it has been passed between players. Its color changes from purple to red, orange, yellow and finally white. The ball is the most powerful when it is white and least powerful when it is purple. In other words, passing the ball between teammates makes it easier to score a goal. If the ball is intercepted by another team or the sequence of passes broken, the ball will begin to power back down, from white to purple. Charging a shot has the same effect as passing, and if one has enough time, one can simply charge a shot and then pass before actually shooting to speed up the ball charging process. Items [ edit ] A Bob-omb explodes to blow the opponents off their feet. \nOne of the most critical elements of a team's strategy is its use of items. Regardless of which player earned an item, any member of that player's team may use it. However, this may not be true of the special items that activate a captain's Super Ability. Offensive Items [ edit ] \nIn keeping with the combative nature of the Strikers sport, the many offensive items at the disposal of players are cinematic and devastating. These items are the most useful in blocking Mega Strikes, clearing the field for a Mega Strike, or to simply gain possession of the ball. Bananas : A staple of the Mario sports series, Bananas again play the role of a landmine. Players who touch a Banana peel fall to the ground and lose the ball if in possession. Bananas come in sets of three or five normal sized items. There also is a bigger version of the banana peel which comes in a set of one, and it does not leave behind three smaller banana peels when someone touches it like it does in Mario Kart: Double Dash!! . Green Shells : Green Shells are the basic projectile item. They do not home in on players, but because they come in sets of three, they are very effective at close range. If they make contact with a wall, they ricochet off. However, they are destroyed upon contact with a player. The player that gets hit falls and is stunned for a brief moment. Giant Green Shells : Unlike its miniature counterpart, the Giant Green Shell is a devastating item. While its movement pattern is the same, it does not disintegrate upon its first impact with an item or player. Any players that get hit by this green shell gets buried and is stunned for an amount of time. Only one can be fired at a time. Red Shells : A more advanced projectile weapon than the Green Shell, the Red Shell homes down the nearest opposing player. They come in sets of three, making them useful both for clearing the field for a Mega Strike or taking possession of the ball. However, not all three always reach targets. Often, one breaks into pieces by hitting a wall. Giant Red Shells : The Giant Red Shell is more robust than the normal Red Shell. It will bounce off of walls for a number of times before crumbling. As soon as it bowls over one player, its homing abilities are nullified and it acts as a Giant Green Shell. Only one can be fired at a time. Blue Shells : The Blue Shell utilizes a similar movement pattern to the Green Shell and also comes in packs of three which are deployed at the same time. Blue Shells bounce off walls until they come in contact with a player or break. The character is then encased in ice, effectively stunning him or her for a few seconds. Giant Blue Shells : Larger than the basic blue shell, the Giant Blue Shell follows the same movement pattern and also freezes characters. They can only be released one at a time. Spiny Shells : While they have the same effects on players as the Green Shells, Spiny Shells are much more durable and will bounce off walls more times than the Green Shell can before falling apart. During this period, they can run over players an infinite number of times. Giant Spiny Shells : The difference between Giant Spiny Shells and Spiny Shells is comparable to the differences between Giant Blue Shells and Blue Shells; they last longer. The movement patterns of both versions are the same. The difference between the types of Spiny Shells is their size. Also, only one can be fired at a time. Bob-ombs : Some of the most devastating items in the game, Bob-ombs come in sets of three or five, deployed in front of the player with the ball, or the player closest to the teammate with the ball. All players caught in the blast radius, excluding the user, are affected by the blast.. They cause tremendous explosions that literally ram players into the field. Unlike in other games, the player who deploys the Bob-ombs cannot be injured by them as they explode on contact with the ground, although their teammates can. Giant Bob-ombs : The largest item-based explosive in the game, the Giant Bob-omb can only be fired one at a time. All players caught in the blast radius, excluding the user, are affected by the blast. However, the size of the explosion is much greater than that of an individual Bob-omb. The blast radius is much larger, although the attack is not as wide as that of three normal sized Bob-ombs. Chain Chomps : While the Mario Kart games had the Thunderbolt item, Strikers tournaments use the Chain Chomp. Systematically attacking every single player on the opposing team by ramming him or her into the ground, the Chain Chomp can easily turn the tide of the game, although it will not hesitate to strike the user and his or her teammates if they are in the way. If the user's team is not in possession of the ball, the Chain Chomp falls onto the pitch right on top of the player in possession. The item is very rare, and it mostly appears if a team is losing badly. Defensive Items [ edit ] \nWith the exception of the Super Ability items, there are only two defensive items in the game. Defensive items beef up the user and are particularly useful for scoring goals without the use of Mega Strikes. Mushrooms : Unlike Super Mushrooms , the Mushroom only makes characters faster. (The size increase is negligible.) This item is especially effective when surrounded by the opposing team. Running can further increase its usefulness. Stars : The defensive equivalent of the Chain Chomp , Stars make players invincible for a short period of time. This item is useful for turning the tide of the game and for scoring any time of goal. To have enough time for a 6-ball Mega Strike , the player should activate it right when the meter appears. Super Ability Items [ edit ] Main article: Super Ability Luigi using his Super Ability. A Super Ability item, represented by icons the team Captain's head, allow the Captain to use his or her Super Ability. The effects of each Super Ability are different. Depending on the captain, Super Abilities can be either offensive, defensive, or both. The Super Ability items are most effective when used to clear a field before performing a Mega Strike as an example Luigi's special item can allow him to stomp on the other team and then use his Mega Strike. The list of Super Abilities can be seen in the Captains ' table. Modes of Play [ edit ] The main menu is set up in wheel-like fashion, and modes are selected with the Wii Remote. \nMario Strikers Charged places a great emphasis on the multiplayer aspect of the game. However, there are also single-player modes present in the package. Road to the Strikers Cup [ edit ] \nDesigned for one to four players, Road to the Strikers Cup is the standard tournament mode seen in all of the Mario sports games. Players are challenged by various teams across three cups. As the mode progresses, its difficulty increases. Alternatively, players can choose to play in Extreme Mode , which makes the game difficult from the start. The mode uses a tournament ladder or the table system seen in Super Mario Strikers . Domination Mode [ edit ] \nTaking the place of Super Mario Strikers\u2019 grudge match mode, domination mode can be played by up to four players. Two teams are created, and players can choose which team they wish to play on. Matches such as 1 vs. 1, 2 vs. 2, 1 vs. 2, and 1 vs. 3 are possible. All four players can cooperate against a CPU player. Striker Challenges [ edit ] \nStriker Challenges is similar to Mission Mode in Mario Kart DS . Each character has one challenge, amounting to 12 total. Most challenges simply involve winning under difficult circumstances (Such as the goalie being very weak to charged shots, the opposing team leading by five points at the start, etc.). Challenges are separated by difficulty, with two classified as Novice, two as Professional, three as Superstar, three as Legend, and two as MegaStriker. Completing each challenge unlocks a new cheat for use in Domination Mode, and also unlocks a card featuring artwork of the player used in that challenge. Each of the 12 Challenges allows the player to play as all 12 Captains. However, only 11 Captains are the opponent, as Donkey Kong is faced twice, which leaves Bowser Jr. out. Before a striker challenge is started, there is an article in the Striker Times based on the event. Nintendo WFC Mode [ edit ] Screenshot of Wi-Fi friend code billboard. \nPerhaps the most anticipated mode, players with access to the Internet will be able to play with anyone in their region though Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection (WFC). For example, a player in Europe can play with anyone in that continent, but cannot play with a friend in America - Nintendo excluded worldwide play to avoid lag. Matches are available for any combination of four players on two teams as long as at least one player controls each team. \nRandom matchmaking is possible for players who choose to play ranked matches. However, it is also possible to play with friends by registering their Wii System Codes beforehand. The downside of this is that points will not be recorded in online ranking. Friend play options are equivalent to Domination Mode options. \nEach player is identified by the Mii of his or her choosing. Using this system, a \u201cStriker of the Day\u201d is crowned based on the player who earned the most points day-by-day in a week time period. Points earned in unranked matches are not counted. These points are scored by winning matches (ten points), scoring goals (one for each goal, but goals after ten in a game do not count), and not disconnecting and taking a loss (one point). The player will lose points if he or she disconnects. \nThe players will be able to choose from any captain to play as in WFC Mode, even if they haven't unlocked the unlockable captains. Characters [ edit ] All the Captains in Mario Strikers Charged . \nEach character has his or her individual advantages and disadvantages. However, strategic team creation can serve to offset the disadvantages and play to each individual's advantages. Additionally, each character also has a theme song that plays when they score a goal and during their home entrance. Captains [ edit ] \nThe captain is the leader of the team and the only character that can perform the Mega Strike. Captains also may receive a special item, the Captain Ability.

Lt. Col. Deo Akiiki, deputy spokesman for the Ugandan military, said Thursday that 281 troops will leave Somalia by Dec. 31. Akiiki said that under an agreement between the African Union and the U.N. Security Council the number of all African peacekeepers in Somalia will be reduced by 1,000 before the end of 2017. Uganda has over 6,000 troops deployed in Somalia as part of the multi-national African Union force. Other African countries such as Burundi and Kenya also contribute to the regional force.

As for Sling itself, it's actually not that bad for the price. With the Roku, there's no more crashing and choppy-ness thank god. And another plus side to having the Roku is that it basically makes your non-smart TV to a smart tv. A whole bunch of apps are already installed onto the Roku. You get a lot of free movies through the Roku unit itself (albiet old and mostly B and C rated movies, but still free so no complaints). So most of the good comes more directly with having the Roku itself and not so much the Sling. The great thing about Sling is now you can DVR all of your shows for $5 with 50 hours of storage which is way better than my cable and yes you can fast forward and rewind your DVR content. The Roku unit can be taken on the go and as long as you have a Wi-Fi connection and a TV that has an HDMI input, you can use it anywhere. Only downside is if you have multiple TV's in your house than you will need a seperate Roku for each TV (and a decent internet speed) if you want to have full access to all of the Roku apps and channels.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 3.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:58.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "81a82717a4502bf2544280d12f47c6165bbfc33f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7u9CaMC2FIUWJlb9Ypy_6M-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "81a82717a4502bf2544280d12f47c6165bbfc33f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7u9CaMC2FIUWJlb9Ypy_6M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "[02:21:54] Siege (siege@sulfur.mednor.net) left IRC.

He also said he is committed to standing up for Canadian values in a \"respectful way,\" including protecting the interests of Canadians behind bars. \n\"Canadians should be under no illusions that a free trade deal with China will be easy,\" Trudeau told reporters before returning to Canada after a four-day visit. \nBefore agreeing to formally start talks, the government wants China to agree to a broad framework that will incorporate its so-called progressive trade agenda that would place the environment, labour, gender and governance issues formally on the bargaining table. \nTrudeau acknowledged that the two countries have a lot of work to do to \"interface\" their different systems in a way that is \"mutually beneficial\" \u2014 a phrase the Chinese are fond of using. He said the two countries have already had good success in partnering on the environment. \nTrudeau suggested that getting China to agree to other parts of his progressive agenda isn't an insurmountable challenge. \n\"Trade has been an essential element in their success in lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and into the global middle class.\" \nInternational Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne stayed behind in Beijing to continue discussions over the last two days while Trudeau travelled south to China's industrial heartland to attend the Fortune Global Forum, a major gathering of international chief executives, which Canada will host next year. \nChampagne was due to return to Canada on Thursday with Trudeau with the trade discussions stalled at the exploratory phase. \n\"There was good progress made and we expect that work to continue in the weeks ahead,\" said his spokesman Joe Pickerill. \nTrudeau acknowledged that difficult discussions lie ahead in addressing concerns when Chinese state-owned companies try to buy Canadian firms. \nThe government faced criticism for allowing the takeover of Norsat by Chinese-based Hytera Communications Co. Ltd. without a full national security review. Vancouver-based Norsat makes radio systems and transceivers used by the American military and other NATO partners. \nAnd it is now weighing a proposal by a Chinese firm to buy the Canadian construction company, Aecon, which has been involved in landmark projects like the CN Tower. \n\"As a socialist economy, China has a significant role for public ownership of enterprises that is simply characteristic of their approach,\" Trudeau said. \nHe future discussions would \"reflect on the challenges, the opportunities, the advantages, the inconvenience when two systems that are different try to collaborate so we can create benefits for both groups of citizens.\" \nTrudeau said he didn't back down from raising consular cases in his meetings with Chinese leaders, including the detention of two British Columbia winery owners involved in a customs dispute. \nTrudeau said he pays closer attention to consular cases than past prime ministers \"perhaps it's because I spent a lot of time backbpacking around the world when I was younger.\" \nThe prime minister also reiterated his support for a free press when asked about a scathing Chinese newspaper editorial that chastised the media travelling with him for unfair coverage of their country. \n\"You play an essential role: a challenge function, an information function,\" he said. \n\"That is a perspective shared by many and it's one that I am very happy to repeat today.\" \nBut he demurred when asked what he thought of China banning access to websites such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and others. \n\"In Canada, we have a different history, a different approach on a broad range of things, and we will continue to stand for the way we do things, and work with people who do things differently.\" \nAs Trudeau travelled back to Canada on Thursday, analysts were underwhelmed by what he accomplished in China. \n\"The visit seemed strangely unprepared,\" said Wendy Dobson, co-director of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, who called the trip \"a missed opportunity to deepen the relationship and diversify our markets.\" \nPaul Evans, an Asia expert at the University of British Columbia, said the trip was \"successful in the minimalist sense\" because it managed to fulfil a commitment by both sides to hold a leaders' meeting each year. \nWenran Jiang, director of the Canada-China Energy and Environment Forum, said the delay in formally starting the talks \"will only further convince the Chinese side that Canada can't get anything done.\" \n\"We can't build a pipeline to the West coast when every reason is there to get it done,\" he added. \n\"We are a country of complacency, without pressure to compete with others; we tend to think we have all the high moral grounds on gender, environment, labour while others are inferior to us.\" \nDespite the differences on trade, Trudeau was warmly welcomed by President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing, as well as various other Chinese officials. And the prime minister returned the sentiment, repeatedly referring to how influential his travels 22 years ago as a student backpacker had been on him. \nHis continued affinity for China appeared undiminished on his last day as he toured a 19th Century temple and witnessed a traditional lion dance by six dancers energetically flailing in three separate red costumes. \nBefore performing a traditional eye-dotting ritual on the costumed head of one of the dancers at the Chen Clan Academy, one of his Chinese hosts declared: \n\"We will awaken the lions.\" \nMike Blanchfield, The Canadian Press", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trudeau", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "xi jinping", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin trudeau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe pickerill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wenran jiang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wendy dobson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike blanchfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norsat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "li keqiang", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada-china energy and environment forum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fortune global forum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of british columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hytera communications co. ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rotman school of management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aecon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chen clan academy", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guangzhou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "british columbia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:58.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cd97a8a9f809b6b0fe759041d90964c3677c23d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9QCjJMm01ny4U2zWncMArrewUvVtYTz3FlyptTRg15wEiuK1XuDyrbTYRikF5.E4brBK5Z6Kjpyhr6ZfcYev_i", "site_full": "www.politicsforum.co.uk", "site": "politicsforum.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.politicsforum.co.uk/forum/viewforum.php?f=101", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Members' Bar - The UK Politics Forum", "title": "I Made My Shed the Top Rated Restaurant On TripAdvisor", "title_full": "I Made My Shed the Top Rated Restaurant On TripAdvisor - The UK Politics Forum", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.988, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cd97a8a9f809b6b0fe759041d90964c3677c23d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9QCjJMm01ny4U2zWncMArrewUvVtYTz3FlyptTRg15wEiuK1XuDyrbTYRikF5.E4brBK5Z6Kjpyhr6ZfcYev_i", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Prosthetic Conscience", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "I Made My Shed the Top Rated Restaurant On TripAdvisor", "text": "Prosthetic Quote: : He didn't get paid for the one I Quote: d.

This was very seat of the pants and we are looking at improving the way we do things next semester. In our case, the students are (as they say in New Zealand) from low-decile schools and don't necessarily have great math backgrounds, unfortunately, so we work with what we have. So our focus is getting them to use KSP to get a visual grasp of orbital mechanics etc without getting much into the math of it (which in doing some internet searching, I see many teachers are doing with AP type classes).\nI'd be keen to hear from any teachers about what worked, what did not work etc.\nAlso, have any teachers out there used the Kerbal Edu mission library? https://kerbaledu.com/kerbalmissionlibrary/\nFinally, is there a way to preload custom scenarios? For example, creating a scenario where we land on a moon or orbit a planet without having to spend the limited class time launching etc. We tried the training scenarios but they are rather bug-filled and inflexible.\nThanks in advance for any and all thoughts.\nEdited yesterday at 05:05 AM by Klapaucius\nForgot to add tags", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://kerbaledu.com/kerbalmissionlibrary/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:59.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4ad30326c4665cfc6f56c9a65386a65a4610edd6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4LzquGRVTO32zS_dZQcEEDlO0Gft28wZdaMlW6gW20Gq1SfiAk7jenMjY4j3defdvBvg-", "site_full": "www.booking.com", "site": "booking.com", "site_section": "https://www.booking.com/hotel/at/gasthof-pension-hirlatz.en-gb.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Gasthof Pension Hirlatz, Hallstatt, Austria - Booking.com ", "title": "413 Verified Reviews of Gasthof Pension Hirlatz | Booking.com", "title_full": "413 Verified Reviews of Gasthof Pension Hirlatz | Booking.com", "published": "2017-01-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 41, "participants_count": 39, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://t-ec.bstatic.com/static/img/facebook-image-else/566c7081f1deeaca39957e96365c3908f83b95af.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 105, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "92a402087ff95d70c402e98fc0cda738e8175f6e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4LzquGRVTO32zS_dZQcEEDlO0Gft28wZdaMlW6gW20Gq1SfiAk7jenMjYZUAc7vEz7DpDKzft4a9GH1Rj8z..8Xvq4DkzIlq67JQZkYs0uNA9Xg--", "ord_in_thread": 41, "author": "Chen", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "\"A cozy stay and worthy for the price.\"", "text": "\ub209 Not a complain here but sound isulation is not good.

They start to close off. They start to get fearful,\" he added. \"If that continues to happen, make no mistake about it, we will all lose.\" \nTrudeau didn't mention the Donald Trump administration in Washington, but he's already spoken out in China on the need to save the North American Free Trade Agreement from demise. He was delivering the message to a gathering of business leaders meeting under the banner of \"Openness and Innovation: Shaping the Global Economy,\" that brought together the chief executives from the world's biggest companies. \nIn his speech, he singled out China as kindred economic spirit, saying it is \"well aligned\" with Canada to fight for liberalized trade. \n\"In this new era, we refuse to get left behind; instead we have chosen to lead. We know there are significant disruptions around the world, in our workplaces, within our borders in our countries.\" \nCanada and China are still working towards starting formal free talks, a task that has been given to International Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, who stayed behind in Beijing where Trudeau held meetings earlier in the week. \nTrudeau's meetings in Beijing with China's top leadership failed to move Canada-China free talks forward from a long round of exploratory talks to the start of formal negotiations. But both countries say economic bonds are stronger than ever as Trudeau was warmly welcomed by President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing. \nTrudeau had separate meetings and dinners with Xi and Li before jetting south, where he spent the first of two days glad-handing with business leaders from Fortune 500 companies. \nTrudeau renewed his friendship with billionaire Jack Ma, the founder of the Asian e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba, who praised the prime minister for a new policy that will speed the Canadian visa process for skilled workers. \n\"It's going to be huge news among the Chinese young people,\" Ma told him. \nThey have gathered at a 36-story luxury hotel that shoots through a dense haze overlooking the Pearl River, the grand waterway that winds through the busiest industrial concentration of companies on the planet \u2014 70 million people in nine southern Chinese cities. \nCanada is no slouch either, the prime minister said. \n\"We're becoming the go-to economy for ambitious companies looking to take their business to the next level,\" Trudeau said in his keynote address. \nHe said Canada is becoming a world leader in artificial intelligence, robotics, and quantum computing. He said Canada is a stable and predictable destination for investment with a good banking system. \nThe prime minister made it clear he wants Canada to move forward with the trade talks with China but said there needs to be an agreed framework that includes progressive elements such as gender, labour rights and the environment. \n\"China and Canada share the belief that more openness and more collaboration is the right way forward. Closing our doors will only hurt our businesses, and our citizens,\" Trudeau said. \n\"The old model won't cut it anymore.\" \nTrudeau began Wednesday with a meeting of Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang, who decried the forces of protectionism as like living in a \"dark room.\" \nTrudeau displayed a fond nostalgia for this city, which he visited 22 years ago he was a student backpacker. He told Wang the connections between this city and Canada run deep because many of the earliest Chinese immigrants came from this region. \nHe returned to Shamian Island, a beautiful tree-lined garden oasis in the city, where families with young children, millennials, and many others strolled on the square cobblestone boulevard lined with green and pink foliage under a canopy of Banyan trees. \nTrudeau said he vividly remembered walking the streets of the picturesque neighbourhood, in what was once the city's embassy district, during a visit with the Li Xi, the secretary of the Communist Party of Guangdong province, at an ornate yellow Spanish Colonial guesthouse with stained glass windows. \nTrudeau capped a whirlwind day by marking a much darker memory in the history of another city much closer to him: he took part in a candle lighting ceremony at the Canadian consulate to mark the 28th anniversary of the 1989 massacre at Montreal's Ecole Polytechnique, where a gunman killed 14 women. \nMike Blanchfield, The Canadian Press", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "xi jinping", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack ma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "francois-philippe champagne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "li xi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wang yang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin trudeau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike blanchfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "li", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "li keqiang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trudeau", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fortune global forum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alibaba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecole polytechnique", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "communist party", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "guangzhou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shamian island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pearl river", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guangdong province", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guangzhou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montreal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:59.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2f051e0a3c69f3a122eb68ae69b179d7f2a03be2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT.JzkJu_t78zmWOpzDvXSK2uWOeDggAq_2V0cJC.sLcFNxHcW8J4.msaFsBznYVP8-", "site_full": "play.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://play.google.com/store", "site_categories": ["media", "hobbies_and_interests", "comic_books"], "section_title": "Android Apps on Google Play", "title": "Sling TV", "title_full": "Sling TV - Android Apps on Google Play", "published": "2017-11-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 39, "participants_count": 40, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "50d996b083b51b71ac6301b9465c6aba75b1d1b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT.JzkJu_t78zmWOpzDvXSK2uWOeDggAq_2V0cJC.sLcFNxHcW8J4.mOWt58kpsceSonrqw4Bfh0BUrxbV7XvcweyTriHQVMcEdjj2PcHXgjmGFyQ6oRKN_XUreDA4DDpiBJ321CvoW78hBKoxPGuKzIhn9wB2q3kGQoYvihRqLRi5q1luy5xPrm1_XaWiiw7nFGQ.ONwywyv7wpvzezDFAAFlnFV1TZAqKhC2eRgXwkgEfGE3OxtY5QRboiWIaaHA-", "ord_in_thread": 17, "author": "Roger Carter", "published": "2017-11-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I switched to Sling TV and I like it.

Priorities need to change were we spend our taxes. Fuck Kim over in Korea, the true dangers and the real threats to us all are here, within our borders. Is not the rape of babies and children a priority for the UK ?\n\nAs for you judges - crimes such as those below, were children under 10yrs are abused, it is time you began to give mandated 25yr sentences. We need a zero tolerance message here sent out to the world. Theses sentences do not fit the crime here whatsoever, G \n\n                                              \nStephen Stott, 23, and Dean Jones, 34, were arrested following US investigation Homeland Security discovered paedophiles using video conference software Watched horrific child pornography featuring babies as young as 12 months old Stott was jailed for 32 months after he admitted number of offences including making and distributing indecent images and possessing extreme pornography  Jones jailed for nine months after he admitted similar charges linked to videos They were both also accused of conspiracy to perform a sexual act on a child. Two 'warped' British paedophiles who used a conference calling app to watch films of children being raped have been jailed following an international investigation. Stephen Stott, 23, and 34-year old Dean Jones were held after investigators from Homeland Security in the US discovered paedophiles were using video conference software to watch horrific and explicit child pornography together. Using pin numbers, up to 50 paedophiles at a time would log onto a chatroom via the app to see boys and girls being raped live - with some horrific film footage featuring babies just 12 months old. \nSource - http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5151477/British-paedophiles-caught-security-services.html ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paedos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dean jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen stott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "homeland security", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:00.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9b574ef973721ab25854e699c08c71f16447d26d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8SN9il7cGGTt7g.TSvhBp_rg.gonE.pEcRM2dRaMvIrCG_3RjWhndtkkH1130gpI-", "site_full": "www.dpreview.com", "site": "dpreview.com", "site_section": "https://www.dpreview.com/forums/1033", "site_categories": ["photography", "hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Panasonic Compact Camera Talk Forum: Digital Photography Review", "title": "RX10 owner needing more reach: Does it make sense to pickup an FZ1000 these days?:", "title_full": "RX10 owner needing more reach: Does it make sense to pickup an FZ1000 these days?: Panasonic Compact Camera Talk Forum: Digital Photography Review", "published": "2017-11-24T04:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1469, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9b574ef973721ab25854e699c08c71f16447d26d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8SN9il7cGGTt7g.TSvhBp_rg.gonE.pEcRM2dRaMvIrCG_3RjWhndtkkH1130gpI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Digital Nigel", "published": "2017-11-24T04:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "RX10 owner needing more reach: Does it make sense to pickup an FZ1000 these days?:", "text": "Quote: :\nQuote: :\nA shop display model has had a vast amount of users of all age groups many without any clue on how to handle the kit or much concern how it is handled.\nMaybe you have a different understanding of what I mean by display model.

In order to maintain its leadership on this market, Orange Belgium decided last year to invest in new IoT technologies based on international standards. Today Orange announces the availability of Narrow Band-IoT (NB-IoT) and LTE-M technologies, so called 'Mobile IoT', on the whole Belgian territory, reaching nationwide coverage both indoors and outdoors. \nThe NB-IoT and LTE-M technologies are Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) cellular network layers that will allow millions of everyday objects to be connected to the Internet of Things (IoT). LPWA technologies offer many advantages when connecting objects to the Internet of Things, such as extending the battery life of the connected equipment by up to 10 years thanks to low energy consumption, or drastically reducing the cost of the radio modules inside the devices that need to be connected. Smart furniture, smart parking and asset tracking for instance become possible. \nOrange turns Belgium into a Mobile IoT test lab by launching the first nationwide LPWA cellular network in Belgium \nToday Orange Belgium announces the nationwide roll-out of Mobile IoT on its network, as committed 1 year ago. \nThe Mobile IoT technologies bring a different approach to LPWA technologies. Apart from the extended battery life and the minimal cost of the radio modules, NB-IoT and LTE-M: \nalso enable full bidirectional communication between the object and the network allowing firmware software updates over the air; \nhave the best possible mobile coverage (up to +20dB compared to 2G/4G coverage), considerably improving signal penetration inside buildings; \ncan rely on a guaranteed connectivity abroad (roaming) on other operators' Mobile IoT networks; \nAnd they are the safest solution for IoT connectivity as it operates in licensed spectrum. Moreover, the SIM card offers secure connections thanks to LTE networks' unique capabilities in terms of authenticating and encrypting the data in transit. \nGabriel Flichy, Chief Technology Officer of Orange Belgium, explains: 'The choice for Mobile IoT technologies is future-proof as it is fully consistent with the future evolution towards 5G. It will then be possible to connect objects that require very high reliability e.g. for the remote control of critical devices and automation processes. Today we are already using our Mobile IoT network together with the Flemish government for a project with connected bikes in collaboration with our partners Huawei and Sensinxs; IMEC is testing a smart plug project as part of Antwerp's City of Things program and we have teamed up with CommuniThings for smart parking solutions. We invite all application developers, system integrators and early adopters to test the advantages of Orange Mobile IoT network.' More info via the website business.orange.be/iotstarterskit or via [email protected] \nOverall Mobile IoT will act as the catalyst for companies to establish connections that would not have been viable with existing technologies.

The NATO allies are divided by a series of decades-old issues, including territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea, and have come to the brink of war three times since the early 1970s.\nLATEST SFGATE VIDEOS   Whole Foods' first 365 store opens in the Bay Area sfgate Sen.

I get that, but let's now quickly do what is necessary,\" Erdogan told Pavlopoulos. \"Many things have changed in 94 years. If we review these, I believe that all the sides will agree that so many things have to (change.)\"\nThe spat continued during Erdogan's appearance at an unusually candid joint news conference with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.\nThe two listed a series of grievances their countries have with each other, including religious and minority rights, the divided island of Cyprus and the case of ten Turkish servicemen who have applied for asylum in Greece following a Turkish government crackdown after a failed coup last year.\n\"It is very important to strengthen our channels of communication, and this can only happen on the basis of mutual respect,\" Tsipras said.\nThe prime minister said the two also discussed tensions in the Aegean Sea, where Greece complains Turkish fighter jets frequently violate its airspace.\n\"The increasing violations of Greek airspace in the Aegean and particularly the simulated dogfights in the Aegean pose a threat to our relations, and particularly a threat to our pilots,\" Tsipras said.\nFor his part, Erdogan insisted once more that the Lausanne treaty needed to be reviewed, but stressed his country had no territorial claims on its smaller neighbor.\nOn the topic of the Muslim minority in Greece \u2014 which the country recognizes only as a religious minority, while Turkey has long pressed for better rights \u2014 Tsipras said his government agreed that improvements must be made in their quality of life.\n\"But issues that concern reforms involving Greek citizens are not an issue of negotiation between countries,\" he said.\nTsipras noted it was unclear exactly what Erdogan was seeking with his call to update the 1923 treaty.\n\"The truth is I am a little confused about what he is putting on the table,\" he said.\nGreeks have been aghast at Erdogan's previous comments over possibly revising the Lausanne treaty, fearing that could harbor territorial claims.\nErdogan and Tsipras also sparred over Cyprus, a Mediterranean island divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion into a Turkish-occupied north and an internationally recognized Greek Cypriot south. Another round of internationally-brokered peace talks to reunify the island failed earlier this year.\n\"Who left the table? Southern Cyprus did ... we want the issue to reach a fair and lasting solution but that is not southern Cyprus' concern,\" Erdogan said.\nTsipras retorted: \"My dear friend, Mr. President, we must not forget that this issue remains unresolved because 43 years ago there was an illegal invasion and occupation of the northern part of Cyprus.\"\nErdogan also raised the issue of Athens having no official mosque, to which Tsipras responded by saying Greece had restored several mosques around the country, including a centuries-old mosque in Athens.\nThe refugee crisis appeared to be the only issue the two sides did not disagree on, with both noting they had shared a significant burden of the migration flows into the European Union. More than a million people crossed from Turkey through Greece at the height of the crisis.\nLater Thursday, several hundred leftist, anarchist and Kurdish protesters held a peaceful march through Athens against Erdogan's visit.\nOn Friday, Erdogan will visit the northeastern town of Komotini to meet with members of Greece's Muslim minority.\n____\nSuzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, Derek Gatopoulos and Nicholas Paphitis in Athens contributed.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "erdogan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexis tsipras", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "muslim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lausanne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:00.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2f051e0a3c69f3a122eb68ae69b179d7f2a03be2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT.JzkJu_t78zmWOpzDvXSK2uWOeDggAq_2V0cJC.sLcFNxHcW8J4.msaFsBznYVP8-", "site_full": "play.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://play.google.com/store", "site_categories": ["media", "hobbies_and_interests", "comic_books"], "section_title": "Android Apps on Google Play", "title": "Sling TV", "title_full": "Sling TV - Android Apps on Google Play", "published": "2017-11-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 39, "participants_count": 40, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9ba65ac084fabdec14fa5f82637950f85041ff81", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT.JzkJu_t78zmWOpzDvXSK2uWOeDggAq_2V0cJC.sLcFNxHcW8J4.mOWt58kpsceSonrqw4Bfh0BUrxbV7XvcweyTriHQVMcEdjj2PcHXgjpWK9OCIjK41Kyp1vkFqLFaJC49fUkhL6TV5hLn87ynHN03fydJWEKIOiRBKLRLNmx2vX4WQFAgranupBjw4QGnoyvXF54GOMIk7Njlo6tD7ERCAs6zx9Ui1bxYB8kjwe2Blofo3sEa.nUqbSJzC7jA-", "ord_in_thread": 23, "author": "GA GU", "published": "2017-11-30T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "New upgrade killing it completely , can't forward or rewind.

A woman named Kecia Johnson has revealed how she was infected with JOB which eventually developed to full blown AIDS. She reportedly said she was infected by a popular Houston rapper who never mentioned to her that he had the virus. Here is what she reportedly wrote\u2026 \u201cAt the time, I was a sophomore at Sam Houston State, planning to pledge Alpha Kappa Alpha and ride out my college experience. But, I was also at that point in life where I longed to have Prince Charming sweep me off my feet so we could live happily ever after. Admittedly, I felt that without this element of my life, I was incomplete. I was a broken, lost, and scattered soul \u2013 not at all prepared for what I was about to endure. He was a well-known Houston area rapper. He was charming and well-connected and from the moment we met, we were inseparable. He introduced me to my first job in the music world as a promotions assistant and I eventually climbed the ladder and became a manager. Being around musicians wasn\u2019t new to me. My father was a successful writer and I grew up around artists like Mint Condition and Prince. But the hip hop world was an entirely new beast, and I was completely submerged in it. Our life was filled with power, sex, drugs, and strip clubs. I got anything I wanted \u2013 designer clothes and shoes and entry into the hottest parties. I was rubbing elbows with the biggest names in music and the lifestyle pulled me in. So, when the cheating, lies, disrespect, emotional and mental abuse started, I had no exit plan because I constantly pacified the severity of our unhealthy relationship. Our relationship came to an abrupt end when I found out through a mutual acquaintance that he had impregnated another woman. That was the last straw and I finally left him. A few months later, I passed out in the shower. When I woke up, the paramedics were doing their best to keep me conscious. After being released from the hospital that day, I went back home still not feeling like myself. I had chills so bad, I was shaking like a leaf. I had a fever of 105 and I felt as if my body was starting to leave earth, and I was powerless to stop it. I tried over-the-counter medicines to bring my fever down, but nothing worked. Eventually, I was rushed back to the hospital where I fell into a partial coma. Kecia is said to be diagnosed with AIDS, and has began taking medication. She\u2019s doing much better, report saysnow.

The teacher used a speed radar monitor and posted the results on Twitter, clocking drivers between 30 and 56 mph. \nCrosswalk posts were recently placed in the street near the school, but Balto says drivers would hit them and knock them over. \nHe placed the Brady images on the posts with the hope that people would slow down. And Balto says it \"absolutely\" worked. \n___ \nInformation from: The Boston Globe, http://www.bostonglobe.com \nThe Associated Press", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom brady", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sam balto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "boston globe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england patriots", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "roxbury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:01.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "01a6e9f9ec7969c60df8fcae35813b04fff712a1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT.JzkJu_t78zmWOpzDvXSK2uWOeDggAq_2V0cJC.sLcFNxHcW8J4.mEega9mlqnQyufE8vVYmXVsDJIR8n73oW", "site_full": "play.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://play.google.com/store", "site_categories": ["media", "hobbies_and_interests", "comic_books"], "section_title": "Android Apps on Google Play", "title": "Google Chrome: Fast & Secure", "title_full": "Google Chrome: Fast & Secure - Android Apps on Google Play", "published": "2017-11-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 39, "participants_count": 39, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dcb78767e3fe2eb996ba8aff0f1592f97edf18d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT.JzkJu_t78zmWOpzDvXSK2uWOeDggAq_2V0cJC.sLcFNxHcW8J4.mEega9mlqnQyufE8vVYmXVs1kMFTd1BjLVvbEuQw8KQpzT0czmgoL4ti4Se4JVOGn0Rv7HcgX5xpj3KpHFt3kWJ5OraVHIhORnKUz_UyrNWjsYYYbNCOmARZP3EFQBTyFeXK1YvXIKS8LU.6knqvDCFnFunQITqAbe8HJLZ7.xyYP18Jpxr8f94Zo.9ix6DcYQ_4T7HhrgqAhmfx80ypiww--", "ord_in_thread": 20, "author": "Shivdatta Patil", "published": "2017-11-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I like Google Chrome for browsing it supports all desktop and mobile sites.
