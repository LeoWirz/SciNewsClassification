REUTERS/Eric Gaillard - LR2EB5I1KYAOB Rachel Brosnahan was certain she was close to death when she flew to Los Angeles just for the chance to audition for a new gig. The 26-year-old Wisconsin native, who starred as Rachel Posner in Netflix\u2019s political thriller \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d was hoping to nab the role of Miriam Maisel, a 1950s housewife who finds solace in the all-boys club of standup comedy. But she had the flu during her trip to LA, and she believed impressing married team Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino, the creators behind \u201cGilmore Girls,\u201d would be impossible. However, the actress succeeded, and she\u2019s starring on Amazon\u2019s \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d to rave reviews. \nFox News spoke with Brosnahan on taking inspiration from two iconic comedians, how Hollywood can do better and how she survived \"the plague.\" \n[SPOILER ALERT: THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS INFORMATION ABOUT THE PLOT OF 'THE MARVELOUS MRS. MAISEL'] \nFox News: It looks like Netflix is pulling the plug on \u2018House of Cards\u2019 after Season 6. Are you sad to see the show go? Rachel Brosnahan: It\u2019s a wonderful show with so many incredible talent. And it\u2019s a show that changed my life. It\u2019s a character that I loved dearly. I\u2019m sad to see it go, but they\u2019ve left a beautiful piece of art behind. \nFox News: It\u2019s been said you had \u2018the plague\u2019 when you auditioned for the role of Miriam Maisel. Brosnahan: Yeah! I had come down with what may have been the worst flu I\u2019ve ever had in my life. You know when you have the normal flu, you start to see the light after three-four days? \nAbout 10 days later, I still couldn\u2019t get out of bed, which was horrible. But I rallied way too soon and showed up in LA drenched in sweat, feeling like I was under water. I didn\u2019t want to shake anyone\u2019s hand because I was very contagious. I blacked out for the whole thing. I don\u2019t remember anything. But it must have gone OK because here we are! \nFox News: You studied the works of Phyllis Diller and Joan Rivers , two successful comedians who are no longer with us. Why these two? Brosnahan: They were pioneers. These were trailblazers. These were women who questioned and challenged what it meant to be a woman at the time when that wasn\u2019t accepted or encouraged. They talked about subjects that were taboo. They were extraordinary. \nFox News: How does this show address what women may be going through today? Brosnahan: Period pieces hold up a mirror to the world that we live in\u2026 But this show is more so about a woman finding her voice. And it is about a woman pursuing standup. And so, I think that through her journey to finding this new voice, you\u2019ll see it explores a lot of the issues and battles that women are still fighting today. \nFox News: Are there enough female comedians being represented today or can Hollywood do better? Brosnahan: Hollywood can absolutely do better. We can always do better. There are a handful of female comedians who were able to break through, but there are so many more voices out there with so much more to say. I hope to see us continue to do better moving forward. A post shared by Rachel Brosnahan (@rachelbrosnahan) on May 25, 2017 at 8:20am PDT \nFox News: It\u2019s been said you would rather die than get on stage and perform comedy. Brosnahan: Yes, absolutely. It\u2019s a terrible job. I don\u2019t know why or how people do that. It\u2019s so vulnerable. I can\u2019t imagine putting yourself\u2026 out there like that. I bow down to standup comics and they\u2019re insane. \nFox News: How has your character\u2019s confidence impacted you off-camera? Brosnahan: Hugely! I\u2019m somebody who hasn\u2019t really felt fairly confident in my own life. Obviously, I\u2019ve gone through periods of insecurity and anxiety. But when it comes to my work, that\u2019s something I\u2019ve always struggled with a little bit more, the confidence. It\u2019s something I really care about a lot. I think it\u2019s only natural. \nBut I\u2019ve never played a woman who is this confident, and I feel it\u2019s important to see that represented today. It\u2019s also been really important for my own growth. I think you always carry a little bit of your character you\u2019ve ever played with you. And I hope I\u2019m able to carry some of Mrs. Maisel with me.

Only prior if you have things to protect then yes get one. But when dealing with two countries you may want to get one in both countries as the other country will not likely honor or enforce what was done in the other.\n9 hours ago, Chris Duffy said: I strongly suggest a prenup if you have assets. Or if the person you are marrying has to pay child support\nI am in Texas and if your spouse signs a pre nup then if your ex tried to take you to court to get a modification on child support payment, the judge would just laugh at them and tell them that a pre nup prevents the court from taking other spouses income into consideration.\nThis is completely wrong a prenup does nothing to stop child support modification. Child support never ever is prevented with a pre nup.\n9 hours ago, Chris Duffy said: Your laws would over rule US laws on marriage.\nFor Example: My wife is from Philppines, Which Philippines divorce is illegal and doesn't exist. So if we are in USA and my wife files for divorce in USA and get granted US divorce. Her country would not recognize it. And if she went back home and got married there she would probably get arrested for bigamy. I have seen this happen before.\nThis again is not entirely true. If your wife files for divorce as a permanent resident the PI will not recognize it. If she files after she because a USC they will.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations":

By forcing bulbs you are convincing a spring bulb that it has slept through the winter months and are encouraging it to bloom early. It\u2019s wonderful to have bright blooms and sweet scents during the grey and drab days of winter.\nForcing bulbs is not too difficult. It just takes time, patience, and a little advance planning. It may be a little late to start forcing some types of bulbs for this winter, but some bulbs are ready to go and need no advance planning! Here are some easy steps to getting your own beautiful indoor blooms.\nStep #1 \u2013 Select Your Bulbs Many bulbs require pre-chilling in order to grow indoors (35-40\u00baF is recommended \u2013 like in your refrigerator!). The catch here is that many ripening vegetables and fruits, especially apples, release ethylene gas, which can kill or damage the flowers, so if you store produce in your refrigerator, try a partially heated garage instead or use bulbs that do not require pre-chilling. Here are some suggestions for bulbs that work well for indoor forcing:\nAmaryllis (requires no chilling) Hyacinth (12-16 weeks of chilling) Tulip and daffodil (12-16 weeks of chilling) Crocus and grape hyacinth (12-14 weeks of chilling) Paperwhite narcissus (Requires no chilling) Autumn crocus or Colchicum autumnale (Requires no chilling) Dutch Iris or Iris reticulata (Requires no chilling, but should be fed every 2 weeks) Bluebells or Scilla (Requires no chilling) Step #2 \u2013 Prepare Your Bulbs There are several methods for growing bulbs indoors. Here are the most common: \nPebbles & Water: Simply take a clear glass bowl, fill it with gravel or decorative stone. Firm the base of the pre-chilled bulbs into the pebbles until they stand firmly on their own. Next, fill water up to the base of the bulbs, but not high enough that it touches them (about 1/8 away). Keep it in a cool, dark location for a few weeks until they\u2019re ready to bloom to help maintain strong stems and encourage root growth.\nWater Forcing: There is an hourglass-shaped vase you can buy called a \u2018Hyacinth Glass\u2019. Simply fill the container with water, up to the tapered neck, set the pre-chilled bulb on the widened mouth of the container and it\u2019s ready to grow. Again, do not let the bulb touch the water. Place bulbs in a dark, cool place for a few weeks before blooming.\nPotting in Soil: Shallow pots are usually used for forcing, but you can use most any container, if it has holes for drainage. Fill the pot about 3/4 full with a peat based potting mix. Squeeze in as many bulbs as you can fit. You can use all one type or mix and match, but choose bulbs with a similar bloom time. Plant the bulbs flat side down and cover with potting mix. Leave the shoot tips poking out slightly above the soil line. Water until it comes out of the drainage holes. Next, chill the pot and all for the recommended time (above). You can do this by burying it in the ground outside, placing it in your garage, or in a refrigerator. When you bring the pot indoors, keep it in cooler temperatures for a few weeks until it\u2019s ready to bloom.\nStep #3 \u2013 After the Bloom Unfortunately, forcing takes a lot out of a bulb so it may not bloom again for many seasons. Still, bulbs can be planted outside when the weather permits just as with any perennial. Do not remove the foliage until it has turned yellow. The bulbs should never be forced a second time, always start with new bulbs.\nHave some fun this winter and give forcing a try!\nYou might also enjoy our previous blog posts on Forcing Amaryllis and Forcing Hyacinth \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tammy borden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scilla", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:09.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ba3c87856e12226748abfdfa9a80d0c48263ed6b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_kWTFmHec1c6myXrZSSWfZ4hFm4Jq1ot2szZP3sKiDw4MEjTuwWV8nq6nVoefIE4mrqFOdSxbMoA--", "site_full": "www.visajourney.com", "site": "visajourney.com", "site_section": "http://www.visajourney.com/forums/forum/16-off-topic/", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "immigration"], "section_title": "Off Topic - VisaJourney", "title": "marriage law? - Off Topic", "title_full": "marriage law? - Off Topic - VisaJourney", "published": "2017-12-03T06:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://static.visajourney.com/images/uploads/monthly_2017_04/visajourney-logo-social-media.jpg.6e6b1b83deab742607adb9d8628f8e88.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27019, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "88a80d8cdb7909cbc579d615bf0dceaa7f746d6e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_kWTFmHec1c6myXrZSSWfZ4hFm4Jq1ot2szZP3sKiDw4MEjTuwWV8nq6nVoefIE4kZHjLPQ8EIm9UwxHYD1i66", "ord_in_thread": 14, "author": "Ontarkie", "published": "2017-12-04T21:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "2 hours ago, Chris Duffy said: Again you are incorrect\nI was sitting in court about 12 years ago and my ex was trying to get more child support, I had been married a few years and had a pre nup done with my new wife.

Egads, I was in the CBD earlier this week, and ALREADY there were Christmas shoppers out there, running around like headless chooks! With that in mind, I thought I would try and do my bit for a simpler, greener, less stressful holiday season. In no particular order, here are five things that you can employ that will make your holidays more enjoyable, less stressful and easier on the pocketbook! (\u201cThrift-mas\u201d \u2013 you\u2019re welcome).\nLearn the Art of \u201cNo\u201d . You simply don\u2019t have to do it all! Yes, there will be invites to things \u2013 but think of the amount of times that you have said \u201cGosh, I\u2019d really rather not go to XXXX (insert boring social event of your choice)\u201d. Well, don\u2019t! I know you can come up with a lot of excuses as to why you CAN\u2019T say no\u2026. but try and challenge yourself! And by doing that, you can be honouring yourself. Saying no can be done graciously. Here are a few ways to say no politely: Thanks so much for the invite! Unfortunately I/we won\u2019t be able to make it. But have a drink for us! I would really love to come to X, but I have already made plans for that morning / afternoon / evening (NB: even if your plans mean curling up with a book and listening to music!) I am feeling pretty overwhelmed at the moment with all the holiday planning, and I really need to take a step back from all these social engagements. Have a great time and send me a photo! (and thanks for thinking of me). Remember the motto \u201cIt is better to DO, than to HAVE\u201d . If you still have present obligations, remember that the gift of TIME is always an appreciated one! You can prepare little \u201cgift certificates\u201d that provide your friends and family with quality time with you (big night in, complete with movie of choice and popcorn, anyone?), or assistance for people who may need it (\u201cthis voucher good for one hour gardening time\u201d). This can also be extended to providing gifts of experiences, rather than buying more \u201cthings\u201d. Examples are movie vouchers, dinner vouchers, or even sporting experiences that you can share together (trips to the local swimming pool, or an indoor skydive?). Wrap with the REUSE in mind. I always save wrapping or tissue paper when I can. If you ARE wrapping up a gift, try to use wrapping paper that has already had a good life. So much waste is generated during the holiday period, it is good if we can minimise where we can. And no-one is going to care if their gift is wrapped in paper that is on its second life. Trust me. And if YOU get given a gift that has beautiful wrapping paper surrounding it, keep it and reuse it yourself next time! Ditto for the ribbons. Remember those less fortunate. This is a tough time of year for a lot of people. Instead of buying \u201cthings\u201d, think about making a donation to a charity in a friend\u2019s / family member\u2019s name. Or get the family involved in making a \u201creverse Advent calendar\u201d (where you put a new item in every day up until Christmas, then gift that to a worthy charity. One very worthy charity in Perth can be found here ). Get all old school and give home made gifts. Spending some time baking yummy treats and then packaging them up in festive (recycled) ways are always a hit. Made with love, the old-fashioned home baked goodies are definitely appreciated. This year I am doing gingerbread muffins, festive shortbread, and fruit drops. (my first Xmas batch of protein rich bliss balls shown below are already out the door!) Remember to take the time to relax during this festive period. Happy holidays everyone!\nPictured: Home made bliss balls. Always a hit!

Century LLC and The Frisch School, respectively. The buildings were acquired by M&T Bank in its 2015 acquisition of Hudson City Savings Bank. \n\u201cBoth buildings generated a significant amount of attention within the Bergen County community given their desirable Paramus location in addition to their proximity to lifestyle amenities and major retail corridors, as well as easy access to highways and nearby executive housing,\u201d said Cushman & Wakefield Associate Director Frank A. DiTommaso II. \n\u201cEach offering presented unique opportunities for both investors and developers. Ultimately, after a very competitive bid process, two different local users were selected,\u201d said Cushman & Wakefield Vice Chairman David Bernhaut. \nCushman & Wakefield, a global real estate services firm, served as exclusive sales agent for M&T Bank. In New Jersey, the team of David Bernhaut, Andrew Merin, Gary Gabriel, Brian Whitmer and Frank DiTommaso II orchestrated the sale with assistance from the leasing team of David Sherman, David DeMatteis and Mark Zaziski. The deal also involved close collaboration with William Hartman and Lou D\u2019Avanzo based in the New York City office of Cushman & Wakefield. The Cushman & Wakefield team worked directly with Patricia Dore, Administrative Vice President for M&T Bank, and the Bank\u2019s Senior Corporate Real Estate Manager for, among other areas, the Greater New York City and New Jersey Regions\u2019 corporate real estate portfolio. \n\u201cThis is an excellent example of Cushman & Wakefield\u2019s multiple service lines working together to serve the needs of our corporate clients,\u201d said Cushman & Wakefield Vice Chairman Andrew Merin. \nA private entity plans to relocate to 80 W. Century Road and occupy a portion of the space. The remaining available space will be marketed for lease. M&T Bank will continue to operate its retail bank branch at the property, located immediately off of the entrance lobby. \nThe iconic building at 80 West Century Road, offering approximately 70,000 square feet of space on 3.5 acres, drew strong interest from local and regional developers, according to Cushman & Wakefield. The building is located immediately off of Routes 17 and 80. In addition to its ideal location in Bergen County just 15 miles west of New York City, the property offers a unique design and flexible 15,000+/- square foot floor plates that cater to local demand. \nThe single-story, 25,000-square-foot building at 100 W. Century Road was purchased by The Frisch School, a co-educational high school, whose main campus is located adjacent to the property. \n\u201cThis was a natural acquisition for The Frisch School, which has been expanding their operations to meet their growing needs,\u201d said DiTommaso. \nBased in East Rutherford, New Jersey, Cushman & Wakefield\u2019s Metropolitan Area Capital Markets Group specializes exclusively in investment sales of office, industrial, multifamily, land and retail properties throughout New Jersey, New York, and Fairfield County, Connecticut. The team has completed more than $26 billion worth of transactions since 2000, closing over $3.2 billion in sales in 2016. \nAbout Cushman & WakefieldCushman & Wakefield is a leading global real estate services firm with 45,000 employees in more than 70 countries helping occupiers and investors optimize the value of their real estate.

The chief justice, quite properly, I thought, referred that minister to Parliament \u2014 the source of the recently minted Bail Act, which I understand mandates that an accused is entitled to bail. \nThe interesting thing was that when this Act was passed the crime statistics were at the lowest they had been in years. I understand that the law, as it concerned bail for individuals accused of murder at that time, would only be granted in exceptional circumstances. \nIt is fair to say the present position is, it is only in exceptional circumstances, as enumerated in the Act, that bail can be withheld. The accused is entitled to bail. \nThe direct consequence of this is the dramatic increase in the number of individuals who have been killed by accused people who are out on bail. \nThe minister stated that 148 individuals have been killed during the course of this year. In any other country, long before the figures went into double digits, there would have been an outcry, a media storm which would have caused the Government to rethink its policy. \nIt is a pertinent question to ask: If the courts are releasing accused people, who then eliminate witnesses and consequently walk free, why should any accused feel the need to plead guilty? \nAs it stands, even in instances that the witnesses survive and testify, the jurors are tampered with. \nIn the unusual case in which a juror acting on behalf of the accused is caught, that trial is never brought to a conclusion. \nThe Government needs to get serious in dealing with crime and its punishment and stop asking irrelevant and nonsensical questions.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cabinet", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:10.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eefb084bf1dc1c3e0dbace354597aa5faf194794", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DH4fzRhcB2ytvhxNKSp.nbQPB7LA2FJCh1.T4HG2dIAdO76apOMRYX1_ny4klXIBkeg4KvtO.TnAfFrkkjRMRudkGWZOt72_e4jU7n3WsAuoKlj3AO5s.1rQ--", "site_full": "www.huffingtonpost.co.uk", "site": "huffingtonpost.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/feeds/verticals/uk-lifestyle/news.xml", "site_categories": ["politics", "financial_news", "law_government_and_politics", "finance"], "section_title": "HuffPost UK - Athena2 - All Entries (Public)", "title": "Woman Discovers Avocado The Size Of Her Head (Proves Dreams Do Come True)", "title_full": "Woman Discovers Avocado The Size Of Her Head (Proves Dreams Do Come True)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fimg.huffingtonpost.com%2Fasset%2F1200_630%2F5a290ec5140000fe79b6be7f.jpeg&amp;client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&amp;signature=9763835a2f46a99b6f3464a740ca91cff8040110", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3053, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 32, "comments": 1, "shares": 32}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eefb084bf1dc1c3e0dbace354597aa5faf194794", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DH4fzRhcB2ytvhxNKSp.nbQPB7LA2FJCh1.T4HG2dIAdO76apOMRYX1_ny4klXIBkeg4KvtO.TnAfFrkkjRMRudkGWZOt72_e4jU7n3WsAuoKlj3AO5s.1rQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Natasha Hinde", "published": "2017-12-07T12:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "Woman Discovers Avocado The Size Of Her Head (Proves Dreams Do Come True)", "text": "Woman Discovers Avocado The Size Of Her Head (Proves Dreams Do Come True) Imagine the brunch you could have with this bad boy. 07/12/2017 10:00 GMT | Updated 48 minutes ago Natasha Hinde Reporter at HuffPost UK \nA woman en route to buy a newspaper couldn\u2019t believe her eyes when she stumbled across the holy grail of the food world: a giant avocado . \nPrepare to gasp... \u2014 Curley (@cadadj) December 6, 2017 \nPamela Wang was out for a walk when she spotted the large avo on the ground. \n\u201cI see avocados every day, and I pick up avocados every day, but this one ... it was hard to miss,\u201d Pam told West Hawaii Today . \u201cIt was as big as my head.\u201d \nShe has since submitted an application to the Guinness World Records to find out if the avocado is the world\u2019s largest. \nAs you\u2019d expect, the internet is very jealous of Pam\u2019s discovery.

Now, it appears as if he'll have the opportunity to make the leap to Star Wars ... Filed Under: \" Star Wars \" Source: Newshub During the press tour for Thor: Ragnarok , Taika Waititi mentioned that he would probably be \"fired within a week\" of working on a Star Wars movie due to his improvisational style (that's what led to Phil Lord and Chris Miller being given the boot from Solo: A Star Wars Story , after all). However, the filmmaker noted that he would never so no to such an opportunity so could it now become a reality? During a recent interview to promote the release of Star Wars: The Last Jedi , Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy informally offered Waititi the chance to one day helm a Star Wars movie. \"I would love for him to direct a Star Wars movie,\" she said. \"I think he has exactly the right sensibility. It was very exciting to see him step into the Marvel universe and do such an amazing job with Thor.\" Just how well she would respond to Waititi going off script is hard to say but that helped Thor: Ragnarok succeed so perhaps we'll start seeing more unique Star Wars movies in future.

He worked in a program that offers dance, music and other activities designed to give kids safe alternatives after school. \nBut investigators said the 13-year-old girl who reported the assault was not safe with Jenkins. \nHe allegedly met with the girl outside of the school on Monday and she went to his house willingly, a law enforcement source said. That's allegedly where the assault happened. \nThe teen, who attends the school where Jenkins worked, reported the incident to police on Wednesday and that night Jenkins was taken into custody. \nInvestigators do not believe this has been an ongoing pattern. \nJenkins faces multiple charges, including rape, forcible touching, criminal sex act, acting in a manner injurious to a child less than 17, and sex abuse, police said. \nHe's been suspended without pay and won't be allowed to work in any schools, the city's Department of Education said. \nThe agency emphasized that Jenkins does not work for them, but rather for a city program run by the Department of Youth and Community Development (DYCD). \n\"The safety of young people is our top priority, and we take allegations of this nature very seriously. The individual was immediately suspended without pay and he is no longer permitted in any schools. DYCD has suspended funding for the program as we determine whether the provider can continue to operate at this school,\" the agency said in a statement. \nPIX11 News' Anthony DiLorenzo contributed to this report. 40.854655 -73.897036 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jenkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael jenkins", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "angelo patri middle school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bronx", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "webster ave.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "folin st.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fordham heights", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:10.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0b86e6e6c42a552afc51fbc0946b4732859f3ec4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPLDUPglFBFDyj0C6EDQQCJQj6.2gqS9.wXuMQtOxyU.vLuTaYRLGN9JM.6V4ATWTouhxCgaU1kyrkBDfb2ZfGzS5ax8wZObsnQm3FWEEdaxp1EukgF82WkWNbtYCr3TfoiwvDC8XhjnY", "site_full": "www.digit.in", "site": "digit.in", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/digit/latest-news", "site_categories": ["media", "cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "Latest Technology News", "title": "YouTube Rewind 2017: These were the most watched YouTube videos this year", "title_full": "YouTube Rewind 2017: These were the most watched YouTube videos this year", "published": "2017-12-07T05:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.digit.in/default/0cfdce38502fe4d5d79667269d2a6e55ace8a884.jpeg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 5905, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 126, "comments": 0, "shares": 126}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0b86e6e6c42a552afc51fbc0946b4732859f3ec4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPLDUPglFBFDyj0C6EDQQCJQj6.2gqS9.wXuMQtOxyU.vLuTaYRLGN9JM.6V4ATWTouhxCgaU1kyrkBDfb2ZfGzS5ax8wZObsnQm3FWEEdaxp1EukgF82WkWNbtYCr3TfoiwvDC8XhjnY", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "adamya.sharma@digit.in (Adamya Sharma)", "published": "2017-12-07T05:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "YouTube Rewind 2017: These were the most watched YouTube videos this year", "text": "YouTube Rewind 2017: These were the most watched YouTube videos this year YouTube Rewind 2017: These were the most watched YouTube videos this year YouTube has revealed some of the biggest video trends, memes and creators of the past 365 days.

Cortisol is a steroid hormone released by the adrenal glands and helps the body to deal with injury or infection. Increasing levels of cortisol increases the blood sugar and can even cause diabetes mellitus. However the disease is also caused due to excess production of hypothalamus corticotropin re leasing hormone (CRH) which stimulates the synthesis of cortisol by the adrenal glands. The condition is named after Harvey Cushing, the doctor who first identified the disease in 1912. Cushing disease results in Cushing syndrome. Cushing syndrome is a group of signs and symptoms developed due to prolonged exposure to cortisol. Signs and symptoms of Cushing syndrome includes hypertension, abdominal obesity, muscle weakness, headache, fragile skin, acne, thin arms and legs, red stretch marks on stomach, fluid retention or swelling, excess body and facial hair, weight gain, acne, buffalo hump, tiredness, fatigue, brittle bones, low back pain, moon shaped face etc. Symptoms vary from individual to individual depending upon the disease duration, age and gender of the patient. Disease diagnosis is done by measuring levels of cortisol in patient\u2019s urine, saliva or blood. For confirming the diagnosis, a blood test for ACTH is performed. The first-line treatment of the disease is through surgical resection of ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma, however disease management is also done through medications, Cushing disease treatment market comprises of the drugs designed for lowering the level of cortisol in the body. Thus patients suffering from Cushing disease are prescribed medications such as ketoconazole, mitotane, aminoglutethimide metyrapone, mifepristone, etomidate and pasireotide.Report overview @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/cushing\u2026 \nCushing\u2019s disease treatment market revenue is growing with a stable growth rate, this is attributed to increasing number of pipeline drugs.

that a MARC train had stopped south of a station because of an Amtrak train striking a \u201ctrespasser.\u201d That MARC train returned to Martin Airport for bus and taxi service. \nThe Amtrak Northeast account sent a tweet nearly an hour after the reported crash announcing that customers traveling between Wilmington and Baltimore would experience delays stemming from a \u201ctrespasser incident.\u201d \nFurther details weren\u2019t immediately released. \nInformation from: WBFF-TV, http://www.foxbaltimore.com/baltimore_md/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

The ATF letter says marijuana users are prohibited from \u0093shipping, transporting, receiving or possessing firearms or ammunition.\u0094\nAnyone applying to purchase a gun from a licensed dealer must sign a form attesting he or she is not \u0093an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance.\u0094\n\u0093Warning: The use or possession of marijuana remains unlawful under Federal law regardless of whether it has been legalized or decriminalized for medicinal or recreational purposes in the state where you reside,\u0094 the form notes.\nLying on the form is a felony under federal law, punishable with up to 10 years in prison.\n\u0093There is definitely a conflict between the state laws and the federal laws,\u0094 said Joe Eaton, southwest Ohio spokesman for the Buckeye Firearms Association.\nIt\u0092s not clear how to reconcile that conflict, he said, \u0093We are confused as everyone else at this point.\u0094\nWhen Ohio\u0092s medical marijuana program becomes operational in September 2018, Ohioans will be able to register to use cannabis if they have a recommendation from a physician saying they have one of 21 qualifying conditions.\nIndustry analysts have estimated as many of 24 percent of the state\u0092s population \u0096 or about 2.8 million Ohioans \u0096 have a qualifying condition.\nThe conflict between federal firearms laws and state cannabis laws has flared up on other states.\nIn Hawaii, Honolulu police last month told residents who had medical marijuana cards they have 30 days to turn in their firearms to authorities, according to reports in the Honolulu Star Advertiser.\nThe Associated Press reports that a federal circuit court of appeals ruling on a case out of Nevada found that the federal ban on the sale of guns to medical marijuana users doesn\u0092t violate the Second Amendment.\n Medical marijuana users in Ohio can't own or possess guns\nAuthor: Josh

Dom Rep president \nThursday, December 07, 2017 \nThe following is an open letter to the people of Jamaica on the award of a national honour to the president of the Dominican Republic: \n\nDear Editor, \nI was recently appalled to learn that the Government of Jamaica, led by Prime Minister Andrew Holness, has conferred Jamaica's Order of Excellence on President Danilo Medina of the Dominican Republic. \nAny Jamaican Government that is so lacking in racial pride and respect for humanity and civilised values that it would confer a national honour on President Medina of the Dominican Republic \u2014 a political leader who is currently presiding over a racist genocidal mass deportation of hundreds of thousands of Black Dominicans of Haitian ancestry \u2014 has done Jamaica and Jamaicans a grave disservice! \nPrime Minister Andrew Holness and his Administration are guilty of an act of infamy and have seriously undermined the historic and sacred mission of the Jamaican and Caribbean people to be champions of black dignity and human rights. \nSurely Prime Minister Holness knows that the Government of the Dominican Republic has effectively stripped some 300,000 black Dominicans of Haitian ancestry of their citizenship rights and has presided over the deportation of some 200,000 of such people to Haiti over the past two years. \nSurely he is aware that many of these people know nothing about Haiti; have no family connections there; don't speak French or Haitian creole; and have ended up in cholera-stricken refugee camps in Haiti. \nSurely he is aware that the widespread anti-black, racist sentiment that the policies of the Dominican Republic Government have given rise to has led to several black Dominicans being lynched in the Dominican Republic and to a wave of unlawful racist violence against black Dominicans? \nAnd yet he still goes ahead and disgraces the land of the Marcus Garvey, Paul Bogle, Sam Sharpe, Nanny of the Maroons, George William Gordon, Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Rex Nettleford, and Norman Girvan in this manner? \nI humbly and sincerely believe that it is now incumbent on the people of Jamaica to reassert the honour of their nation by protesting this decision and letting the world know of their disapproval and disavowal.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities":

I\u2019ll take the easy one first.\nI\u2019ve never written about bitcoin in this column because, well, it just wasn\u2019t important enough in the great scheme of things. (It still isn\u2019t\u2014 it represents only 2.4% of the $7.6 trillion in coins and bank notes in circulation .) Will cryptocurrencies or electronic cash replace bank notes at some point? Quite possibly, and bitcoin is very innovative.\nBut history shows early innovators often aren\u2019t the ultimate winners of the technological disruption they cause, and bitcoin is as likely to dominate global currencies as Tesla is to prevail in electric, autonomous cars against Volkswagen, Toyota and General Motors .\nAnd bitcoin is in the kind of mania this column spotted before with silver in 2011 and Chinese stocks in 2015 , at the top of those two markets. Consider:\n\u2022 Bitcoin has soared over 10,000% since 2013, and 1,733% in the 12 months ending Nov. 30, giving it a market value of around $170 billion .\nRead: Here\u2019s what bitcoin\u2019s monster 2017 gain looks like in one humongous chart\n\u2022 The Winklevoss twins (you might remember them with a pompous, patronizing Larry Summers in \u201cThe Social Network\u201d) may have lost out on tons of Facebook money, but they put $11 million of their $65 million settlement into bitcoin. It\u2019s now worth $1 billion, making them the first bitcoin billionaires .\n\u2022 More than 100 hedge funds are dedicated to cryptocurrencies, and Kardashian wannabe Paris Hilton and boxing champ Floyd Mayweather have endorsed initial coin offerings . That\u2019s right: C-list celebrities hawking ICOs. Need I say more?\nRead: George Washington used bitcoin, Alan Greenspan says\nOn the mere euphoria side, the FAANG stocks\u2019 recent selloff has caused the Nasdaq Composite Index to fall only about 2%. But Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet have lost more than 5% of late, Netflix is down 8%, and Nvidia has slumped 13%.\nBefore the selloff, the S&P 500\u2019s information technology sector had surged 39% in 2017 (the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF XLK, +0.43% lagged behind), four of the five FAANGs had gained at least 50% for the year, and the FAANGs had a total market capitalization of $2.8 trillion, 10% of the value of the entire U.S. stock market . At one point they accounted for 20% of the S&P 500\u2019s total return for 2017 . Take a deep breath and think about that.\nThe FAANG stocks sold off big in June\u2014and I was premature in saying they\u2019d peaked . They came roaring back, in some cases hitting new highs. This could be another correction that sets them up for even bigger things in the future, or it could be the start of a rotation into other strong sectors like energy and financial stocks, which also have been market leaders.\nOverall, stocks are trading at very lofty valuations , and cash holdings for Merrill Lynch clients are below where they were in 2007 . Margin debt is at a record . Institutional sentiment indicators tracked by Barron\u2019s are wildly bullish .\nSo, what else is new? These indicators have been flashing red for months, and the market has continued to rise. We also haven\u2019t seen the usual signs of mania like stock tips from Uber drivers, shoeshine men, etc.\nThat\u2019s why I think except for manias like bitcoin and the FAANGs, we\u2019re in the early stages of stock-market euphoria. The best\u2014or worst\u2014is yet to come.\nHoward R.

For those uninitiated in GOQii \u2019s offering, it includes a hardware-software pairing that seeks data from an activity tracker and incorporates the same into an ecosystem that comprises of a human fitness coach, doctors among other things. As a part of the new announcement, the subscription of the ecosystem has been extended to family members as well, with the details briefly being as below: Rs. 1999 for up to 2 family members and 3 months duration. Rs. 3499 for up to 3 family members and 6 months duration. Rs. 4999 for up to 4 family members and 12 months duration. \nIn addition to that, members of the same family plan will share a fitness coach as well as be able to book shared doctor consults. All plans are tax deductible under 80D as well. \nAnother part of the upgraded ecosystem is the Active Lifestyle Health Cover - which, essentially, is insurance for injuries incurred during preventive health care . This aspect of the ecosystem is still subject to approval from regulatory bodies. \nAdditionally, GOQii has also launched the GOQii Health Store on the GOQii app. The store includes several health -related categories in partnership with third-parties like: Healthy food ordering (Healthie.in, Herbivore, Fig) Pharmacy (1mg) Supplements (Pure Nutrition, Zenith Nutrition) Healthy snacks (Yoga bar, Sattviko, MO's, Green Snack co) Accessories (Urban buddha, GOQii itself) The GOQii Health Store \nThe best thing about the store is that all your purchases are reflected across the ecosystem - so your coach and your doctor are fully aware of your decisions on the store. Other partners, not exactly on the app, include MapMyGenome and Reset gyms. \nWithin the ecosystem, GOQii has also launched a virtual currency called GOQii cash. You can earn this by maintaining an overall healthy lifestyle in the ecosystem, which in turn can be spent within the ecosystem. \nIn addition, GOQii has also launched a cognitive games section called Games4Good on the app, focused on mental health and stress-relieving. A cognitive game on Games4Good \nAnd at the heart of all this lies the brand new GOQii V3 tracker that sports a colour display, continuous heart rate detection, a 15-day battery life and a new feature known as Presence Plus that allows the tracker to detect other GOQii users around you and give you the option to add them as friends on the app. The all new tracker is set to launch in January \nWith all these announcements, GOQii has pulled off a considerably significant annual overhaul by including insurance into its folds as well. Instead of just providing you with a device to detect and relay dumb data to you, GOQii very clearly aims to be the one-stop incentivised solution for all your preventive healthcare needs. It would be really interesting to see the brand get into the reactive healthcare segment as well, something that founder Vishal Gondal states is not on the cards right now as it does not fall within the use case of the current GOQii ecosystem.

These achievements must be commended. \nHowever, the present Administration must acknowledge that a growth-inhibiting culture may derail targets. For example, several of our young men expect to become wealthy quite quickly, without sufficient work. The disadvantage of such a mindset is that more young people will engage in illicit activities to gain status. This is problematic because many of them are already criminals. \nCulture plays an important role in development, and numerous Jamaicans are unable to delay gratification, which unfortunately is a feature of what sociologists would call a \u201cprogress-resistant culture\u201d. A progress-resistant culture is the opposite of a progress-prone culture. In the latter, individuals are innovative and forward-thinking, and not dependent on others for material gains or untrustworthy. \nPresently there is no way Jamaica can achieve Vision 2030 with a culture resistant to progress. If one wants empirical data to indicate that culture is holding back the country, then they can read the numerous reports indicating that Jamaica is a low-trust society lacking in innovation. These are all features of poor societies. However, the belief of some Jamaicans that they do not control their destiny is the biggest obstacle to success. This trait exhibits itself in the immense mendicancy that can be seen everywhere in Jamaica. It is unfortunate that healthy young people will boldly declare that they are poor because the system is oppressive. Such individuals do not seem to believe that they can change their circumstances. It is even more disturbing that individuals residing in Jamaica will proudly accept handouts and refuse job opportunities. \nReaders may not believe these examples, but such cases do exist.
