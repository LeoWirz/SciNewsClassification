The Conservative leader and byelection candidate weren't shopping just to soothe a sugar craving. They were making a political point about small business taxes, an issue they're pushing to be front and centre in South Surrey-White Rock. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck \nSURREY, B.C. \u2013 Inside a colourful candy shop in a bustling Vancouver suburb, Andrew Scheer and Kerry-Lynne Findlay marvelled at delicate British chocolate bars, chewy Red Vines and an edible Monopoly board. \nThe Conservative leader and byelection candidate weren\u2019t shopping just to soothe a sugar craving. They were making a political point about small business taxes, an issue they\u2019re pushing to be front and centre in South Surrey-White Rock. \n\u201cPeople are saying, \u2018I\u2019m paying a lot higher taxes than I was before. I\u2019m being called a tax cheat because I\u2019m an entrepreneur with a small business,\u2019\u201d said Findlay, 62, a former national revenue minister. \nThe riding is one of four across Canada where a byelection will be held Monday, but it\u2019s anticipated to be the closest race. Conservative Dianne Watts won by just 1,400 votes over the Liberal candidate in 2015, while the NDP placed a distant third. \nThe vote arrives midway through Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s term and it\u2019s expected to test his popularity, as well as the potential of rookie leader Scheer, ahead of the 2019 election. Both men have visited the riding twice and both have suggested the outcome will indicate whether the Liberal surge of 2015 is continuing or waning. \n\u201cTwo years ago, in the election, Canadians didn\u2019t randomly or suddenly change who we are,\u201d Trudeau said at a recent rally to support Liberal candidate Gordie Hogg, 71. \n\u201cWe have always been progressive, forward-thinking, open, compassionate, ambitious people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just about getting a government that recognizes that.\u201d \nSouth Surrey-White Rock has older, wealthier and whiter demographics than other ridings in Surrey, which is the fastest-growing city in Metro Vancouver. It\u2019s home to a picturesque waterfront and an array of restaurants, shops and other small businesses. \nIn July, Trudeau\u2019s government announced plans to close loopholes that it said have allowed high-earning business owners to avoid higher taxes. The measures included changes to \u201cincome sprinkling,\u201d which allows owners to split income among family members. \nAfter a backlash, the government said it would cut the small business tax rate from 10.5 per cent to nine per cent by 2019. \nHogg said he and Trudeau are committed to cutting taxes for small businesses, while the Conservatives voted against a tax cut in 2015 for \u201cmiddle-class\u201d Canadians earning between about $45,000 and $90,000 a year. \n\u201cTo me, their record is more important than their rhetoric,\u201d said Hogg. \u201cThis byelection is about electing the strongest positive voice for our community, and only Justin Trudeau and I have a positive plan to strengthen our middle class and offer real help for families.\u201d \nThe seat became vacant after Watts resigned to run for leader of the B.C. Liberal Party, an informal coalition of federal Conservatives and Liberals. \nByelections will also be held in Battlefords-Lloydminster in Saskatchewan, previously held by the Conservatives; Bonavista-Burin-Trinity in Newfoundland, a Liberal seat; and Scarborough-Agincourt in Ontario, also won by the Liberals in the last election. \nIn South Surrey-White Rock, Hogg has name recognition and deep roots. He was White Rock mayor for 10 years before being elected to the B.C. legislature for two decades. Findlay, meantime, represented Delta-Richmond East in Parliament from 2011 to 2015. \nAsked about her connection to the riding, Findlay said her parents lived in the community and she has also lived there at various points, including after she was widowed at 34 and was raising her children alone. She said she moved to White Rock this summer. \nThe NDP candidate is Jonathan Silveira, 40, a real estate agent and founder of advocacy group Surrey Kids Matter. He said the byelection was an opportunity to train new volunteers and strengthen relationships, but added he was serious about winning. \n\u201cThere are two big sharks fighting here. I am not afraid of the fight as well,\u201d he said. \nNew Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh has not joined Silveira in the riding. \nTrudeau\u2019s recent rally with Hogg in Surrey drew hundreds. Some were not local voters, however, including a Syrian refugee who said she wanted to thank Trudeau, and a visitor from Singapore who wanted to see the famous Canadian politician in person. \nThe prime minister is pictured alongside Hogg on campaign signs, indicating confidence among Liberals in Trudeau\u2019s popularity. \nScheer and Findlay, however, said they\u2019ve heard from people who have \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d after voting Liberal in 2015. \nIt\u2019s hard to predict a general election based on byelections, Scheer added, because the latter generally have lower turnouts, and local issues become amplified over national ones. \n\u201cBut I think we would love to send a signal, mid-term, that what the Liberals have been doing for Canadians isn\u2019t working.\u201d \n\u2014 Follow @ellekane on Twitter.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laura kane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scheer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trudeau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hogg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kerry-lynne findlay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew scheer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dianne watts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gordie hogg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jagmeet singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin trudeau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bonavista-burin-trinity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "findlay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan silveira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silveira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dyck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "watts", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "b.c. liberal party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surrey kids matter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ndp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "surrey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metro vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south surrey-white rock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white rock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newfoundland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saskatchewan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scarborough-agincourt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "battlefords-lloydminster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ontario", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surrey", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:14:40.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "50452f8ed74fab93a9bec466063f5d3e94c30ae7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFeckjn2cQSj.STKY5BKWYJlnh_1FHOlZvmpx3OuR83j6n9FGmNFKdKwOAdstrw7k5D4Wy9.1c5fG4aW.mQtPkS3qqoLo9eI3LSdZ0RJcbAvt.vVkf7mUE._g--", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/shop-storage/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Computer Storage with the Best Prices in Malaysia", "title": "Ultra Dual USB OTG 32GB (White)", "title_full": "SanDisk Ultra Dual USB OTG Drive 32GB (White) | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-04-14T05:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 230, "participants_count": 209, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.111, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c093873a1bc92d2264754fac1897354742860588", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFeckjn2cQSj.STKY5BKWYJlnh_1FHOlZvmpx3OuR83j6n9FGmNFKdKwOAdstrw7k5D4Wy9.1c5fG4aW.mQtPkS3qqoLo9eI3LSdZ0RJcbAvt_j0XyNRLIQfnh2o3CegNeR", "ord_in_thread": 172, "author": "Edrin Syahmi", "published": "2017-11-15T17:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "Very good item", "text": "I got a msj the yesterday saying it will arrive.

I loved him for writing them and got a kick out of his hiding places. \nOne note was stuck in the steering wheel of my car, another under my pillow. Notes were taped to the bathroom mirror, the front door, and the kitchen sink. Once he bought me an Eskimo pie and attached his note to it in the freezer: \u201cHappy Wednesday!\u201d he wrote. Occasionally I\u2019d find a message among the frozen vegetables. \nNate thanked me for cleaning the apartment, folding his undershirts, and making breakfast. \nOf all the notes he left, though, my favorite was his simple \u201cI love you,\u201d something he had said consistently from the beginning of our then-one-sided relationship. Even when I hadn\u2019t loved him, he\u2019d written of his love for me. \nHe did many other things that spoke love to me. He opened doors, whether it was at the apartment, in a store, a church, someone else\u2019s home, or anyplace \u2013 including the car. Even if it meant standing in the rain, he always took care of me first. \nHe brushed every new snowfall off my car and always carried boxes or bags for me, even if they weren\u2019t heavy. He pulled out every chair for me, never seating himself before I was settled \u2013 even when it was just the two of us in our apartment. And at the dinner table, he never helped himself to any of the food before offering the serving bowls to me. \nWhen we took our evening strolls around the neighborhood, he faithfully walked on the curb side, the old-fashioned, gentlemanly way to shield a lady from harm. I marveled at how seamlessly he changed sides if we went around a corner or across the street, almost like a smooth dance. \nAny time he got a glass of water or a Pepsi for himself, he\u2019d ask if I wanted one, too, and then would prepare them both. And he never sent me off to work without giving several delicious kisses. When I returned, he had a bunch more ready for me. \nOn cold days he made a cozy fire before I came in from work, knowing this would warm me inside and outside. As we talked on a blanket in front of it, he was careful not to interrupt me and always focused on my face when I talked. \nEven when we were in a group, he kindly introduced me and spent time talking to me as well as others. By his consistent example in these ways, he let me see what life looked like when one person put another ahead of himself. His actions assured me of his devotion. \nAs I watched him, it seemed like he didn\u2019t have to work very hard at doing these things, which amazed me.

The only reason I don\u2019t have more of them is that no one wants to drive to the middle of nowhere and drink and have to drive home. Oh, and also because from about half-an-hour before the party to about two hours into a party, I\u2019ve decided I hate having parties. That\u2019s when I give up on my shining image of what I wanted, accept whatever has gone haywire, sit down and let the rest of the evening take its course.So I found this cool book, \u201cInStyle Parties,\u201d which includes 15 parties, fully planned, from concept to invites to recipes, with countdowns and shortcuts and all the details perfectly laid out.I tried the recipes for the Harvest Dinner chapter \u2014 without really having a party, so I didn\u2019t use all the elements that make this book so cool, but the recipes were enough to get me thinking.Five things I learned:1. It\u2019s the fashion now, when you\u2019re having a party, to have a single cocktail that pairs well with the food. That\u2019s awesome for foodies like me and my few foodie friends, but I\u2019ll tell you, by the end of the evening, I\u2019ll be with the rest of my tribe, digging around in the fridge for a plain old beer, or unscrewing the top from a cheap bottle of vino. So consider your audience: Have something popular on hand, or, better yet, ask everyone to bring their own libation.One of the book\u2019s shortcuts on this party is to replace the cocktail with a trusted wine, so, there you go: Dispensation to decant the Yellow Tail. All that being said, these Ginger-Lemon Hot Toddies look pretty tasty, and I\u2019m plotting when I might be able to partake of them.2. As for the roast chicken, it might seem intimidating, but it\u2019s the easiest dish on the menu, except you have to get up to your elbows in raw chicken. Don\u2019t be squeamish. That\u2019s why God gave us hand soap.When you roast a chicken, just butter it, (get some under the skin) give it a good dose of salt and pepper and roast it \u2014 in just about any dish it\u2019ll fit in \u2014 at 475 F for half an hour, then turn it down to 400 F for another hour or so, depending on how big it is. Mine was about 5 pounds, and it was perfect. Don\u2019t forget to take it out of the pan and let it rest at least 10 minutes but maybe up to 20 before carving, to let the juices settle back into the meat.3. The Pear & Pumpkin Tart is endlessly flexible, and I took advantage of that, subbing butternut squash for the pumpkin (easier to find).You could sub in apple for the pear, though the pear was wonderful. It\u2019s OK if it\u2019s firm. I put mine in a bag with an apple overnight to ripen it a bit, but it\u2019ll soften as it bakes as well. It\u2019s easier to cut when it\u2019s firm.If you can\u2019t find baby arugula, use frisee or a baby greens mix.Don\u2019t go cheap and skip the pomegranate seeds like I did. They would have provided a nice seasonal color, flavor and foil to the richness of the blue cheese.4. The idea of a Shaved Brussels Sprouts Salad didn\u2019t excite me too much, but I\u2019ve found if you put enough walnuts, Pecorino Romano, olive oil, salt and pepper on something, I\u2019ll eat it. Shaving individual Brussels sprouts was a bit tedious. It\u2019s listed on the party \u201ccountdown\u201d to do three hours before the party. I don\u2019t know about you, but three hours before a party, I\u2019m usually busy getting cobwebs off the ceiling fans. I might move it back a bit, maybe to the day before. As long as they\u2019re in the fridge, they should be fine.I did use my mandoline, which in this case is not a small guitar, but a slanted kitchen tool that you slide food back and forth on and it slices it evenly. You could do it on a box grater, too, but either way, I seriously recommend acquiring a cutting glove for such work. They\u2019re tight-fitting gloves with metal woven into them that prevent you from slicing off your finger doing things like shaving Brussels sprouts.5. \u201cTruss the chicken.\u201d Huh. Well, I used kitchen string to tie the legs together, but that\u2019s only half of the job, according to \u201cJoy of Cooking\u201d (which, by the way, said it\u2019s rarely necessary). But, for the record, to truss, once you tie the legs together, you take the string back on both sides and wrap it around the wings and tie the ends of the string together in the middle of the neck region so the chicken stays together in a nice bundle while it cooks. What you do about it is between you and your bird.Ginger-Lemon Hot ToddiesTotal 4 hours, 13 minutes; hands-on 13 minutes; serves 85 cups water1 cup fresh lemon juice1 cup honey3 tablespoons finely chopped crystallized ginger1\u20442 (3-inch) piece peeled fresh ginger, cut into 1\u20444-inch-thick slices1\u20442 cup golden rum1\u20442 cup brandyLemon zest strips (optional)Place the first 5 ingredients in a 3-quart electric slow cooker.

That means that they will play the next round against either Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, PSG, Roma or Besiktas. How would Real fare against those teams? Who should they want in the draw? From toughest to easiest, here is the ranking for the draw. Paris Saint-Germain . OK, they have not been as brilliant as expected this season and reports coming out of France suggest that they are looking to replace coach Unai Emery even before the end of the season. Still, Real Madrid are defending very poorly and they would struggle quite a lot against Neymar, Mbappe and Cavani. Add Julian Draxler or Angel Di Maria to the equation and that would be a very tough draw for Los Blancos. Manchester City . Pep Guardiola\u2019s team has improved from last year and are dominating the Premier League. They are comfortable under Guardiola\u2019s style and while Real Madrid have proved that they can also counterattack and let other teams dominate the ball, it would not be easy to stop City\u2019s system right now. Manchester United . They defend well and Real Madrid are not creating or converting their chances this season. Mourinho would probably park the bus against Madrid and that didn\u2019t work when these two teams met in the UEFA Super Cup last August. Still, that was a different Real Madrid team than the current one, nobody knows why. Liverpool . They are tough and they play with a lot of intensity. Still, Liverpool would probably concede some goals, Stopping their wingers would be crucial but Los Blancos should at least be able to control the tempo of the game if the midfield can handle Klopp\u2019s pressing system. Roma . They finished the group ahead of Chelsea and Atletico de Madrid, earning the right of being taken very seriously. Still, they don\u2019t have a big advantage when playing at home and Madrid should once again dominate the game. Besiktas . Pepe\u2019s return to the Bernabeu would be interesting to watch after his comments about the fans at the Bernabeu. Besiktas would be the easiest draw for Madrid and yet their home-field advantage is huge and Madrid would have to get ready for a very tough atmosphere on the opening leg.

PHOTO: REUTERS \nJEJU: The art of Neapolitan pizza making won world heritage status on Thursday, joining a horse-riding game from Iran and Dutch wind mills on UNESCO\u2019s culture list. \nUNESCO accepted the art of Neapolitan \u2018pizzaiuolo\u2019 on the world body\u2019s list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. \u201cCongratulations #Italy!\u201d it said in a tweet after a meeting in Jeju, South Korea where the decision was made. In Rome, pizzeria owner Romano Fiore celebrated the decision. \u201cI am honoured, like all Italians and Neapolitans are\u2026pizza has centuries of history,\u201d he said. \nNaples pizza twirling seeks nod as UNESCO \u2018intangible\u2019 \nItaly had argued the practice of pizzaiuolo \u2013 from preparing and flipping the pizza dough to baking it in a wood-fired oven \u2013 was part of the country\u2019s cultural and gastronomic tradition. Traditional Neapolitan pizza has a relatively thin crust with the exception of the rim, which, when baked, bloats like a tiny bicycle tyre. \nIt is rigorously made in a wood-burning brick oven and has two classic versions: Marinara (tomato, garlic, oregano and oil) and, the most famous, Margherita (tomato, mozzarella, oil and basil). Tradition holds the Margherita pizza was created in 1889 by a local chef in honour of Queen Margherita, who was visiting Naples, south of Rome on Italy\u2019s Tyrrhenian coast.

Credit: Courtesy Palm Beach Marriott Singer Island Credit: Courtesy Palm Beach Marriott Singer Island Credit: Courtesy Palm Beach Marriott Singer Island prev next comments It\u2019s hard to imagine that folks who live in Palm Beach County, Fla., would ever feel the need to get away. After all, they live surrounded by splendor: the sea, the beach, the culture, the shopping and more. But folks do. And when they do, they know to just head down the road, over the Blue Heron Bridge and submerse themselves in the beautiful world that is Singer Island.\nSinger Island, named for the son of Singer Sewing Machine magnate Isaac Singer, is just three miles north of Palm Beach but has a wonderful feeling of escape. While it\u2019s not big, it packs a total vacation punch, but in a seaside, chill kind of way.\nYou won\u2019t find shopping malls and theaters on Singer Island. Those luxuries are a quick jaunt over the bridge if you need them. You will find nature parks, marinas, hiking trails, sea sports, scuba diving, snorkeling and miles and miles of sandy beaches nestled up to the warm Gulf Stream. Singer Island\u2019s beaches are, in fact, the closest to the Gulf Stream in all of America.\nLife on the island centers around the 4.7 miles of sparkling beaches. Hotels are tucked along it. As you walk the beaches, you will find plenty of ways to have fun. Rent boats, sign up to paddle board and parasail and more.\nYou can learn to scuba or snorkel. There\u2019s plenty of great spots, but a true favorite is under the Blue Heron Bridge that brought you to the island. There, even beginner snorkelers (as well as expert divers) can find delight in the vibrant sea life. Besides the usual array of tropical fish drawn to the warm waters, you often spot starfish, hat fish and even seahorses. It\u2019s a must-do for visitors, with plenty of companies to help you do that, such as Pura Vida Divers, located on the island.\nYou can ride atop of the water on a peaceful paddle boarding adventure (also simple to learn on site). Check out High Point Paddle Adventures. To kick things up a bit, visit Get Wet Watersports for all kinds of active water fun.\nSinger Island embraces nature, too. The best spot to soak it in is at MacArthur Beach State Park, the only state park in Palm Beach County. Tucked between the Atlantic Ocean and Lake Worth Lagoon, the park\u2019s 438 acres is home to almost countless plants and animals. (Seven of those plants and 22 of the animals are endangered.) You can lose yourself wandering there, take educational tours or soak in the park\u2019s beautiful beach and rock reef. It\u2019s like a beach trip with a nature preserve wrapped into one.\nWhere to stay? The beach is dotted with fabulous hotel choices, and the island has a wealth of lovely condos available. You cannot do better than a stay at the Marriott Singer Island Resort, which is, according to Conde Nast, a top resort in Florida and the best in Palm Beach.\nJust 13 miles from the airport, the Marriott Singer Island Resort is the only all-suite beachfront resort in the county \u2014 and there\u2019s a balcony in every suite. That makes it friendly for all: families, couples, business, weddings and more. With so many amenities, you might be tempted to never leave. You can snorkel in the resort\u2019s own reef. With pools and an expansive beach, you can tuck into a lounge chair and call it home.\nWhile suites mean easy in-room cooking, you\u2019ll want to go out, since the Marriott Singer Island Resort is like a foodie paradise. The three restaurants \u2014 from the casual fun of the Reef Tiki Bar to the Caribbean vibe at Lagoon Cantina, to the upscale Americana fare and 400-bottle wine list at 3800 Ocean \u2014 offer chef-inspired excellence.\nSi Spa, the resort\u2019s in-house spa, is heralded for focusing on using products from the sea. This is the only spa in the area to offer \u201cComfort Care Classes,\u201d a wellness program for those either going through or recovering from cancer treatment.\nLearn more at palmbeach marriottresort.com.\nSo what if you settle into this paradise and suddenly get a hankering for, say, culture or sports?\nThree miles up the road (and over that bridge) is all that and more in Palm Beach. You\u2019ll find music, art, shopping, everything you can desire. Baseball lovers are right at home, too. Roger Dean Stadium, where the St. Louis Cardinals and Miami Marlins settle in for spring training, is just a few minutes to the north. To the south, you\u2019ll find The Ballpark of Palm Beaches, spring training home to the World Series champion Houston Astros and the Washington Nationals.\nOver the Blue Heron Bridge, locals know, is the way to go for a total beach escape.

Nadal (16), Djokovic (12) and Murray (3) all lag behind the Swiss legend. December 7, 2017 10:00 GMT Federer ended his year with a total of seven titles, including two Grand Slams Getty \nFormer Wimbledon finalist Mark Philippoussis has revealed why he believes Roger Federer trumps Rafael Nadal , Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray as the greatest of all time. \nThe debate on who the greatest tennis player of all time is one that has gone for many years with the likes of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic all in the conversation. \nIt seemed like Djokovic was making a strong push for the title in 2016 when he won four consecutive Grand Slams, dubbed as the Nole Slam \u2014 with just two other players in history achieving the feat. \nHowever, Nadal and Federer re-entered the conversation when they experienced career resurgences in 2017, winning a combined 13 titles, including two Grand Slams each as they returned to the top of the ATP tennis rankings. \nFederer, in particular, increased his Grand Slam tally to 19. And Philippoussis, who lost to the Swiss ace in the 2003 Wimbledon final , believes results-wise, he can be considered the best of all time. \n\"If you're just going on results alone, of course,\" Philippoussis told Sky Sports . \"You can't argue with results and what he's done and continues to do. \n\"(Rafael) Nadal is one of the best of all time. I mean we're incredibly fortunate and lucky for the fact that we have so many at the same time, some of the greatest of all time. \n\"(Andy) Murray, what he's done and (Novak) Djokovic and they just happen to be playing at the same time, so of course, out of all those guys you've got (Roger) Federer as the greatest of all time.\" Nadal won his 16th men's singles Grand Slam title at the 2017 US Open Getty \nThe Australian, however, believes with the careful managing of the schedule, Nadal can overtake the 36-year-old when it comes to major titles, with the Spaniard's French Open and US Open wins taking his tally up to 16. \n\"All these guys, Nadal is probably right behind him - maybe three - is it three Grand Slams behind him?\" Philippoussis added. \"I mean, he's looking pretty good. \n\"It was smart for him to pull out and have a little bit of time off toward the end of the year but we're incredibly lucky and spoilt at the moment with what's going on.\" Read more", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "murray federer", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "murray", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nadal", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "federer", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "djokovic", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "novak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rafael nadal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark philippoussis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger) federer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger federer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy) murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "novak djokovic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippoussis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rafael) nadal", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "us open", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sky sports", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:14:44.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6bd5c83192cabbeff8a14015c9d6104a3ac45858", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf5XHgktHaICcUgF2FEY_.WsFUg2NlYLgK2HUFxvejOi3LQ4Jy.Cgv7XUhReEPvOTHw5H7yQlpoUAIWDmUIg96.x", "site_full": "www.expedia.se", "site": "expedia.se", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.se/Metro-Toronto-Convention-Centre-Hotell.0-l6123390-0.Reseguide-Filter-Hotell", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Hotell Metro Toronto Convention Centre, Toronto | Expedia.se", "title": "Life Suites Loft - CN Tower", "title_full": "Life Suites Loft - CN Tower (Toronto, Kanada) | Expedia.se", "published": "2017-09-26T22:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 96941, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cd72ef50a326fb468012640c1b632b7030313228", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf5XHgktHaICcUgF2FEY_.WsFUg2NlYLgK2HUFxvejOi3LQ4Jy.Cgv7XUhReEPvOTHw5H7yQlpoUAF8nZPm8P2XK4QoQMv9g.gMgBec_SCSnEROYsT9ZCwTZ", "ord_in_thread": 17, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-18T13:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Great location which is very close to CN Tower.
