Chris Ngige as governor, the PDP has become a workshop for \u201cpolitical merchants\u201d who continue to use the party for their business interests. The PDP stalwarts who are age-long in this trend, as the last election revealed, include; Mr. Chris Uba, Nicholas Ukachukwu and brothers, Prince John Emeka, Ken Emekayi, Ben Nwankwo and recently others joined, including Sen. Stella Oduah, Ifeanyi Ubah and almost all the PDP House of Representatives members from Anambra State. \nThey specialize in nurturing their own political structures in the State to place them at an advantage at the negotiation table during every election year. They use the strength of their so-called structures to earn higher negotiating power and send them to work for the highest bidder during elections. The highest bidder is usually from another party. To them, anti-party is just a word. This has gone on for so long that it now seems normal with the PDP in Anambra State without any consequence. \nEnter Peter Obi. That trend was destined to change. Once the former Governor, who is widely seen as one of the best governors in the history of the country, was forced out of APGA by the party leadership and dragged into the PDP by an irresistible entourage that stormed his Onitsha residence on that fateful day in 2014. Obi began to gradually change the face of PDP in the State and started putting up a strong base for a re-launch of the party in the State. \nPDP had agreed that Governors will automatically become leaders of the party in their States while it will be immediate past governors in States were PDP are in opposition. That officially handed Peter Obi the leadership of the party in the State and set the stage for the rancor by the political merchants in the party who deemed Peter\u2019s presence an eternal frustration of their age-long business. It proved to be so as the party, for the first time in a long while, attracted a personality such as Mr. Oseloka H. Obaze, a globally-revered diplomat whose career at the United Nations was replete with excellence and not just that, the PDP also for the first time in twelve years conducted one primary election which was televised live on national television as against multiple primaries that obtained previously. It was unthinkable! \nThat angered the business lords whose deal was burst with the introduction of transparency into the PDP. They tried to derail the party as Ken Emekayi and Ifeanyi Ubah did, and were hit with suspensions. Both, in addition to Hon. Ben Nwankwo, eventually defected officially and worked for APGA. Others including Stella Oduah, the Ukachukwus, Chris Uba and all other PDP National Assembly members, excluding Hon. Lynda Ikpeazu and Hon. Chris Azubogu, worked for APGA while still maintaining that they are PDP members. Figures that circulated on the social media showed that they were heavily paid by the incumbent governor to work for him. Some allegedly received over N600 million while the lowest payout was N50 million. They worked against their party and ensured it lost the election. \nBarely two weeks after betraying their party, they are back to the same party to maintain the structure that feeds their pocket as the Ward, Local Government and State Congresses commenced and it left me to wonder if God is so unkind to leave these ones without conscience? How can one be so brazen in impunity? I expect PDP to bite hard at all those that engaged in anti-party activities during the election. Failure to do so will mean there is no PDP in Anambra State for certainty. This practice is killing the enthusiasm of those who want to genuinely join the party. \nBeyond that, they now have a harder nut to crack. It was only Peter Obi about a year ago, now Mr. Oseloka Obaze, as the candidate of the party in the concluded elections, is the leader of the party in the State. If I know him well, he will insist on global best practices in the Anambra State PDP. He won\u2019t take anything less and that is why another battle is on by the political business merchants to hijack the party from him. This is a battle they are destined to lose. \nAnambra PDP has an amazing opportunity to rebuild itself with the mouthwatering Obaze \u2013 Obi combination. If they get the needed support from the National PDP, Anambra State will boast of the best PDP state structure soon, especially with 2019 around the corner. PDP needs to pamper Obaze and Obi well enough as they have very few of their ilk as members, losing them will be suicidal for the party\u2019s survival. \nThere are rumours that Governor Obiano is very interested in PDP structure in the State to ensure that those members who worked for him are firmly in control of the party. \nI am sure the party\u2019s national Chairman, HE Ahmed Makarfi is not ignorant of all these.

PDP and anti-corruption are like daylight and night-time; ordinarily, their paths should never interweave. \nWithout trying to excuse President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s unidirectional anti-corruption campaign, PDP is at the heart of corruption (and every other shortcoming of democracy) in the Fourth Republic. Since leaving power, Olusegun Obasanjo \u2014 and he should know, being the biggest beneficiary of PDP\u2019s ascent to power \u2014 has been unable to hide his disdain for the pervasiveness of corruption in the legislature. The only thing he hasn\u2019t done is to expressly blame his then party; not that we need that information \u2014 until 2015, the same legislature frequently maligned by Obasanjo was dominated by PDP lawmakers. \nThe lawmakers are quick to return the favours. Obasanjo it was who schooled them in the art of corruption, they often say, reminding him of how he wooed the legislature with cash in an attempt to push through his failed third term bid. None of this is new information. \nPDP\u2019s legacy of corruption has outlasted its 16-year rule. There is the Siemens bribery scandal, featuring shady payments of a total of \u20ac1.3 billion to a minister, a senator and other federal government officials who, by the way, are still walking about freely. There is the stupendously messy Halliburton scandal involving the bribery of elected officials in the Fourth Republic, and dating back to the military era, to the tune of $182 million. These are the more obvious, internationally-embarrassing cases. In states, ministries, agencies and the central government, there are so many PDP-era corruption cases that even the EFCC and ICPC must have lost count. \nYet, on December 9, the day set aside since 2003 by the United Nations to raise global awareness of the consequences of corruption, PDP will begin a two-day convention that will culminate in the emergence of its national chairman and other principal officers. This is by far the party\u2019s most crucial convention ever, and it\u2019s not hard to explain. \nFor two-and-a-half years into his tenure, Buhari has operated in a one-and-a-half-party democracy. PDP, the half, has failed to muster a quarter of the engagement it endured from the APC in its own years of rule. Of course, the quality of that engagement was often lacking in intellectual depth and was more propaganda than fact-based, but there was something at least. So far, Buhari has, to a large extent, been unchallenged by an opposition; and it could worsen \u2014 not for Buhari but for our democracy \u2014 if PDP doesn\u2019t speak with one voice from December 10. It could mean that Buhari walks into a second tenure practically unchallenged or maybe weakly challenged \u2014 a scenario that would defeat the very essence of democracy. If Buhari wants to be president in 2019, he must work hard for that ticket. Very hard. This is why even those who detest the PDP must be interested in this convention. \nPre-election Bickering \nThe buildup to the convention has been a huge cause for concern. Desperation for the \u2018juicy\u2019 position of national chairman is threatening to derail the progress recently made by the party, following a long stretch of internal tussle that clearly had the markings of APC pulling the strings from hiding. The zoning (or incomplete zoning) of the position to the South threatens to spark a post-convention crisis or the staging of a parallel convention. \nThe chairmanship aspirants from the South-West, led by old guard Olabode George, want the position zoned to their geopolitical zone, but Raymond Dokpesi and Uche Secondus, a former acting national chairman, argue that the South-South has never produced a substantive PDP chairman. \nWhile Dayo Adeyeye, national publicity secretary, has been boasting that the PDP would \u201corganise the most credible party election in the history of Nigeria\u201d, a convention chairman is yet to be agreed upon due to aspirants\u2019 suspicion about the interests and intentions of possible candidates for the post. Calls for the resignation of Ahmed Makarfi, chairman of the caretaker committee, have recently intensified, providing an extra reason to fear for the post-convention unity of the PDP. \nSame Old, Same Old \nMuch as this won\u2019t be in the interest of the country, it\u2019s hard to see PDP playing anything more than the devil\u2019s advocate in the 2019 presidential election. Just take a look at the chairmanship aspirants: Rasheed Ladoja, Jimi Agbaje, Tunde Adeniran, Raymond Dokpesi, Gbenga Daniel, Uche Secondus. Each of them has been a minister or senator or governor or governorship aspirant in the past. No breath of fresh air. \nWhat, for example, is someone like Bode George doing anywhere close to places where serious conversations about the next PDP chairman are holding? Someone of his public-office standing \u2014 he\u2019s retired from the Navy, been military governor of Ondo State, been chairman of the Nigerian Ports Authority, been national vice chairman and deputy national chairman of the PDP, has gone to prison (for four years) and come back \u2014 should be working for the PDP from the background. Even Adamu Ciroma\u2019s wife, Maryam, wants to be deputy national chairman! Husband and wife have been ministers of the federal republic at different times, just to mention one of the many plum national positions that have been shared between them. \nApparently, PDP has misdiagnosed the reasons for which it lost the 2015 election. Having been rejected by the people \u2018against the run of play\u2019, despite the war chest at its disposal in 2015, the party should have known, by now, that its desperately-needed rebranding cannot happen with the same faces that defined its most recent era. By now, the names associated with the party should be people brimming with ideas who haven\u2019t been the faces of the party in recent years \u2014 people against whom the public holds no grudge yet. \nIf the PDP hopes to contest the 2019 election with the likes of Ahmed Makarfi and Atiku Abubakar, then the contest would have been over way before its start, and the PDP\u2019s sojourn to political oblivion would have begun to earn some permanence. \nBut before then, its one final debt to Nigerians is to hold a free and fair convention on Saturday and stay united thereafter (or at least pretend to be). Nigerians will keep an eye on this convention \u2014 not necessarily because we love the party that PDP is, but because it\u2019s our most realistic chance of not getting stuck in a one-way election traffic in 2019. \nThe PDP can be Nigeria\u2019s necessary evil for at least another two years; we can\u2019t throw it away just yet, regardless of our misgivings against it. For once, this party cannot disappoint Nigerians. Having failed as a ruling party, it must not make a mess of opposition politicking. \n\u2018Fisayo Soyombo, editor of the International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR), tweets @fisayosoyombo.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jimi agbaje", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buhari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atiku abubakar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rasheed ladoja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raymond dokpesi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dayo adeyeye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obasanjo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olusegun obasanjo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmed makarfi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gbenga daniel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muhammadu buhari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tunde adeniran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adamu ciroma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olabode george", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uche secondus", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pdp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "efcc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "navy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "halliburton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siemens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international centre for investigative reporting", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peoples democratic party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigerian ports authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "icpc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ondo state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south-west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fourth republic", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:09:58.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cf461b4c5dc7595e5a59a01aaf689ead06dcb0e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ6m5_DJ5Wv6RdXp9Qi0xfHiKw0L.4vQqDpuU6KK_G12IjJf8V7t_cJWdnanU7Y3MxPAtPIAF0wwTFmxSxBNtMb0uOQPi_Q_OxgcT7KKo_G7yv237h1mnsAB.r9PVf2IHj2ViADaviXZNIo56aQw6Eri2cCRyxzliP71_uBc.fP7FqVRdCUXetZ", "site_full": "www.longroom.com", "site": "longroom.com", "site_section": "https://longroom.com/discussions/feed.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Long Room", "title": "Gillibrand Calls for Franken to Step Aside: \u2018We as Elected Leaders\u2019 Should Be Held to a \u2018Higher Standard\u2019", "title_full": "Gillibrand Calls for Franken to Step Aside: \u2018We as Elected Leaders\u2019 Should Be Held to a \u2018Higher Standard\u2019", "published": "2017-12-07T11:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/Kirsten-Gillibrand-ap.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cf461b4c5dc7595e5a59a01aaf689ead06dcb0e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ6m5_DJ5Wv6RdXp9Qi0xfHiKw0L.4vQqDpuU6KK_G12IjJf8V7t_cJWdnanU7Y3MxPAtPIAF0wwTFmxSxBNtMb0uOQPi_Q_OxgcT7KKo_G7yv237h1mnsAB.r9PVf2IHj2ViADaviXZNIo56aQw6Eri2cCRyxzliP71_uBc.fP7FqVRdCUXetZ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mijac", "published": "2017-12-07T11:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "Gillibrand Calls for Franken to Step Aside: \u2018We as Elected Leaders\u2019 Should Be Held to a \u2018Higher Standard\u2019", "text": "\u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 6, 2017 Wednesday at a press conference on Capitol Hill, Sen.

From every story shared with the EndSARS hashtag, the recurring themes of brutality, disrespect for civil rights, frustration and a total breakdown of trust are unmistakable. The anger was not provoked by policing power, the anger is about the way in which it is applied by police officers. Whosoever has encountered a gun toting policeman will appreciate the feeling of the Nigerian youth as powerless victims of unstoppable bullies. All it takes to be harrased for a young person is to be in possession of a laptop, have more than one phone in your hands, spot an unfamiliar haircut or be in a car, in the company of other young people. Our urban policemen think every young man with sagged pants, who is driving a car, is a Yahoo-Yahoo boy or scammer. What kind of unimaginative policing is that? \nOne of the key ideational components of an oppressive state is the construction of suspicion by state operatives. With SARS, we have a unit of oppression within the police force, funded by the state, which nurses the socialised belief that the young urban male is a danger to public good. The experiences and perceptions of citizens to stop-and-search by the SARS team is that of brutality and it reflects the lack of training of the Nigerian police. If citizens know the hideouts of the youth engaged in Advance Fee Fraud (419) and Internet scams in their neighbourhoods, the police cannot claim ignorance of this. They only do what they want to do and the public understands them. Unfortunately, the stop-and-searches on young people and the kind of interaction they have with policemen, sets in motion a broader chain of social problems through fear, social exclusion and violence, that the society will have to deal with, sooner than later. We may pretend otherwise, but those that are stopped and searched are disproportionately those the poor and vulnerable. What this translates to is \u2013 the demographic that is disadvantaged in education, in employment, in life\u2019s opportunities are further degraded, embarrassed, and oppressed by stop-and-search. They get no explanations. They are routinely fed lies and misinterpretations of the law. In most cases, they are harassed by the same set of officers they have become accustomed to. Worse, each attempt at exercising their rights are read as cockiness and met with beatings, jail time or death. \nIt is a shame; we have all kinds of problems on our hands and we are compounding needless ones. Even those who mouth off the \u201cPolice is your friend\u201d worn-out clich\u00e9 do not believe it. Public safety is about trust. It is about respect for the community. It is about investment and cooperation in every aspect of the community. Public safety goes beyond an encounter between a uniformed police officer and the young civilian they stop. The action taken by the Inspector General of police to the call to #EndSARS is commendable. Hopefully those who call or send messages to the phone numbers supplied, will be met with professional officers who are true to their charter, at the other end. Renaming is not enough. FSARS should not be another racket. When claims are made, the integrity of the investigation must be maintained. The chief superintendent of plice (CSP) or superintendent of police (SP) in charge must be accessible to the public and be able to present what has been done on any investigation, at a moment\u2019s notice. \nThe rising tensions between social control, protection and power cannot be wished away. Increasingly, discontent is fanned because there are no oppportunities for social mobility. Nigeria risks combustion with its army of unemployed and underemployed youth and no one seems to care! For those who have no idea what sparked the #EndSARS outrage, ask an urban youth; especially the Lagos dwelling type. Everyday, young people who face the fear of their rucksacks being ransacked, who are afraid of riding in the same car with their peers, who are scared of moving around with their laptops or even get creative with their hairstyles or dressing, can articulate with amazing detail how these situations develop and end in undesirable outcomes. The wide-ranging harm done to young people, coupled with a lack of protection, leave them wide open to physical, mental and emotional damage from an early age.This may seem low but keep in mind vulnerable young people are the group least likely to make any formal complaints about the police. They are also the ones least likely to have the wherewithal and resources to fight for their right in a corrupt and oppressive country. \n#EndSARS presents yet another opportunity for tighter legislation by our do-nothing legislature. FARS is welcome but the long-term solution is a fundamental change in police culture if we ever want community friendly policing. It is in our long-term collective interest to listen.

But it is surprising that Time features so prominently NBC\u2019s Megyn Kelly \u2013 not to talk about sexual harassers on her current show, but on Fox News. It came more than 30 paragraphs into the cover story, but Kelly sounds like an NBC employee by declaring that Donald Trump\u2019s victory was a setback for women:That Donald Trump could express himself that way and still be elected President is part of what stoked the rage that fueled the Women's March the day after his Inauguration.... Megyn - Kelly - NBC - Anchor - October Megyn Kelly, the NBC anchor who revealed in October that she had complained to Fox News executives about Bill O'Reilly's treatment of women, and who was a target of Trump's ire during the campaign, says the tape as well as the tenor of the election turned the political into the personal. \"I have real doubts about whether we'd be going through this if Hillary Clinton had won, because I think that President Trump's election in many ways was a setback for women,\" says Kelly, who noted that not all women at the march were Clinton supporters. \"But the overall message to us was that we don't really matter.\"It's probably true that if we had President Hillary, we wouldn't be talking about sexual harassment. Because the Clintons have skeletons in that closet, and Time was always good at sticking up for them.

A continent that is so rich in natural resources has been plagued by destructive leadership motivated mainly by greed.\u201d \n\u201cWith its pristine simplicity, the continent evokes thoughts of Eden,\u201d the professor continues. \u201cThis is evident in her exquisite flora and fauna. At the same time, the widespread senseless poverty echoes the outback of hell, with poverty and devastating diseases serving as the hallmark of the average citizen\u2019s daily existence. \n\u201cCapturing Africa\u2019s magnetic ability to attract perilous opposites, TIME magazine once reported that: \u201cAfrica\u2014especially the sub-Saharan region\u2014has begun to look like an immense illustration of chaos theory.\u201d \n\u201cAccording to observations made by the British charity, Oxfam, development efforts have been in place all over the continent throughout the past two decades, yet Africans continue to grow poorer with each passing year. This is hard to believe. I don\u2019t have to tell you that Africa is blessed with all the resources that make for greatness \u2014 human, material, and ecological.\u201d \nAccording to the professor, \u201cThe continent harbours more than 40 percent of the world\u2019s potential hydroelectric power supply; the bulk of the world\u2019s diamond and chromium resources; 30 percent of the uranium; 50 percent of the world\u2019s gold; 90 percent of its cobalt; 50 percent of its phosphates; 40 percent of its platinum; 7.5 percent of its coal; 8 percent of its known petroleum reserves; 12 percent of its natural gas; 3 percent of its iron ore; 64 percent of the world\u2019s manganese, 13 percent of its copper, vast bauxite, nickel and lead resources, and millions of untilled farmlands.\u201d \n\u201cYou are probably wondering why, in this world of great abundance, such extreme poverty not only exists, but is allowed to continue,\u201d the professor continued. \nBut while much of Africa\u2019s poverty is attributable to poor leadership, it is obvious that there is much individuals can do to better their lot and those of others before the red of the famine of good leadership turns green. \nAliko Dangote, president of the Dangote Group, who spoke at the forum, offered another scary perspective: \u201cUnemployment around the continent is troubling. A 2013 study by Brookings Institution found that African youth (15-24 years) constitute about 37 percent of the working age population. The same age group, however, accounts for about 70 percent of jobless people in Africa. \n\u201cWorking poverty rates among the youth in Sub-Saharan Africa was nearly 70 percent in 2016, translating to about 64 million working youth living in extreme or moderate poverty (less than $3.10 per day). \n\u201cAbout 10 \u2013 12 million young people join the continent\u2019s labour market each year.\u201d \nBut the man, who became an entrepreneur at young age, and is now a leading industrialist across Africa, employing thousands of people, has a solution: \u201cFrom a very early age young Africans have to be encouraged, educated, equipped and inspired to be employers of labour rather than employees. \n\u201cEntrepreneurship has the potential to be one of the most potent tools for Africa\u2019s transformation. Entrepreneurship can create jobs and increase the middle class which is essential in sustaining economic growth.\u201d \n\u201cWe can\u2019t look on without doing something,\u201d says Tony Elumelu, an entrepreneur, philanthropist. \u201cThis is as fundamental reason we have the Tony Elumelu Foundation doing what we are doing today.\u201d \nHe continued: \u201cWhen we launched, we wanted to change the narrative on African development. We wanted to reframe the agenda, so that economic development would no longer be centred on foreign aid. We would show that Africa\u2019s transformation could and should be driven by Africans.\u201d \nEstablished in 2010, The Tony Elumelu Foundation is a leading philanthropic organisation in Africa with the aim of promoting entrepreneurship as the catalyst for the socio-economic development of the continent. The Foundation has set itself apart from grant-making bodies, by operationalising integrated programmes to support entrepreneurship in Africa and by enhancing the competitiveness of the African private sector. \nTEF has achieved this, namely through its flagship initiative \u2013 the entrepreneurship programme, a 10-year, $100 million commitment to identifying, training, mentoring and funding 10,000 entrepreneurs. \nVice President Yemi Osinbajo \nVice President Osinbajo, noted for richly illustrated speeches, graced the forum with another simple but powerful speech on the same theme of what will make Africa work \u2013 the resourcefulness of its people. \n\u201cHere in this room are seated the answers to that question, indeed we have right here with us 1000 reasons why Africa would work and you are those reasons why this country will work,\u201d he observed as he opened his presentation. \n\u201cAcross agriculture, ICT, hospitality, fashion, energy, manufacturing, entertainment and many other fields, the breadth and depth of talent and innovation on display in the current and previous Tony Elumelu Entrepreneurship cohort have shown that there is indeed hope.\u201d \nHe had examples to show: \n\u2022 In the 2016 set, we have Osakwe Chukwunonso, who is building vehicles that would run on clean energy. \n\u2022 Soji Megbowan, who is creating educational products that would simplify STEM, especially the teaching of STEM subjects. \n\u2022 Sierra Leonean Edward Noni, from the 2015 set, built a tracking tool which was useful, following the devastating flood in his home country of Sierra Leone. \n\u2022 Frank Mugarura of Rwanda is the proprietor of a branding and marketing agency that is set to conquer the continent. \n\u2022 Nkem Okocha, Mamamoni, as she is called, runs a prolific microcredit enterprise. \n\u201cThese are merely a handful of some of the inspiring stories that have preceded you and we know now that indeed Africa is set for incredible progress in the next few years.\u201d \nThere are many more, where his examples came from: \n\u2022 Shabbirali Hasnain Mussa, of Tanzania is of the 2017 set. He said, \u201cAfter receiving the seed capital from TEF, we have secured office space, and managed to get an affordable bag making machine which produces non-woven bags. By doing this, we have had the chance to grow our business and hired five staff; by doing this, we doubled our output and attracted new clients.\u201d \n\u2022 Dennis Mulongo Mutoro, from Kenya: \u201cWithin two months of joining, I launched a new product. Three months later, before even completing the programme, I have made three sales and one contract for over $28,300. This I owe to TEF training alone.\u201d \n\u2022 Jean Emmanuel Yannick Labonne, of Mauritius: \u201cThe seed capital is a blessing. I once read Mr.Elumelu\u2019s quote \u201cDo not eat the seed\u201d and this was the guiding line for me when I received the seed capital. To be part of TEF has opened unimaginable doors and allowed me to dive deep and explore the depths of entrepreneurship. I shall be forever grateful.\u201d \nProfessor Osinbajo also dwelt on the blockers to the potentials of the young entrepreneurs, key among which he called the tyranny of the past. He cautioned them on how history can tie people down, compelling them to look back until sometimes when they trip; compelling them to look at the present with fear and apprehension; how history, especially past failures, individually or collectively, can become a barrier to the achievement of freedom. \nWith resources and knowledge acquired by the participants, he charged them to make \u201cforward ever\u201d their policy. \nOf Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, etc \nCiting factors like ingenuity, creativity, ideas and most importantly passion in the success stories of such great men around the world, Elumelu also urged the participants to be their best. \nHe however called on governments of various African countries to improve on the ease of doing business to enable entrepreneurs thrive. He commended the Buhari administration for improving the operating environment in Nigeria. Then, he stressed the point he has often made, that it is for Africans to develop Africa. But indeed, that should be a challenge for his enormous energy, wealth and experience. \nThe Future \n\u201cAt the end of our 10-year commitment,\u201d the Foundation says, \u201cTony Elumelu Entrepreneurs will become a generation of dynamic African business owners, who will prove that local business growth will drive Africa\u2019s economic and social transformation. We believe that by the end of this \u2018Decade of African Entrepreneurship,\u2019 thousands of businesses will grow and flourish, driving sustainable prosperity across Africa. Furthermore, they will create ripples and waves of economic transformation across the continent.\u201d \nTony Elumelu \nTony O. Elumelu is an entrepreneur and a philanthropist. The chairman of Heirs Holdings, United Bank for Africa Plc, and Transcorp Nigeria Plc. \u201cIn his early career, he made a name for himself by turning the nearly bankrupt Standard Trust Bank into a top-five player in Nigeria. In 2005 he led the largest merger in the banking sector in sub-Saharan Africa, acquiring United Bank for Africa (UBA). In five years, he transformed it from a single-country bank to a pan-African institution with over 7 million customers in 19 African countries. \n\u201cIn 2010, he commenced full-time operations at Heirs Holdings and founded The Tony Elumelu Foundation, an Africa-based and African-funded philanthropic organisation focused on supporting entrepreneurs in Africa by enhancing the competitiveness of the private sector. \n\u201cHe serves as a member of the USAID\u2019s Private Capital Group for Africa Partners Forum. He sits on the Nigerian President\u2019s Agricultural Transformation Implementation Council and serves as Co-Chair of the Aspen Institute Dialogue Series on Global Food Security. He played a leading role in the formation of the National Competitiveness Council of Nigeria and serves as its vice chairman. He is also a member of the Global Advisory Board of the United Nations Sustainable Energy for All Initiative. \n\u201cHe is the author and leading proponent of the philosophy he calls \u201cAfricapitalism,\u201d which is the private sector\u2019s commitment to Africa\u2019s development through long-term investment in strategic sectors of the economy that drive economic prosperity and social wealth. \n\u201cIn 2003 the FG of Nigeria conferred the national honour of Member of the Federal Republic on Mr. Elumelu. In 2012 he was also awarded the Commander of the Order of the Niger for his service in promoting private enterprise. He was recognised as one of \u201cAfrica\u2019s 20 Most Powerful People in 2012\u201d by Forbes magazine and the New African magazine featured him in its list of the \u201c100 Most Influential Africans in Business.\u201d \nBisi Daniels is a journalist and author of The False Truth .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities":

Dele Agekameh   National   Dele Agekameh \n\nThe travails of Abdulrasheed Maina, the embattled former head of the Presidential Task Force on Pension Reform under former President Goodluck Jonathan is still hot in the news. While the mystery surrounding his disappearance and reappearance continues to unravel, there is more confusion than there are clarifications. \nThe House of Representatives began an investigative hearing into the matter on Thursday, November 23, 2017, and we have since been treated to a rash of accusations and denials that leave no doubt that there is a toxic element to the Maina matter. One after the other, government officials and heads of agencies have distanced themselves from involvement in Maina\u2019s re-appointment. \nDocuments that were made public through excellent journalistic diligence showing the paper trail of approvals and referrals leading to Maina\u2019s re-emergence, have made the matter worse. This is because they have not only been denied by their apparent makers and originators, the denials have even gone as far as to include claims of forgery in their preparation and production. The entire issue is now taking the form of a mystery/thriller bestseller novel. \nIn a display of the lack of coordination between government agencies that this column has continually hammered on, Winifred Oyo-Ita, the head of service of the federal civil service; Abubakar Malami, the attorney general of the federation; and Abdulrahman Dambazau, the minister of interior, the seeming principal players, all washed their hands off responsibility. They are all claiming no knowledge of how Maina eventually re-emerged as a director in the Civil Service. Dambazau, on his own part, claimed no knowledge at all about even the prior correspondence and instead led the permanent secretary in his ministry, Abubakar Magaji, to the gauntlet. \nMagaji later emerged to be the sacrificial lamb in the festival of denials playing out before the House of Representatives. After an initial tussle with Oyo-Ita, Magaji seemed to accept responsibility for Maina\u2019s appointment by admitting to an \u2018administrative error\u2019 that, at least, on the surface, cleared Oyo-Ita. His admission remains the only recorded hint at responsibility for the re-appointment. \nMany questions remain, however. In the case of Malami, it does not appear that his ten-foot pole strategy will work. He is caught stark in the middle of the imbroglio. Tapes have surfaced showing Maina giving account of how he met with Malami outside the country. This does not help Malami\u2019s picture of aloofness in the matter, as suggested by his convenient memory lapse while making his first statements. \nAlso, Mrs Oyo-Ita and the head of the Federal Civil Service Commission, Joseph Akande, both claim to have received a series of letters from the AGF on the issue of Maina\u2019s re-instatement. Malami denied signing or sending any. This suggests one of two things \u2013 that forgery is involved in this matter or that the AGF has suffered severe memory loss. Either way, Malami is far from exonerated, as there is documentary evidence, some of which has been made public. \nThe denials extend as far as the net of Maina-gate goes. For instance, whereas Maina\u2019s lawyer claimed that his client has continued to receive payment of salary from the government, Kemi Adeosun, the minister of finance, and Ahmed Idris the accountant general of the federation, have both rubbished the claim, stating that Maina\u2019s last payment from the government was in February 2013. The police denied protecting Maina or his properties, with the Nigerian Immigration Service also claiming to have no record of Maina\u2019s goings and comings in and out of Nigeria since 2013, while he was wanted by the EFCC and the police. \nIbrahim Magu, the EFCC boss, had the opportunity to make his own denial in response to a Senate ad-hoc committee finding that Maina handed over 222 properties recovered from pension thieves to the EFCC. He claimed not to have been handed anything by Maina, but, instead, that all properties recovered in relation to Maina and pensions were done solely by his agency. This is particularly interesting as the EFCC has routinely been accused of receiving and \u2018sharing\u2019 recovered loot and properties. Claims by \u2018victims\u2019 of the agency who are coerced into forfeiting asset quietly in exchange for no prosecution are rampant. \nIn relation to recovered loot, there are unanswered questions arising from the video recording of Maina that surfaced recently. He claimed to have handed over documents to Malami that would lead to the recovery of N1.3 trillion in stolen pension funds. There has been no hint of this in any part of the testimony that has been recorded in the House of Representatives. If true, there is already another case to answer between Malami and whoever else was privy to the documents mentioned by Maina. \nMaina further pleaded for audience with the president and protection from the security agencies to enable him reveal facts and documents that will expose people and lead to the recovery of even more trillions. \nFor what it is worth, it is beginning to appear like Maina has been sitting on serious evidence and information that may justify his paranoia. What is disturbing, however, is his lack of trust in the integrity of the government agencies, particularly the EFCC. His fear and distrust is an indictment on the agency. Guilty or not, a person under investigation should have confidence in the system and assurance that the right thing will be done. \nThe plot thickens with the emergence of new clues that the Department of State Services (DSS) has been within reach of Maina in the past. The head of that agency has revealed how he advised Malami to meet with Maina. If the government agencies were in consonance about their objectives, the knowledge of Maina reaching out to Malami could have been used to lure him out into the open to allow the law take its course. \nAt this juncture, with the facts at hand and the demeanour of the different agencies, there seems to be some cover up. The shadow of vested interests is again visible in this case. An alternative perspective of the matter sees Maina as a compromised person who is threatening to bring other powerful people down with him. As he stated in the video recording, \u201cI am no saint\u201d. Whether that is an admission of some guilt on his part is left to anyone\u2019s imagination but his evasiveness and insistence on his possession of information that puts his life at risk cannot be ignored. \nIf Maina\u2019s claims are to be believed, he has obtained about three court judgments in his favour concerning his dismissal. True to his lawyer\u2019s claim also, there is no court judgment or pronouncement that has found him guilty of wrongdoing. Whether this is because he has not made himself available for prosecution is another matter altogether. However the legalese of this matter is not the main issue anymore. The central issue now is that Maina is a potential whistle-blower who fears for his life. Malami needs to be re-invited to the House to shed light on the truth of the documents Maina claimed to have handed him somewhere outside the country. \nThe next chapter of Maina-gate is likely to be more revealing than the present orgy of denials. Somewhere down the line, there will be no more room for excuses and the real issues will begin to emerge. Maina\u2019s fame or infamy will ultimately be determined in the long run. His family insists he is a hero and will be justified, while Magu wants to find out why his 7-year-old son has N1.7 billion in his account. \nIn other climes, a person claiming threat to his life and access to sensitive incriminating evidence would have been granted protective custody by now. Seeing as the information could help recover crucially needed funds, some sort of deal can be reached regarding his culpability. The government has dragged its feet for too long and this is now becoming a media circus.

ITER - Bernard - Bigot - Project - Track ITER's director-general, Bernard Bigot, said the project is on track to begin superheating hydrogen atoms in 2025, a milestone known as 'first plasma.''We have no contingency plan,' he told The Associated Press in a phone interview from Paris. ITER - Science - Project - History ITER is the most complex science project in human history. The hydrogen plasma will be heated to 150 million degrees Celsius, ten times hotter than the core of the Sun, to enable the fusion reaction. Process - Reactor - Tokamak - Magnets - Plasma The process happens in a donut-shaped reactor, called a tokamak,1 which is surrounded by giant magnets that confine and circulate the superheated, ionized plasma, away from the metal walls. The superconducting magnets must be cooled to minus 269\u00b0C, as cold as interstellar space Scientists - Process - Fusion - Sun - Source Scientists have long sought to mimic the process of nuclear fusion that occurs inside the sun, arguing that it could provide an almost limitless source of cheap, safe and clean electricity. Unlike in existing fission reactors, which split plutonium or uranium atoms, there's no risk of an uncontrolled chain reaction with fusion and it doesn't produce long-lived radioactive waste. Project - Technology - Summit - US - President A joint project to explore the technology was first proposed at a summit between U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985, with the aim of 'utilizing controlled thermonuclear fusion for peaceful purposes ... for the benefit for all mankind.'It took more than two decades for work to begin at the site in Saint-Paul-les-Durance, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) northeast of Marseille.

Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment.\nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe.\n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\"\nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers.\nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube.\nSuch attacks are becoming more common \u2014 and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems.\nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data.\n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said.\nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released.\nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations.\nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services.\nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information.\nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system.\nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dena diorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diorio", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mecklenburg county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:09:59.048+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4da19cfb07f611b6cc76bfd179dc6f486123a33e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94oobUZghFoTw5ajn9zRl15jW9j0m99SGZKViNI_NdLIhYAAxkkXoYmm8gN4nayrfgX2eM4EwrqZbMjxaD1UdSIQWXXhg2RQZTCMSnDzoWrJWyisCdBd.scwPEPZYn885tO5rOYSJqzB43aE3NgC1wfydPHBze9ExsUwM2dY.X34NH", "site_full": "www.amazon.co.uk", "site": "amazon.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product-reviews/B01N5WKRUY/ref=s9_acsd_zwish_hd_bw_b17GB_c_x_18_w?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-11&pf_rd_r=FJKTB864TB0WXTC3603S&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=fd347e45-37c2-5ef7-938e-e2348b8d0a86&pf_rd_i=266239", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Amazon.co.uk:Customer reviews: Sweet Little Lies: The Number One Bestseller", "title": "Sweet Little Number One Bestseller", "title_full": "Amazon.co.uk:Customer reviews: Sweet Little Lies: The Number One Bestseller", "published": "2017-12-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c88ae9916144d3d14f1b66699c0a3549866c44a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94oobUZghFoTw5ajn9zRl15jW9j0m99SGZKViNI_NdLIhYAAxkkXoYmm8gN4nayrfgX2eM4EwrqZbMjxaD1UdSIQWXXhg2RQZTCMSnDzoWrJWyisCdBd.scwPEPZYn885tO5rOYSJqzB43aE3NgC1wfydPHBze9ExsUzlMV4q.1WNFs_79CS2ANOKFS2LcTro4aYiJ0taexIZH", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "Susan", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "An enjoyable book from start to finish , Great storyline had me wondering who the murderer was .

Some say the current limit of four engines per season is good enough. Some say four is too less and want five whilst other teams say three is the way to go.\nIn order to cut costs and make it a more level playing field, the FIA said earlier that F1 would go to a three engine limit for the 2018 season, a move that was heavily criticized by a few team principals, primarily Christian Horner of Red Bull Racing.\nNow, despite the hybrid engine technology being too raw and unable to last a full F1 season with only three engines, the FIA say it is too late and there is no going back on the 3 engine limit for 2018. \nPhoto : Sutton Images\n\u201cIt is something that was decided\u201d, said FIA president Jean Todt. \u201cSome people are still thinking why don\u2019t we have one engine for the whole championship? It is not something that is new. It was decided years ago for 2018.\n\u201cWe had some meetings with teams and the way the regulations are made and the governance are made, to decide now to go back to four engines, or let\u2019s go back, we need to be in 100% agreement. And we don\u2019t get 100% agreement, so we are down to three engines.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel it is easy to find the right solution. If you don\u2019t do anything, it will be more expensive to buy the engines. For the FIA to decide that you don\u2019t have limited amount of engines, it won\u2019t be a problem but it would be a problem for the competitors.

Typically, the senate is referred to as the upper house and has a smaller membership than the lower house. In such legislatures, both houses must pass the same bill to make it a law.\n\nModern democratic systems having legislatures with senates include the United States of America, Canada , Australia and all US states  with the exception of Nebraska (whose legislature is a unicameral body called the \u201cLegislature\u201d but whose members refer to themselves as \u201csenators\u201d).\n\nThe debating chamber of the Senate of the Czech Republic By Krokodyl \nIn 1879 James Shields, who had previously served Illinois and Minnesota , began a term as a U.S. Senator from Missouri .

there have been calls for Dennis Wise to be removed from the show. \nThe footballer upset some viewers last night when he told campmate Iain Lee that he shouldn't do any more trials. \nAfter claiming Iain had \"lied\" about how difficult the Temple of Gloom trial was on Tuesday night's episode, Dennis last night told Iain he had a 'problem' with him taking on the upcoming trial, Tutankha-Doom, which Iain put his name forward for. \n\"My only problem and I\u2019ll be honest with you, Iain, is that you\u2019ve said 'Get Me Out Of Here' twice and what I don\u2019t want to do is we have no dinner.\" \nIain reminded him that he'd also won 11 stars in a trial but Dennis remained firm. \n\"If you come back with nothing everyone will be upset,\" he told Iain. \nThe lads later shook hands and ended their argument but speaking later in the Bush Telegraph, Iain said he felt humiliated. \n\"I was quite happy to stand my ground a bit (but) it did feel a bit humiliating having my list of failures kind of recited back to me.\" Advertisement \nDennis meanwhile defended his opinion. \n\"People need to eat and people are hungry. If he doesn\u2019t like my opinion, he doesn\u2019t like it, but I have to say what I feel.\" \nMany viewers took to Twitter to express their anger at how Dennis spoke to Iain.

Angelique also had an allergy to parabens, so she started exploring making her own products and so Neek was born. The range is a relatively small one, but it has some skincare and a range of natural and vegan lipsticks.  \n\nI was sent three shades of the lipsticks to review and I was instantly drawn to the bamboo outer packaging, it says on the Neek website that they use recycled packaging which is wonderful and the look of the products makes them standout from anything else in my collection.  \n\nAlthough Neek calls these lipsticks, I found them to be more of a lip tint, more pigmented than a tinted balm but offering a sheerer wash of colour than you would from a lipstick. I don't say that as a negative at all, the finish is very pretty on the lips and the application fool proof, so perfect for everyday.  \n\n\n\nI was sent three shades; Shine on - Is a clear balm/gloss, perfect over the top of other shades or just to add some moisture. This is the new look version which has a pink bullet. I was also sent two of the new lipstick shades. Mystify - Is a brown with a slight pink undertone, it has a nineties retro feel to it but is actually a lot more wearable than it looks in the bullet thanks to the finish. I must admit when I first received it I didn't think I would be able to wear it all, so I am pleased to be proven wrong. Kiss me Kiss me - Is a bright fuchsia pink which really perks up the complexion. It is a fun colour, but again wearable thanks to the sheer finish.  \n\nThe lipsticks can be built up a little bit by adding several layers, but I prefer to wear them as a sheer wash of colour. The formula is smooth once on the lips but can feel a little waxy straight out of the bullet. I think this is because of the vegan formula, vegan waxes like candelila can feel a little grainy. The ingredients list is full of nourishing and healthy plant oils such as avocado and jojoba, so they do nourish the lips as well as adding colour.  \n\n\n\n\nAlthough I love the packaging, I don't really trust it to stay shut in my handbag, as you don't get that satisfying click you get with other lipsticks. I find popping them in a small compartment where they didn't have much room to move solved that issue for me, so it isn't a major problem at all.  \n\nThe lipsticks cost \u00a315.99 on the Neek website or they are available at Love Lula * for \u00a315. Although I enjoyed them I do find the price a little high for what you are getting, that said they are in line with a lot of other natural and organic lip products and I haven't seen many vegan lipsticks that are less expensive than that. So that is personal preference.  \n\nOverall I liked the quality ingredients, fun colours and ethos that Neek has. Have you tried these lipsticks? Do you have a favourite?  \n\nAna x   \n\nPost contains PR Samples. Some of the links in the post are affiliate links (Affiliate links are marked with an *) please see my full disclaimer for details.

With the weekend ahead, set to be snowy and very cold for many of us...it can be a real struggle to get the runs in :) Sniffs, snuffles and hidden mojos, linked with the unpredictable weather conditions, may conspire against us at this time of year, but whatever you are doing, stay safe , stay healthy and enjoy :) Shorter days and longer nights, crisp,cold mornings and clear, starlit evenings. The weather can be challenging, but let's rise to those challenges and set some exciting goals for this new month :) What the Quest is; The Quest takes one month . You can join any time, within those weeks. The main aim of the Quest is to help you find a focus or goal that you would like to achieve by the end of the Quest period. I ask that you will be a Graduate to join the Quest. The main reason I ask this is that while you are doing the programme, your plan is very structured so I wouldn't want the Quest to interfere with that. Most popular goals are:- To run three times a week To slowly increase distance To train for a specific race To add In Stretch and Strength exercises As you can see they are personal to yourself and it's totally your own choice. Each week, I will pin a new post where all the members of the quest can talk about how things are going. So if you want to join, all you have to do is put; I would like to join the Quest, or, count me in and then, I would like to. Your name will then be added to the top post and every week your name will be in the quest until the end. At the end of the Quest, there will be a certificate that you can download to keep.

continue at the current rate Mail Online | 12/7/2017 | Tim Collins For Mailonline in General Your browser does not support HTML5 video.Global warming will cause temperatures to rise even higher than we thought by the end of the century, a shocking new study has claimed.Experts examined a range of modelling simulations to work out which was best able to accurately predict climate change. Findings - Cent - Chance - Warming Their findings suggest that there is a 93 per cent chance that global warming will exceed 4\u00b0C by 2100.Researchers from the Carnegie Institution for Science (CIS) in Washington DC looked at a range of widely used software to make their assessment. Programmes - Warming - Increase - Concentration - Carbon The programmes predict how much warming should be expected for any given increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.Based on existing levels of increasing concentration, raw climate model results suggest we can expect global temperatures to increase anywhere between 3.2 and 5.9\u00b0C (5.8 and 10.6\u00b0F) above preindustrial levels by 2100. Difference - Factor - Projections This is a difference of about a factor of two between the most and least severe projections. Patrick Brown and Ken Caldeira set out to determine whether the upper or lower end of this range is more likely to prove accurate. Models - Conditions - Ones - Reduction - Cloud They found that the models that are best able to recreate current conditions are the ones that simulate a reduction in cloud cooling in the future.These are the models that predict the greatest future warming. Dr - Brown - Dozens - Climate - Models Dr Brown said: 'There are dozens of prominent global climate models and they all project different amounts of global warming for a given change in greenhouse gas concentrations.'That's primarily because there is not a consensus on how to best model some key aspects of the climate system. Results - Sense - Warming - Projections - Fact 'Our results suggest that it doesn't make sense to dismiss the most-severe global warming projections based on the fact that climate models are imperfect in their simulation of the...

leading contender for the St George Illawarra fullback spot next NRL season.\nMatt Dufty has established himself as the man to beat for the St George Illawarra fullback spot despite Gareth Widdop making a strong case he had a future in the No.1 jumper.\nCoach Paul McGregor has a plethora of options with Dufty, Kurt Mann and Jai Field all vying to start round one of the 2018 NRL season at the back for the Dragons.\nTo complicate McGregor's selection puzzle, skipper Widdop was a standout playing fullback for England at the World Cup.\nIt's believed McGregor isn't considering switching Widdop from five-eighth to fullback and is intent on partnering him with marquee recruit Ben Hunt in the halves.\nThat leaves Dufty, Mann and Field to fight it out during the pre-season trials.\nHooker Cameron McInnes said he believed Dufty deserved first crack after making a huge impact when he came into first-grade at the back end of the 2017 season.\n\"That fullback spot is up for grabs but the way Matt Dufty played there ... , he deserves his shot but that will be the coach's decision,\" McInnes said.\nMcInnes, who this week inked a three-year extension which will keep him at the Dragons until the end of 2021, said he was excited at the prospect of forming a long-term spine partnership with Hunt, Widdop and Dufty.\n\"He's an exciting player, he's lightning quick,\" McInnes said of Dufty.\n\"But he's got very good ball skills, he's got a very nice cut-out pass.\n\"He played a lot of touch growing up so he's very sharp and he can read the game.\n\"Having that at fullback, being like an extra ball player -- all the best teams have that.\n\"Melbourne have it with Billy Slater, (Brisbane's) Darius Boyd; they've all got that ability.\n\"If he focuses and does what he did at the end of last year, he'll improve and I can see him locking that spot down.\"\nMann has previously been mentioned as a fullback option by McGregor, however, he conceded he may be the victim of his own versatility.\nHe was the Dragons' Mr Fix It last season and played almost every position in the backline in his 21 appearances.\nThe former Storm outside back said he saw himself as a fullback or five-eighth but due to his ability to play anywhere, he had never been able to lock down a spot.\n\"It's good but it's an Achilles heel as well,\" Mann said.\n\"Being able to play a few different positions, it doesn't nail me down to one spot.\n\"What I'd like to be doing is sticking to a position and getting a bit of consistency there.\"\nAAP", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

Cheongsam (qipao)  or Hanfu ?\nWell, the answer is not that straight forward. While many Hanfu enthusiasts would argue that Cheongsam has a Manchurian root thereby not representative of the Chinese culture, I believe that it is no less Chinese than Hanfu . Hanfu , on the other hand, faces a serious identity crisis making it impossible to define.\nI know this is extremely ironic that I find it impossible to define Hanfu , though I call myself #hanfugirl.\nTherefore I think it\u2019s important to just give everyone a little overview on factors that contribute to this impossibility and also, the current Hanfu scene.\nFirstly, the current Hanfu scene is generally categorised into the following categories:\nCultural supremacists who think that everything starts from China, and that there are \u2018Pure\u2019 Han Chinese traditions which we ought to follow to continue this grand cultural supremacy. They thrive on pointing out the flaws of others, and ironically, don\u2019t bother much about the hair, fabric, make-up style, and the finer things (possibly too preoccupied with ideology). Also, they feel that Han culture is basically the defining and representative culture of the Chinese. Cosplayers, teenagers who are after the novelty and aesthetics of it. They typically are involved in cosplay, anime, gaming, lolita dress, BJ dolls and take loads of pictures. Interested in what the dress can offer in terms of cultural understanding. I call this the twilight region. Can sway both ways at times, but generally quite moderate. The reasons why it is impossible to define Hanfu , and also difficult for foreigners/outsiders to really pinpoint/identify Hanfu that easily is due to the following:\nWhat is Han culture and when did it start? Is Han culture representative of the Chinese culture as a whole? How did the Han culture evolve, and to what point do you stop considering the culture/dress as being Han? In modernising Hanfu, at which point do you stop considering it a traditional dress or do you go around calling anything with a specific trait a \u201cHanfu\u201d? On the macro level, the main problem lies in the fact that unlike the Japanese, where there is an assumption* of an ethnic/cultural homogeneity, the Chinese government of the last century has openly embraced its ethnic and cultural diversity. So it becomes difficult on the top-down level for the Chinese government to single out a particular ethnic group/majority and to promote that particular traditional dress as the national dress.\n*I use the term assumption (rather loosely) because looking at the case of the Ainu people of Japan, the concept of ethnic and cultural homogeneity is likely to be politically motivated than a reality.\nOn a micro level, Hanfu enthusiasts have yet to agree on a particular era to take reference from. They/We just can\u2019t decide which is the most \u201cauthentic\u201d and \u201cChinese\u201d period to take reference from. There were already non-Han influences in Han dressing from more than 2,000 years ago, and the Han Chinese has always been evolving and absorbing influences from surrounding cultures through intermarriages, through trade, through the silk road, and through war.\nImage (left to right): Han dynasty (206 BCE\u2013220 CE), Tang dynasty (618CE\u2013907CE), Ming dynasty (1368CE\u20131644CE). 400 years between each of the examples below, and already the difference is huge.  \nHan dynasty wrap-around robe Tang dynasty chest-level dress One of the 100+ styles from Ming dynasty Also, because we don\u2019t live in the past, it\u2019s impossible to be behaving and dressing like people in those days, wearing things exactly the way they did. So if there\u2019s any traditional dress that is to be adopted, definitely certain changes have to be made, and the Hanfu community needs to settle on just a handful of options. That\u2019s from a communications point of view\u2013unified understanding is important for easy and widespread adoption.\nSome argue that Ming dynasty, being the last dynasty ruled by the Han Chinese would be the best reference to take before the Manchurians took over and changed everything. But Ming dynasty took quite a fair amount of influence from the Mongolians and Tang dynasty (which in turn, was greatly influenced by the Turks, Persians, Central Asians, Indians and Tibetans). So where do we stop?\nAnd can I just say, Ming dynasty was really greedy\u2013they took references from all the dynasties before and resulted in 100+ different styles of dresses for women alone! Some images below just to show a few styles.\nMing dynasty long top This is Song dynasty style. Similar elements were used for Ming dynasty as well. Mind dynasty overcoat for colder period Mind dynasty style Ming dynasty style with horse face skirt If the argument is taking reference from the \u201clast\u201d of the traditional Chinese dress that evolved organically from thousands of years ago, then Ming dynasty as the last period doesn\u2019t apply to the female Chinese dress. While men were forced to adopt Manchurian dressing during the Qing dynasty, in the case of the female dress, women didn\u2019t need to. So towards late Qing dynasty, Han Chinese women and Manchurian women inter-influenced each other in their dressing, resulting in a really organic fusion of styles. Although, the Manchurians continued with their one-piece long robe, and Han Chinese women continued with their two-piece top-bottom style.\nIn the adoption of the Cheongsam (literally translated to mean long robe, in Cantonese), which was based on the Manchurian one-piece robe, it was an organic adoption as well with the liberation of the Chinese people from their ancient feudal system. Women were exposed to western culture, and there was a rise in feminism which propelled them to abandon their traditional Han Chinese two-piece wear, and wore the one-piece Manchurian robe which Han Chinese men were wearing at that time. At least that was how it started.\nAs I delve deeper into the history of the Chinese dress, I realise that the question of a traditional Chinese dress is not as simple as Cheongsam vs Hanfu .\nBecause of the impossible definition of Hanfu , I\u2019m actually not very sticky about the specific era to take reference from. Rather, I think it\u2019s more important that we don\u2019t miss the forest for the trees. The rich and diverse culture and history behind the dress is worth delving into, and visual feasts of beautiful dresses and beautifully made up women are definitely good start!\nThere\u2019s no better excuse to dress up than learning about its culture!\nHere\u2019s a quick glance at the evolution and diversity. Just in case, you know, it\u2019s not confusing enough. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hanfu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ming", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ming dynasty", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hanfu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:04.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f356a5aa75d650714351f535482304e7501eb171", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjKETTmcQmnvKx_Y81VjuOqgwcKM.xjA8euw35CxcFZoE1A0YWF4BbxhrF3BU2vLLOjmITS7XjAXX6RhSGGCHAUUq7meQyfRJakCzl805hdXm", "site_full": "www.startribune.com", "site": "startribune.com", "site_section": "http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/index.rss2", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "National", "title": "On Jerusalem, Trump delivers for supporters at home", "title_full": "On Jerusalem, Trump delivers for supporters at home - StarTribune.com", "published": "2017-12-07T10:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1512587912", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4035, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f356a5aa75d650714351f535482304e7501eb171", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjKETTmcQmnvKx_Y81VjuOqgwcKM.xjA8euw35CxcFZoE1A0YWF4BbxhrF3BU2vLLOjmITS7XjAXX6RhSGGCHAUUq7meQyfRJakCzl805hdXm", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "startribune.com", "published": "2017-12-07T10:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "On Jerusalem, Trump delivers for supporters at home", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump's move to recognize the divided city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital may have triggered a worldwide chorus of critics but the president had his ears closely tuned to his supporters at home.\nFor Trump, the proclamation was an important way to make good on a pledge to his political base, which includes evangelical Christians and pro-Israel Republicans eager for such a move.\n\"While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver,\" the president declared Wednesday in announcing his decision. \"Today, I am delivering.\"\nThose were words to savor for a president who's been frustrated to see a number of key campaign pledges stalled or slowed \u2014 sometimes by a bitterly divided Congress, some by larger national or international concerns.\nRepealing the Obama era health care law is a promise unfulfilled, much to Trump's frustration. Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall.\nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation.\nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box \u2014 although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months.\nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters.\nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action.\n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\"\nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\"\nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East.\nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move.\nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\"\nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts.\n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.\nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\"\nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\"\nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court.\nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\"\nTrump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric.\n\"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:04.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7ee858e2db1b72e375a0f8b31ee3563ab5429606", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWdzjE8MP1_Xnn7dSEzcXkUIwegllDOCHHTfrhQspQBRrvhEEgrer1r0idlwVI8MHHTzdNHpvL5w--", "site_full": "forums.aws.amazon.com", "site": "amazon.com", "site_section": "https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=30", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "AWS Developer Forums: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) ", "title": "EBS Provisioned IOPS (io1) Volumes now", "title_full": "AWS Developer Forums: EBS Provisioned IOPS (io1) Volumes now ...", "published": "2017-12-07T03:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.525, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7ee858e2db1b72e375a0f8b31ee3563ab5429606", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWdzjE8MP1_Xnn7dSEzcXkUIwegllDOCHHTfrhQspQBRrvhEEgrer1r0idlwVI8MHHTzdNHpvL5w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "IgorKatAWS", "published": "2017-12-07T03:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "EBS Provisioned IOPS (io1) Volumes now", "text": "Today we announced improvement in performance of Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) Volumes from 20,000 IOPS to 32,000 IOPS and from 320 MB/s to 500 MB/s of throughput per volume.

I really don't know. Nursing seemed to me to be very natural and a beautiful thing. Others seem to view it as sexual or disgusting. I think this comes from society (media, magazines, billboards, etc.).\nHere's my 2 cents on breastfeeding: I'll be honest-I didn't read all the other comments so sorry if I'm repeating other posters! As a FTM, I wasn't sure if I would be able to or if I even really wanted to breastfeed. I did some research and knew even a little would be a health benefit to my baby. I decided to give it a try-and found that I loved it. It seemed so natural and really helped me build a fast bond with her. I nursed her until she was 2 and was sad when I weaned her then! HOWEVER, she is almost 5 now and we still have a very strong bond. Whether or not you nurse, you will build that with your child. Also, I sent her to Pre-K this year...and not a single parent has asked if any of the other kids were breastfed or not. There is no way to tell by looking at the classroom full of kids!\nIf you are able, willing, and enjoy breastfeeding, do it! If you're not, then don't stress about it! If you end up nursing and need to supplement with formula, it's totally ok! (I wish someone would have told me that the first time around!) What is important is that you love your child and keep him/her healthy with good nutrition-breastmilk or formula.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:06.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "84e5de787b09be453170ed0c3520dbc6155b4842", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg84.JNoWvVEJGNuYD4HCC4Md2TWExdpWO9kCZcv.T8OZTRhKxNSUqtAYwmqXLp137PlVTHA0GTG38a_o57B_zg5", "site_full": "www.riveted-blog.com", "site": "riveted-blog.com", "site_section": "http://riveted-blog.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Riveted", "title": "Winter Cruise to Sucia Island", "title_full": "Winter Cruise to Sucia Island", "published": "2017-12-07T02:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.riveted-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/suciaisland-4041.jpg?fit=1000%2C747", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "84e5de787b09be453170ed0c3520dbc6155b4842", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg84.JNoWvVEJGNuYD4HCC4Md2TWExdpWO9kCZcv.T8OZTRhKxNSUqtAYwmqXLp137PlVTHA0GTG38a_o57B_zg5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Laura Domela", "published": "2017-12-07T02:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "Winter Cruise to Sucia Island", "text": "Winter Cruise to Sucia Island Published December 7, 2017 By Laura Domela \nWe finally got back up to Airship AND the weather was cooperative (unlike the week we spent aboard in October), so we headed up to Sucia Island for a couple nights while the sun was shining and the wind was calm. \nWinter cruising is so great up in this area. So much of time we have the whole place to ourselves! We did some work after we got settled, and then went for a hike before the sun set. Nice sandstone textures on the outer rocky beach that faces Orcas Island. \nLast night was quiet and clear and the stars were bright. This morning was still clear and blue with a nice big moon and some low fog off in the distance (and a bit of frost on the dock!) \nWe worked for most of the day, but managed to get out and hike over to Echo Bay before it got too dark and too cold. \nWe got a couple neighbor boats by the end of the day, and by the end of our hike the fog had really rolled in. No sunset photos tonight! \nWe\u2019re going to grill up some of the salmon we caught in Alaska for a salmon taco dinner tonight, and then in the morning (after the fog burns off, I expect) we\u2019ll figure out where we want to go next! \nAlso, totally unrelated, here\u2019s a photo of my mom\u2019s adorable new puppy, Lucca: \nHe\u2019s a White Shepherd like her others, and just adorable, don\u2019t you think? \ud83d\ude42 Share this:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laura domela", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "sucia island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sucia island winter cruise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "echo bay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orcas island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alaska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucca", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:06.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f4b9c18f616401d55a2c5d8426041644660442ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ze7iYzhB4pRQYGxBfV1QC0OU50lnjWrUGo6_3hl.BS.tZthPwmUluMj94O14Agjro8DLDAVkRtmzavoVlhZsQQBR.Vhutt9o-", "site_full": "www.fosters.com", "site": "fosters.com", "site_section": "http://www.fosters.com/edge?template=rss&mime=xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Edge - fosters.com", "title": "Con Tutti to perform holiday concert Dec. 9", "title_full": "Con Tutti to perform holiday concert Dec. 9", "published": "2017-12-07T10:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.fosters.com/storyimage/FD/20171207/NEWS/171209731/AR/0/AR-171209731.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f4b9c18f616401d55a2c5d8426041644660442ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ze7iYzhB4pRQYGxBfV1QC0OU50lnjWrUGo6_3hl.BS.tZthPwmUluMj94O14Agjro8DLDAVkRtmzavoVlhZsQQBR.Vhutt9o-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "Con Tutti to perform holiday concert Dec. 9", "text": "Con Tutti to perform holiday concert Dec. 9 Thursday Dec 7, 2017 at 3:15 AM \nCon Tutti sings and celebrates the season in style with the heralding brass of classic carols, giant puppets, an Irish folk band and, of course, the joyous singing of Con Tuttians on Dec. 9 at 7:30 p.m. at South Church in Portsmouth.
