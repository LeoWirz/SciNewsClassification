At Home in Tanzania - Germans in the shadow of Mount Kilimanjaro | DW Documentary published: 04 Mar 2017 At Home in Tanzania - Germans in the shadow of Mount Kilimanjaro | DW Documentary At Home in Tanzania - Germans in the shadow of Mount Kilimanjaro | DW Documentary published: 04 Mar 2017 views: 37610 \nGerman occupation left its mark on Tanzania. But how has the east African country changed since the colonial era? Even though the Germans were pushed out of East Africa after the First World War, the ties remain close. Many farms there have changed little since, and Germans still live in some of them. German settlers originally built some of the old farmsteads on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro during the colonial era. Makoa Farm is one that dates back to that time. German veterinarian Elli Stegmaier and her husband Laszlo run a clinic there where they mainly treat sick and injured wild animals. It\u2019s their dream come true. Not far from their estate is Momella Farm, where actors John Wayne and Hardy Kr\u00fcger filmed the Hollywood classic Hatari in the early sixties. Kr\u00fcger fell in love with the property and bought it and turned it into one of East Africa\u2019s first bush hotels. Germans have left their mark on many of the country\u2019s towns and cities as well. Lushoto, which used to be called Wilhelmstal, still has its old butcher\u2019s and post office - they look as if their owners have just popped out on an errand. But our film also shows a different Tanzania and the challenges the country faces. A remote Maasai village is constantly seeking new grazing land for its livestock.

The Republican-led House passed a bill to make it easier for gun owners to legally carry concealed weapons across state lines. J. Scott Applewhite / AP Originally published on December 7, 2017 2:43 am \nThe House approved a bill on Wednesday that would ease legal restrictions for carrying concealed firearms across state lines \u2013 a move pushed by the National Rifle Association that comes just weeks after mass shootings in Las Vegas and Texas. \nOn a mostly party-line vote, the measure easily passed, 231-198, although 14 Republicans voted no. Six Democrats voted for the so-called reciprocity measure, which would allow a gun owner with the proper permit in any state to carry a concealed firearm to another state where it is also legal. \nThe bill now goes to the Senate, where it is likely to encounter a much tougher battle. \nIn the House version, GOP lawmakers added a measure aimed at strengthening tracking in the national background-check database of legal and mental health records that might prevent some gun purchases. Just last month it was revealed that Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman who killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., legally purchase firearms used in the attack despite a record of domestic assault in the Air Force that should have disqualified him. \nHowever, as The New York Times reports: \"... the background check measure was not enough to win over most Democrats, nor did it persuade law enforcement officials in some of the largest cities, including New York, who say the legislation would force locales with strict gun laws to bow to places with few or no gun restrictions.\" \nThe bill angered many Democrats who argued that following mass shootings that have killed 80 people, the times called for stricter, not looser gun measures. \nConnecticut Democrat Rep. Elizabeth Esty \u2014 who represents Newtown, Conn., where 20 first-graders and six teachers and staff were killed in a 2012 mass shooting \u2013 said the bill would undermine states' rights, \"hamstring law enforcement and allow dangerous criminals to walk around with hidden guns anywhere and at any time. It's unspeakable that this is Congress' response to the worst gun tragedies in American history,\" according to The Associated Press. \nThe NRA's executive director, Chris Cox, is quoted in the Times as saying Thursday's vote is a \"watershed\" for Second Amendment rights and that the bill would ensure \"all law-abiding citizens in our great country can protect themselves in the manner they see fit without accidentally running afoul of the law.\" \nIn the Senate, supporters would likely need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster by Democrats.

She completed her bachelor in dental surgery (BDS) in 2013. She has published three books, one being a novella and two are short story collections, all of which are available on Amazon and pothi.com. She has also released a compilation of her blog posts named Fond Illusion, available on Amazon as an e-book. Currently, she resides in Greater Noida with her husband and a daughter.  \nWelcome to On-Writing, Varsha! \n\nWas becoming an author always your dream or was it a particular event or incident that gave birth to the author in you? Yes, I had always wanted to have a book published in my name. I am a very shy individual keeping my feelings to myself. But sometimes these feelings affect my daily life to an extent that I had to put them to paper. And this gave birth to the writer inside me. I love writing as it gives me a peace of mind and it takes me into another world which I had created and I find it far better than the reality. It is a kind of escape from the reality and I find it peaceful. \nHow important are the names of the characters in your books to you? Do you spend agonizing hours deciding on their names? Basically, my focus is on my character's attitude and thought process. Though I do ponder over their names, but my major concern is on their being as an individual. \nWhat is your writing process like? Do you write every day? Is there a favorite place to write?  I cannot write forcefully and writing daily makes me bound like a 9 to 5 job which somewhere kills the creativity. I only write when I feel overburdened with my own thoughts and I feel an urge to relieve myself. \nWhat is different about \u2018Nest An Abode of Short Stories\u2019 ?  Nest An Abode of Short Stories is a collection of short stories that revolve around our daily lives. Stories are simple and one can easily relate to them. \nWhich is your favorite story in the book and why?  My favorite story is \u2018The Pink Doll' because I feel a painful end which provokes my thought process that how we as an adult can sometimes be careless regarding ours and our loved one\u2019s lives. \nWhich do you prefer as a reader? EBook or Paperback?  Though I had published my books as ebooks as well, I myself prefer reading the paperback versions because the feel of a book is achieved only when it is present physically in your hands, which, according to me, is the best feeling. \nHow long did it take to finish writing \u2018Nest An Abode of Short Stories\u2019? I am a dental surgeon, a mother of a three-year-old daughter and being a part of an Indian joint family, it was difficult for me to take the time out for my writing. Yet I tried and whenever I got the time, I wrote. It took almost six to seven months to complete this book. \nHow important do you think is marketing in today\u2019s world for any book? Marketing is extremely important for the book's success. With the advent of e-books, the number of books available has increased tremendously and standing out among these is difficult without marketing. Spreading the word about the book raise interest among the readers for the upcoming book. \nPlease share a passage or quote from \u2018Nest An Abode of Short Stories\u2019 for our readers.     \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem? Are you a fool? I think they are right. You are a total nerd. They are mocking at you and you barely cared to protest?\u201d He stared him innocently for a second or two and said respectfully, \u201cI don't care what others say or do, and you shouldn't do that as well. They might be having extra time to spend on such silly jokes. But I have only twenty-four hours to fulfill my dreams. You too, don't squander your time. This time won't return. Do you know how long would you live?\u201d \nWhat are the three tips you have for readers of this interview who are aspiring writers? Follow your heart. Your dreams are solely yours and no one except you can visualize them. Keep writing. Don\u2019t stop even if you couldn't make enough sales with your first book. Writing isn't a business, it's an exercise to keep you healthy mentally. Be patient because success doesn't come in a single day. Hard work is always paid. Thank you, Varsha!

Tauseef Mustafa / AFP/Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 3:27 am \nMonths after a tense standoff between China and India along their Himalayan border, Beijing on Thursday expressed anger at an Indian drone that crashed inside its territory. \n\"This action by India violated China's territorial sovereignty. We express strong dissatisfaction and opposition,\" Xinhua cited Zhang Shuili, a senior military official in China's western battle zone command, as saying. \nChina said the drone crashed in \"recent days\" but didn't say where. Zhang said his country would defend its national sovereignty against such intrusions. \nHe said China's border defense forces conducted \"an inspection of the device,\" but didn't elaborate. \nIndia has not responded to the charge. \nAlthough the two countries have made moves toward warmer relations in recent years, they also have a long history of border tensions. In 1962, they fought a brief, but inconclusive border conflict. They have also had ongoing disputes over sovereignty in other border areas, notably Aksai Chin, a Himalayan region that straddles their territorial demarcation in the west. \nThe two countries have also long been at odds over India's hosting of Tibet's government-in-exile and their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, considered by China to be subversive because of his calls for Tibetan independence. \nStarting in June this year, tensions flared again over a disputed region called the Doklam Plateau that borders China, Bhutan and the Indian state of Sikkim. \nAs NPR's Julie McCarthy reported from New Delhi in July , the problems stemmed from China's construction of a road in Doklam Plateau. \"Not far from the plateau lies the narrow passage that connects India's northeast states with the rest of the country \u2014 a strategic link called the Siliguri Corridor but more commonly known as the \"Chicken's Neck. \" Any possibility of China being able to sever that \"neck\" unnerves India. \nAs late as August, India had rushed troops to Doklam Plateau and although an immediate conflict was avoided, heated rhetoric on both sides has soured relations. \nIn September, India's army chief said that his country \"could not afford to be complacent and must be prepared for war,\" according to The Hindustan Times. \nAnd in November, China took umbrage at Indian President Ram Nath Kovind's visit to the remote state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China also claims, Reuters reports.

Furnace oil based power generation is back in business. The Prime Minister has reportedly ordered almost all furnace oil based power generation units to be brought online, at least for now. Only if this decision was taken before the refiners almost went to a halt in production due to ban on FO based power generation. \nIt is not clear whether the decision to allow FO based generation is by choice or by design \u2013 but refineries could care less for the reason, as long as they are able to get the units running. From what it increasingly appears, the hollow claims of zero load shedding caught up too fast with the government. The timings could not have been worse, as hydel generation has stooped to new lows, and increased gas demand in winters has meant lower gas based generation too. \nBut the second LNG terminal has not been handling any LNG ever since its first shipment, which goes on to show it is a calculated move to get clear of the FO inventories with refineries and PSO. If gas demand was the only reason, the second LNG terminal would still be handling imported gas today. Mind you, PSO has been facing huge demurrage cost at over $100,000 a week and something had to be done. Moreover, the near shutdown at refineries also meant shortage of jet fuel and reduced off-take from local E&P companies. \nA little birdie at a leading refinery told BR Research that such is the level of understanding at the relevant ministries that a certain secretary admitted of not even knowing that banning FO based power generation could cause such a big issue for refineries. The power and petroleum divisions of the ministry are just one floor apart \u2013 yet the decision making makes it seem seven seas apart. \nThe merger of ministries would serve little purpose if it remains symbolic and there is no coherence in decisions of such importance. The last month and so at the energy ministry is clearly a case of too many cooks. Surely it is no rocket science to think before acting, and taking decisions mutually or at least take the other wing of the same ministry on board. \nAll is well that ends well they say, so refineries should breathe a sigh of relief. Meanwhile, the ministry would do well to chalk out a detailed plan for refiners, power producers, gas companies, terminals and all others involved, to avoid embarrassment of such magnitude again. \nCopyright Business Recorder, 2017 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "business recorder", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "br research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pso", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:09.038+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "599ce38c4ace196f764f38a0cf797b4c42438183", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQOY2Vu62HdS2fx3k67ipt6upNUj_7ZtN6LqnUt8k7aPkwp271IjKAQvl_KYR9aEbqJ6.fiH6VeQc8pVExAKXkIkdrMGsLr8zk3NHu9zYAZwss7sw_sHmTOmioqfbxRFDQ-", "site_full": "article.wn.com", "site": "wn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.wn.com/English/keyword/africa", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WN.com - Africa News", "title": "Perrance Shiri, Obert Mpofu Dragged to Court in Mat North Land Row", "title_full": "Perrance Shiri, Obert Mpofu Dragged to Court in Mat North Land Row", "published": "2017-12-07T11:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u6JNDkM1PsI/0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5594, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "599ce38c4ace196f764f38a0cf797b4c42438183", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQOY2Vu62HdS2fx3k67ipt6upNUj_7ZtN6LqnUt8k7aPkwp271IjKAQvl_KYR9aEbqJ6.fiH6VeQc8pVExAKXkIkdrMGsLr8zk3NHu9zYAZwss7sw_sHmTOmioqfbxRFDQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "Perrance Shiri, Obert Mpofu Dragged to Court in Mat North Land Row", "text": "Perrance Shiri, Obert Mpofu Dragged to Court in Mat North Land Row Posted , 2017-12-07 developed with YouTube [New Zimbabwe] NEWLY appointed government ministers Air Marshal Perrance Shiri, Obert Mpofu and police commissioner-general Augustine Chihuri and Prosecutor General Ray Goba have been dragged to court in a land dispute. ...

Reactions from Harare to new Zimbabwean cabinet published: 06 Dec 2017 Reactions from Harare to new Zimbabwean cabinet Reactions from Harare to new Zimbabwean cabinet published: 06 Dec 2017 views: 16 \n(1 Dec 2017) Zimbabwe\\'s new President Emmerson Mnangagwa has appointed a new Cabinet filled with ruling party loyalists and figures linked to the military, whose takeover helped oust former leader Robert Mugabe. No opposition politicians are included. The 22-member Cabinet announced late Thursday on state-run television includes Maj. Gen. Sibusiso Moyo as foreign minister, Air Marshal Perrance Shiri as agriculture minister and Chris Mutsvangwa, leader of Zimbabwe\\'s war veterans, as information minister. For some Zimbabweans, who had hoped that the new leader would make the Cabinet more inclusive, Thursday night\\'s announcement was seen as a disappointment after they had cheered the military\\'s takeover and backed the ruling party\\'s impeachment efforts. Political analyst Thoko Matshe said the new cabinet was a \\\"disappointment\\\". Civil society activist Marvellous Khumalo described the newly-appointed members of the cabinet as \\\"old recycled ministers\\\". In contrast, some Zanu PF supporters expressed confidence in the new president. Speaking to the Associated Press, Zanu PF youth member Shepherd Takawanda said \\\"I have got confidence in his brain, he has got a reason for that cabinet\\\". On Friday, Mnangagwa said the economically struggling country must modernize in order to engage with a \\\"fiercely competitive\\\" world. Discontent with Zimbabwe\\'s economy was a factor in Mugabe\\'s downfall. Industries have collapsed, unemployment is high and cash shortages are rife.

Military muscles into first post Mugabe cabinet published: 02 Dec 2017 Military muscles into first post Mugabe cabinet Military muscles into first post Mugabe cabinet published: 02 Dec 2017 views: 129 \n.Military muscles into first post-Mugabe cabinet. Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa appointed senior military officials to top posts in his first cabinet on Friday in what was widely seen as a reward for the army\u2019s role in the removal of his predecessor, Robert Mugabe. Sworn in as president a week ago after 93-year-old Mugabe quit in the wake of a de facto military coup, Mnangagwa made Major-General Sibusiso Moyo foreign minister and handed Air Marshal Perrance Shiri the sensitive land portfolio. The new president, who later on Friday spoke publicly about the need to draw on local expertise and skills to put the economy back on robust footing, also brought back Patrick Chinamasa as finance minister despite his chequered record in that post previously. Most Zimbabweans remember Moyo as the khaki-clad general who went on state television in the early hours of Nov. 15 to announce the military takeover that ended Mugabe\u2019s 37-year rule. Shiri is feared \u2013 and loathed \u2013 by many Zimbabweans as the former commander of the North Korean-trained \u20185 Brigade\u2019 that played a central role in the so-called Gukurahundi massacres in Matabeleland in 1983 in which an estimated 20,000 people were killed. The land portfolio is a sensitive but economically crucial one since land reforms in the early 2000s led to violent seizure of thousands of white-owned farms and the collapse of the nation\u2019s economy. \u201cFor most observers, this (the new cabinet line-up) looks like a reward for the military \u2013 or more specifically like the military asserting its authority,\u201d London-based political analyst Alex...

New series of US dollars are issued with different signatures when the Secretary of the Treasury changes. The supernote in question was a copy of the 2006 series. \u201cEarly last year, a suspected counterfeit dollar bill at a branch in Seoul was separated out with a regular identification device and underwent visual scanning before being sent to the main branch\u2019s counterfeiting response center,\u201d a Hana Bank source said. \u201cAfter video deciphering, the center concluded that a detailed identification would be needed. The original was obtained, and detailed analysis showed that it was a supernote,\u201d the source added. \u201cApparently the same conclusion was reached when the information was later shared with the National Intelligence Service.\u201d The same source said the method used had \u201cnot yet been reported to Interpol, which makes it impossible to know how many are actually circulating.\u201d Recent dollar series are more difficult to forge. Supernotes are reportedly produced by protected state-level manufacturing facilities in North Korea and other countries, and are deliberately designed to be difficult to distinguish with the counterfeit identification equipment available at most bank branches. In addition to using special ink and paper that change color at different angles, the supernotes are also produced with printing techniques that create a rugged texture on the bill\u2019s surface. \u201cTo print supernote-level forgeries, you need a minting corporation-level production line in place, which costs hundreds of billions of won,\u201d explained a Hana Bank source. \u201cThis makes it difficult for ordinary criminal organizations to produce them.\u201d \u201cThe bank has no knowledge of any connection between North Korea and the supernote-level forgery that was discovered [on this occasion],\u201d the source said, adding that the NIS would \u201cattempt to determine the route behind its circulation.\u201d By Jung Se-ra, staff reporter Please direct questions or comments to [english@hani.co.kr]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jung se-ra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "keb hana bank", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "national intelligence service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hana bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "interpol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "treasury", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:10.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "885137225af97da12ec5d228fba94a83a4ac57e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYyoODA_sG6MMGxFh26nSAvKG6FLuHYMMK.qGc.H8OCT4b6ADl4hL28a105ixKab6oIt0YVncTa0MCmGDTGglkDituxkQqLfwO7UUoRVSaDmFfepoti_qHPl48BeZ1mfSr9wcEHe68.9I-", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.co.za", "site": "tripadvisor.co.za", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/ShowForum-g187768-i20-o40-Italy.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Italy Forum, Travel Discussion for Italy - TripAdvisor", "title": "Agritourismo in Tuscany recommendation for two adults - Italy", "title_full": "Agritourismo in Tuscany recommendation for two adults - Italy Message Board - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-06T03:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.036, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10000, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8a42ebf1cfccb15738f3fe2ca9180c08dc252717", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYyoODA_sG6MMGxFh26nSAvKG6FLuHYMMK.qGc.H8OCT4b6ADl4hL28a105ixKab6oIt0YVncTa0MCmGDTGglkDituxkQqLfwO7UUoRVSaDmFfepoti_qHPl48BeZ1mfSrb7VfZln9_nBWNbKP27fI5w--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "pnaj", "published": "2017-12-07T00:51:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Don't fret quite yet about the lack of response.

Although recent rain provided temporary relief from drought conditions, the extended forecast for December reflects continued drought and warmer than normal temperatures. \nTo ensure the safety of Florida\u2019s citizens, homes and natural resources, the Florida Forest Service provided the following tips to reduce fire hazards in and around the home: \n\u00b7 Keep natural and artificial indoor trees away from fireplaces, portable heaters and other heat sources. \u00b7 Use only non-combustible or flame-resistant decorations. \u00b7 Check the labels on lights to make sure they were tested at a facility, such as UL or ETL, and follow manufacturer\u2019s instructions for use. \u00b7 Discard any lights with cracked sockets, frayed or bare wires, or loose connections. \u00b7 Always turn off holiday lights and extinguish candles when going to sleep or leaving the house. \nThe Florida Forest Service also encourages residents to clear dry debris from roofs and yards to eliminate the link that could carry a wildfire from the woods to their homes and asks that they refrain from burning collected yard debris at this time.

If backed by Labour, the challenge will pose a major threat to a weakened Theresa May, after she lost her parliamentary majority in the general election.\nWriting in The Times , Ms Soubry and Mr Umunna, co-chairs of the all-party parliamentary group on EU relations, said: \u201cThrough their elected representatives, the British people must now take control and one way to achieve that is to ensure that parliament will not just debate the withdrawal terms but have the power to determine them in statute and consider other options.\"\nTheir demands include a vote on the final deal before Britain leaves the EU, where MPs are given comprehensive detail of the withdrawal agreements, while the terms of our withdrawal should be approved by way of a legally binding act of parliament.\nThe pair said: \"If more time is required before sufficient detail arises from the negotiations, the government can seek an extension of the negotiation timetable from our EU partners to allow for a vote and our departure after March 2019.\"\nIn a dig at Brexit-backing colleagues, they added: \"If the government is serious about reasserting parliamentary sovereignty, it should have no objections to these very reasonable demands.\"\nIn a sign of growing disquiet among pro-EU Tories, a group of 19 MPs - including several former cabinet ministers - also wrote to Ms May to condemn their \"highly irresponsible\" Brexit-backing colleagues who \"seek to dictate terms\" which could lead to Britain leaving the EU without a deal.\nIt comes as the Prime Minister faced a race against time to come up with a suitable plan for the Irish border after Brexit, after her allies in the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) effectively vetoed draft plans to allow similar regulatory arrangements between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\nThe DUP - who effectively prop up Ms May's minority government - refuse to accept any deal that would see Northern Ireland offered different arrangements to the rest of the UK.\nIf Ms May cannot find a deal acceptable to Brussels, Dublin and Belfast then the UK could be prevented from moving onto vital trade talks until next year.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "chuka umunna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dominic grieve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "soubry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anna soubry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umunna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "democratic unionist party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dup", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belfast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dublin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republic", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:10.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f7b3161723d3649f3f37675adb7440eb31973df6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9nQrDfWKXFizjvzjrUYzU1yFmADLvUNbTPFFO2y5A4DLrsLU4VpeRWaPyRToJ2rLw-", "site_full": "www.gazettextra.com", "site": "gazettextra.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bucks stall Pistons | GazetteXtra", "title_full": "Bucks stall Pistons | GazetteXtra", "published": "2017-12-06T23:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.851, "main_image": "http://www.gazettextra.com/assets/jpeg/JG8079106.JPG", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 91873, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f7b3161723d3649f3f37675adb7440eb31973df6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9nQrDfWKXFizjvzjrUYzU1yFmADLvUNbTPFFO2y5A4DLrsLU4VpeRWaPyRToJ2rLw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Associated Press", "published": "2017-12-06T23:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Bucks stall Pistons | GazetteXtra", "text": "Associated Press Wednesday, December 6, 2017 \nGiannis Antetokounmpo had 25 points and nine rebounds, and the Milwaukee Bucks used a strong start to the fourth quarter to beat the Detroit Pistons 104-100 on Wednesday night. \n\nKhris Middleton had 21 points, including four free throws in the final 20 seconds to help the Bucks win for the fourth time in five games.

You may have heard some nasty gossip that has put you off becoming a super cool Chook Lady or Hen Lad. Don\u2019t despair, we are here to get you back on cluckin\u2019 track with your coop dreams! Chickens really do make fantastic pets for the young and the young at heart and we\u2019re here to bust the most bogus of chicken keeping myths that we\u2019ve come across. 1. Chickens are smelly \nFowl doesn\u2019t equal foul! Chickens are actually clean animals that like to preen, primp and dust bathe several times a day. Their level of smelliness is based on how well they\u2019re looked after. Keep their bedding fresh , their run floor free of droppings, use diatomaceous earth to soak up any ammonia smells and don\u2019t overcrowd your coop and run. Your hens will stay fresh as a daisy if given the right care . \n\n2. Chickens are noisy \nSome chooks like to chin-wag, it\u2019s true! But chattiness really depends on the chicken breeds in question. Most chook chatter is a cute, soft babble that can\u2019t be heard on the other side of the garden. Some of the most quiet and docile breeds are Orpingtons , Pekin Bantams and Rhode Island Reds . Roosters , of course, love an early morning crow so most local councils don\u2019t allow them to be kept for this reason. \n3. Chickens are dumb \nChickens aren\u2019t just a bunch of bim-birds that aimlessly shuffle about your back garden. A pet chicken can learn tricks, come when called, show a level of self-awareness and even count! The anything but ordinary gallus gallus domesticus has a large range of physical communication methods and at least 24 distinct vocalisations . The eyes of a chicken possess one more colour cone than ours, so they can see a wider range of colours and shades than us. Groovy girls! \n\n4. Chickens are boring \nLast weekend, while your cat was napping the day away and your dog was still chasing his tail in an endless loop, your future chickens had an epic backyard adventure. Having a few chooks in your garden is endlessly entertaining. Their unique personalities are diverse and charming. They are curious and funny and will reward your observation of them with silly little jumps, dinosaurian bug hunting skills and charmingly cheeky moments of avian affection and pecking order squabbles.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "orpingtons", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rhode island reds", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pekin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:11.044+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "67d276a9567a7e9a8ae05c6e9d86d455afb9b121", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pOIu0PjaMHWQfV2Kow.71la3QuC36m6jd", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/his/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/his/ - History &amp; Humanities - 4chan", "title": "Who is the rightful successor to Rome?

Think of it as an easy way to catch up on (most of) what\u2019s happening here at The Kitchen though. \nWe will try to operate Fresh Picks the same way the big playlists in the game like Rap Caviar that update on a rolling basis, discarding older tracks as new ones are added. Unlike many of those though, we hope to do some kind of archiving of the older music featured as we are still a little old school in our thinking that we don\u2019t believe in the microwave, disposable mindset that has pervaded (even more than in the past) the modern music industry. \nExpect to hear music on Fresh Picks that runs the gamut of what we post here on the blog: (mostly) hip-hop, jazzy/R&B/soul, \u2018urban alternative\u2019, electronic, dance & bass music and some indie & pop music if it\u2019s to our liking and fits The Kitchen aesthetic.

(Montefiore Health System via AP) less In this Nov. 21, 2017 photo provided by the Montefiore Health System, Dr. Tova Koenigsberg at The Montefiore Einstein Center for Cancer Care in New York shows an example of a traditional mammogram scan. U.S. ... more Photo: AP Are 3-D mammograms really better? US puts scans to the test 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. It's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" WHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? That depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) The American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. The American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, though it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. And the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. WHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? Standard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles \u2014 not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet the standard of care in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. Some studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. HOW TO DECIDE? Understand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. Breast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. Consider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death \u2014 but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening \u2014 that overdiagnosis problem. As for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. THE NEW STUDY About 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. Researchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens. ___ This Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Credit: ISS Expedition 7 Crew, EOL, NASA A team of scientists using a state-of-the-art UCLA instrument reports the discovery of a planetary-scale \u201ctug-of-war\u201d of life, deep Earth and the upper atmosphere that is expressed in atmospheric nitrogen.\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere differs from the atmospheres of most other rocky planets and moons in our solar system in that it is rich in nitrogen gas, or N2; Earth\u2019s atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen gas. Titan, the largest of Saturn\u2019s more than 60 moons, is the other body in our solar system with a nitrogen-rich atmosphere that resembles ours.\nCompared with other key elements of life \u2014 such as oxygen, hydrogen and carbon \u2014 molecular nitrogen is very stable. Two nitrogen atoms combine to form N2 molecules that stay in the atmosphere for millions of years.\nThe majority of nitrogen has an atomic mass of 14. Less than one percent of nitrogen has an extra neutron. While this heavy isotope, nitrogen-15, is rare, N2 molecules that contain two nitrogen-15s \u2014 which chemists call 15 N 15 N \u2014 are the rarest of all N2 molecules.\nThe team of scientists measured the amount of 15N15N in air and discovered that this rare form of nitrogen gas is far more abundant than scientists had expected. Earth\u2019s atmosphere contains about two percent more 15N15N than can be accounted for by geochemical processes occurring near Earth\u2019s surface.\n\u201cThis excess was not known before because nobody could measure it,\u201d said senior author Edward Young, a UCLA professor of geochemistry and cosmochemistry. \u201cOur one-of-a-kind Panorama mass spectrometer allows us to see this for the first time. We conducted experiments showing that the only way for this excess of 15N15N to occur is by rare reactions in the upper atmosphere. Two percent is a huge excess.\u201d\nYoung said the enrichment of 15 N 15 N in Earth\u2019s atmosphere is a signature that\u2019s unique to our planet. \u201cBut it also gives us a clue about what signatures of other planets might look like, especially if they are capable of supporting life as we know it.\u201d\nThe research is published in the journal Science Advances.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t believe the measurements at first, and spent about a year just convincing ourselves that they were accurate,\u201d said lead author Laurence Yeung, an assistant professor of Earth, environmental and planetary sciences at Rice University.\nThe study began four years ago when Yeung, then a UCLA postdoctoral scholar in Young\u2019s laboratory, learned about the first-of-its-kind mass spectrometer that was being installed in Young\u2019s laboratory.\n\u201cAt that time, no one had a way to reliably quantify 15 N 15 N,\u201d said Yeung, who joined Rice\u2019s faculty in 2015. \u201cIt has an atomic mass of 30, the same as nitric oxide. The signal from nitric oxide usually overwhelms the signal from 15 N 15 N in mass spectrometers.\u201d\nThe difference in mass between nitric oxide and 15N15N is about two one-thousandths the mass of a neutron. When Yeung learned that the new machine in Young\u2019s laboratory could discern this slight difference, he applied for grant funding from the National Science Foundation to learn exactly how much 15N15N is in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nCo-authors Joshua Haslun and Nathaniel Ostrom at Michigan State University conducted experiments on N2-consuming and N2-producing bacteria that allowed the team to determine their 15N15N signatures.\nThese experiments suggested that one should see a bit more 15 N 15 N in air than random pairings of nitrogen-14 and nitrogen-15 would produce \u2014 an enrichment of about 1 part per 1,000, Yeung said.\n\u201cThere was a bit of enrichment in the biological experiments, but not nearly enough to account for what we\u2019d found in the atmosphere,\u201d Yeung said. \u201cIn fact, it meant that the process causing the atmospheric 15 N 15 N enrichment has to fight against this biological signature. They are locked in a tug-of-war.\u201d\nThe team found that zapping mixtures of air with electricity, which simulates the chemistry of the upper atmosphere, could produce enriched levels of 15 N 15 N like they measured in air samples.\nThe researchers tested air samples from ground level and from altitudes of about 20 miles, as well as dissolved air from shallow ocean water samples.\n\u201cWe think the 15 N 15 N enrichment fundamentally comes from chemistry in the upper atmosphere, at altitudes close to the orbit of the International Space Station,\u201d Yeung said. \u201cThe tug-of-war comes from life pulling in the other direction, and we can see chemical evidence of that. We can see the tug-of-war everywhere.\u201d\nReference: \nLaurence Y. Yeung, Shuning Li, Issaku E. Kohl, Joshua A. Haslun, Nathaniel E. Ostrom, Huanting Hu, Tobias P. Fischer, Edwin A.

The initiative has significantly reduced delayed transfers of care in only a few areas. \nThe chief executive of one trust said: \u201cWe\u2019re lucky to get below 99 per cent bed occupancy rates.We plan for winter all year round, but there\u2019s an underlying lack of beds and resources. There is a daily battle [over where to care for patients who need to be admitted] due to the lack of beds. \n\u201cIn terms of extreme pressure, we do worry. We worry about getting people into beds quickly enough.\u201d \nAnother trust chief executive said: \u201cWe\u2019re at 98 per cent capacity and 11 per cent of our beds are occupied by delayed transfer of care patients [who are medically fit to be discharged but cannot leave as social care support is not available]. Every day we have 80 to 90 patients in beds who should be somewhere else.\u201d \nChris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said: \u201cIt is worrying to hear of occupancy rates in some places moving close to 100 per cent before winter has started. \n\u201cThe health service may be sorely tested in the coming months as it is already at or close to full stretch.\u201d \nChaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association, said: \u201cThese figures are deeply worrying and show an NHS which is now struggling to find free beds year round. The UK already has fewer beds than equivalent European nations and further cuts could exacerbate pressures, which will adversely impact patients. \n\u201cBed occupancy remains higher than recommended safety levels of 85 per cent, and this is added to by lack of capacity in community services and social care. High levels of bed occupancy can increase the risk of cross infection between patients, and will make it difficult for many hospitals to provide beds to ill patients who desperately need to be admitted.\u201d \nA spokesman for NHS Improvement said: \u201cThe NHS is under great pressure, bed occupancy is very high in some areas and its staff are owed a huge thank you for working so hard for patients in these circumstances. \n\u201cPlanning for this winter has been more effective and more extensive than ever before. We would always encourage the public to consider alternatives to going to hospital wherever possible, including their local GP or pharmacist.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chris hopson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chaand nagpaul", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nhs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "british medical association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhs providers", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:12.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5db42fa86c411969fda87dd04fbe1da8dca5e419", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXnqxf5z74D_P4MjMYF9_UEbE5la7VnOqpRdJtlJ4B27NIOO3.rTHZaV21pDMCD9Ck6jAcGPiJMyNEX5Gj9cLEORk0sFZfz6vs-", "site_full": "notizie.tiscali.it", "site": "tiscali.it", "site_section": "http://notizie.tiscali.it/economia/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Finanza e Mercati.

While low-income people are more likely to struggle with health problems such as smoking and depression, new research shows many are motivated to improve. Thursday's study from the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index found that 40 percent of people on Medicaid say they're in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those with workplace coverage. The analysis for The Associated Press also showed that Medicaid recipients are invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care, experts say. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. Medicaid is a federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people. Today, it covers about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but officials also say they want to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills.

It is what I wished that MAC's Melon or Rose Pigments would have been. It looks fabulous with MAC's Melon and Rose Pigments, but is a different color.\nWarm intense pink base with luscious gold shimmer, this color is rich and beautiful. Makes fabulous lipcolor, blush, and eyeshadow. The texture is very fine, but coverage is excellent. When used with a good base, it stays on well, but if used with mixing medium, it is intense and looks even more rich and opulent.\nIf you were to put MAC Rose and MAC Melon Pigment together in a grinder, you might come out very close to this color. FABULOUS with MAC Golden Olive, many of the Sweetscents Gold pigments, Sweetscents Golden Green ,Robin's Egg Blue, MAC's Steel Blue, Sweetscents Copper Interference, Turquoise interference- this is a very versatile color.\nI love it as a lipcolor. It is truly stunning when smeared over lipstick or gloss. You can mix it in before application, but when i am out, I find it easier to just apply lipstick or gloss and quickly slash some pigment over it.

This event brings professionals and policy-makers together to openly discuss ways to adapt current transportation issues into innovative and improved economic and environmental realities. \n\nOn November 8-9, more than 150 attendees gathered at the Sheraton Bay Point Resort in Panama City Beach to attend the 2017 Emerald Coast Transportation Symposium hosted by WFRPC. A diverse and unique collection of panel discussions and special speakers filled the day-and-a-half event with valuable and cutting-edge information on topics including complete streets, public transportation, intelligent transportation systems, emerging transportation technologies, public involvement, tourism, freight, and more. \n\nSpecial guest speakers included Jay Trumbull, Chairman of the Florida Transportation Commission and Phillip Gainer, P.E., Florida Department of Transportation, District 3 Secretary. Keynote speakers were Dr. Monica Scamardo of Variate Consulting and Michael Willis of Color Nine Group, LLC. \nPictured below are some moments from the event, including the WFRPC evening reception, Starlight Soiree . New Year Ushers in Estuary Program for Bay Area Resource Council Thirty years of Bay Area Resource Council (BARC) partnership is creating a new chapter \u2013 an estuary program! BARC member governments (Santa Rosa County, Escambia County, City of Pensacola, City of Milton, and City of Gulf Breeze) teamed with stakeholders throughout the region to submit a successful proposal for a RESTORE-EPA funding opportunity to establish the new estuary program. On November 1, the BARC held a Pensacola and Perdido Bays Estuary Program informational meeting at the Escambia County Central Office Complex, bringing together 65 stakeholders, potential policy board members, and technical advisory committee members from throughout the Pensacola Bay and Perdido Bay watersheds in the northwest Florida panhandle and Alabama. \nEstuaries provide economic and environmental benefits, including critical habitats for birds, fish, amphibians, insects, and other wildlife. This includes species that are valued commercially, recreationally, and culturally. Estuaries maintain healthy ocean environments for marine life by filtering sediments and pollutants, and are vital to coastal communities, providing recreation, transportation, fishing, and tourism. \nThe BARC expects to stand up the Estuary Program over the next four years through a cooperative agreement from RESTORE and EPA, with Escambia County as the host agency. Please contact Katie Wilhelm at katie.wilhelm@wfprc.org for information on becoming involved. \nAbove: Chips Kirschenfeld, Escambia County Department of Natural Resources, provides an overview of the next steps in the estuary program.

Dec 6th, 2017 Guy sleeps on a bus by night. Photo: Walter Quiet (Getty). \nWho doesn\u2019t hate having to go through the airport to travel? After beating all the traffic on the road, you then have to work your way through check-in, hopefully get on your flight (if it\u2019s not delayed), and then you\u2019re packed into an uncomfortable seat next to somebody who doesn\u2019t know the definition of personal space. It\u2019s a headache. \nSleeping on a plane is a whole other pain in the ass. It\u2019s almost impossible to do, and there are more comfortable things life offers (like learning to swim in shark infested waters or having a month-long case of diarrhea). Luckily, there\u2019s a company that hears your gripes and wants to ensure you have a nice and restful trip\u2026 on their bus. Sleep Buses Are A Thing, So Pack Your Bags And Hit The Sack \nCabin is a California-based bus company that offers rides between Los Angeles and San Francisco. But before you call it \u201cjust another Greyhound,\u201d there\u2019s a big difference: these buses have bunks for you to snooze in. \nThe buses are lined with beds for travelers to zonk for the duration of the trip between the two west coast cities. Instead of the hassle of the airport or irritating drive through cow country, Cabin lets you lie down and knock out on your way to your destination. \nAs you can see, the sleeping cabins have more than enough room for someone to stretch out. They also offer something called \u201csleep water,\u201d which apparently helps you fall into slumber. I\u2019ve used this kind of drink before, but I usually call it \u201cwhiskey.\u201d They also have free Wi-Fi with bandwidth great enough to stream all you want. So if you don\u2019t fall asleep, you can catch an entire season of Stranger Things without a worry. \nThere are, of course, drawbacks to this kind of travel. For starters, a roundtrip ticket on Cabin is sometimes more expensive than a plane. For some, it\u2019s about economics, and they\u2019ll probably choose to fly. But for others, they might not mind dropping a few extra dollars for a full night\u2019s sleep and the luxury of not sitting next to someone who unfairly laid claim to the armrest. Also, I can\u2019t imagine there isn\u2019t at least one person on a bus full of sleeping bodies who doesn\u2019t fart through their sleep. It happens. \nAs for me, I\u2019ll get down on a trip with Cabin if it means I get to skip a flight or drive to San Francisco.
