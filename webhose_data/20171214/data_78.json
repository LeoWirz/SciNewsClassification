Amosun - Afro247.com", "text": "Ogun loses N5bn revenue monthly \u2013 Gov. Amosun Ogun loses N5bn revenue monthly \u2013 Gov. Amosun Gov. Ibikunle Amosun of Ogun on Monday disclosed that the state was losing between N3 billion and N5 billion as revenue monthly from haphazard toll collection. The governor said this at the inauguration of harmonisation of haulage revenue collection in state, in Abeokuta. The event, with the theme: `Harmonisation Eradicating Multiplicity in Haulage Revenue Collection\u2019, was attended by top officials of security agencies, stakeholders in transport and haulage sector. Also in attendance were chairmen of local governments and local council development authorities in the state. Amosun lamented the huge loss of revenue by the state due to unorganised toll revenue collection, saying the new scheme would address the identified inadequacies of the former method. He added that the harmonisation would also block revenue leakages and eradicate printing and issuing of fake toll tickets by some contractors. According to Amosun, the new revenue scheme will ensure that the toll posts being operated by local governments, agencies and LCDAs, no longer exist. He declared that the state could no longer tolerate illegal ways of toll collection. The governor further explained that the new scheme, apart from eradicating touting at the designated toll points across the state, would be in compliant with the directive of the Inspector-General of Police that all road blocks should be dismantled. \u201cIt is important to note that haulage collection should ordinarily come under the purview of the civil service structure. But, we decide to contract the collection to our people. \u201cOur aim was to create more openings through which we could empower more people. \u201cBut, I must confess that our intervention was grossly misconstrued and largely abused by majority of the participants. \u201cWe find out that a large chunk of generated revenue was not remitted to government and some of the operators have gone beyond the brief of the delegated authority. \u201cAs a government, we cannot allow such abuse which has led to major revenue loss and extortion of our people,\u2019\u2019 he said. He hinted that harmonised tickets will henceforth be issued by the state government, while erection of signposts, provision of reflective jackets and issuance of security code, will also be put in place to make the scheme a success. The governor warned that anyone found operating illegal toll points would be prosecuted and assured that the scheme would not lead to job loss, but would create more fundamental, dignifying and viable jobs for the citizens. \u201cLet it be known that any individual or group of persons found to be collecting haulage revenue without due approval will not only be arrested but made to face the full wrath of the law. To be fore-warned is to be fore-armed,\u2019\u2019 he said. He said that a town hall meeting would soon be organised, to further intimate the stakeholders and members of the public on the new scheme, expressing optimism it would reverse the trend of huge revenue loss. Earlier, the Commissioner for Finance, Mr Adewale Oshinowo, said the scheme was put together to end the haphazard way of collecting streams of revenues due to the government from all the 63 toll points and control posts. Oshinowo added that to achieve the desired result, a technical committee comprising the officials of the ministries of finance, commerce and industry, agriculture, forestry and environment, was set up to fashion out a modern method of collecting revenue.

It\u2019s miraculously true! But first let me tell you a story about an engaged woman losing sleep over wedding coordination. \nA year before our wedding and I was already getting inundated with questions. Spreadsheets, emails, accommodation advice, Skype calls, invoices, \u201cflights aren\u2019t even available yet, text me in a few months\u201d\u2013 planning our wedding began to feel less like party planning and more like a full time job. \nThen at my real full time job (hey, Bridal Musings world!) we came across Joy , the wedding app that would turn my coordination nightmares into the ease of filling out a social media profile. \nJoy is so much more than a wedding website. Of course, we could talk all day about how beautiful and customizable their personal wedding sites are, and how intuitive the websites run with schedules, countdowns, photos, maps and stories. But it\u2019s the coordination tools within the app that\u2019s got us singing \u201cHallelujah!\u201d \nWe\u2019ve layed out all our favorite features , how Joy simplifies all your wedding information, and passes off as an extra day-of-coordinator. Streamline Your Guest List \nTired of spreadsheets? Me too! \nNot only are they an eye sore, but they\u2019re not quite intuitive. Joy let\u2019s you import any spreadsheets you\u2019ve already started (so don\u2019t worry, you can switch to Joy from the stone ages) or quickly fill out names of invitees. \nOne thing I\u2019ve been dreading while creating our invites is requesting addresses, copying them from whatever text or email guests responded to, importing them to another spreadsheet, when does the fun begin?! \nJoy asks your guests to fill out all the information you need when they RSVP on the app or through your website then does the rest of the work organizing all the addresses, phone numbers, and anything else you\u2019ve asked your couple. \nThen, each invitee has their own special profile based on what they\u2019ve filled out, so guests can get to know each other, see who\u2019s coming, meet up the week of the wedding, and hey \u2013 see who\u2019s coming without a date. Communicate with Everyone, Instantly \nSay goodbye to the \u201cHey honey, I texted you, Christina, my parents and Ally in a group text about the new rehearsal dinner address, can you copy it and text your people?\u201d conversation. \nNow whenever you have new times, locations, or just general reminders you want to send out to all your guests, (or say, just your bridal party and family) you can take care of any communication within the app\u2019s Announcements function, all at once. \nYour guests will receive a notification just as they would a text, and can respond with any extra questions. No more scrolling through to find the right group text message, no more forgetting someone\u2019s phone number; it\u2019s so simple. \nAnd as a special bonus, you can use the Announcements section to thank your guests the morning after, and send out those pesky lost and found requests. Organize Every Wedding Detail in One Place \nThrowing a destination wedding? Treating your friends and family to plenty of parties the week of? All of the information your guests need to get to celebrating are organized in one place in the app and on your wedding website. \nCreate schedules for each day you\u2019re holding events, including times, maps, dress codes, and any important information you want to get across (like having a blast!). The app includes a handy \u201cAdd to Calendar\u201d so your guests will be alerted just as they would in their normal work and home life. \nAccommodation recommendations can be simply displayed along with links to booking and any room block information to disperse wedding discounts. Use the App as a Virtual Day-of-Coordinator \nDo you sometimes want to throw your phone out the window with all the wedding related questions you receive? Pass those questions off to your virtual day-of-coordinator, Joy. \nI love weddings, I love planning, I love travel, but responding to the same questions over and over is driving me a little bonkers. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so relieved the Joy App has come into my life. You can create an FAQ so that before a guest even thinks of texting you, they can find their question answered. Not only does this save you from repeating yourself, but it could spare you that uncomfortable \u201cI\u2019m really sorry you can\u2019t bring xyz to our wedding, please don\u2019t be offended.\u201d \nLay out schedules, maps, locations, and communicate through the app and on your website. Then, when it\u2019s time to put your phone aside and enjoy your wedding day, you can authorize any friend, family member or even your hired wedding planner to take over communication with your guests. No need to hand over your contact sheet, just add your responsible party to your Admins and let them answer the \u201cwhat time, again?\u201d questions for as long as you need. ..and Create a Beautiful Wedding Website! \nWhen you fill out all the information online or through the app, it automatically creates you a beautiful wedding website with your own url. Customize the look to your heart\u2019s desire, select what details are public or private, and save plenty of time to enjoy your engagement. \nWho doesn\u2019t love killing two birds with one stone? Essential Info Joy is absolutely free and available for download on IOS and Android . Create an account on the app or sign up on their website .

This mentoring gap is enormously consequential\u2014those with mentors are more likely to graduate from high school, attend college, and obtain a Bachelor\u2019s degree (Raposa, et al., 2017; Hagler et al., 2017; Christiansen, et al., 2017). Likewise, we are finding that, although having a mentor in college, knowing teachers, and being engaged in faculty around shared interests is associated with later life and career satisfaction (Gallup, 2015), more marginalized students are less likely to find mentors during college (Raposa et al, 2017). Although such findings are discouraging, they also suggest a promising point of intervention. Perhaps targeting the psychological processes that prevent students from reaching out to available adults is a key lever that could help narrow educational disparities. \nThe Connected Scholars (CS) program, originally developed by Professor Sarah Schwartz and colleagues and extended into a semester-long course by researchers at iRT , is a case in point. Through this intervention, disadvantaged students are provided with information about the value of mentors and a context for learning and mastering the skills for recruiting help, so as to become \u201cmentor magnets.\u201d A recent evaluation of an abbreviated version (four 1-hour classes) of CS among first-generation college students participating in the summer between high school and college showed significantly higher first-year college GPAs a year later, as well as closer relationships with instructors, increased networking and support-recruiting behaviors, and decreased help-seeking avoidance, relative to a comparison group ( Schwartz, 2017). 1 \n\n\n\n1 Schwartz, S., Kanchewa, S., Rhodes, J., Gowdy, G., Stark, A., Horn, J., Parnes, M., Spencer, R. (in press). \u201cI\u2019m having a little struggle with this, can you help me out?\u201d: Examining impacts and processes of a social capital intervention for first-generation college students. American Journal of Community Psychology. \nAn experimental evaluation of CS is underway, and variations of this youth-initiated mentoring model have also been shown to lead to improvements in a range of academic and career outcomes (Millenky, Schwartz, & Rhodes, 2013; Schwartz, et al., 2013; Spencer, Tugenberg, Ocean, Schwartz, & Rhodes 2014). Given that CS is relatively short term, focused specifically on the processes thought to impede mentor access, and effective, it fits the criteria for what researchers are calling \u201cwise interventions.\u201d In his 2014 article, \u201cThe new science of wise psychological interventions,\u201d Stanford researcher, Gregory Walton, described three factors that set wise interventions apart from others. This includes Wise Interventions are Psychologically Precise \n\u201cA wise intervention begins with a specific, well-founded psychological theory. This theoretical precision allows researchers to create a precise tool, often instantiated in a brief exercise, to change a specific psychological process in a real-world setting.\u201d(Walton, 2017). \nIn the case of CS, researchers drew on social capital theory and the findings that marginalized students have less access to networks of helpful adults and fewer skills and expectations regarding and value of such support when they encounter difficulties. Wise Interventions target recursive processes to cause lasting change \n\u201cWise interventions can improve outcomes for years\u2026.[they] change not a moment in time (\u201ca snapshot) but a process that unfolds over time \u201ca movie\u201d\u201d (Walton, 76) \nAs Walton describes, wise interventions are \u201crecursive\u201d\u2013that is, they target critical processes that become self-reinforcing and strengthens with practice over time. Consider again CS. Over the course of the 4 sessions, students learned how to identify helpful adults in their networks and practiced strategies for connecting with them through role-playing and real-world conversations. Exposure like this shifts students\u2019 orientation from avoidant to engaged\u2013shaping the mindset and skills that will be reinforced in each subsequent setting they encounter. In this way, CS redirects the natural proclivities that put students at a disadvantage and creates a new narrative and basis for understanding everyday struggles and solutions. These recursive psychological and social processes are amplified over time, as students gain mastery and confidence in the benefits of mentors and social networks and the skills to recruit them (Walton, 2014). \nInterestingly, this notion of a recursive process has implications for the more common, short-term experience of being paired with a mentor (i.e., as in the traditional friendship model). Traditional mentoring introduces students to a supportive adult who provides new experiences, but might only indirectly change the underlying psychological and social processes that gave rise to their disadvantages (McCord, 1978). Moreover, when the intervention is built around the experiences provided by a time-limited volunteer, there is the potential of disappointment and loss when it ends (Grossman et al., 2012). Targeted interventions like CS, are more robust because they are designed to target specific psychological processes and create recursive dynamics (Walton, 2014). Depending on the needs of the youth, other mentoring interventions that target processes (e.g., Lunch Buddies , Fostering Healthy Futures, Becoming a Man ) are likely to lead to more sustained change. More generally, the mentoring field would do well to embrace and dynamically deliver several of the growing number of \u201cwise interventions\u201d that target underlying processes and difficulties. \n3. Wise Interventions are context dependent\u2014not silver bullets \n\u201cBecause wise interventions target specific psychological processes and recursive dynamics, they will not always produce the same effects.\u201d (Walton, 2014) \nWalton notes that wise interventions, must be wise to the the population and context. This means it must matter in the setting at hand (e.g., if students already have plenty of social capital, CS will not improve their academic outcomes), and that students actively engage in and practice the skills (e.g., recruiting mentors) in the context of their specific surroundings. When delivered early, such interventions can alter recursive processes in ways that affect long-term outcomes. As mentioned, a brief exposure to CS delivered the summer before college appears to have interrupted students\u2019 longer term cycles of risk and vulnerability. \nOf course, interventions like CS also depend on resources being available in the context. As Walton concludes, \u201cIf a social-belonging intervention generates lasting gains by helping students to form better relationships, its effectiveness will depend on the possibility of forming these ties\u2026removing psychological barriers to learning will benefit only those students with access to adequate learning opportunities.\u201d \nThis, of course, underscores the need for creating relationship-rich settings and opportunities, where there are ample opportunities for students to access a network of caring adults. \n\nRelated posts:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

It has asked the Education and Skills Funding Agency for another \u00a31.5 million, but the funds \u201caren\u2019t forthcoming\u201d, according to the Cambridge News. \nThe school has been struggling with the legacy left by its disgraced former principal, James Stewart, who defrauded the school out of more than \u00a3100,000. \nIn October this year, Stewart was sentenced to four years in prison, after pleading guilty to four counts of fraud, two counts of aiding and abetting fraud and one count of misconduct in public office. The offences took place between 2011 and 2014. \nMoney that could have been spent on school maintenance was put to non-educational uses, such as furnishing Stewart\u2019s office with sex toys, rugs and a fridge full of champagne. \nAs a result of the neglect, the school is now in such bad condition that emergency repairs are needed to ensure the safety of pupils. \nSawtry councillor Simon Bywater told the meeting of his shock at seeing the state of the school. \u201cI was gobsmacked. It was tragic to see what was happening. There were rotten floors and water coming through the ceiling.\u201d \nSarah Wilson, principal of Sawtry Village Academy, told the paper: \u201cTwo of our school buildings, in particular, have fallen into disrepair. Maintaining school buildings requires leadership from people who manage the budget for it and are mindful of opportunities to put bids in for funding.\u201d You might also like... Schools relax term time holiday rules as Platt case goes to the Supreme Court \nThe decision to give the academy \u00a32m in funding was made despite opposition from some councillors. \nPreviously known as Sawtry Community College, the school became an academy in 2011 and has been part of the Cambridge Meridian Academies Trust since 2015. \nJoan Whitehead, Labour leader on the county council, said: \u201cOnce a school becomes an academy, it is not our responsibility. The responsibility lies with the governing body and the Secretary of State.\u201d She added: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a big pot of money. Our budget is currently \u00a35 million short of funds, yet here we are offering \u00a32 million to a school that is not our responsibility.\u201d \nThe funding from the council was welcomed by Denise Pike, a member of the academy\u2019s governing body. \nShe said: \u201cThis will cover the most urgent building repairs, but it won\u2019t cover the rest of the refurbishment needed on the site. We are trying to get ESFA funding of about \u00a31.5 million. We are having great difficulty with that.\u201d \nThe ESFA has been approached for comment. \nDon\u2019t forget to follow us on Twitter , like us on Facebook , or connect with us on LinkedIn !

December 2017 Accord Coalition for Inclusive Education questions reacts to Catholic Churches reported religious descrimination \nThe Accord Coalition has responded with alarm to reports Catholic Church officials are instructing state funded schools they control to actively support a Church campaign to allow faith free schools to religiously discriminate when awarding more of their pupil places. \nChair of the Accord Coalition for Inclusive Education, Rabbi Dr Jonathan Romain, said \u2018It is astonishing that Catholic educational authorities, who have regularly claimed they are inclusive of non-Catholics, are getting their schools to campaign for the right to have more 100% Catholic schools which can segregate their pupils from those of other religions and beliefs. These are state funded schools and while they may have a Catholic ethos, they should not be barring local children, nor misusing public funds to campaign to change how they are regulated.\u2019 \nAccording to findings released today by Humanists UK, the Catholic Diocese of Westminster\u2019s Education Service has asked schools to encourage local people to support the Church\u2019s public campaign to get the Government to scrap the current cap which prevents faith free schools from not religiously discriminating when awarding more than half of places. Schools in other dioceses are found to have shared similar messages, suggesting the promotion could be nationwide. \nSection 406 of the 1996 Education Act forbids the promotion of partisan political views in schools. Section 407 of the Act requires schools to present political issues in a balanced way. The Catholic Education Service of England and Wales was rebuked by both the Welsh and UK governments in 2012 after it wrote to its state funded schools urging them to encourage staff and pupils to oppose same sex marriage. \nThe 50% discrimination cap was introduced in 2010 when the free schools programme was launched. In the summer of 2015 the Conservative Government stated it would continue with the cap \u2018\u2026 as an important way of supporting these schools to be inclusive and to meet the needs of a broad mix of families.\u2019 The 2017 Conservative Manifesto stated the cap would be scrapped but there has since been public speculation that it would be continued.

Hull's St Andrew's school cuts Easter holidays to one week \nAn Accord commissioned Populus opinion poll in May this year found that 80% of voters preferred the 50% discrimination cap was continued rather than scrapped. Keeping the cap was supported by 67% to 33% among those self identifying as Catholic. \nDon\u2019t forget to follow us on Twitter , like us on Facebook , or connect with us on LinkedIn !

First of all, I can tell you that we are happy with Atiku coming back to the PDP. It is very exciting for all of us. It is a good omen to everybody in the PDP. He was one of the founding fathers, one of those who built this party and he is coming back home. His room was never occupied, so we have opened it for him. He will be part of this convention. He will even make a speech at the convention but he may not be voting at the convention.\u201d Adeyeye said \nChapter 2 (Part 1) section 8 and 9 of the party\u2019s constitution states the conditions for which a returnee to the party can vote at party function. deals with admission of members into the party.\n\n\u201cA person, who desires to rejoin the party after leaving it shall apply to his Ward Secretary for re-admission; and unless given a waiver by the National Working Committee, he willbe placed on probation for a period of not less than one year. Subject to the provision of Section 8(b), a member on probation shall have the right to attend all meetings of the party, but shall not be entitled to vote at such meetings, nor shall he be eligible to contest elective office on the platform of the party.\u201d\n\nWhether this will jeopadize the former Vice President's ambition to be the party's presidential candidate in 2019, only time will tell.

Referring a girl impure is a common practice by the society. You know that her periods are coming. Her period of what? Well, that depends on the girl. It could be crying, fits of anger, yelling, pizza consumption or chocolate obsession. So, instead of being the guy who panics or bolts when his girl\u2019s on her period, use these tips to be the guy who pampers her or a friend who cares for her until she feels a lot better.\n1. Don\u2019t mention words like blood, pains, cramps etc. in these days. Even when her mood is good, such words can make her feel the pain again and even more this time. She may get angry, cry, or behave strangely.\n2. Even if she gets angry, try talking to her being as much patient as you can be. You may think that her crankiness and her drastic mood swings are all a result of her period. You may be right. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to say it out loud. Keep it to you only. Don\u2019t blame anything on her.\n3. Get her food. Lots of food. Girls usually feel weak or more hungry cause of loss of a lot of blood in those days. Ask her choice. Get her what she wants to eat or cook yourself. It will make her love and respect you even more. She won\u2019t say, she won\u2019t show, but she will love you for this.\n4. Answer her questions with care. Your girl may come up with some cranky questions which don\u2019t even have a right answer. Your one wrong reply and you may be assaulted by a barrage of angry words, tears and the occasional threat to break up. Try avoiding such situations, or answer being really careful.\n\n5. Watch movies together. Just take a break from your routine and sit by her side. Hold her hands, get closer and spend some time watching her favourite movie or TV shows. This will make her the happiest.\n6. Never say a NO. If she wants it, she wants it. Treat her like a queen. Try your best to get her the stuff she wants.\n7. Ask her how you can help her. Do some entertaining things for her. Be a kid with her. Act weird, but being mature. Try to understand her pain. Get her pads, pills, hot water bottles just to make her feel better and show that you actually care.\n8. Last but not the least, DON\u2019T GET TOO CLOSE. If she isn\u2019t feeling comfortable seeing you getting closer to her, then STOP. Don\u2019t make it too cheesy for her. Don\u2019t make her feel that she\u2019s weak. Take good care of her like a mother does for her child, and see her smiling even on her worst days.\n\nPS.

He did not do what they are saying he did.\u201d \n\u2013 President Trump, re Vladimir Putin after their meeting in Vietnam. \nPutin later added that he knew \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d about Russian contacts with Trump campaign officials. \u201cThey can do what they want, looking for some sensation. But there are no sensations.\u201d \nNumerous US intelligence agencies have said otherwise. Former Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, responded to Trump\u2019s remarks by declaring: \u201cThe president was given clear and indisputable evidence that Russia interfered in the election.\u201d \nAs we\u2019ll see below, there isn\u2019t too much of the \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d stuff. And this of course is the same James Clapper who made an admittedly false statement to Congress in March 2013, when he responded, \u201cNo, sir\u201d and \u201cnot wittingly\u201d to a question about whether the National Security Agency was collecting \u201cany type of data at all\u201d on millions of Americans. Lies don\u2019t usually come in any size larger than that. \nVirtually every member of Congress who has publicly stated a position on the issue has criticized Russia for interfering in the 2016 American presidential election. And it would be very difficult to find a member of the mainstream media which has questioned this thesis. \nWhat is the poor consumer of news to make of these gross contradictions? Here are some things to keep in mind: \nHow do we know that the tweets and advertisements \u201csent by Russians\u201d -\u2013 those presented as attempts to sway the vote -\u2013 were actually sent by Russians? The Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS), composed of National Security Agency and CIA veterans, recently declared that the CIA knows how to disguise the origin of emails and tweets. The Washington Post has as well reported that Twitter \u201cmakes it easy for users to hide their true identities.\u201d Even if these communications were actually sent from Russia, how do we know that they came from the Russian government, and not from any of the other 144.3 million residents of Russia? \nEven if they were sent by the Russian government, we have to ask: Why would they do that? Do the Russians think the United States is a Third World, under-developed, backward Banana Republic easily influenced and moved by a bunch of simple condemnations of the plight of blacks in America and the Clinton \u201cdynasty\u201d? Or clich\u00e9d statements about other controversial issues, such as gun rights and immigration? If so, many Democratic and Republican officials would love to know the secret of the Russians\u2019 method. Consider also that Facebook has stated that 90 percent of the alleged-Russian-bought content that ran on its network did not even mention Trump or Clinton. \nOn top of all this is the complete absence of even the charge, much less with any supporting evidence, of Russian interference in the actual voting or counting of votes. \nAfter his remark suggesting he believed Putin\u2019s assertion that there had been no Russian meddling in the election, Trump \u2013 of course, as usual \u2013 attempted to backtrack and distant himself from his words after drawing criticism at home; while James Clapper declared: \u201cThe fact the president of the United States would take Putin at his word over that of the intelligence community is quite simply unconscionable.\u201d \nGiven Clapper\u2019s large-size lie referred to above, can Trump be faulted for being skeptical of the intelligence community\u2019s Holy Writ? Purposeful lies of the intelligence community during the first Cold War were legendary, many hailed as brilliant tactics when later revealed. The CIA, for example, had phoney articles and editorials planted in foreign newspapers (real Fake News), made sex films of target subjects caught in flagrante delicto who had been lured to Agency safe houses by female agents, had Communist embassy personnel expelled because of phoney CIA documents, and much more. \nThe Post recently published an article entitled \u201cHow did Russian trolls get into your Facebook feed? Silicon Valley made it easy.\u201d In the midst of this \u201cexpos\u00e9,\u201d The Post stated: \u201cThere\u2019s no way to tell if you personally saw a Russian post or tweet.\u201d So \u2026 Do the Cold Warriors have a case to make or do they not? Or do they just want us to remember that the Russkis are bad? So it goes. \nAn organization in Czechoslovakia with the self-appointed name of European Values has produced a lengthy report entitled \u201c The Kremlin\u2019s Platform for \u2018Useful Idiots\u2019 in the West: An Overview of RT\u2019s Editorial Strategy and Evidence of Impact \u201d. It includes a long list of people who have appeared on the Russian-owned TV station RT (formerly Russia Today ), which can be seen in the US, the UK and other countries. Those who\u2019ve been guests on RT are the \u201cidiots\u201d useful to Moscow. (The list is not complete. I\u2019ve been on RT about five times, but I\u2019m not listed. Where is my Idiot Badge?) \nRT\u2019s YouTube channel has more than two million followers and claims to be the \u201cmost-watched news network\u201d on the video site. Its Facebook page has more than 4 million likes and followers. Can this explain why the powers-that-be forget about a thing called freedom-of-speech and treat the station like an enemy? The US government recently forced RT America to register as a foreign agent and has cut off the station\u2019s Congressional press credentials. \nThe Cold War strategist, George Kennan, wrote prophetically: \n\u201cWere the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American military-industrial establishment would have to go on, substantially unchanged, until some other adversary could be invented. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy.\u201d \nWriter John Wight has described the new Cold War as being \u201cin response to Russia\u2019s recovery from the demise of the Soviet Union and the failed attempt to turn the country into a wholly owned subsidiary of Washington via the imposition of free market economic shock treatment thereafter.\u201d \nSo let\u2019s see what other brilliance the New Cold War brings us. \u2026 Ah yes, another headline in the Post (November 18, 2017): \u201cBritish alarm rising over possible Russian meddling in Brexit\u201d. Of course, why else would the British people have voted to leave the European Union? But wait a moment, again, one of the British researchers behind the report \u201csaid that the accounts they analyzed \u2013 which claimed Russian as their language when they were set up but tweeted in English \u2013 posted a mixture of pro-\u2018leave\u2019 and pro-\u2018remain\u2019 messages regarding Brexit. Commentators have said that the goal may simply have been to sow discord and division in society.\u201d \nWas there ever a time when the Post would have been embarrassed to be so openly, amateurishly biased about Russia? Perhaps during the few years between the two Cold Wars. \nIn case you don\u2019t remember how stupid Cold War Number One was \u2026 \n+ 1948: The Pittsburgh Press published the names, addresses, and places of employment of about 1,000 citizens who had signed presidential-nominating petitions for former Vice President Henry Wallace, running under the Progressive Party. This, and a number of other lists of \u201ccommunists\u201d, published in the mainstream media, resulted in people losing their jobs, being expelled from unions, having their children abused, being denied state welfare benefits, and suffering various other punishments. \n+ Around 1950: The House Committee on Un-American Activities published a pamphlet, \u201c100 Things You Should Know About Communism in the U.S.A.\u201d This included information about what a communist takeover of the United States would mean: Q: What would happen to my insurance? A: It would go to the Communists. Q: Would communism give me something better than I have now? A: Not unless you are in a penitentiary serving a life sentence at hard labor. + 1950s: Mrs. Ada White, member of the Indiana State Textbook Commission, believed that Robin Hood was a Communist and urged that books that told the Robin Hood story be banned from Indiana schools. \n+ As evidence that anti-communist mania was not limited to the lunatic fringe or conservative newspaper publishers, here is Clark Kerr, president of the University of California at Berkeley in a 1959 speech: \u201cPerhaps 2 or even 20 million people have been killed in China by the new [communist] regime.\u201d One person wrote to Kerr: \u201cI am wondering how you would judge a person who estimates the age of a passerby on the street as being \u2018perhaps 2 or even 20 years old.\u2019 Or what would you think of a physician who tells you to take \u2018perhaps 2 or even twenty teaspoonsful of a remedy\u2019?\u201d \n+ Throughout the cold war, traffic in phoney Lenin quotes was brisk, each one passed around from one publication or speaker to another for years. Here\u2019s U. S. News and World Report in 1958 demonstrating communist duplicity by quoting Lenin: \u201cPromises are like pie crusts, made to be broken.\u201d Secretary of State John Foster Dulles used it in a speech shortly afterward, one of many to do so during the cold war. Lenin actually did use a very similar line, but he explicitly stated that he was quoting an English proverb (it comes from Jonathan Swift) and his purpose was to show the unreliability of the bourgeoisie, not of communists. \u201cFirst we will take Eastern Europe, then the masses of Asia, then we will encircle the United States, which will be the last bastion of capitalism. We will not have to attack. It will fall like an overripe fruit into our hands.\u201d This Lenin \u201cquotation\u201d had the usual wide circulation, even winding up in the Congressional Record in 1962. This was not simply a careless attribution; this was an out-and-out fabrication; an extensive search, including by the Library of Congress and the United States Information Agency failed to find its origin. + A favorite theme of the anti-communists was that a principal force behind drug trafficking was a communist plot to demoralize the United States. Here\u2019s a small sample: Don Keller, District Attorney for San Diego County, California in 1953: \u201cWe know that more heroin is being produced south of the border than ever before and we are beginning to hear stories of financial backing by big shot Communists operating out of Mexico City.\u201d Henry Giordano, Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 1964, interviewed in the American Legion Magazine : Interviewer: \u201cI\u2019ve been told that the communists are trying to flood our country with narcotics to weaken our moral and physical stamina. Is that true?\u201d Giordano: \u201cAs far as the drugs are concerned, it\u2019s true. There\u2019s a terrific flow of drugs coming out of Yunnan Province of China. \u2026 There\u2019s no question that in that particular area this is the aim of the Red Chinese. It should be apparent that if you could addict a population you would degrade a nation\u2019s moral fiber.\u201d Fulton Lewis, Jr., prominent conservative radio broadcaster and newspaper columnist, 1965: \u201cNarcotics of Cuban origin \u2013 marijuana, cocaine, opium, and heroin \u2013 are now peddled in big cities and tiny hamlets throughout this country. Several Cubans arrested by the Los Angeles police have boasted they are communists.\u201d We were also told that along with drugs another tool of the commies to undermine America\u2019s spirit was fluoridation of the water. + Mickey Spillane was one of the most successful writers of the 1950s, selling millions of his anti-communist thriller mysteries. Here is his hero, Mike Hammer, in \u201cOne Lonely Night\u201d, boasting of his delight in the grisly murders he commits, all in the name of destroying a communist plot to steal atomic secrets. After a night of carnage, the triumphant Hammer gloats, \u201cI shot them in cold blood and enjoyed every minute of it. I pumped slugs into the nastiest bunch of bastards you ever saw. \u2026 They were Commies. \u2026 Pretty soon what\u2019s left of Russia and the slime that breeds there won\u2019t be worth mentioning and I\u2019m glad because I had a part in the killing. God, but it was fun!\u201d + 1952: A campaign against the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) because it was tainted with \u201catheism and communism\u201d, and was \u201csubversive\u201d because it preached internationalism. Any attempt to introduce an international point of view in the schools was seen as undermining patriotism and loyalty to the United States. A bill in the US Senate, clearly aimed at UNESCO, called for a ban on the funding of \u201cany international agency that directly or indirectly promoted one-world government or world citizenship.\u201d There was also opposition to UNESCO\u2019s association with the UN Declaration of Human Rights on the grounds that it was trying to replace the American Bill of Rights with a less liberty-giving covenant of human rights. + 1955: A US Army 6-page pamphlet, \u201cHow to Spot a Communist\u201d, informed us that a communist could be spotted by his predisposition to discuss civil rights, racial and religious discrimination, the immigration laws, anti-subversive legislation, curbs on unions, and peace. Good Americans were advised to keep their ears stretched for such give-away terms as \u201cchauvinism\u201d, \u201cbook-burning\u201d, \u201ccolonialism\u201d, \u201cdemagogy\u201d, \u201cwitch hunt\u201d, \u201creactionary\u201d, \u201cprogressive\u201d, and \u201cexploitation\u201d. Another \u201cdistinguishing mark\u201d of \u201cCommunist language\u201d was a \u201cpreference for long sentences.\u201d After some ridicule, the Army rescinded the pamphlet. + 1958: The noted sportscaster Bill Stern (one of the heroes of my innocent youth) observed on the radio that the lack of interest in \u201cbig time\u201d football at New York University, City College of New York, Chicago, and Harvard \u201cis due to the widespread acceptance of Communism at the universities.\u201d + 1960: US General Thomas Power speaking about nuclear war or a first strike by the US: \u201cThe whole idea is to kill the bastards! At the end of the war, if there are two Americans and one Russian, we win!\u201d The response from one of those present was: \u201cWell, you\u2019d better make sure that they\u2019re a man and a woman.\u201d + 1966: The Boys Club of America is of course wholesome and patriotic. Imagine their horror when they were confused with the Dubois Clubs. (W.E.B. Du Bois had been a very prominent civil rights activist.) When the Justice Department required the DuBois Clubs to register as a Communist front group, good loyal Americans knew what to do. They called up the Boys Club to announce that they would no longer contribute any money, or to threaten violence against them; and sure enough an explosion damaged the national headquarters of the youth group in San Francisco. Then former Vice President Richard Nixon, who was national board chairman of the Boys Club, declared: \u201cThis is an almost classic example of Communist deception and duplicity. The \u2018DuBois Clubs\u2019 are not unaware of the confusion they are causing among our supporters and among many other good citizens.\u201d + 1966: \u201cRhythm, Riots and Revolution: An Analysis of the Communist Use of Music, The Communist Master Music Plan\u201d, by David A. Noebel, published by Christian Crusade Publications, (expanded version of 1965 pamphlet: \u201cCommunism, Hypnotism and the Beatles\u201d). Some chapters: Communist Use of Mind Warfare \u2026 Nature of Red Record Companies \u2026 Destructive Nature of Beatle Music \u2026 Communist Subversion of Folk Music \u2026 Folk Music and the Negro Revolution \u2026 Folk Music and the College Revolution + 1968: William Calley, US Army Lieutenant, charged with overseeing the massacre of more than 100 Vietnamese civilians in My Lai in 1968, said some years later: \u201cIn all my years in the Army I was never taught that communists were human beings. We were there to kill ideology carried by \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 pawns, blobs, pieces of flesh. I was there to destroy communism. We never conceived of old people, men, women, children, babies.\u201d + 1977: Scientists theorized that the earth\u2019s protective ozone layer was being damaged by synthetic chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons. The manufacturers and users of CFCs were not happy. They made life difficult for the lead scientist. The president of one aerosol manufacturing firm suggested that criticism of CFCs was \u201corchestrated by the Ministry of Disinformation of the KGB.\u201d + 1978: Life inside a California youth camp of the ultra anti-communist John Birch Society: Five hours each day of lectures on communism, Americanism and \u201cThe Conspiracy\u201d; campers learned that the Soviet government had created a famine and spread a virus to kill a large number of citizens and make the rest of them more manageable; the famine led starving adults to eat their children; communist guerrillas in Southeast Asia jammed chopsticks into children\u2019s ears, piercing their eardrums; American movies are all under the control of the Communists; the theme is always that capitalism is no better than communism; you can\u2019t find a dictionary now that isn\u2019t under communist influence; the communists are also taking over the Bibles. + The Reagan administration declared that the Russians were spraying toxic chemicals over Laos, Cambodia and Afghanistan \u2013 the so-called \u201cyellow rain\u201d \u2013 and had caused more than ten thousand deaths by 1982 alone, (including, in Afghanistan, 3,042 deaths attributed to 47 separate incidents between the summer of 1979 and the summer of 1981, so precise was the information). Secretary of State Alexander Haig was a prime dispenser of such stories, and President Reagan himself denounced the Soviet Union thusly more than 15 times in documents and speeches. The \u201cyellow rain\u201d, it turned out, was pollen-laden feces dropped by huge swarms of honeybees flying far overhead. + 1982: In commenting about sexual harassment in the Army, General John Crosby stated that the Army doesn\u2019t care about soldiers\u2019 social lives \u2013 \u201cThe basic purpose of the United States Army is to kill Russians,\u201d he said. \n+ 1983: The US invasion of Grenada, the home of the Cuban ambassador is damaged and looted by American soldiers; on one wall is written \u201cAA\u201d, symbol of the 82nd Airborne Division; beside it the message: \u201cEat shit, commie faggot.\u201d \u2026 \u201cI want to fuck communism out of this little island,\u201d says a marine, \u201cand fuck it right back to Moscow.\u201d \n+ 1984: During a sound check just before his weekly broadcast, President Reagan spoke these words into the microphone: \u201cMy fellow Americans, I am pleased to tell you I have signed legislation to outlaw Russia, forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.\u201d His words were picked up by at least two radio networks. \n+ 1985: October 29 BBC interview with Ronald Reagan: asked about the differences he saw between the US and Russia, the president replied: \u201cI\u2019m no linguist, but I\u2019ve been told that in the Russian language there isn\u2019t even a word for freedom.\u201d (The word is \u201csvoboda\u201d.) \n+ 1986: Soviet artists and cultural officials criticized Rambo-like American films as an expression of \u201canti-Russian phobia even more pathological than in the days of McCarthyism\u201d. Russian film-maker Stanislav Rostofsky claimed that on one visit to an American school \u201ca young girl trembled with fury when she heard I was from the Soviet Union, and said she hated Russians.\u201d \n+ 1986: Roy Cohn, who achieved considerable fame and notoriety in the 1950s as an assistant to the communist-witch-hunting Senator Joseph McCarthy, died, reportedly of AIDS. Cohn, though homosexual, had denied that he was and had denounced such rumors as communist smears. \n+1986: After American journalist Nicholas Daniloff was arrested in Moscow for \u201cspying\u201d and held in custody for two weeks, New York Mayor Edward Koch sent a group of 10 visiting Soviet students storming out of City Hall in fury. \u201cThe Soviet government is the pits,\u201d said Koch, visibly shocking the students, ranging in age from 10 to 18 years. One 14-year-old student was so outraged he declared: \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay in this house. I want to go to the bus and go far away from this place. The mayor is very rude. We never had a worse welcome anywhere.\u201d As matters turned out, it appeared that Daniloff had not been completely pure when it came to his news gathering. \n+ 1989: After the infamous Chinese crackdown on dissenters in Tiananmen Square in June, the US news media was replete with reports that the governments of Nicaragua, Vietnam and Cuba had expressed their support of the Chinese leadership. Said the Wall Street Journal : \u201cNicaragua, with Cuba and Vietnam, constituted the only countries in the world to approve the Chinese Communists\u2019 slaughter of the students in Tiananmen Square.\u201d But it was all someone\u2019s fabrication; no such support had been expressed by any of the three governments. At that time, as now, there were few, if any, organizations other than the CIA which could manipulate major Western media in such a manner. \nNOTE: It should be remembered that the worst consequences of anti-communism were not those discussed above.

When he\u2019s not touring the world, playing shows for millions of raving fans and tossing cakes into the crowd, the DJ\u2014who turns 40 on November 30\u2014is in the studio rolling out track after track, building and collaborating with lifestyle brands, dreaming up video-game concepts and more. But for a eeting moment, you just might nd him in our city, enjoying a meal at his Lower East Side restaurant, Dudley\u2019s, before he\u2019s on to the next big thing\u2026 \nAt the core of your career, you\u2019re a musician. But you also have your hand in a host of interesting projects, like your new gambling video game with GameCo, Steve Aoki\u2019s Neon Dream. The gaming world and EDM, there\u2019s a synergy there. I\u2019ve done remixes for Dragon Ball Z, Injustice 2, Nintendo and PlayStation. Gaming is something I\u2019m already involved with, and the casino world is my bread and butter. I\u2019ve been playing in casinos in Las Vegas for over 10 years. I love Temple Run and all those infinite-runner games, so we thought, Let\u2019s do one of those and put it inside this neon future realm. My last two albums were Neon Future I and II, and I tie in music with futurism and the exploration of space and technology, so we called it Neon Dream. Music is a big component. You can hear releases from my label, Dim Mak, in the game. \nYou just launched the \u201cI Move Me\u201d campaign with ASICS. How does the brand relate to your lifestyle? An ongoing part of my lifestyle is working out. It\u2019s something I attribute my stamina to, being on the road for so long. Working out gives me a challenge, it gives me motivation, and you\u2019re sculpting yourself and maintaining your health. The lifestyle space is a huge part of my [career], designing for Dim Mak and working on building Vision Street Wear, so to apply that to the athletics world is a no-brainer for me. ASICS gave me the opportunity to not just be the brand ambassador, but to create a trampoline to build on this brand and give them my vision. Expect some really cool Aoki collections coming out through ASICS. \nYou\u2019re also the co-owner of Vision Street Wear, which recently dropped a new sportswear collection at Topman. It\u2019s amazing to go back into the archives and fulfill a dream you had when you were a kid. When I was a kid and started skating, I was rocking Vision. They\u2019re a heritage skate brand with such rich culture, and [they were] part of the early years of skateboarding. To bring that back now, decades later, is so exciting. And to bring it back in America, we needed a really great partner\u2014Topman was by far the number-one choice. You have to maintain the integrity of the brand. I want to keep the logo and the heritage there but build upon it and make it more fashion accessible. \nWhat inspired you to make a hip-hop album with your latest release, Kolony? There\u2019s nothing better than surprising people. I\u2019ve been working with hip-hop artists since day one. My first single was with will.i.am, and I was remixing Drake before 2010. All my previous albums had hip-hop artists on them, but with Kolony the process was different, and it is truly an EDM hip-hopinspired album from front to back. I\u2019m using Kolony as a vehicle to create more music under the same brand. The whole process was incredible, working with Lil Uzi Vert, Lil Yachty, Migos, 2 Chainz, Gucci Mane, T-Pain. And we\u2019re doing a music video for every single song. For \u201cHow Else,\u201d the video took us one year to make and we shot over 260 shows. There\u2019s over 5 million people singing along to \u201cHow Else\u201d in 60 to 80 countries. \nWhat ties do you have to New York? When I think of New York, I think of my father [Benihana founder Hiroaki \u201cRocky\u201d Aoki].

As I was laying on the bed in only my underwear I started feeling my ribs and hips with my hands.\nNo, I wasn\u2019t feeling myself up or anything, I just like to test out my bones, see if they are getting more prominent. I don\u2019t really see myself as I am most of the time so I find I can get a better idea of how much I am losing (or heaven forbid, gaining!) if I feel without looking.\nAnyways!\nMy hip bone felt bonier, I was laying on my side though so it doesn\u2019t really count. So I rolled over onto my back and was feeling my hips and thought \u201cyup, they do feel more pronounced\u201d so I decided to chance it and I looked down the length of my body to take a look at my hips.\nNormally when I do this all I see if fat so I don\u2019t like doing this.\nToday though I noticed my rib cage is sticking out farther than my breasts (don\u2019t take that as being too impressive, my bra was off and my boobs were flattened from gravity, stupid gravity, sigh) but the big thing, the exciting thing, the thing I am proud of is that there was a gap between my skin and my panties because my panties were held aloft from my body by my hips.\nI had a panty gap!\nWhich I don\u2019t know if that is what it is actually called but who the fuck cares? I have one!\nnd since my explanation makes n sense I\u2019m gonna try to find a pic\u2026\n\nOk so see in the picture above how the waistband isn\u2019t touching the torso cuz the hipbones stick out? That is what mine are doing now!\nOnly I don\u2019t look as good as in this picture cuz this girl is way skinnier than me. But hey, I\u2019m getting there! *crosses fingers*\nI\u2019ve been getting better with keeping my calories low and my binges less frequent. I think I sorta inadvertently reset when my friend died. I was so upset that I lost my appetite completely and when it started to come back I was better able to be ruthless about not giving in to it.\nI\u2019m going to have to be extra strict for the next week or so as I hurt my knee and can\u2019t run until it is a bit more stable. I\u2019m going to try the bike at the gym tomorrow, see if I can manage that ok, if so then I guess that\u2019ll be my cardio for a while, which sucks balls cause I get a way better workout from running (even though I hate running with a passion) but it is either take it easy for a week and then be ok or push myself and hurt my knee even more which then prevents me from working out at all, for months. It has happened. It is horrible. I really can\u2019t go through that again.\nI think I\u2019ll be able to maintain the strictness though, now that I have that panty gap, it\u2019ll be great motivation.

The recognition of Jerusalem as the natural capital for the State of Israel by US President Donald J. Trump was promised by the buffoonish steward of the empire. Delivering on it was not necessarily expected \u2013 US presidents, keen on courting pro-Israeli groups, had been promising to do so for years. \nOverthrowing the shackles of convention is something Trump believes is a valuable substitute for good sense. Ruffle feathers, dirty assumptions, and hope that it catches. One such convention is the steadfast refusal on the part of states to recognise Jerusalem as the Israeli capital in any de jure sense. \nFrom the White House, Trump claimed he had \u201cjudged this course of action to be in the best interests of the United States of America, and the pursuit of peace between Israel and the Palestinians.\u201d Such best interests evidently did not include Palestinians as such, but was \u201cnothing more or less than a recognition of reality\u201d. \nThis is a reality born of brute force rather than guiding law. In the case of the latter, it is without any distinct foundation, unless intangible spirits are accorded corporeal dimensions. UN Resolution 181, passed by the UN General Assembly on November 29, 1947, deemed the city \u201ca corpus separatum under a special international regime\u201d. \nSubsequent moves based around the force of arms were made in contravention of the resolution, though these never had the blessing of international law: Israel claimed West Jerusalem during the Arab-Israeli War of 1948; Jordan assumed control of East Jerusalem in 1950. \nThe Six-Day War of 1967 saw Israel seize the eastern portion of the city, an act that generated a string of finger pointing resolutions from the UN Security Council. Resolution 267 (Jul 3, 1969), confirming resolution 252 (May 21, 1968) reaffirmed the position that \u201cacquisition of territory by military conquest is inadmissible\u201d. \nSince then, the internal assumptions of the Israeli state have been unmistakable: legalise domination and legitimise control over the Holy City. The Knesset, in 1980 , decided to treat Jerusalem\u2019s status as an internal matter. \u201cJerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of Israel.\u201d The UN Security Council gave a different serve, calling on all states \u201cthat have established diplomatic missions\u201d in Jerusalem to withdraw them. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had certainly scored a coup, calling the move a \u201cgenuine milestone in the glorious history of this city.\u201d The US Congress, heavily lobbied by AIPAC and then Israeli opposition leader Netanyahu, did much the same in 1995, passing legislation requiring the move of the US embassy to Jerusalem. This measure effectively compelled administrations to sign a waiver every six months delaying the move. \nTrump, in refusing to issue another waiver, delighted local political punters. The Republican Jewish Coalition was so thrilled at the move from the White House, it took out an advertisement in the New York Times congratulating the President for \u201ccourageously recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s Eternal Capital.\u201d \nSuch moves are given the deceptive, even dangerous clothing of spiritual, immutable eternity. Ever ready for the pulp fiction narrative, Trump would tweet that the city \u201chas been the focus of our hopes, our dreams, our prayers for three millennia.\u201d \nIn the at times unsteady world of international law and deliberation, the approach to Jerusalem has generally been stable: refuse to acknowledge any one claim to sovereignty over the city in favour of an international administration or accept an outcome drawn from a peace process. \nThe tangible outcome of the declaration is hard to say, though its message is unmistakable, treading with disdain on Palestinian assumptions that East Jerusalem be the capital of any future state. It accords primacy to Israeli supremacy, and, importantly, the status of Judaism. The status of the city, intended to be the subject of future discussion as outlined in the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, is directly brought into question by Trump\u2019s move. This is the nature of unilateral punchiness writ large. \nAllies have been left stunned; Islamic states are waving their fists with threatening promise, more concerned with the reactions of their own populaces than anything else. To predetermine the outcome of the fate of the Holy City, claims Mouin Rabbani with some colour, \u201cwould constitute an act of premeditated political pyromania with unforeseen local, regional and global consequences.\u201d \nMahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority has been put in a particularly difficult situation, caught between having to take a frothily angered stand (Palestinian figures are clamouring for three days of rage ), but also what can be made of an essentially moribund peace process. \u201cThis,\u201d he rightly notes, \u201cis a reward to Israel.\u201d \nInflammatory outcomes are also promised with typical relish. Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb , imam of Egypt\u2019s al-Azhar mosque, claimed Trump\u2019s move would incite \u201cthe feelings of anger among all Muslims and threatens world peace. The gates of hell will be opened in the West before the East.\u201d \nMost strikingly is the notion that unilateralism is tolerable, even desirable, when it comes to matters Israeli. When other states, without Israeli consultation, choose to recognise anything Palestinian, even in terms of a nominal status, unilateral conduct becomes a matter for abuse and derision. \nShort of not packing the diplomatic bags and upping stakes from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, governments will maintain stony faces and deem such moves complicating, conditioned by a good degree of apocalyptic rhetoric against the US-Israel alliance. But over the years, the Palestinians have retreated into the recesses of a consciousness numbed by international rivalries among Muslim states. They are no longer the poster boys and girls of revolutionary justice. \nFrom the war in Syria to the conflict in Yemen, states of various shades of Islam are shoring up allies and rivalries with murderous consistency. Such continuing disunity is exactly what Israel, and its US backers, will be hoping for, letting the babble over Jerusalem slide into its own eternity. \nBinoy Kampmark was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College, Cambridge.

And Ireland is open to having a look at it.\n\u201cI expressed my willingness to consider that because I want to move things forward as well,\u201d Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told reporters late on Wednesday.\nMay also spoke to Arlene Foster of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party on Wednesday \u2013 there wasn\u2019t much sign of flexibility there. The party that props up May\u2019s government \u2013 and defines itself by its mission to keep Northern Ireland in the U.K. \u2013 is demanding significant changes to May\u2019s previous proposal, which would have left the enclave aligned with rules in the Republic of Ireland and therefore risked putting up a border between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. \nA disused customs control point near Dundalk, Ireland. Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg Adding to the tension on Wednesday night, Sinn Fein, the party that wants a united Ireland, held a protest in Belfast against a hard border with the Republic and unveiled a mural calling on Varadkar to use his \u201cveto\u201d to press his case, the BBC reports . A separate rally called for the territory to have special status inside the EU\u2019s single market. Northern Ireland voters opted to remain in the referendum, but the biggest party, the DUP, is pro-Brexit.\nWhile Irish officials were increasingly pessimistic earlier on Wednesday that a deal could be reached this month, Varadkar\u2019s openness to looking at another proposal reflects Dublin\u2019s opposing interests. Ireland wants talks to move on to trade and, after the U.K., has the most to lose from a messy exit. A no-deal Brexit would make a hard border on the island almost inevitable.\nMeanwhile in Brussels, there are signs EU officials are willing to be flexible on the deadline they set ahead of the key summit on Dec. 14-15. The bloc had said that this week was the \u201cdeadline of deadlines\u201d as the proposals May brings need to go through the EU machinery before leaders can announce a common position at the summit. But the tone softened on Wednesday, Ian Wishart reports. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is willing to meet May right up until the summit, officials said. One diplomat said the hard deadline is now Dec. 11, the day representatives of EU leaders meet in Brussels to prepare their position for the summit. Remember when Dec. 4 was the absolute cutoff?\nBrexit Latest Spilling the Beans  | The Cabinet hasn\u2019t had a formal discussion about what the future trade relationship with the EU should look like, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond revealed on Wednesday. It was what many had long suspected, particularly after Boris Johnson and Michael Gove\u2019s protests of the last two days. But it was the first confirmation, and contrasts with efforts on the EU side to start discussing the kind of deal it wants. The EU\u2019s position is that the U.K. should get a deal a bit like the one Canada struck \u2013 the best in class for EU trade agreements, but well short of what the U.K. enjoys now.\nWho Needs Numbers  | The other revelation on Wednesday was that the Cabinet decided to leave the customs union without a careful look at the numbers. David Davis told lawmakers that while \u201cqualitative\u201d assessments were made, there was no \u201cquantitative\u201d study. In the same sitting, he also revealed that the government didn\u2019t in fact have a series of studies on the impact of Brexit on different parts of the economy, drawing accusations that he\u2019d misled lawmakers. \nBrexit Tories Anxious  | Pro-Brexit Tory lawmakers are upping the pressure on May not to go soft. Peter Bone offered to accompany her to Brussels for the next round of negotiations, Jacob Rees-Mogg asked her if her \u201cred lines\u201d were fading to pink, and Bernard Jenkin urged her to focus on free trade deals beyond Europe. While all were impeccably polite, they were reminding her that she faces a revolt if she\u2019s seen to be softening her position.\nDavis Maneuvers?  | Davis supporters are testing the waters with a bid to replace May by Christmas, the Sun reports.\nWorst Outcome  | It\u2019s difficult, if not impossible, to envisage a worse outcome for the U.K. than a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit, according to a report from the House of Lords. Not only would it be economically damaging, it would \u201cbring an abrupt end to cooperation between the U.K. and EU on issues such as counterterrorism, police and security and nuclear safeguards. It would also necessitate the imposition of controls at the Irish land border.\u201d The government\u2019s line that no deal is better than a bad deal is \u201cnot helpful.\u201d\nBrexit Cloud  | The head of the country\u2019s main business lobby group says uncertainty around Brexit looms over every aspect of corporate Britain. It affects hiring, construction and investment decisions across the country. EU citizens will leave the country, and companies will shift jobs and investments abroad if May doesn\u2019t chart a clear direction for the country soon, Confederation of British Industry President Paul Drechsler is set to say in a speech. \u201cEvery day, companies are having to plan for the worst while hoping for the best. They are making choices that will determine new jobs, new plants and new investments in the years ahead. Businesses will press snooze for as long as they can \u2013 but the alarm will go off,\u201d he will say. Financial firms will start to make their \u201cno turning back\u201d decisions from January.\nBusiness Pressure  | The majority of British businesses expect their costs to rise over the next year as a result of weakness in the pound, but almost half are doing nothing to mitigate their foreign exchange risk, according to the British Chamber of Commerce.\nOn the Markets  | But maybe they don\u2019t need to. Currency strategists expect the pound to strengthen next year as a lot of bad news on Brexit is already priced in, Bloomberg\u2019s John Ainger reports.\nAnd Finally... The Irish prime minister seems to be getting an electoral boost from bashing Britain and the DUP. Support for his Fine Gael party is up 5 points from October to 36 percent, a poll showed today.\nLeo Varadkar.
