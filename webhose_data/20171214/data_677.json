News - telegram.com - Worcester, MA", "text": "Editorial: The right woman, in the right place, at the right time Thursday Dec 7, 2017 at 6:00 AM \n\nState Senator and now Acting Senate President Harriette L. Chandler, D-Worcester, suddenly finds herself, at the cusp of her 80th birthday, with a new and potentially overwhelming challenge as she navigates the senate through a maelstrom of its ethics investigation \u2013 not to mention the outside criminal investigation by the attorney general and the Suffolk County district attorney - over accusations that then Senate President Stanley C. Rosenberg\u2019s husband had sexually assaulted men involved in state matters as well as indicated that he had influence over state policy.\nThe shocking allegations, brought to light late last week by The Boston Globe, come amid some other recent allegations of women being sexually harassed in work or dealings with the legislature.\nFollowing then Senate President Stanley C. Rosenberg\u2019s decision to relinquish his president\u2019s position pending the investigation, although not resigning his senate seat, the Senate\u2019s 31-6 vote to elect Senator Chandler as acting president was, for a number of reasons, their best recourse. (The six votes against her were basically a useless pro-forma gesture by senate Republicans voting for one of their own.)\nMs. Chandler, who had been appointed by then Senate President Rosenberg as his senate majority leader, is by temperament and approach the right person at the right time for this new responsibility. Known to her friends and associates as Harlee, people who know her cite a hard worker who doesn\u2019t naturally seek the limelight, someone who's steady and reliable, who is known for her intelligence and for doing her homework. All that, and being \u201cmotivated by the right things.\u201d\nDon\u2019t mistake the low-key demeanor for a pushover. Decades ago, she was among a group of women and helped lead them in boycotting the Worcester Club for their meetings until it dropped its hidebound prohibition against women entering through the front door. She doesn\u2019t talk about it much, but she's also lived through breast cancer. And her passion for \u201cthe right things\u201d runs deep, focused on the work, including on issues that are not the usual front-page fodder.\nHer long-running advocacy for creating a mid-level dental provider - \u201cadvanced dental hygiene practitioner\u201d \u2013 providing oral health care for MassHealth patients not accepted by many dentists is a case in point. Her advocacy for oral health as a normal aspect of overall healthcare for poor and immigrant populations, can be seen in her compiling and arguing statistics on health outcomes, and in butting heads with a powerful interest group of Massachusetts dentists. The practitioner approach was pioneered in states where dentists are scarce, and it\u2019s her contention that the shortage of dentists willing to accept MassHealth creates a different sort of scarcity here.\nMore high profile was her work as lead senate sponsor of legislation, signed into law last month, to assure that birth control would be covered by Massachusetts insurers without a copay. Passage came under the shadow of Republican efforts in Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act as well as a policy allowing employers to deny coverage based on religious objections. The only religious exceptions in the state bill involve employees of churches and faith-based organizations.\nWith at least four state senators apparently positioning themselves for the senate presidency already, it\u2019s no surprise that the senate turned to Ms. Chandler to succeed Mr. Rosenberg in an acting role. She said she will step down from the acting president\u2019s position when the Senate\u2019s Ethics Committee completes its investigation. It's in keeping with her style. That investigation, focused on whether Mr. Rosenberg knowingly violated rules or ethics of the Senate, may be completed in less than two months. The committee plans to hire an outside investigator to take the lead and its results will be made public.\nHere\u2019s where we disagree with Ms. Chandler\u2019s position on her tenure. She shouldn\u2019t step down until both the Ethics Committee investigation and the state attorney general and Suffolk County district attorney\u2019s investigation is completed and reported. The Ethics Committee's focus is Mr. Rosenberg. The criminal investigation is said to focus on the actions of his husband, Bryon Hefner, rather than Mr. Rosenberg, who has denied any knowledge of the assaults. But imagine if the Ethics Committee were to clear Mr. Rosenberg, and imagine if \u2013 a very big if \u2013 Mr. Rosenberg were to attempt to win the senate presidency again or to continue holding onto his seat and it were later learned that the criminal investigation revealed information potentially impacting any votes on his status. Very big ifs, but also very big potential complications.\nOn other matters, Ms. Chandler is on the money. She said she doesn\u2019t intend to occupy the senate president\u2019s office or accept the position\u2019s substantial pay, although she is well compensated as majority leader. Her four-person State House staff, may or may not be augmented, but she also has three assistant majority leaders to rely on.\n\u201cMy job is to get everybody working together, get us through, and hopefully turn it over to a (permanent) Senate president,\u201d she told the Telegram\u2019s Brad Petrishen. \u201cI feel a responsibility to take that ship that\u2019s listing a bit and try and keep it going.\u201d She also said, in trying to be fair, \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a man\u2019s career here\u201d and \"this has to be open, it has to be public and it has to be transparent.\"\nWe'll hold her to that. And in the meantime, the senate will be well served with a steady hand at the tiller - a hand that should remain there until all the investigations are completed.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bryon hefner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harriette l. chandler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanley c. rosenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harlee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad petrishen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chandler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "worcester club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate\u2019s ethics committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the boston globe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethics committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "worcester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-worcester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suffolk county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:35.061+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "06e2ea50bf21b383cdb711c19715382f9319b8bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTK9tbdQ_2Ov5x0JjBZKZG1CW6MPn31sk0OhzDKdK3450cojT6MKSPEpKwH6WWq5qY-", "site_full": "forum.odroid.com", "site": "odroid.com", "site_section": "https://forum.odroid.com/viewforum.php?f=99", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "ODROID \u2022 View forum - Issues", "title": "USB3 not working on XU4", "title_full": "ODROID \u2022 View topic - USB3 not working on XU4", "published": "2017-12-07T05:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "KR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 70494, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "06e2ea50bf21b383cdb711c19715382f9319b8bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTK9tbdQ_2Ov5x0JjBZKZG1CW6MPn31sk0OhzDKdK3450cojT6MKSPEpKwH6WWq5qY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "odroid", "published": "2017-12-07T05:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "USB3 not working on XU4", "text": "We've shipped over several thousand of XU4-series boards every month.\nAnd we have around 20pcs of RMA cases due to the USB 3.0 related issue in this year.\nSo the USB 3.0 hub chip defective rate should be lower than 0.03%.

December 07, 2017 \nSome 281 troops will leave Somalia by Dec. 31, said Lt. Col. Deo Akiiki, deputy spokesman for the Ugandan military. Uganda was the first country to deploy troops to Somalia in 2007 to back a weak federal government in Mogadishu against an insurgency by the extremist group al-Shabab, which is responsible for many deadly attacks in Somalia and elsewhere in the region. \nUnder an agreement between the African Union and the U.N. Security Council the number of all African peacekeepers in Somalia will be reduced by 1,000 before the end of 2017, Akiiki said. The African Union plans to withdraw all its 22,000 forces from Somalia by the end of 2020, prompting questions about the ability of Somalia's army to fight al-Shabab on its own. \nUganda has more than 6,000 troops in Somalia as part of the multi-national African Union force. Other African countries such as Burundi and Kenya also contribute to the regional force. The Western-backed deployments have helped to push Islamic extremists out of Mogadishu and other areas, even though the rebels still make frequent bombing attacks targeting public places. The armed group is now mostly active in the southern rural areas of Somalia. \nAl-Shabab, which is allied to al-Qaida, opposes the presence of foreign troops in Somalia. The group has mounted deadly attacks in Kenya and Uganda, saying the killings were in retaliation over those countries' military involvement in Somalia.

Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan waves to a group of workers at the airport in Ankara, Turkey, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017 prior to his departure on a two-day official visit to Greece. Erdogan accused U.S.President Donald Trump of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" by declaring the divided holy city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.The Turkish leader said, addressing Trump: \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it.\".(Kayhan Ozer/Pool via AP) December 07, 2017 \nErdogan was greeted by an honor guard at the airport and headed to central Athens, laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier before talks with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and other officials. On Friday, he travels to northeastern Greece to meet with members of the country's Muslim minority. \nSecurity was tight in the Greek capital, with roads shut down and demonstrations banned in the center of Athens. On the eve of his arrival, Erdogan alarmed Greek officials by saying in an interview with Greece's Skai television that the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, which determined current Greek-Turkish borders among other issues, should be \"updated.\" \n\"In fact, all agreements (pacts) in the world should be updated with the passage of time,\" Erdogan said in the interview. \"Lausanne too, in the face of all these developments, is in need of an update. This update would be beneficial not only for Turkey but also for Greece.\" \nErdogan has made similar comments in the past about the peace treaty, which set the borders of modern Turkey, but his repetition on the day before his arrival in Athens came as an unwelcome surprise to his hosts. \nHis comments \"raises serious concerns and questions,\" Greek government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said in a statement. \"The Greek government and the prime minister want his visit to be a reason to build bridges, not to raise walls.\" \nTzanakopoulos said respecting the treaty is \"the exclusive and non-negotiable foundation on which the honest cooperation of the two countries can be built.\" \"Comments regarding its revision do not contribute to the climate we are trying to build in our relations and in the region,\" he said. \nThe refugee crisis will be high on the agenda of talks with Erdogan, as Greek islands have been the gateway into Europe for migrants crossing from the Turkish coast. Regional relations, energy and business ties, Turkey's stalled bid to join the European Union and longstanding disputes such as Turkey's territorial claims in the Greek Aegean will also be discussed. \nOne of the current thorny issues to be raised will be the case of eight Turkish servicemen who have requested asylum in Greece following last year's failed coup in Turkey. Ankara has demanded their extradition, a request rejected by Greek courts on the grounds they could not be guaranteed a fair trial in Turkey. \nThe move infuriated Erdogan, who said in his Wednesday interview that his country's judicial system is \"the best in Europe.\" He said Tsipras had promised to return the servicemen in \"15 to 20 days\" after they flew to Greece in a military helicopter. \n\"That is what he said. But unfortunately right now they are still in Greece,\" Erdogan said, adding that the servicemen should have been handed over before Greek courts became involved. \"If you leave it up to the judiciary there will be no result,\" he said. \"In order to facilitate the work of the judiciary you must first, as the government, take the necessary measures before you assign it to the judiciary.\" \nErdogan's visit comes as his country finds itself increasingly isolated on the international stage, and his comments will be closely watched for signs he might try to improve some of Turkey's international relations, particularly with the EU. \nTurkey's ties with the EU, and with several European countries, deteriorated significantly following Erdogan's post-coup crackdown. Tens of thousands of Turks have been fired from their jobs, and tens of thousands more have been imprisoned on accusations of being linked, however tenuously, with Fethullah Gulen, the U.S.-based Islamic cleric that Erdogan blames for masterminding the coup. \nOther than Greece, Poland is the only other EU country to have invited Erdogan to visit since mid-2016. Historical tensions between Greece and Turkey, which have brought the two countries to the brink of war on three occasions since the 1970s, remain. Decades-old thorny issues include territorial disputes in the Aegean, the Muslim minority in northeastern Greece and the continued occupation by Turkish troops of northern Cyprus. \nTension between Ankara and Washington has also increased recently, particularly over the New York trial of a Turkish banker over alleged transactions with Iran. Earlier in the week, Erdogan described the trial of Mehmet Hakan Atilla as an American conspiracy to blackmail and blemish his country.

You have the option to take advantage of the principles of object-oriented programming.\nMake two different views, one for workers and one for managers, using common identifiers for general controls. Do two different controllers, like the one for managers, to be the successor to the controller for the workers. This will give you a logical separation of both views and allowed features for each user group.\nHere is a sample implementation.\nThese are the two controllers: worker_homescreen.fxml\n<VBox xmlns=\"http://javafx.com/javafx\" xmlns:fx=\"http://javafx.com/fxml\" fx:controller=\"sample.WorkerController\"> <children> <Label text=\"Worker\"/> <Button text=\"Different Action Button\" onAction=\"#handleDifferentActionButton\"/> <Button text=\"General Action Button\" onAction=\"#handleGeneralActionButton\"/> </children> </VBox>\nand manager_homescreen.fxml\n<VBox xmlns=\"http://javafx.com/javafx\" xmlns:fx=\"http://javafx.com/fxml\" fx:controller=\"sample.ManagerController\"> <children> <Label text=\"Manager\"/> <Button text=\"Manager Only Button\" onAction=\"#handleManagerButton\"/> <Button text=\"Different Action Button\" onAction=\"#handleDifferentActionButton\"/> <Button text=\"General Action Button\" onAction=\"#handleGeneralActionButton\"/> </children> </VBox>\nThe General Action Button is a control available in both views, which performs the same function. Different Action Button is also available in both views but performs different things depending on which view is loaded. And, of course, Manager Only Button is only available in the Mannard view and performs a specific feature available only for Managers.\nAll this \"magic\" comes from the inheritance of the controllers used.\npublic class WorkerController { @FXML protected void initialize() { } @FXML protected void handleDifferentActionButton(ActionEvent event) { } @FXML protected void handleGeneralActionButton(ActionEvent event) { } } public class ManagerController extends WorkerController { @FXML @Override protected void initialize() { super.initialize(); } @FXML protected void handleManagerButton(ActionEvent event) { } @FXML @Override protected void handleDifferentActionButton(ActionEvent event) { } }\nAs you can see, logic is cleared and you do not have to constantly hide and show controls. You can concentrate on implementing business logic because you will not have to constantly check the role of the user. This is done once when logging in.\npublic class Controller { private static final String WORKER = \"/sample/worker_homescreen.fxml\"; private static final String MANAGER = \"/sample/manager_homescreen.fxml\"; @FXML private void handleLoginButton() { ... if (!resultSet.next()) { infoBox(\"Enter Correct Username and Password\", \"Failed\", null); } else { if (\"Employee\".equals(function)) { infoBox(\"Login Successfull\", \"Success\", null); showMainView(getClass().getResource(WORKER)); } else if (\"Manager\".equals(function)) { infoBox(\"Login Successfull\", \"Success\", null); showMainView(getClass().getResource(MANAGER)); } } } private void showMainView(URL url) { try { Parent parent = FXMLLoader.load(url); Stage stage = new Stage(); stage.setScene(new Scene(parent, 800, 600)); stage.show(); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }\nThe best thing about this approach is that you can easily add roles without affecting

art of singing Martin Cullingford Thu 7th December 2017 Gramophone's Editor introduces the December issue \n\u2018Celebrating the voice!\u2019 Those are the words emblazoned on our cover this month, and throughout the magazine we\u2019ve done exactly that: explored and celebrated singing, in all its extraordinary diversity. \nLet\u2019s begin with Erato\u2019s set of Berlioz\u2019s Les Troyens , our Recording of the Month and the subject of a fascinating feature by Editor-in-Chief James Jolly. It draws on some of today\u2019s finest singers, and the interpretative insight of a conductor, John Nelson, for whom exploring Berlioz has been a career-long quest. It also intriguingly \u2013 and fairly uniquely \u2013 bridges that oft-discussed divide between studio and live recording, drawing on the best of both. Though taken from concert performances, it was conceived first and foremost as recording sessions in front of an audience. It\u2019s an approach other labels might consider when juggling such matters as interpretative excellence, the frisson of live performance, and budgets. Either way, as a celebration of both the voice and the art of recording, it\u2019s a formidable achievement. \nThen we\u2019re perhaps on more familiar ground for our Christmas issue \u2013 choral music. The Reformation\u2019s impact on religion was seismic. Its long-term part in shaping the development of music was also profound, and the nature of what so many of us sing today can still find its roots in those events of half a century ago. Then from marking five centuries to five decades, and the King\u2019s Singers. Their distinctive sound \u2013 from polyphony to pop \u2013 has remained as impeccably excellent as ever through the many line-up changes, as has their commitment to reaching audiences throughout the world in a manner which is open and engaging. It\u2019s hard to think of many groups that better embody the desire to celebrate singing; a whole-hearted Happy Birthday to them from all at Gramophone. Finally, still in the choral world, our festive season brings our annual round-up of releases from the choirs, cathedrals and colleges who tap into the powerful resonance Christmas has for composers, congregations and audiences alike. \nAll the above features were planned. What emerged with delightful serendipity was that, when considering this month\u2019s Editor\u2019s Choice list, there was an extraordinary strength among vocal releases. Settling on the Editor\u2019s Choices usually involves balancing a desire for variety of repertoire with offering a true representation of which releases simply stand out. And after discussion this month, it felt only right \u2013 and, as it turned out, highly appropriate \u2013 to lean towards the latter consideration. Thus, of the 12 Editor\u2019s Choices (including Reissue and DVD of the month), 10 involve singing. But what rich achievements \u2013 and what breadth of repertoire! Majestic medievalism from the Sollazzo Ensemble, or fin de si\u00e8cle French songs from Sabine Devieihle and Marianne Crebassa don\u2019t perhaps have a lot in common. Except, of course, for the obvious link. The voice. Diversity then, but a single compelling constant: the remarkably direct communication between an artist and an audience, achieved through that most fundamental and basic aspect of music-making, singing. Happy listening \u2013 and a very happy Christmas to you all. Martin Cullingford is the Editor and Publisher of Gramophone.

The Challenger 300 aircraft series have garnered more deliveries than any other business jet platform in the last decade, and the Challenger 600 series aircraft is the best-selling business jet of all time in the large category.\n\u201cAchieving these significant delivery milestones is a testament to the unrivalled capabilities of our newest Challenger aircraft,\u201d said Peter Likoray, Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing, Bombardier Business Aircraft. \u201cNo competitor comes close to the comfort and connectivity of the Challenger aircraft\u2019s cabin, or to their class-leading economics and dependable performance in operation. They simply deliver it all. It\u2019s no surprise these aircraft are highly favoured by experienced flight departments and individuals around the world.\u201d\nChallenger 650 aircraft feature an advanced wing design that minimizes the effect of turbulence, resulting in a smoother ride from takeoff to landing. An unparalled smooth ride elevates the aircraft\u2019s unmatched connectivity and cabin comfort to the next level.\nChallenger series aircraft feature the latest in internet technology. The Challenger 350 aircraft offer the fastest and most reliable air-to-ground internet coverage over North America available for business aircraft with high-speed 4G internet service technology. With a true 4,000 NM (7,408 km) range capability, the Challenger 650 aircraft offers the revolutionary Ka-band high-speed internet system, the industry\u2019s fastest in-flight Wi-Fi connectivity with worldwide coverage*. Bombardier is the first and only OEM to offer the Ka-band system for business aircraft in the medium category.\nThe Challenger aircraft continue to define their categories with more than 650 deliveries for the Challenger 300 series and close to 1,100 deliveries for the Challenger 600 series. Challenger aircraft have the lowest direct operating cost in their respective categories due to affordable maintenance programs and longer maintenance intervals than the competition. Bombardier\u2019s new Smart Services offering, the most competitive cost-per-flight hour coverage, brings budget predictability to a whole new level with enhanced adaptability and greater customization. Enrollment is open to existing Bombardier customers and \u00e0-la-carte coverage now includes landing gear overhaul and unscheduled maintenance.\nSource:- Bombardier\nTags: Bombardier , Global Travel News , Railway News", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bombardier business aircraft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bombardier", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:39.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5368a31eadd00a12b707ed15700bc5a1859b6b25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/FYJ2xGwtw8Gwvmb6eh1ZEIFzQ2so_plCLypR_c1PUE60kE7kxmYqCWscG0t4n8I.VRs4hPBvZ7Pnn2zcClFjIPcXjzlPReh3LcZs5hbmqgmBckweLk7n_ZFff5E3N896", "site_full": "yourhealthbxvoice.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://yourhealthbxvoice.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Your Health Voice", "title": "Chronic wasting disease found in deer near Chester", "title_full": "Chronic wasting disease found in deer near Chester", "published": "2017-12-06T21:43:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/58uhjmuKYVTLtmj--JtvQil4V5LOTX7dUGXXN30R53yMDK0na9XmpEw=w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5368a31eadd00a12b707ed15700bc5a1859b6b25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/FYJ2xGwtw8Gwvmb6eh1ZEIFzQ2so_plCLypR_c1PUE60kE7kxmYqCWscG0t4n8I.VRs4hPBvZ7Pnn2zcClFjIPcXjzlPReh3LcZs5hbmqgmBckweLk7n_ZFff5E3N896", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "noreply@blogger.com (Bronx Voice)", "published": "2017-12-06T21:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "Chronic wasting disease found in deer near Chester", "text": "How to hunt a Fox;

On Friday, he travels to northeastern Greece to meet with members of the country's Muslim minority.\nSecurity was tight in the Greek capital, with roads shut down and demonstrations banned in the center of Athens.\nLATEST SFGATE VIDEOS Now Playing: Now Playing Behind the scenes: \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" sfgate Star Wars: The Last Jedi (official trailer) sfgate Muni bus and streetcar collide sfgate Time lapse of Bay Area traffic sfgate Mountain lion and kitten spotted for first time since fire sfgate Santa Rosa firefighters headed south to fight LA blaze sfgate The best views in Russian Hill sfgate Ventura resident shows view of massive fire sfgate Oakland city workers go on strike sfgate Smoke from Creek Fire smothers Lake View Terrace in Los Angeles sfgate On the eve of his arrival, Erdogan alarmed Greek officials by saying in an interview with Greece's Skai television that the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, which determined current Greek-Turkish borders among other issues, should be \"updated.\"\n\"In fact, all agreements (pacts) in the world should be updated with the passage of time,\" Erdogan said in the interview. \"Lausanne too, in the face of all these developments, is in need of an update. This update would be beneficial not only for Turkey but also for Greece.\"\nErdogan has made similar comments in the past about the peace treaty, which set the borders of modern Turkey, but his repetition on the day before his arrival in Athens came as an unwelcome surprise to his hosts.\nHis comments \"raises serious concerns and questions,\" Greek government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said in a statement.\n\"The Greek government and the prime minister want his visit to be a reason to build bridges, not to raise walls.\"\nTzanakopoulos said respecting the treaty is \"the exclusive and non-negotiable foundation on which the honest cooperation of the two countries can be built.\"\n\"Comments regarding its revision do not contribute to the climate we are trying to build in our relations and in the region,\" he said.\nThe refugee crisis will be high on the agenda of talks with Erdogan, as Greek islands have been the gateway into Europe for migrants crossing from the Turkish coast. Regional relations, energy and business ties, Turkey's stalled bid to join the European Union and longstanding disputes such as Turkey's territorial claims in the Greek Aegean will also be discussed.\nOne of the current thorny issues to be raised will be the case of eight Turkish servicemen who have requested asylum in Greece following last year's failed coup in Turkey. Ankara has demanded their extradition, a request rejected by Greek courts on the grounds they could not be guaranteed a fair trial in Turkey.\nThe move infuriated Erdogan, who said in his Wednesday interview that his country's judicial system is \"the best in Europe.\" He said Tsipras had promised to return the servicemen in \"15 to 20 days\" after they flew to Greece in a military helicopter.\n\"That is what he said. But unfortunately right now they are still in Greece,\" Erdogan said, adding that the servicemen should have been handed over before Greek courts became involved.\n\"If you leave it up to the judiciary there will be no result,\" he said. \"In order to facilitate the work of the judiciary you must first, as the government, take the necessary measures before you assign it to the judiciary.\"\nErdogan's visit comes as his country finds itself increasingly isolated on the international stage, and his comments will be closely watched for signs he might try to improve some of Turkey's international relations, particularly with the EU.\nTurkey's ties with the EU, and with several European countries, deteriorated significantly following Erdogan's post-coup crackdown. Tens of thousands of Turks have been fired from their jobs, and tens of thousands more have been imprisoned on accusations of being linked, however tenuously, with Fethullah Gulen, the U.S.-based Islamic cleric that Erdogan blames for masterminding the coup.\nOther than Greece, Poland is the only other EU country to have invited Erdogan to visit since mid-2016.\nHistorical tensions between Greece and Turkey, which have brought the two countries to the brink of war on three occasions since the 1970s, remain. Decades-old thorny issues include territorial disputes in the Aegean, the Muslim minority in northeastern Greece and the continued occupation by Turkish troops of northern Cyprus.\nTension between Ankara and Washington has also increased recently, particularly over the New York trial of a Turkish banker over alleged transactions with Iran. Earlier in the week, Erdogan described the trial of Mehmet Hakan Atilla as an American conspiracy to blackmail and blemish his country.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/11/14664279/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/qyZLykzv-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/ymIabdMc-720.jpg)", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/11/14664278/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/oT0P81gO-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/Gf0WUwLB-720.jpg)", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/10/14664238/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/r6YuJPz1-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/Y1yGNtl0-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/Kc2ifh3L-720.jpg)", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/11/14664279/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/11/14664280/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/fPX3XJZJ-720.jpg)", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/11/14664280/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/11/14664278/3/920x920.jpg", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/GTtCvdHL-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/5T4LjYVX-720.jpg)", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/10/14664238/5/920x920.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:40.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f0d0445e69a5abeb038b5d0d206f0f0b795baa73", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7isP1zfmxVBDnZM0Iju6gLg1F57ngLIShSv6qBlu28QnbYCLSs47JAqxDniL2bKFtDoInCsrykphQSGKtMxr2Kd9f6X0shCVp5XzEZIaNradcHlseY232_1_cM5857rhDLYn9b__4wyA--", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/more-sports/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "More Sports Board | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "12th Annual CSAA (Formerly CSAL) 8th Grade Basketball Preseason Rankings | Page 3", "title_full": "12th Annual CSAA (Formerly CSAL) 8th Grade Basketball Preseason Rankings | Page 3 | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T05:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eecd30c852e1027cc9666569fa3a248d349a5681", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7isP1zfmxVBDnZM0Iju6gLg1F57ngLIShSv6qBlu28QnbYCLSs47JAqxDniL2bKFtDoInCsrykphQSGKtMxr2Kd9f6X0shCVp5XzEZIaNradcHlseY232_1_cM5857rhD3LmK7ngfJfqh6u5bvvC5.", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "rockchlkjayhku11", "published": "2017-12-07T05:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: :\nI have inside info that a 5th ranking for St. George is actually too high.\ni will bet you 100 tigerdroppings bucks. dragons out of the top 5?

The school doesn't have electricity, so it lets out at 12:30 p.m.\nRyan Caron King/WNPR The Puerto Rican effort to advance from response to recovery after Hurricane Maria continues. For some, water and electricity are still elusive. And that makes it hard to get back to normal \u2014 especially for children.\nEducation Interviews At The Airport: Teachers From Puerto Rico Find New Schools In Orlando An after-school program is designed to pick up when school lets out. The program \u2013 which has no formal name \u2013 is organized by volunteers and the nonprofit Save the Children. In a territory still lacking basic utilities in some places, Facebook access and YouTube videos are a lower priority. But kids need something to do.\nSchool started again in mid-November in the mountain town of Orocovis \u2013 two months after Maria passed. Even now the school building doesn't have electricity, so the day ends at 12:30 p.m. \nBut one day last week, 51 children stayed behind for more. Before splitting up for activities, they began with songs that got them moving \u2014 practicing their lefts and rights, and smiling. Parents say the after-school opportunity is a safe place for them to send their children. It gives adults time to work and to try and deal with the daily stress of living without basic services. That stress affects the kids, too.\nWanda Medina, a science teacher in Orocovis, said she decided to use the situation as a teachable moment in her classroom. She posed a question to her students: \"Nature has been affected, and human beings have been affected. Which [will] replenish more quickly?\"\nAll of them said nature. The children spoke from their own observations. They told her that trees have already grown new leaves. Their families and friends, however, lost things they can't get back, like valuables their parents gave them. Three of Medina's students lost their entire home.\nParent and volunteer Giovanni Caballero Fuentes was luckier. His family didn't lose their house, but his kids watched the storm rip off their neighbor's roof. He said he's hoping they soon forget the sound of the wind and rain, and learn to deal with life without electricity, without water, and without technology.\n\"Back to basic,\" Caballero Fuentes said.\nHe and his kids play board games at home, and they look for other ways to distract themselves. Still, his 10-year-old daughter Nadjah said she is happy to be in the after-school program.\n\"Because it is very fun,\" she said.\nEnlarge this image Children do crafts during the after-school program.

Santiago said his grandson often stays with him because his daughter works two jobs. He's a retired elementary school teacher, and he knows how important routine is for kids.\n\"It's a little bit difficult, you know, [to] have normality,\" Santiago said. \"We don't go to the movies, we don't go to the places where before we can go. But before was great. But now it's very difficult.\"\nThe Salt Puerto Rico's Hurricane Recovery Hinders Farm Businesses' Seed Research Eugenio Soto Santiago teaches during the day and leads some of the after-school activities. He said many of his students thought that their island would never be the same after Hurricane Maria. However, small bits of regular life are coming back into view.\n\"Even though we don't have electricity, and sometimes we don't have water, they're turning back to that ... this is our new normal,\" Soto Santiago said. \"And they're able to handle it.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "maria", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jeff cohen/wnpr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hurricane maria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wanda medina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giovanni caballero fuentes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff cohen/wnpr  luis santiago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janiel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eugenio soto santiago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santiago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "soto santiago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caballero fuentes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nadjah", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "npr", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "orocovis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santiago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orlando", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:40.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3dbcbc0d6c4976aebf23b04387069487dd6d2588", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog63_RxOXa1nosG2y.4JTtxtLVxsV5uvGvc3QpDqYyQTJzZS9OHiULZEeXEO8m8DnkQSx92DUIr8vlQTvCyCUiNgioQ3jdpn_sReNnLAhah44H", "site_full": "community.vodafone.co.nz", "site": "vodafone.co.nz", "site_section": "http://community.vodafone.co.nz/t5/Mobile-plans-services/bd-p/b3/page/150", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Mobile plans and services | Vodafone NZ Community", "title": "Solved: Replacement SIM card 134315", "title_full": "Solved: Replacement SIM card - Vodafone New Zealand Community - 134315", "published": "2017-12-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NZ", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://vodafonenz.i.lithium.com/html/assets/touch-icon-iphone-retina.png?8FF10F3C52D2A30A90B53E0E8EA62C3C", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 38622, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3dbcbc0d6c4976aebf23b04387069487dd6d2588", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog63_RxOXa1nosG2y.4JTtxtLVxsV5uvGvc3QpDqYyQTJzZS9OHiULZEeXEO8m8DnkQSx92DUIr8vlQTvCyCUiNgioQ3jdpn_sReNnLAhah44H", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lukeeysherman", "published": "2017-12-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Solved: Replacement SIM card 134315", "text": "Anyone know how much micro sim cards cost ?

Snow is somewhat easier to walk in then pelting cold rain . Snow drifts down from the sky above and gently as its momentum is lost, settles on the ground to gently paint the ground white. Yes, if the flake of snow hits your face it is cold but only fleeting.\nThe cold rain seems to almost wash the warmth out of your body. Every inch, every drop seeming to carry cold and shivers with it. Ah, the rain drives us indoors. Drives us to that fireplace that forces us to wrestle with Labradors, who also fear that cold rain. Wait, aren\u2019t they water dogs? Waterproof in some twist of natures fate. But they wish not to have the cold rain make them uncomfortable? Instead, they wish always to curl in their dog resting places pushed by the fireplace?\n\nI moved them, the dogs resting places once, further away from the fire. Dylan dragged his back. I pushed Raven\u2019s back so she would stop bugging me as I tried to watch football. I gave up control of dog bed locations. Now there are two, in front of the fireplace. One for each dog.

(PRWEB) December 07, 2017 \nQuality Bearings & Components, a distributor of the world\u2019s leading bearing manufacturers and bearing maintenance equipment introduces the \u201cBETEX Cone Heater\u201d. The BETEX Cone Heater is used to heat bearings and other drive components, developed specifically for the smaller workshop; it is an affordable alternative to larger induction heaters. \n\u201cWhen mounting bearings, gears, and other drive components it is extremely important to use the proper method to ensure ease of assembly, limit damage, and maximize component life cycle. The use of heat and shrink fitting is a safe alternative to open flame heating and oil baths,\u201d says Kathy Lantier, Product Manager. The BETEX Cone Heater\u2019s lightweight aluminum body ensures fast, even heating and the unique cone shape can accommodate multiple components in diameters of 10 mm to 203 mm simultaneously. The electric heater is offered in two models by Quality Bearings & Components, model CHC with thermostat, will maintain a set temperature, freeing up the user to perform other operations while components are heating. \nThe BETEX Cone Heater is a cost-effective tool that improves the quality of assembly, is safe to use, and increases machine uptime.

AP Photo / Alex Brandon President Donald Trump's announcement of plans to move the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem has inflamed regional leaders and drawn threats of violence against the US and Israel, but in practical terms it changes little. Both US political parties have long promised to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and Palestinian-aligned regional forces have long threatened violence against the US and Israel. Trump's announcement allows him to tick the box on another campaign promise with no input from Congress and only at the cost of antagonizing the Muslim world, which he seems OK with. \nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday stirred the pot across the Muslim world by announcing that the US would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel . \nSome regional leaders didn't even wait for the announcement to become official before predicting a violent response. \n\"He is declaring war in the Middle East, he is declaring war against 1.5 billion Muslims (and) hundreds of millions of Christians that are not going to accept the holy shrines to be totally under the hegemony of Israel,\" Manuel Hassassian, the Palestinian general delegate to the UK, told the BBC on Wednesday. \nTurkey's deputy prime minister said the move \" will be a major catastrophe .\" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the move a \"red line\" for Muslims. \nThe militant Palestinian Sunni Muslim group Hamas used the occasion to call for another intifada, or uprising, against Israel. \nAn Iranian-backed militia operating in Iraq said the move would give some \"legitimate reason to target American forces.\" In response, US embassies across the Middle East braced for violence . Trump's announcement 'will change nothing on the ground' \nAn ultra-Orthodox Jewish man holding a shofar, or ram's horn, in front of the golden Dome of the Rock, the Islamic shrine, on Wednesday in Jerusalem. Lior Mizrahi/Getty Images \nDespite the fury it provoked, \"the Trump announcement will change nothing on the ground itself,\" Michael Koplow, the policy director at the Israel Policy Forum, an advocacy group supporting a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, wrote at the Jewish Telegraph Agency . \nIsrael considers Jerusalem its capital. The policy platforms of successive Democratic candidates have considered Jerusalem to be Israel's capital, and the US Congress passed legislation recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital back in 1995 (the legislation allowed the president to postpone the official recognition, something all subsequent presidents had done until this week). \nYet Hamas frequently calls for intifadas. Iranian-backed forces have several times attacked or imperiled US forces operating in the Middle East . Turkey and Israel last year normalized relations after six years of difficult silence . \nAbsent from Trump's speech was a timetable for moving the US Embassy. \n\"As a practical matter, no embassy is constructed today anywhere in the world in shorter than three or four years \u2014 no embassy,\" a Trump administration official told the Washington Examiner . \nThe US will probably first study sites and evaluate security concerns before then beginning a lengthy construction process that is likely to stretch past Trump's current term in office. \nAs far as endangering the already dubious Palestinian-Israeli peace process, Trump on Wednesday sought to convey that the US took no position on how Jerusalem should ultimately be divided in a two-state solution. What actually happens now \nPalestinian members of al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of the Hamas movement, taking part in a military parade in Gaza City in 2014 marking the 27th anniversary of Hamas' founding. REUTERS/Suhaib Salem \nBesides inflaming an already inflamed Middle East, Trump's announcement makes a few material changes. \nAs Koplow points out, it will irk the US's Sunni Arab allies who support the Palestinians and don't want to be seen as siding with the US and Israel. \nDomestically, the move allows Trump to tick the box on another campaign promise unilaterally. \n\"Some say [past presidents] lacked courage, but they made their best judgments based on facts as they understood them at the time,\" Trump said during the announcement. \nIsrael is pleased by the decision. The Palestinian Authority protests it. Fundamentalist groups have called for violence against Israel and the US. Trump's secretaries of state and of defense cautioned against the move out of security concerns , but Trump is the executive. \nPolitically at home, Trump has executed on a promise and again demonstrated that for his administration, antagonizing the Muslim world is an acceptable price to pay.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "alex brandon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lior", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael koplow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koplow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdo\u011fan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manuel hassassian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al-qassam brigades", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "white house", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jewish telegraph agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel policy forum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington examiner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestinian authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defense", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:42.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9fcba05f248f8213ae6c233adb445bcf9c1f9634", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsOZfoRKnBiGldH2uUXBWA9RE5zfmXS8KS.uJ_NS1W7CP.iMy4PmNcFUlkjhB9wltbt.8WjKw0wR5nzPU6BP5Jc", "site_full": "mainearts.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://mainearts.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Maine Arts Opportunities", "title": "Music Exchange Program", "title_full": "Music Exchange Program", "published": "2017-12-07T12:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9fcba05f248f8213ae6c233adb445bcf9c1f9634", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsOZfoRKnBiGldH2uUXBWA9RE5zfmXS8KS.uJ_NS1W7CP.iMy4PmNcFUlkjhB9wltbt.8WjKw0wR5nzPU6BP5Jc", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kgilg (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "Music Exchange Program", "text": "American Music Abroad Invites Applications for International Exchange Program  \nDeadline 01-21-2018  \n\nAmerican Music Abroad, a partnership between American Voices and the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, is an international exchange program designed to communicate America's rich musical heritage and diverse culture to audiences around the world.\n\nEach year, approximately ten ensembles are selected to conduct regional cultural exchange tours in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, Central and South America, and the Middle East. As part of their activities, selected ensembles are expected to perform high-profile public concerts, engage in collaborations with local musicians, lead jam sessions, make themselves available to local media, and offer educational activities such as workshops, business training for aspiring musicians, and programs for underserved youth.\n\nThe program plan also should include opportunities for ensemble members to engage post-tour in the creation of online tutorials and share their expertise through Skype chats and Internet radio broadcasts.\n\nPrior to its respective tour, each ensemble will participate in the American Music Abroad@Home program in Washington, D.C., which includes a concert or education program in a local school or community center and an orientation at the State Department. All events nationally and internationally may be recorded, posted on social media, and broadcast non-commercially.\n\nAMA tours operate under the official auspices of the U.S. government. The State Department funds international travel, hotels, and an allowance for meals and incidental expenses. In addition, a tour honorarium of $200 per day is awarded to each individual musician.

Unless you know everything about everyone, you couldn't assess the probabilities and even if you had a super database capable of storing all the relevant information, it would be out of date by the time you got in all the data.\nBest chance would be to try for an experimental result. ie. You collect lots of actual employment records and assess the probability from that. I don't think it would lead to consistent results if you repeated the collection with new (random) data.\nBob", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:43.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b288bbcaebc5a700af74f9e9c40762455898b593", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAiukyO974C2ZTHN7wGrwHTEE-", "site_full": "groups.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://groups.google.com/a/googleproductforums.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=categories/gmail/computer-email-program-please-specify-apple-mail-outlook-thunderbird-etc", "site_categories": ["business"], "section_title": "Gmail Help Forum - Google Product Forums", "title": "Send emails to a large private homeowner group", "title_full": "Send emails to a large private homeowner group - Google Product Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.google.com/images/icons/product/groups-128.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb952a7731196060cc5ab64e84388bb09c651155", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAiukyO974C2ZTZDAWxkgRsPNKTY.EFfsIpw--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "catzrule", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Try MailChimp.\nGmail is not a mass emailing service.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:43.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b288bbcaebc5a700af74f9e9c40762455898b593", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAiukyO974C2ZTHN7wGrwHTEE-", "site_full": "groups.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://groups.google.com/a/googleproductforums.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=categories/gmail/computer-email-program-please-specify-apple-mail-outlook-thunderbird-etc", "site_categories": ["business"], "section_title": "Gmail Help Forum - Google Product Forums", "title": "Send emails to a large private homeowner group", "title_full": "Send emails to a large private homeowner group - Google Product Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.google.com/images/icons/product/groups-128.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b288bbcaebc5a700af74f9e9c40762455898b593", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAiukyO974C2ZTHN7wGrwHTEE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Donncha", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Send emails to a large private homeowner group", "text": "I'm managing a self-hosted website for a group of homeowners.
