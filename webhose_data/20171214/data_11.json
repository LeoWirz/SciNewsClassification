I have loved seeing all your comments on my most recent post on My Teens Camp Experience . Many of you wanted to see me do a post on my pets so here it is. I have 3 pets at the moment, but overall my family has owned over 25 pets. The pets we have now are 2 guinea pigs and 1 dog. So let\u2019s get into it!\nZootie \nZootie is our pet dog. We think he is 9 years old though we are not too sure. His name is Zootie because my brother is a professional rower and we got Zooties when we left home to go to university in America. Zooties are what rowers call the piece of clothing they wear and that is where we got the name from. I\u2019m sorry if that was confusing, I don\u2019t think I explained it very well. Anyway, we have had Zootie for almost 8 years.\nZootie loves running around in our backyard and barking at all our neighbours, thanks Zootie, haha. He loves schmackos, a dog treat which we have in Australia. He also loves to be around us and is very protective over us as he barks at anyone who enters the house.\nAlfie \nAlfie is my pet guinea pig. He is black and has a bit of an afro but he is really cute. I chose his name to be Alfie I think because it just came to me. He is 2 years old and I love him very much. Alfie loves to play on the grass and really loves food as well. He is really cute and loves to be held sometimes just not all the time.\nHarold \nHarold is my sister\u2019s guinea pig. He is orange and white. I\u2019m not too sure why she chose to name him Harold but it definitely suits him. Harold is quite a timid but he loves to run out of his cage when he is not supposed to and go on little adventures which end up with him being very scared. Harold loves food as well and is also 2 as they were born on the same day.\nI am sorry that this post is very short. I have an exciting one for you tomorrow. I would love it if you could go out and check my friend Laila\u2019s new blog. She is new to blogging and is getting the hang of it.\nCya \nHannah xx\nFor with God nothing shall be impossible \u2013 Luke 1:37 \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alfie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zootie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luke 1:37", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harold  harold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laila", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cya  hannah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alfie  alfie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zootie  zootie", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "zooties", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:50.059+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d94ee72ecd173e6f8e6f4a8e76b2aef112acb27c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3KW4S8B2kR55hUe_gNOMsp6mRgIHMfIApAZoqfRBj.24RrTY1Br.umEN8QRre38cKdvbws07DPJxQ--", "site_full": "eroticalee1.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://eroticalee1.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "cj gordon ~  photography", "title": "bum thursday", "title_full": "bum thursday", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d94ee72ecd173e6f8e6f4a8e76b2aef112acb27c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3KW4S8B2kR55hUe_gNOMsp6mRgIHMfIApAZoqfRBj.24RrTY1Br.umEN8QRre38cKdvbws07DPJxQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cj gordon ~ photography (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "bum thursday", "text": "", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:50.064+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "81007b90839a56fa98b39bd925279fb88d56871e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9D2Qkpp6vWSMwMM8NxS2qQ4nMVF4sMvv9Bob7v5bEBIjPxVeQLC_96W7YzADB0B_MElkBj8pFzd19LRvPFy96c.acpf3IPqxNNZAWLwuc73frAvi0EMOb1", "site_full": "www.lse.co.uk", "site": "lse.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.lse.co.uk/share-chat.asp?page=167", "site_categories": ["united_kingdom", "travel", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Share Chat on London South East.

How would it have been to visit Yellowstone before it was a wildlife reserve; the Grand Canyon when it was more of an obstacle than a wonder of the world; Yosemite when you had it to yourself? \nFortunately, a cadre of pioneer photographers took their cumbersome equipment to record images from that time. Their fragile glass plates, poisonous chemicals, and heavy gear were transported by pack animals, and black-and-white exposures were often counted in minutes, not fractions of a second. Today things are a bit easier. \nSo, it was with great interest that I received a copy of the new Paul Horsted book: Treasures of the National Parks: Yesterday & Today . Horsted has produced similar books on the Black Hills and Yellowstone, but this book is a trip back in time to 24 of our premiere national parks, with modern day images taken from the exact spot historic images were produced so long ago. \nThis is a fascinating large format full-color comparison of then and now. Over the space of five years, Horsted hiked more than 200 miles to find the exact vantages of the historic photographs. Designer Camille Riner\u2019s design mimics the cardboard stereoscopic photo mounts of the past, with old and new photographs side by side. It\u2019s a beautiful book. \nThe author writes, \u201cWhen I look at historic landscape images of our National parks, I hope to find that exact spot where someone placed their camera 100 years ago, and see what\u2019s there now. I want to see what has changed and what remains from the past.\u201d \nSome are iconic views, such as the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, and Yosemite\u2019s Glacier Point. There are comparisons from well-known viewpoints, now and then, such as the view of the eruption of Old Faithful and the Old Faithful Inn or Sequoias famous tunnel Tree, in 1938 and present day. \nOther vantages are not quite as well known, like the comparison of California\u2019s Mount Lassen during its 1915 eruption and what it looks like today, and Charlie\u2019s Bunion in Great Smoky Mountains in Tennesee. \nOne thing that is obvious in many of these comparisons is that while rocks and mountains and cliffs are sometimes only slightly different, it's easier to see changes in the vegetation, with more trees and shrubs visible in modern times, perhaps due to the suppression of wildfires. Sometimes timber blocks the original view, like the view from Yosemite\u2019s Inspiration Point. \nHorsted also writes about the subject, the conditions present when the original photograph was taken, and how he was able to find the original location and recreate the view. Some of these included quite arduous hikes, and definitely off the beaten path, such as his view of Granite Gorge from Pyrites Point in the Grand Canyon. \n\u201cI finally located this photo site about half a mile to the west of Plateau Point (as the condor flies, or about a mile and a half on foot), above a hair-raising drop at the edge of the Granite Gorge\u2026.The hike down a side canyon to reach this point was also quite extreme,\" he writes. \nThere are 170 views in 240 pages. It\u2019s produced by Golden Valley Press, and retails at $45. It\u2019d make a great gift for a national park or history fan, or a gift to yourself for your own shelf.

And, in the Boo arc, unlike Piccolo, Vegeta never redeemed himself enough until that point to earn the privilege of keeping his body after death (well, if it wasn't for Enma's contingency plan against Majin Boo), and it wasn't that long prior that he killed a bunch of people at the tournament just to provoke Goku into fighting him.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:53.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8d1319cb3ce85998e129b6703d3c88ab4c1ef651", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSTJuiA8BF.qVS6i15rYExzM33RhWB1cDGql17xJ6RavVD2fkujelkknWoKLUZ0HE5QlFjefMNwKyDTVPm.2v3XuTKIOGpWBMd0PtnQkusBkyNZgHGcoAntQ--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dbz/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Dragon World", "title": "Does Tien have some sort of grudge against Vegeta still?", "title_full": "Does Tien have some sort of grudge against Vegeta still? : dbz", "published": "2017-12-07T07:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 31, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ae1857a4d0a7e6e4fb37b9cf106ce3e264ee4468", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSTJuiA8BF.qVS6i15rYExzM33RhWB1cDGql17xJ6RavVD2fkujelkknWoKLUZ0HE5QlFjefMNwKyDTVPm.2v3XuTKIOGpWBMd0PtnQkusBkwWGZT5iGXNCgFntEOrPqeeRtkMz0bdawE-", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "DoraMuda", "published": "2017-12-07T10:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "It was also anime-only filler.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:53.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8d1319cb3ce85998e129b6703d3c88ab4c1ef651", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSTJuiA8BF.qVS6i15rYExzM33RhWB1cDGql17xJ6RavVD2fkujelkknWoKLUZ0HE5QlFjefMNwKyDTVPm.2v3XuTKIOGpWBMd0PtnQkusBkyNZgHGcoAntQ--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dbz/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Dragon World", "title": "Does Tien have some sort of grudge against Vegeta still?", "title_full": "Does Tien have some sort of grudge against Vegeta still? : dbz", "published": "2017-12-07T07:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 31, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "817968c86d0e4dbcfd676008f12cdd9ef03bd1c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSTJuiA8BF.qVS6i15rYExzM33RhWB1cDGql17xJ6RavVD2fkujelkknWoKLUZ0HE5QlFjefMNwKyDTVPm.2v3XuTKIOGpWBMd0PtnQkusBkwWGZT5iGXNCsS4COGbDq7JNka7DW0xRps-", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "DoraMuda", "published": "2017-12-07T10:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Launch? forget she exists.\nHeh.

Also Read Principals, deputies now required to hold a Masters degree, TSC \nFor the first time at a UN Environment Assembly, environment ministers issued a declaration . This declaration said nations would honour efforts to prevent, mitigate and manage the pollution of air, land and soil, freshwater, and oceans, which harms our health, societies, ecosystems, economies, and security. \nThe declaration committed to increasing research and development, targeting pollution through tailored actions, moving societies towards sustainable lifestyles based on a circular economy, promoting fiscal incentives to move markets and promote positive change, strengthening and enforcing laws on pollution, and much more. \nThe assembly also passed 13 non-binding resolutions and three decisions. \nAmong them were moves to address marine litter and microplastics, prevent and reduce air pollution, cut out lead poisoning from paint and batteries, protect water-based ecosystems from pollution, deal with soil pollution, and manage pollution in areas hit by conflict and terrorism. \n\u201cToday we have put the fight against pollution high on the global political agenda,\u201d said Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment. \u201cWe have a long struggle ahead of us, but the summit showed there is a real appetite for significant positive change.\u201d Also Read Form One selection exercise to be launched Monday \nA large part of the impact from the assembly comes from global support. UN Environment\u2019s #BeatPollution campaign hit almost 2.5 million pledges during the event, with 88,000 personal commitments to act. \nChile, Oman, South Africa and Sri Lanka all joined the #CleanSeas campaign during the Nairobi summit, with Sri Lanka promising to implement a ban on single-use plastic products from 1 January 2018, step up the separation and recycling of waste, and set the goal of freeing its ocean and coasts of pollution by 2030. There are now 39 countries in the campaign. \nColombia, Singapore, Bulgaria, Hungary and Mongolia joined 100 cities that were already in the #BreatheLife campaign, which aims to tackle air pollution. \nEvery signatory has committed to reduce air pollution to safe levels by 2030, with Singapore promising to tighten fuel and emissions standards for vehicles, and emissions standards for industry.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "edgar guti\u00e9rrez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erik solheim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "un environment assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un environment", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "colombia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "runda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mongolia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nairobi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hungary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sri lanka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bulgaria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "costa rica", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:55.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e2328782922dbe727da5f2901cc61f9743a755c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pfguUTHYhAEG0HOSllNMFzEjag5GC6.wU", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/sci/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/sci/ - Science &amp; Math - 4chan", "title": ">Dragon 2 >CST-100 >Orion Which will be the first", "title_full": "/sci/ - >Dragon 2 >CST-100 >Orion Which will be the first - Science & Math - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-06T13:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5d5e6c806b4838b9c8193fe22039e0b1cd3b73db", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pfguUTHYhAEG0HOSllNMFzIokjAe_IqtEyOAkPVQw1I0-", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T05:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>9346967\nYou can thank LBJ and Vietnam for that.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:55.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0f733d38369027f5df24c0db0cfc546bf03c72d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQzIJtOfwb04nZA7Ou6QRl_PAQv.sKl2tVNWgLoEtMGZQ8Cavvw5UIr3Xc8_yYuFJWR6xoj6JAUSiNhP7757HOYEJL2y76TmlZaZLskA1TnKRyAy6LVfymApHuXOeCU.XkZ5Tv2IYbVq8eo4szNXXJJuhEFU32byBpKBaHuDftfU6wBksBPWrNz", "site_full": "forum.crossout.net", "site": "crossout.net", "site_section": "https://forum.crossout.net/index.php?/forum/104-xbox-discussion/", "site_categories": ["science", "space_astronomy"], "section_title": "[XBOX] Discussion - Crossout - Official Forum", "title": "Not a single moderator or any of the team have responded about the uproar of the new update!", "title_full": "Not a single moderator or any of the team have responded about the uproar of the new update!

Fortunately, he's a good kid and always asking questions---we'll learn him a few things!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:55.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e2328782922dbe727da5f2901cc61f9743a755c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pfguUTHYhAEG0HOSllNMFzEjag5GC6.wU", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/sci/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/sci/ - Science &amp; Math - 4chan", "title": ">Dragon 2 >CST-100 >Orion Which will be the first", "title_full": "/sci/ - >Dragon 2 >CST-100 >Orion Which will be the first - Science & Math - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-06T13:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "335ded1221343ced2302223237af6a0aa8f78385", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pfguUTHYhAEG0HOSllNMFzPvAvGffNujZv3Fe3Ms_ZMU-", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T12:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>9346547\nit sucks that we are having to wait forever to get new manned spacecraft, but with 3+ vehicles currently being built and several more planned it might be worth the wait.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:55.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5a8ae77343573a759d610a9fc9620072a6ba0070", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRzlB.3lY..GwbCvKuuYhLJ8KiWEZqEPPqzLGCuo2iC5jzVkpQAfzT1KYOmsuU5lM8-", "site_full": "forums.overclockers.co.uk", "site": "overclockers.co.uk", "site_section": "http://forums.overclockers.co.uk/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Overclockers UK Forums", "title": "Pixel 2 | Page 130", "title_full": "Pixel 2 | Page 130 | Overclockers UK Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T04:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 18, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forums.overclockers.co.uk/styles/default/xenforo/avatars/avatar_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13599, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5a8ae77343573a759d610a9fc9620072a6ba0070", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRzlB.3lY..GwbCvKuuYhLJ8KiWEZqEPPqzLGCuo2iC5jzVkpQAfzT1KYOmsuU5lM8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Heinz57", "published": "2017-12-06T04:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "Pixel 2 | Page 130", "text": "Has anyone else had issues with phone calls dropping?

In order to maintain its leadership on this market, Orange Belgium decided last year to invest in new IoT technologies based on international standards. Today Orange announces the availability of Narrow Band-IoT (NB-IoT) and LTE-M technologies, so called \"Mobile IoT\", on the whole Belgian territory, reaching nationwide coverage both indoors and outdoors. The NB-IoT and LTE-M technologies are Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) cellular network layers that will allow millions of everyday objects to be connected to the Internet of Things (IoT). LPWA technologies offer many advantages when connecting objects to the Internet of Things, such as extending the battery life of the connected equipment by up to 10 years thanks to low energy consumption, or drastically reducing the cost of the radio modules inside the devices that need to be connected. Smart furniture, smart parking and asset tracking for instance become possible. \nOrange turns Belgium into a Mobile IoT test lab by launching the first nationwide LPWA cellular network in Belgium Today Orange Belgium announces the nationwide roll-out of Mobile IoT on its network, as committed 1 year ago. \nThe Mobile IoT technologies bring a different approach to LPWA technologies. Apart from the extended battery life and the minimal cost of the radio modules, NB-IoT and LTE-M: also enable full bidirectional communication between the object and the network allowing firmware software updates over the air; have the best possible mobile coverage (up to +20dB compared to 2G/4G coverage), considerably improving signal penetration inside buildings; can rely on a guaranteed connectivity abroad (roaming) on other operators' Mobile IoT networks; And they are the safest solution for IoT connectivity as it operates in licensed spectrum. Moreover, the SIM card offers secure connections thanks to LTE networks' unique capabilities in terms of authenticating and encrypting the data in transit. Gabriel Flichy, Chief Technology Officer of Orange Belgium, explains: \"The choice for Mobile IoT technologies is future-proof as it is fully consistent with the future evolution towards 5G. It will then be possible to connect objects that require very high reliability e.g. for the remote control of critical devices and automation processes. Today we are already using our Mobile IoT network together with the Flemish government for a project with connected bikes in collaboration with our partners Huawei and Sensinxs; IMEC is testing a smart plug project as part of Antwerp's City of Things program and we have teamed up with CommuniThings for smart parking solutions.We invite all application developers, system integrators and early adopters to test the advantages of Orange Mobile IoT network.\" More info on the website business.orange.be/iotstarterskit or via mobileiot@orange.be Overall Mobile IoT will act as the catalyst for companies to establish connections that would not have been viable with existing technologies. Consumers will see a huge variety of new products, services and applications enabled by Mobile IoT.

The fate of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest issues between Israel and the Palestinians. \nEight of the 15 nations who are currently members of the United Nations Security Council have called for the body to hold an urgent meeting on the US decision by the end of the week. Why is this significant? \nTrump\u2019s Wednesday announcement puts the US at odds with the rest of the international community\u2019s view on Jerusalem\u2019s status. \nThe Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, and according to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. \nIsraeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and until now all countries have maintained their embassies in Tel Aviv. \nJerusalem contains sites sacred to the three major monotheistic faiths \u2013 Judaism, Islam and Christianity. \nEast Jerusalem, which includes the Old City, was annexed by Israel after the Six Day War of 1967, but is not internationally recognised as part of Israel. What did Trump say? \nThe US president said he had \u201cjudged this course of action to be in the best interests of the United States of America, and the pursuit of peace between Israel and the Palestinians\u201d. \nHe said he was directing the US state department to begin preparations to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. \nDespite warnings of regional unrest over any such move, the decision fulfils a campaign promise and appeals to Mr Trump\u2019s right-wing base. \n\u201cToday, I am delivering,\u201d the US leader said. \nRecognising Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital was \u201cnothing more or less than a recognition of reality\u201d, he added. \u201cIt is also the right thing to do.\u201d \nThe Republican Jewish Coalition have already thanked the president in a New York Times ad. \nTrump said the US still supported a two-state solution to the longstanding Israeli-Palestinian conflict, if approved by both sides, which would essentially see the creation of an independent Palestinian state living alongside Israel.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "united nations security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judaism", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican jewish coalition", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "old city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states of america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recognising jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:55.048+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5a8ae77343573a759d610a9fc9620072a6ba0070", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRzlB.3lY..GwbCvKuuYhLJ8KiWEZqEPPqzLGCuo2iC5jzVkpQAfzT1KYOmsuU5lM8-", "site_full": "forums.overclockers.co.uk", "site": "overclockers.co.uk", "site_section": "http://forums.overclockers.co.uk/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Overclockers UK Forums", "title": "Pixel 2 | Page 130", "title_full": "Pixel 2 | Page 130 | Overclockers UK Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T04:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 18, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forums.overclockers.co.uk/styles/default/xenforo/avatars/avatar_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13599, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "64a57c698bcaf71808836a4ccf7243d4abcaf2f2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRzlB.3lY..GwbCvKuuYhLJ8KiWEZqEPPqzLGCuo2iC5jzVkpQAfzT1AvW4RIQWtusQAJnvSiPqpQ--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "V_R", "published": "2017-12-06T06:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Heinz57 said: \u2191 Has anyone else had issues with phone calls dropping?

It\u2019s \u00a312 for the 90 minute showcase and it will be the same at the Shelley Theatre.\u201d \nFor the first show Mervyn has lined up comedy musical star Earl Okin who is described as a top notch jazz and Bossa Nova guitarist and singer. \nMervyn adds: \u201cEvery month I will open the show with some fun songs and chat and then we move onto the main act. We have a wide selection for 2018.\u201d \nThe new year line up includes a one man theatre show, Playing Maggie, who takes questions from the audience, TV comedian and madcap adventurer, Tim Fitzhigham, and An Instinct For Kindness, one man\u2019s true story of his journey to Dignitas (and back). \nOther acts include Bournemouth comedy group, JunNk who sing four part harmonies and play dustbins, barrels, drainpipes, and flip-flops, Christine Bovill, sharing her personal stories and all the legendary songs of Edith Piaf. \nBy being an established event at the Fringe and well recognised since the 1990s is there a sense of trepidation by bringing a monthly show to a brand new venue? \u201cVery much so,\u201d stated Mervyn. \u201cIt all comes back to where I began.\u201d \n\u201cI have a black book of contacts who have all been a part of Pick Of The Fringe and made it what it is. I am now asking people to trust me and come to an evening that they enjoy, warm to and come back again.\u201d \n\u201cBut after doing this at the Edinburgh Festival for so many years, I\u2019m excited to bring Pick Of The Fringe to Shelley Theatre for 2018.\u201d \nPick Of The Fringe is once a month at Shelley Theatre, starting 6th January.
