Now you have to understand...I absolutely loved smoking, but got to that stage where I had to leave it as it affected my health. I tried so many things over about a 10 year period but always went back to my love...\nI was always chain vaping , looking for that kick and satisfaction I got from the smokes. The more I vap ed, the more I felt \"one step behind\" my smoking days...!\nI'm rambling now, but you all know what i'm talking about...\nAnyway....I recently got some WTA from Aroma. Loaded up my beloved Derringer and started heating it up...Man I got that tingle in the fingers and that old dizzying feeling again (a wee bit fainter but I felt it).

Lucky Strike, Marlboro, then Marlboro Light. Pack a day. And it was starting to take a toll on my body. Persistent cough. Ashen complexion.\nDecades ago, I tried using Nicorette lozenges to quit. Lasted all of two weeks. I was wired to a high-wire. My friends begged me to start smoking again. And I was happy to comply.\nFast forward to 2007. The coughing fits start. I buy Hall\u2019s cough drops. When I lay down to sleep at night, my lungs fill with fluid, which I spit into a cup on the floor by the bed. I con my doctor into writing a prescription for a sleep aid.\nIt was one of those I-Wasn\u2019t-Looking-But-She-Showed-Up kinds of things. After we\u2019d been dating a few months, I gushed about her to a dear friend. \u201cDo you want to enjoy this relationship as long as possible?\u201d she asked. \u201cOf course\u201d, I said. \u201cThen quit smoking\u201d, she said.\nI loved cigarettes. And I quit cigarettes on January 5, 2012. What did it take? All the motivation any sane man would need: I fell in love with a woman\u2026 then with myself.\nThe ePower 1650 kit arrived. 3.7V, Kanger cartos, and SmokeTech tobacco -flavored e-liquid (24 mg) Despite the incomprehensible instructions, I assembled it. It was a revelation. I got my Nic Fix, and all the familiar rituals (except striking a match) were in place. In the first year, I still bought the occasional pack of Marbs. But since 2013, I've not smoked a single cigarette. My cough disappeared, taste buds activated, and my complexion returned to its usual ruddy glow.\nIn 2016, I upgraded to a ProVari . Then to a Provari 3. Then added the ProVari Mini. I was headed to the Grave, then I took the proper detour.

He has a new career that doesn\u2019t feel like his, and parents who would just love to see him settled down. All he needs is a temporary buffer for the parties he has to attend, and for his parents to leave him alone. Enter, Luke.\nLuke is twenty-thousand dollars short for the renovations on Halligans; his family\u2019s bar in New York\u2019s Financial District. A favor for a buddy has him agreeing to play the part of boyfriend to a guy with more money than sense.\nBut when the spirit of Christmas works its magic on the two men, and they begin to fall for each other, Derek runs scared, and Luke needs space.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what obstacles you throw in the way of love, or how much you run in the other direction, because, when you\u2019re least expecting it, whether you want it or not, love happens anyway. \nExcerpt \nI knew Marcus was six-two, just a little taller than me. I knew he had blue eyes, and dark hair with red tones in certain light. He had a brother, but they didn\u2019t see each other much, being that his brother was in the Navy. His parents were retired in Florida, but they\u2019d had Marcus and his brother Adam late in life. Marcus was twenty-nine, same as me with only a few months separating our birthdays, and he was a firefighter. Oh, and he was a good, kind man who was thoughtful all the time and treated me like a prince.\n\u201cThat\u2019s such a shame. Anyway, how are Marcus\u2019 kittens?\u201d Mom asked. I pulled myself back to what she was saying. It was never good to not pay full attention to anything Mom said, otherwise you\u2019d end up agreeing to all kinds of things she\u2019d throw at you when your defenses are down. I loved her dearly but she was sneaky like that.\nWhich is how I got myself into this mess with Marcus in the first place. \n\u201cThey\u2019re fine.\u201d\n\u201cDid he find good homes for them?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely, the last of them went to a widowed grandmother in his apartment block.\u201d\n\u201cSocks? The dark one?\u201d\nI glanced at my notes. \u201cNo, you remember Socks went to his uncle; Spider went to the old lady.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, of course, although why someone would name a kitten Spider I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cThere were spiders in the house where Marcus found the kittens.\u201d\n\u201cI still don\u2019t understand how there could be spiders in a burned-out house.\u201d\nShit. \u201cSpiders are hardy.\u201d\n\u201cYou said the house was razed to the ground, dear.\u201d\nNow I was losing the will to live. \u201cWell, maybe the spider was outside. Mom, I need to go, Moira is at the door and she needs me to sign off on the new AbbaLister raisins account.\u201d\n\u201cOf course dear, just, please tell Marcus he is welcome at any time. We so want to meet him and thought it\u2019d be better at the house.\u201d\n\u201cI will, I know he\u2019s keen to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cOh good,\u201d she said, and I knew I\u2019d fucked up and somehow given her an opening. I\u2019d never mentioned once that Marcus wanted to meet them, because that would just give them the impetus to take matters into their own hands. My worst fears were confirmed. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve had the most wonderful idea.\u201d\nOh God, what? \n\u201cYour dad and I are coming into the city on Monday; book us dinner on any night, or lunch, breakfast, anything. I want to meet this young man of yours and if it has to be in a restaurant then so be it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDerek, he can\u2019t be busy every night next week, and every lunchtime, goodness me, we\u2019ll even take a quick coffee if that is all he can manage.\u201d\nShit. Shit. And double shit. \n\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can organize.\u201d I kept my tone regretful, to at least give the impression I would try to organize them meeting Marcus, but that it would be unlikely.\nWe finished the call, and I replaced the handset in the cradle, fighting the urge to throw it against the wall, sit and cry at my desk, or maybe, less drastically, move to Montana and become a cowboy.\nSo many lies.\nThere was no Moira standing at my door. It was still closed and I\u2019d lied to my mom.\nThere were no kittens, I made those up, and the spider story. The word spider came about because when I\u2019d been talking to my mom about Marcus and the kittens, a tiny spider had crawled over my notes.\nI closed the notebook in which I had the names of five kittens with their various characteristics listed. \nMom wanted to meet Marcus, any night, any lunch, anytime.\nWhich sucked big hairy balls.\nBecause that was another thing I had made up. \nThere was no Marcus either. \n\nRJ Scott is the bestselling romance author of over 100 romance books.

Lucky Strike, Marlboro, then Marlboro Light. Pack a day. And it was starting to take a toll on my body. Persistent cough. Ashen complexion.\nDecades ago, I tried using Nicorette lozenges to quit. Lasted all of two weeks. I was wired to a high-wire. My friends begged me to start smoking again. And I was happy to comply.\nFast forward to 2007. The coughing fits start. I buy Hall\u2019s cough drops. When I lay down to sleep at night, my lungs fill with fluid, which I spit into a cup on the floor by the bed. I con my doctor into writing a prescription for a sleep aid.\nIt was one of those I-Wasn\u2019t-Looking-But-She-Showed-Up kinds of things. After we\u2019d been dating a few months, I gushed about her to a dear friend. \u201cDo you want to enjoy this relationship as long as possible?\u201d she asked. \u201cOf course\u201d, I said. \u201cThen quit smoking\u201d, she said.\nI loved cigarettes. And I quit cigarettes on January 5, 2012. What did it take? All the motivation any sane man would need: I fell in love with a woman\u2026 then with myself.\nThe ePower 1650 kit arrived. 3.7V, Kanger cartos, and SmokeTech tobacco -flavored e-liquid (24 mg) Despite the incomprehensible instructions, I assembled it. It was a revelation. I got my Nic Fix, and all the familiar rituals (except striking a match) were in place. In the first year, I still bought the occasional pack of Marbs. But since 2013, I've not smoked a single cigarette. My cough disappeared, taste buds activated, and my complexion returned to its usual ruddy glow.\nIn 2016, I upgraded to a ProVari . Then to a Provari 3. Then added the ProVari Mini. I was headed to the Grave, then I took the proper detour. Halleluiah.\nView attachment 704365 Click to expand... Great story.

With that command, 20,000 roaring Philadelphia 76ers fans gave AI the standing ovation he earned by stamping himself as one of the franchises all-time greats. Iverson, emotional as he thanked former teammates and friends, had his No. 3 retired at halftime of Saturdays game against Washington. High above the Wells Fargo Center court, Iversons banner slipped between Maurice Cheeks No. 10 and Charles Barkleys No. 34. \"They all wanted me to talk about how much yall loved me,\" Iverson said, \"but trust me, the feeling was mutual.\" Iverson officially retired in October after last playing in 2010. He won four scoring titles for the Sixers and was the 2001 MVP when he led them to the NBA Finals. He never won a championship, the lone omission in a career that is destined for the Hall of Fame. The Sixers may as well have turned the arena into an AI museum. Four banners greeted fans at the main concourse entrance, and photos of him were plastered all around the arena. The merchandise stands sold Iverson jerseys for $130, and lower level tickets were going for as much for $1,280 on Stubhub about an hour before the 7:30 p.m. tipoff. The fans loved him, and he blew them kisses after the No. 3 was raised to show how much he loved them back. \"I am Philly,\" Iverson said. \"Its always going to be that way.\" Iversons return injected a rare dose of excitement into a franchise playing some of the worst basketball in the league. The Sixers, in full-blown rebuilding mode, had lost 12 straight entering Saturdays game. The losing didnt matter much Saturday, just the memories. The Sixers wore special \"Iverson Forever\" patches on their jerseys and Iversons 3 on their pregame warmup shirts. \"Its a great example of how this city responds to somebody that they clearly think the world of and brought such exciting times to the city of Philadelphia,\" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. The Sixers retirement gift was a boat named in honour of his nickname, \"The Answer.\" \"It feels good,\" Iverson said after the ceremony, \"but some part of my heart hurts because I know its over.\" Iverson joined Cheeks, Barkley, Wilt Chamberlain and Julius Erving among the eight retired numbers in franchise history. Erving attended the ceremony. Moses Malone, Dikembe Mutombo, Theo Ratliff, Gary Payton and former team president Pat Croce also were at the celebration. Former coach Larry Brown, who both clashed with and loved Iverson over their tenure, sent a videotaped message. \"I just want to tell you, and I say this fondly: God put me there to coach you,\" Brown said. Iverson said Brown was the player who moulded him into one of the NBAs best. \"I always had raw talent,\" he said. \"I needed Larry Brown to polish it up.\" Iverson was the No. 1 overall pick in the 1996 draft and spent his first 10 seasons in Philadelphia. He also played for Denver, Detroit, and Memphis before returning to Philadelphia for a 25-game stint in 2009-10. Iverson, who mashed hip-hop culture and hoops like no player before him, was perhaps at his peak in his fifth NBA season. The 165-pound guard averaged 31.1 points, was the MVP of the All-Star game and propped an entire franchise on his 6-foot frame all the way to the finals. Led by Brown, the Sixers needed Game 7 wins in consecutive series for the right to play the Lakers. Shaquille ONeal, Kobe Bryant and the Lakers swept their way through the post-season before Game 1 in Los Angeles. Iverson had 48 points in 52 minutes of an overtime victory. The Sixers didnt have enough to go the distance and the Lakers won the next four games. Hes 21st on the NBAs career scoring list with 24,368 points over 914 career games. Iverson, drafted out of Georgetown, scored 30-plus points 345 times and was an 11-time All-Star. His No. 3 jersey was a bestseller around the globe, the headband wrapped snugly around his cornrows, and the tattoos were as much a part of his image as the way he ricochets around the court. Play every game like it was his last was more than a catchphrase, it was a lifestyle. \"Who could not be an Allen Iverson fan?\" said Thaddeus Young, the lone current Sixers player who played with Iverson. \"It got no bigger than him in Philadelphia.\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver was at the game for AIs night. \"Allen was a special player,\" Silver said before the game. \"The great things he did for the league far outweigh the occasional headache. I always thought even at the time of Allen Iversons prominence in the league, he was representative of his generation.\" Joe Maddon Jersey .

Just ask last seasons Supporters Shield winners, the New York Red Bulls, who were resoundingly defeated last weekend by a rampant Vancouver Whitecaps in a match which produced two contenders for MLS Goal of the Week from Sebastian Fernandez and Pedro Morales.Portland, OR (SportsNetwork.com) - Damian Lillard had 21 points and nine assists in three quarters of work as the Portland Trail Blazers thrashed the Chicago Bulls 105-87 on Friday night. LaMarcus Aldridge added 16 points and nine rebounds for the Blazers, who won their sixth straight game. Nikola Mirotic supplied 24 points and 11 boards for Chicago, which was without point guard Derrick Rose and power forward Pau Gasol again. Rose missed his fourth consecutive game with a hamstring injury, while Gasol didnt play for a third time in a row due to a left calf strain. The Bulls lost forward Taj Gibson in the third quarter of this one with a left ankle sprain. The Blazers led by as many as 17 in the opening frame before the Bulls cut the gap to 39-35 in the second. Portland later responded with an 18-2 run and were never threatened again. Lillard hit consecutive triples at one point and nnetted eight points during the surge. Allen Crabbe capped the surge with a dunk to stake Portland to a healthy 59-39 advantage late in the first half. The Blazers led 61-43 at the break and by as many as 28 in the third before settling for an 89-65 cushion heading into the fourth, where they cruised to the easy win. Earlier, Aldridge and Lillard nailed triples in the first few minutes as Portland raced out to an 18-3 margin. The spread swelled to 26-9 late in the first. A 10-2 Bulls flurry pulled them within 30-21, but Chris Kamans reverse at the horn gave the Blazers a 32-21 lead going into the second. Game Notes The Blazers held a 48-28 points in the paint advantage ... Portland shot 49.4 percent (39-of-79) from the field and 9-of-16 from beyond the arc ... The Bulls shot just 36.1 percent (30-of-83) from the floor.

I\u2019ve never felt comfortable or like I could be myself which is why I understand you and thousands of other gay men like us don\u2019t like being in \u201cthe scene.\u201d\n\nHaving full acceptance that you\u2019re not into the gay scene is a huge step to take and I\u2019m here to tell you, welcome to the real party! In my opinion, it\u2019s s much better here.\n\nNow let me give you some practical advice on where you can meet quality gay guys outside the club. \n\n\nMost of us resort to dating apps like Grindr, Scruff, OkCupid or Manhunt, all with the hopes of connecting with our community or meeting the love of our life. Just like gay clubs, this is a way to meet other gay men - but it\u2019s not the only way.\n\nThese apps typically attract guys just looking to hook up. These apps can be a community in their own nature, but they can leave you feeling rejected and lonely - especially when a hookup or encounter doesn\u2019t turn into a meaningful friendship.\n\nYou actually don\u2019t have to make friends in the gay community in order to feel fulfilled and satisfied. You don\u2019t have to go to nightclubs or create a dating profile when you\u2019re feeling lonely, bored or horny. You don\u2019t have to put yourself in environments that make you feel uncomfortable. If you do, then you\u2019re doing yourself a disservice and causing harm toward your mental hygiene which is the way you keep your mind and your emotions clean and spiffy.\n\nJust like we need to stay hygienic with our physical bodies by brushing our teeth, taking showers and exercising, it\u2019s equally as important to place ourselves in healthy environments that support our happiness and social well-being.\n\nIn order to make friends outside the gay scene, you gotta answer this one question: \u201cWhat are your values?\u201d\n\nDo you value health? Do you value education? Do you value giving back to communities through volunteerism or entrepreneurship?\n\nWhen you identify your values, then you can pick and choose communities that align with your values. There are plenty of activities that align with your values in your new city like hiking, yoga, video game clubs, book clubs, art studios, and seminars at local colleges and universities. \n\n\n\nGoing to these place and events that align with your values has got to be your number one priority because that\u2019s where you\u2019re gonna meet people just like you, regardless of whether or not they\u2019re gay or straight, male or female.\n\nThe more often you show up (the keywords here are \u201cshow up\u201d), you\u2019ll begin to meet people who align with your values.\n\nAs you meet and mingle with these people, I want you to become proactive in doing these 3 three things:\n\nFirst, get in the habit of introducing yourself. \n\nIt may feel awkward to introduce yourself to new people, but you just gotta suck it up and realize that some people are gonna become your friends and others aren\u2019t. I always tell my students, some will, some won\u2019t, so what, someone\u2019s waiting. Make sure you remember that.\n\nSecond, always ask to exchange contact information. \n\nSwap phone numbers or exchange email addresses. I\u2019m gonna recommend you don\u2019t start with social media here because it\u2019s so easy to get lost in the noise and just become a cog in someone else\u2019s social media wheel of doom.\n\nLastly, follow up and keep in touch. \n\nEvery time you meet someone you like, invite them out to coffee or invite them out to a non-work related activity.\n\nThen when you have at least 3-4 new friends that you\u2019ve bonded with, you can invite all of them over to your house to have a dinner party or plan a group outing together.\n\nIt\u2019s your responsibility to take the initiative to make new friends and form new social groups, especially when you move to a new city. No one else is gonna do this for you, but now you have the exact steps to take to get a group of guy friends together, and you also know how to meet quality gay guys outside the gay scene.\n\nWhat are your tips for meeting quality gay guys? Let me know in the comments below.\n\nBy Max DuBowy/ huffingtonpost.com \n\nGot a news tip? Want to share your story?  Email us .

A police helicopter circled over the prison van that brought the men to court for hearings.\nDetective Chief Superintendent Gerry McLean, head of Organised Crime and Counter Terrorism, said they \"were involved in the most serious criminal activity, including firearms, drug dealing and extreme violence.\"\n\u201cThey were responsible for bringing fear and misery to communities across Scotland and we welcome the fact that they have been brought to justice and admitted their involvement in the face of a wealth of evidence.\"\nRichardson and Fitzsimmons faced charges including the shooting of underworld figure Ross Monaghan outside a primary school in Penilee, Glasgow, in January this year.\nOther allegations they faced included the attempted murder of gangland boss Robert Kelbie and allegations of \u00a31.5m of hidden \u201ccriminal\u201d cash.\nRichardson, 30, who had been accused to trying to kill Monaghan and Kelbie, admitted having a Glock handgun.\nFitzsimmons, 37, also allegedly involved in the Monaghan attack, pled guilty to also having the gun and ammunition and hiding \u00a336,000 of dirty money.\nDavid Sell, 50, admitted to being involved in the abduction and torture of Robert Allan, who was trussed up at a house in South Yorkshire then bundled into a car and driven 200 miles to West Lothian.\nOnce there, he was attacked before being driven to East Kilbride, shot in the legs in East Kilbride and dumped by a road in March 2015.\nAnthony Woods, 44, Francis Mulligan, 41, and Michael Bowman, 30, each accepted roles in the crime gang. Gerard Docherty, 42, pled guilty to recklessly discharging a firearm at a house.\nSteven McArdle, 33, admitted he also had a Glock. Barry O\u2019Neill, 37, admitted he had dealt in cocaine.\nThe gang could now be hit with Serious Crime Prevention Orders, thought to be a first for a high court in Scotland, in a bid to root out organised crime gangs.\nThe original indictment said the nine had agreed to \u201ccommit and organise the commission of serious offences.\u201d\nOther accusations included the Monaghan shooting outside St George\u2019s Primary School in Penilee, who had been cleared of the murder of gangster Kevin \u201cGerbil\u2019 Carroll in January 2010. Not guilty pleas from Richardson and Fitzsimmons were accepted.\nIt was claimed Richardson, Docherty and McArdle had tried to kill Robert Kelbie in Newbridge, in September 2016. Docherty pled guilty to firing a gun.\nJudge Lord Beckett remanded them in custody, with sentencing due to take place later this month.\nThe hearing was adjourned.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "beckett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert kelbie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "francis mulligan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barry o\u2019neill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark richardson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monaghan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david sell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcardle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelbie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fitzsimmons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richardson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael bowman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony woods", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gerard docherty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven mcardle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ross monaghan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert allan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martyn fitzsimmons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gerry mclean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "docherty", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "scots", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "st george\u2019s primary school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south yorkshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east kilbride", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newbridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penilee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west lothian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glasgow", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:12:01.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5f8a38bdfcd664c069849159c5738f61ea2db924", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSdwCx9ebqzePSygD34acFN45D3FCXr6Ilce86HZ2vxRVZBZzwou5pPhJ51HKQkPxs8qPKlIi3KdYXY3t.YnlEKapO.zWK7c1t", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "\ud83c\udd71lack People Twitter", "title": "What\u2019s the N stand for?!", "title_full": "What\u2019s the N stand for?!

Searching for Solutions", "text": "As the tragic circumstances of a Colorado fifth-grader\u2019s suicide draws widespread attention, two state lawmakers said last Friday they plan to introduce legislation next year aimed at helping schools try to prevent such cases.\n\u201cI want to have a conversation that 10-year-olds die by suicide,\u201d Colorado State Representative, Dafna Michaelson Jenet told Chalkbeat . \u201cAnd we need to be doing more to help them.\u201d\nThe Commerce City Democrat\u2019s comments follow the death of 10-year-old Ashawnty Davis, who hung herself in her closet, according to multiple reports. Ashawnty\u2019s parents say she was \u201cdevastated\u201d after a video of her confronting a bully after school was posted to a social media app, Musical.ly .\nAnthony Davis and Latoshia Harris, Ashawnty\u2019s mother and father, are raising questions about whether Sunrise Elementary in Aurora, CO, part of the Cherry Creek School District, did enough to prevent the incidents before their daughter\u2019s death.\nOfficials from the Cherry Creek School District say they took the appropriate steps. And suicide experts caution about attributing a suicide to a single event. Usually there are multiple factors, and clear answers are often elusive.\nStill, Ashawnty\u2019s death, along with a growing rate of suicides among Coloradans between the ages of 10 and 17, have parents, educators, activists and lawmakers wrestling with complex questions about bullying and suicide prevention in a digital age.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a situation where students can no longer escape the bullying that happens at school, because of technology,\u201d said Daniel Ramos, the executive director of One Colorado, which as the state\u2019s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy organization has taken a strong stance against bullying. \u201cThat\u2019s something we need to better understand.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear how widespread bullying is in Colorado schools. Under Colorado law, schools aren\u2019t required to exclusively report instances of bullying. They are, however, required to report events \u201cdetrimental to the welfare or safety of other students or of school personnel.\u201d But that includes a wide range of issues, state officials said.\nThe Healthy Kids Colorado Survey, a biennial questionnaire that a sample of Colorado students fill out on a volunteer basis, found in 2016 that by the eighth grade, half of all students reported being victims of bullying. And about 20 percent of high school students reported being a victim of bullying within the previous year.\nSome Colorado schools \u2014 including some in the Cherry Creek School District \u2014 are attempting to make their schools safer places. More than 70 school are participating in a three-year, $2 million grant program to curb bullying.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no magic solution to reduce bullying,\u201d said Adam Collins, the state Department of Education\u2019s bullying prevention and education grant coordinator. However, the program is attempting to build teams of teachers, parents and students at participating schools to change the conversation around bullying.\n\u201cA lot of times, people feel like they want to help but they don\u2019t know what to say or do,\u201d Collins said, adding that some schools in the program are helping teachers come up with one or two different sentences they can use to defuse situations around bullying.\nWhile some lawmakers are considering additional steps to prevent bullying at school, Michaelson Jenet and state Sen. Nancy Todd, an Aurora Democrat, want to equip educators and mental health providers with more tools to curb the state\u2019s high child suicide rate.\nSince the beginning of the year, there have been reported cases of children committing suicide in Colorado Springs, Littleton, Thornton and Grand Junction. The deaths have cut across racial and socioeconomic lines.\nThe rate of Colorado children taking their own lives has more than doubled in the last decade, data show. In 2016, nearly 10 out of every 100,000 Colorado kids took their own lives \u2014 57 in total. Colorado\u2019s suicide rate among children is one of the nation\u2019s highest.\nTodd\u2019s bill would provide grants to schools for training teachers and staff in teaching life skills and preventing suicide.\n\u201cOur students need to be surrounded by highly qualified teachers, staff, and peers that have a greater level of focus on positive life skills and know when to seek higher levels of intervention to assist students indicating a need for help,\u201d Todd said in a statement.\nMichaelson Jenet\u2019s bill would allow kids as young as 12 to meet with a licensed therapist to talk about their feelings without parental consent. Under current law, parents must be notified if a child under 15 seeks help.\nThe Commerce City lawmaker\u2019s bill also would create a campaign to advertise the state\u2019s suicide prevention text hotline and create a program to train adults in \u201cmental health first aid.\u201d\nMichaelson Jenet, whose own son attempted suicide when he was 9, ran a similar bill seeking to lower the age of consent this year. It died in the Republican-controlled state Senate.\n\u201cThis is the No. 1 question for our society in Colorado,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to answer the question \u2014 How do we stop our kids from dying?\u201d\nby Nic Garc\u00eda\nNicholas Garc\u00eda is the Deputy Bureau Chief for Chalkbeat Colorado, Chalkbeat.org.\nRead More Cover Features at: www.elsemanario.us", "highlightText": "",

Katibu Mkuu wa Yanga, Charles Boniface Mkwasa ameiambia Bin Zubeiry Sports \u2013 Online leo kwamba Ngoma amewasilisha taarifa na vielelezo mbalimbali juu ya kuchelewa kwake baada ya kuruhusiwa kwenda kwao Zimbabwe mara moja. Hata hivyo, Mkwasa amesema kwamba suala la mchezaji huyo litajadiliwa na Kamati ya Nidhamu ya klabu kwa kuwa bado Ngoma alifanya makosa kuzidisha siku za ruhusa yake bila ya kuwasiliana na klabu. \nDonald Ngoma atafikishwa kwenye Kamati ya Nidhamu mapema wiki ijayo \u201cPamoja na yote ataitwa kwenye kikao cha Kamati ya Nidhamu mapema wiki ijayo, suala lake litajadiliwa na baada ya hapo tutafikia suluhisho,\u201damesema. Aidha, Mkwasa amesema kwamba Kamati ya Usajili inatarajiwa kukutana pia mwishoni mwa wiki hii kupitia taarifa ya benchi la Ufundi chini ya kocha Mzambia, George Lwandamina kuhusu wachezaji wa kuondolewa moja kwa moja, kutolewa kwa mkopo na wa kusajiliwa pia. Lakini Mkwasa alikataa kuthibitisha wala kukanusha kwamba kocha Lwandamina amependekeza viungo Said Juma \u2018Makapu\u2019, Yussuf Mhilu, Baruan Akilimali, Juma Mahadhi, Maka Edward na mshambuliaji Matheo Anthony waondoke wakacheze kwa mkopo klabu nyingine ili kukuza uwezo wao. \u201cNi kweli tuna taarifa imeletwa na kocha, lakini siwezi kuizungumzia kwa sasa hadi hapo Kamati ya Usajili itakapokutana mwishoni mwa wiki na kuifanyia kazi,\u201damesema Mkwasa. Kuhusu Mzimbabwe mwingine, kiungo Thabani Kamusoko, Mkwasa amesema anaendelea na matibabu mjini Dar es Salaam, wakati mshambuliaji Mrundi, Amissi Tambwe alikwenda kwao, Burundi kwa ruhusa maalum na anatarajiwa kurejea kuanzia leo. Kikosi cha Yanga kinaendelea na mazoezi Uwanja wa Uhuru mjini Dar es Salaam wakati huu Ligi Kuu ya Vodacom Tanzania Bara imesimama kupisha michuano ya Kombe la Mataifa ya Afrika Mashariki na Kati, CECAFA Challenge inayoendelea nchini Kenya. Na Ligi Kuu ilisimama Yanga ikiwa katika nafasi ya tatu kwa pointi zake 21 baada ya mechi 11, ikizidiwa pointi mbili na zote, Simba SC na Azam FC za Dar es Salaam pia.

Though I\u2019m personally guided by a utopian vision of anarchist nonviolence, I\u2019m not convinced popping Richard Spencer in the face conflicts with this dream. It\u2019s a long slog from here to there. I promote pluralism in the struggle against fascism and all authoritarianisms. \nStrict pacifists, those who entirely eschew killing or physically harming humans and perhaps other feeling beings, of course have serious trouble against non-pacifist opponents. At current tech levels, strict pacifists have limited options to stop a ruthless adversary. How do strict pacifists avoid getting imprisoned or simply shot? For this reason and others, I can\u2019t advocate strict pacifism, as much I\u2019m drawn to the ideal. \nAs Errico Malatesta famously wrote , \u201cthere can be no doubt that the Anarchist Idea, denying government, is by its very nature opposed to violence.\u201d All (or at least most) anarchists hope to abolish coercion, to achieve genuine liberty for everyone. Engagement with the world that actually exists entails compromise\u2013 recognition of the distance between where we\u2019re at now and what we wish to create. The vexing question is how to optimally progress toward freedom in a manifestly un-free and violent society. \nWhile narrow interests such as status competition and social climbing frequently influence one\u2019s approach to combating fascism, here I explore various anti-fascist strategies from a consequentialist framework focused on fostering maximum freedom for all. \nTo bash-the-fash anarchists, respect-the-NAP libertarians, committed pacifists, and curious liberals alike, I want to emphasize uncertainty. Assessing the effect any given action has on our massively complex network of human connections isn\u2019t easy. I consider compelling both arguments in favor of forcibly no-platforming fascists and ones against this approach. I encourage all anarchists and others opposed to fascism to do the same. Assuming any group or individual has the definitive anti-fascist tactic or strategy strikes me as wildly overconfident. Regardless of what you think about the merits of excluding fascists from the public sphere and the marketplace of ideas, I recommend interactions based on the spirit of intellectual charity and being excellent to fellow anti-fascists in a broad sense. \nBecause of my affinity for pacifism, critiques of no-platforming and the shaming, harassment, and physical force at times associated with it intuitively resonate with me. In theory, I don\u2019t want such coercive tactics to shape what people think or how they act. I don\u2019t personally enjoy being bullied or beaten, so why would I want to do those things to others? Shouldn\u2019t people determine what\u2019s true and what best serves the their interests and the common good without stifling social pressure and employing naked force? \nAs sundry liberals and libertarians point out, the policy of assaulting or killing fascists potentially leads to an authoritarian spiral due to definitional issues and the seductive appeal of coercion. When we say \u201cfascists\u201d and \u201cfascism,\u201d do we mean the proper sense as described by scholars such as Robert O. Paxton or in the expansive colloquial sense? Anti-fascists who practice no-platforming seem to agree it applies to the entirety of the alt-right regardless of how alt-right folks identify ideologically, up to and including Jared Taylor. But is militant no-platforming additionally applicable to Trump supporters, mainstream conservatives, etc.? Lines blur. After all, mainstream conservatives and liberals alike support structural white supremacy, imperialism, settler colonialism, heteropatriarchy, and so on. There is ambiguity about how wide of a net to cast when using no-platforming tactics. This ambiguity can trace a path to a place where, as Malatesta described, anarchists can claim \u201chardly less than the right of life and death over those who are not Anarchists, or who are not Anarchist exactly according to their pattern.\u201d It\u2019s not hard to find approximately this position articulated among certain anarchists in online forums. \nAs understandable as the anarchy-or-die position is, keeping in mind the saying that \u201cextremism in defense of liberty is no vice,\u201d this view clashes conceptually with core anarchist values and provides a welcoming environment for cynical social climbers and petty tyrants. The righteousness of bashing a Nazi (or conservative, or liberal, etc.) for the greater good so easily bleeds into self-righteousness and the joy of inflicting pain and terror, of domination. I personally avoid engaging in violence in part because I fear I would fall into that trap. \nOn the other hand, as a queer geek, I\u2019ve experienced being an outcast and being targeted by a mob. When I watch videos of anti-fascists bashing some lone individual, I viscerally empathize with the individual and wonder if that could be me next. A friend of mine who sits somewhere between communist anarchism and Leninism received a beating from an anarchist black bloc one time, so it\u2019s not inconceivable. I hold a number of extreme and unpopular views. \nThe principles of freedom of expression and of information are crucially important for discovering how the reality we jointly inhabit operates. Scientific inquiry has a long history of challenging social systems and people\u2019s identities. If applied too liberally, no-platforming can hinder research and serve as another tool for guarding established conceptual frameworks against new theories. \nThe most chilling critique of the current anti-fascist tactic of militant confrontation comes out of my monitoring of the alt-right. Mike Enoch and other alt-right folks assert that antifa helps them, that antifa radicalizes white people and brings more recruits to their side. While this claim could be bravado, reverse psychology, or otherwise insincere, it\u2019s imperative that anti-fascists develop ways to assess our effectiveness and make sure our tactics aren\u2019t playing into the enemy\u2019s hands. The narrative of antifa as counterproductive appears routinely in many centrist online forums as well. I doubt all of its proponents are simply playing games. While we can write off some significant number of such centrists as irredeemable or at least extremely difficult to persuade to value freedom in anarchist fashion, it\u2019s likely militant no-platforming repulses some number of centrists who might otherwise prove sympathetic to anarchism. That\u2019s presumably likewise the case with other tactics and while it\u2019s not necessarily a cause to avoid militant no-platforming, it is a factor we should consider. \nBecause the above, I tend to think it\u2019d be better to engage in mass principled nonviolent action against the state and against fascism, with defensive violence reserved for direct aggression if employed at all. This mirrors the pacifist-anarchist position Malatesta criticized, but functions fantastically in a thought experiment! The masses rise up and dismantle oppression without inflicting physical harm on any feeling being. Let people think and say whatever they want, but prevent them from having the ability to hurt anybody. With enough raw numbers and willingness to take risks, we could shut down or transform the economy and society. No punching necessary. \nNeedless to say, such a thought experiment passes the bounds of credibility. We\u2019re not anywhere near having that many anarchists and sympathizers. Harassing, shaming, shunning, and/or punching are arguably more practical under the circumstances we find ourselves in. An effective mass nonviolent movement suffers from the collective-action problem and even in the most optimistic scenario; it asks a lot of people. Ostracizing and terrorizing fascists and company, by contrast, stands out as rather convenient and economical. Existing society operates largely via social pressure and the threat of physical force, so we know these methods can condition human thought and behavior. Qualms about coercion should be weighed against the harm fascism causes and could cause. The danger fascism poses to liberty and human well-being cannot be overstated: fascism is truly the antithesis of freedom. \nMoreover, the importance of masculine power and success in fascist thought and propaganda makes confrontation and humiliation potentially especially effective. Numerous alt-right and other fascist-aligned appeals involve a narrative emasculation and a promise of virile revival. Confrontation, including violence, can suppress fascism by preventing fascists from plausibly offering victory and glory to would-be recruits. What emasculated man wants to get chased off and/or beaten up by a bunch of antifa queers? That doesn\u2019t help. Militant no-platforming can fuel fascist persecution narratives, which is part of their pitch, but recurring humiliation without vindication isn\u2019t very attractive. While it\u2019s of course true to an extent for all movements, fascism in particular needs to demonstrate success in order to succeed. \nThe fascist reliance on winning leads to robust practical case for militant anti-fascism that includes no-platforming by force: this approach has a history of keeping fascist organizing at the margins. But stopping fascism alone isn\u2019t the only relevant question. What about how initiating force against fascists and similar violates the non-aggression principle and in doing so contributes to a pernicious cycle of hostility as sketched above? \nHere it\u2019s critical to keep in mind that fascism is inherently and necessarily violent. Even if we adopt the most generous possible interpretation of the alt-right, their leaders nonetheless brazenly promote countless forms of state violence: borders, detention centers, deportations, police, jails, prisons, etc. They want to strengthen these already horrific elements of contemporary society. It\u2019s fair to see organizing for this unambiguously violent objective as an act of aggression that merits defensive violence in response. And that\u2019s with the most generous interpretation. There\u2019s plenty of evidence that many on the alt-right want to physically exterminate their enemies. That\u2019s what they \u201cjoke\u201d about continually. \n\u201cViolence,\u201d Salvor Hardin says in Isaac Asimov\u2019s novel Foundation , \u201cis the last refuge of the incompetent.\u201d I\u2019m skeptical that damaging human bodies via blunt trauma constitutes the very best method of defeating the humans who currently espouse fascism, much less for defeating fascism as an ideology. At least with superior technology, a sufficiently sagacious artificial intellectual could presumably devise an anti-fascist plan far surpassing anything we squishy fleshbags have come up with. But we\u2019re stuck here in the early 21 st century, equipped with only crude tools and incomplete data.

People in charge need to be pointed out . There have been things that no one, specifically Simon Chapman, wanted to talk about , like suggestions of law, regulations, and opinion to manipulate nicotine in this instance, but \u201cdon\u2019t talk about it\u201d. \nPublic health, is top secret stuff, evidently. I would be irresponsible if I didn\u2019t link Clive Bates covering the paper above here . Less smoking in Australia comes with fines \nThe \u201cdiscussion paper\u201d (Note the other names in that) surely in part, brought this idiotic fine \u201cpenalty system\u201d where posession of nicotine includes fines (and jail time) and cigarettes are legal : Act Like An Expert \nI\u2019ve proudly called Simon Chapman a \u201cchimpmanzee\u201d among other obvious things here . \nAs an \u201cexpert\u201d in tobacco control, it\u2019s been pointed out by much smarter people than I am (in many instances) that Simon is wrong. You\u2019d think, with his Ph.D. in social medicine that he would know better. \nIt isn\u2019t the first time Mr. Chapman has been called out here , here & here . \nChristopher Snowden could go on here . An assertion does not make you correct \nThis one is one of my favorite instances of assertion by Simon Chapman, and it still puzzles me as to why he would ever make such a rookie professional mistake. \nRemember, this statement is from a tobacco control EXPERT influencing public HEALTH and tobacco control . I\u2019d expect such a person to know everything there is to know about nicotine. \nIf you happen to be an \u201cexpert\u201d, act like one. Make it a goal to know more than common people like me, or Judith below. \n\nEven in his retirement, he wants to assert control. Name calling and\u2026 well, who\u2019s above that\u2026 \nI\u2019ve thought of calling Simon Chapman a \u201cpretentious prick\u201d. A \u201cman-child\u201d. I\u2019ve thought \u201cwhat an arrogant pompous ass\u201d, yet I\u2019ve only given time and effort where I thought it may be most appropriate. Like now. \nIt isn\u2019t like Chapman would ever call anyone attempting to engage him properly, (yes I did) trolls . \nLet us clear the decks, call out the lies of those who have more power and funding than brains who are influencing idiotic policy with less than desireable required credentials and force them to answer the questions publicly. \nI don\u2019t want to waste any more of our time. \nYou can see Senator Leyonhjelm who has balls, discussing Simon Chapman below. \n\u201c\u2026Department of Health was so taken aback by Simon Chapman\u2019s false statements that they felt the need to go on the record and clear things up\u201d \u201cIll-informed, willfully ignorant and downright malicious\u201d \u201cSnake oil salesman come in all shapes and sizes. Sometimes they take the guise of an emeritus professor of sociology\u201d ~ Senator Leyonhjelm \n\n\nDon\u2019t spread this around , Simon is talking about litigation . I recently got defamation from someone saying similar false bilge about my qualifications & expertise that warrior #Leyonhjelm said about me in Coward's Castle last night https://t.co/HTknGxz6TC President of Senate will be getting a response. \n\u2014 Simon Chapman AO (@SimonChapman6) December 6, 2017 \nSpell my name right, Simon. \nAs a footnote, the last time I wrote about my pal Simon, he graciously reviewed my inane drivel on Twitter.

Less smoking among teens, what\u2019s the problem? \nIf it has, please, show your work to the class, Senator. \nI\u2019ll assume since Senator Kaminsky is \u201ca leader on ethics reform & corruption\u201d (referred to here ), there would be no need for me to assume there could be broad manipulation or ommission of facts in this discussion. \nNo, I assume credibility & fact-checking was of the highest priority before the discussion began. \nNow, different than the normal rhetoric, he didn\u2019t say it doubled with the normally ever-present words like \u201cyouth\u201d, \u201cchildren\u201d or \u201ckids\u201d in his post(s), instead, for the sake of my own sanity, \u201cThink of the children\u2122\u201d, I\u2019ll describe it as implied . Assumptions \nMy assumption is he and the expert panel \u201care\u201d referring to \u201cchildren\u201d\u2026 if anyone has video or a transcript to the \u201cdiscussion\u201d or data used, please comment below. \nFor those that care, keep up and are watching: \nWhat I still can find is still the latest from the National Institute on Drug Abuse\u201d via the \u201cMonitoring the Future (MTF) survey\u201d from 2016 found here : \nFor a second year in a row, the MTF survey asked high school students about their use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). \nSignificant decreases in use from last year were reported by: \n8th (6.2 vs. 9.5 percent) \n10th (10.3 vs. 14.0 percent) \n12th graders (12.4 vs. 16.2 percent). Since @toddkaminsky is \"a leader on ethics reform & corruption\", I assume credibility & fact-checking is of the highest priority. \nWith \"Danger In Disguise\", I don't care if I'm wrong, I'd like to see the #data used. \nI'm questioning your integrity, I am questioning the intent. https://t.co/3jECMXUKU6 \n\u2014 VapingIT, SPE, EEI (@Vapingit) December 5, 2017 \nI can only assume this will lead to another attempt to promote what is \u201cTobacco 21\u201d or youth smoking covered here and here and here and here . \nWhat I cannot find is \u201cvaping nearly doubled\u201d. If anyone has it, please link it in the comments below so I can publicly Apologize publicly and directly to Senator Kaminsky Correct the numbers so I can pretend I\u2019m an expert! I\u2019ve said this before. \nI\u2019ll repeat it: \u201cIf \u201cchildren\u201d are *already smoking, they\u2019re *smokers regardless of age. Think of the children\u2122.\u201d \nI predict, as others have, rates among \u201ckids\u201d will go up in the next few years. I\u2019m not against that. \n\u201cWhen tobacco use decreases, less smoking occurs.\u201d \nWhat I do know is \u201cnicotine\u201d is now wrongly classified as \u201ctobacco\u201d . \nWhat I also know, Senator, is New York has top billing with the long-standing Master Settlement Agreement Ponzi scheme. Ask the expert! \nI encourage you to voice your questions or concerns on these matters on his public Twitter and Facebook accounts. \n\u201cT21 has potential to increase use rates through psychological reactance, and out of protest once the targeted demographic realizes their right to choose has been removed.\u201d \n\u201cThey\u201d want tobacco to be restricted to adults, they want to restrict adults from tobacco, and e-cigarettes.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "todd kaminsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaminsky", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "d) ny senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national institute on drug abuse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mtf", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:12:04.062+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "89bb21a7053705a5c7579c0deae26f81279863de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpYzFCDIzIkswuLlD6lVO4hklBuYfoXN26pN2ysaD5hZYrzd0qqh6vb9PW6laJ6rjURr21eUjXf2bVqk1F0hyebfmf8tiwUxlxwrziCn_QCKwZU8xovSAh9TFjFK75x2D1Sb.ohEpOKroUg33ltxW_", "site_full": "arstechnica.com", "site": "arstechnica.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Ars Technica", "title": "Shall we play a game?

While Goldman Sachs is planning to hire 250 employees in 2018, Standard Chartered targets to employ about 500 new workers. \nFor expanding its presence in Eastern Europe, Standard Chartered is considering cities like Prague, Budapest, or Polish cities of Warsaw and Krakow. The final decision is expected to be out by the first quarter of 2018. \nGoldman Sachs will be hiring in treasury and human resources, risk management and operations and technology departments. All of which are back-office jobs and do not require offices in big cities like London and Frankfurt. \nWhile the banks across the globe are trying to move away from the U.K. (owing to Brexit), several countries are trying to replace them. In this context, Poland seems to be an attractive destination for financial companies, mainly driven by low costs and highly educated workers. This provides the country an edge over the others. \nIn the recent years, Poland has established itself as an off-shoring center with roughly 2 million people working in the finance sector. In September, Poland announced that JPMorgan Chase JPM was planning to open an operational center in the city of Warsaw. In relation to this, the bank will likely be creating nearly 2,500 new jobs in the country over the next few years. \nMeanwhile, several other global banks including Citigroup Inc. C , UBS Group AG and Credit Suisse Group AG already have considerable presence in the country. \nCurrently, Goldman Sachs and Standard Chartered carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
