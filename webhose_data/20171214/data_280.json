Filed: Thursday, December 7, 2017 at 09:31 UK Last Updated: Thursday, December 7, 2017 at 09:31 UK \nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola has said that his side will be all the better for having lost a game in the wake of their 2-1 defeat at Shakhtar Donetsk last night. \nThe Citizens had been unbeaten in 22 games in the Premier League, Champions League and the EFL Cup going into the encounter in the Ukraine but were stunned by the hosts in the space of six first-half minutes, Sergio Aguero 's stoppage-time penalty proving a mere consolation. \nWith qualification to the last-16 stage of the competition already assured, Guardiola fielded a much weaker side in preparation for this weekend's Manchester derby but admitted that he was still 'hurt' by the loss. \n\"It hurts. It is never nice to lose a game,\" he told reporters. \"But we have said many times we cannot win all the time, we are going to lose games. Today was the first. \n\"We needed to lose a game. It will be good for the club, for all of us and the media. People say things when you win a lot and you can forget that now. \n\"We saw many good things but we made mistakes and we are going to improve on that. Football is how you recover in the good moments and bad moments to stay stable.\" \nCity will go into Sunday's match with Manchester United eight points clear of their city rivals at the top of the Premier League table .

In ancient India, it enjoyed equal status with men; in early Vedic period they were very educated and there are references of women sages such as Maitrayi in our ancient texts. But with the coming of famous treatise of Manu i.e. Manusmriti, the status of women was relegated to a subordinate position to men.Need for empowerment emerged due to centuries of domination and discrimination done by men over women . They are object of brutality .India is no different.\nIndia is a mind boggling country. We have, through centuries, created and developed various types of traditions and practices. These traditions and customs, good as well as awful, have become a part of our society\u2019s collective cognizance. We worship female goddesses; we additionally give incredible significance to our mothers, daughters, sisters, wives and other female relatives or friends. But at the meantime, Indians are additionally renowned for treating their women badly both inside and outside their homes.\nIndian society comprises of people belonging to almost all kinds of religious conviction. In every religion women are given an exceptional place and every religion teaches us to treat it with respect and dignity. Yet some way or another the society has so developed that various types of ill practices, both physical and mental, against women have become a norm since ages. For instance, sati pratha, practice of dowry, female infanticide, parda pratha, sexual violence, wife burning, sexual harassment at work place, domestic violence and other varied kinds of discriminatory practices; all such acts consists of mental as well as physical element.The reasons for such behaviour against women are numerous but the most important one are patriarchal system of society and the male superiority complex. Though to eliminate these ill practices and discrimination against women several self-help groups and NGOs are working in this direction; various constitutional and legal rights are there but in reality there are a lot to be done for breaking the societal hindrances and achieving great heights in all dimensions: political, social and economic. But society as a whole has still not acknowledged women as being equal to men and crimes or abuses against women are still on the rise. For that to change, the society\u2019s orthodox mind set needs to be changed through social conditioning and sensitization programmes.\nTherefore, the concept of women empowerment not just concentrates on giving women strength and aptitudes to rise above from their miserable circumstances however in meantime time it also stresses on the need to teach men regarding women issues and inculcating a sense of respect and obligation towards women as equals.\nAuthor: \u2013 Corporate social responsibilities (CSR, also called corporate conscience, corporate citizenship or responsible business) are a form of corporate self-regulation integrated into a business model.

Evan Vucci AP Photo On Jerusalem, Trump delivers for supporters at home By CATHERINE LUCEY Associated Press December 07, 2017 01:04 AM WASHINGTON \nPresident Donald Trump's move to recognize the divided city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital may have triggered a worldwide chorus of critics but the president had his ears closely tuned to his supporters at home. \nFor Trump, the proclamation was an important way to make good on a pledge to his political base, which includes evangelical Christians and pro-Israel Republicans eager for such a move. \n\"While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver,\" the president declared Wednesday in announcing his decision. \"Today, I am delivering.\" \nThose were words to savor for a president who's been frustrated to see a number of key campaign pledges stalled or slowed \u2014 sometimes by a bitterly divided Congress, some by larger national or international concerns.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \nRepealing the Obama era health care law is a promise unfulfilled, much to Trump's frustration. Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box \u2014 although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action. \n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" \nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. \nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" \nTrump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \n\"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron david miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evan vucci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilan goldenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill galston", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "white house", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east security program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faith and freedom coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catherine lucey associated press", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:08.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b7387ebcd7ccd1868c1138bfd8086f828067bd7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwAKTPg6EMTT02yQ6YyIgqIZsYHD22O6qldrA1hBO4degwluIA4.QOrJNIlHrVzZaEFB24Z155urYV5Gr3QUVN42NKtjOv6CRs-", "site_full": "forum.surfer.com", "site": "surfer.com", "site_section": "http://forum.surfer.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=postlist&Board=8", "site_categories": ["surfing_bodyboarding", "non_standard_content", "adult", "sports"], "section_title": "POLITICS | SURFER Magazine Forum | Surf News, Fantasy Surfer, Photos, Video, and Forecasting", "title": "Impeachment Fails.

Alex Brandon AP Photo Franken faces fresh accusations, weighing his future By ANDREW TAYLOR Associated Press December 07, 2017 01:00 AM UPDATED 1 MINUTE AGO WASHINGTON \nMinnesota Democrat Al Franken, facing fresh allegations of sexual misconduct and vanishing support from fellow Democrats, appears to be on the brink of resigning from the Senate. \nFranken scheduled an announcement for Thursday, though his office tweeted Wednesday evening that he had not made \"a final decision\" on resigning. \nBut a majority of the Senate's Democrats called on the two-term lawmaker to quit after a woman emerged Wednesday morning saying he forcibly tried to kiss her in 2006. Hours later, another woman said Franken inappropriately squeezed \"a handful of flesh\" on her waist while posing for a photo with her in 2009. That brought the number of women alleging misconduct by Franken to at least eight. \nFranken, the former comedian who made his name on \"Saturday Night Live,\" faces a chorus of calls to step aside, and Democratic senators said they expected their liberal colleague to resign.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \n\"Enough is enough,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. \"We need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is OK, none of it is acceptable, and we, as elected leaders, should absolutely be held to a higher standard.\" \nGillibrand was the first to call for Franken's resignation on Wednesday, but a torrent of Democrats quickly followed. \n\"I'm shocked and appalled by Sen. Franken's behavior,\" said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state. \"It's clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time. It's time for him to step aside.\" \nThough the writing appeared to be on the wall, Franken's departure was not certain. A tweet posted Wednesday evening on Franken's Twitter account said: \"Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate.\" \nLate in the day, Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York added his voice. \n\"I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately,\" Schumer said. \nThe resignation demands came in rapid succession even though Franken on Wednesday vehemently denied the new accusation that came from a former Democratic congressional aide, who said he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006. \nThe woman, who was not identified, told Politico that Franken pursued her after her boss had left and she was collecting her belongings. She said that she ducked to avoid his lips and that Franken told her: \"It's my right as an entertainer.\" \nFranken, in a statement, said the idea he would claim such conduct as a right was \"preposterous.\" \nBut it was soon clear that his position had become untenable. \nFellow Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who spoke to Franken, wrote on Twitter, \"I am confident he will make the right decision.\" \nThe pressure only mounted Tuesday, when Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., resigned after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. Rep Ruben Kihuen, D-Nev., faces pressure to resign as well over allegations reported by Buzzfeed that he repeatedly propositioned a former campaign worker. \nWhile Franken apparently is departing, Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore could be arriving, if he prevails in a Dec. 12 special election. Multiple women have accused the 70-year-old Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were teens and he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s. If Moore is elected, it could create a political nightmare for Republicans, who have promised an ethics probe. \nA national conversation about sexual harassment has intensified this fall after the heavily publicized case of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of many acts of sexual misconduct, including rape, by actresses and other women. Just on Wednesday, Time magazine named as its person of the year the \"silence breakers\" \u2014 women who have come forward on sexual harassment. \nPunishment has been swift for leaders in entertainment, media and sports while members of Congress have tried to survive the onslaught of allegations. \nFranken already faced a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into previous claims by several other women that he groped them or sought to forcibly kiss them. \nThe allegations began in mid-November when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan. \nOther allegations followed, including a woman who says Franken put his hand on her buttocks as they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Two women told the Huffington Post that Franken squeezed their buttocks at political events during his first campaign for the Senate in 2008. A fourth woman, an Army veteran, alleged Franken cupped her breast during a photo on a USO tour in 2003. \nFranken has apologized for his behavior but has also disputed some of the allegations.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "al franken", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "franken", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kirsten gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leeann tweeden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john conyers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "politico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew taylor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruben kihuen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy klobuchar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buzzfeed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patty murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey weinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex brandon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schumer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate ethics committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota state fair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huffington post", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "d-minn.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-nev.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-mich.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington  minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:09.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "69ffbab77dfb9e8b7098bac4220f803cba8dc163", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Rp_5vv9o81zfUkelyP4A43rZ1ATj6zE94gtO_Bh3ChlDQTY.utN7VNe.qQEltR90..5bKBK.D5cqiUDaJ0L7v", "site_full": "www.thenewstribune.com", "site": "thenewstribune.com", "site_section": "http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/nation-world/?widgetName=rssfeed&widgetContentId=712015&getXmlFeed=true", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nation & World news | TheNewsTribune.com &", "title": "A better mammogram?

U.S. health officials are beginning a huge study to compare traditional mammograms with 3-D versions, to see if the newer choice might really improve screening for breast cancer. Montefiore Health System via AP) A better mammogram? Huge study putting 3-D scans to the test By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer December 07, 2017 12:55 AM WASHINGTON \nA better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray \u2014 and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat \u2014 overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms \u2014 known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" \u2014 with standard two-dimensional digital mammography.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles \u2014 not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death \u2014 but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening \u2014 that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tova koenigs", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "otis brawley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tova koenigsberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "etta pisano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mccaskill-stevens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "worta mccaskill-stevens", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "montefiore health system", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mobile & apps in", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "u.s. preventive services task force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montefiore einstein center for cancer care", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american cancer society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beth israel deaconess medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american college of radiology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national cancer institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lauran neergaard ap medical", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:09.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ad31b85b8954ed5f16480de20f41126de1f9a8e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7VTx3P6swGuTxWsdDGxsCY-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Raise your Business through Employee Motivation Strategy.", "title_full": "Raise your Business through Employee Motivation Strategy.", "published": "2017-12-07T11:31:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.224, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ad31b85b8954ed5f16480de20f41126de1f9a8e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7VTx3P6swGuTxWsdDGxsCY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kirankmehtaa", "published": "2017-12-07T11:31:00.000+02:00", "title": "Raise your Business through Employee Motivation Strategy.", "text": "If you want to raise your business and spread it all over the world, then you must go for Tridindia Services as they are providing certified services all over the world from a long period of time.

J. Scott Applewhite AP Photo Congress averts shutdown, sends Trump stopgap spending bill By ANDREW TAYLOR and ALAN FRAM Associated Press December 07, 2017 04:28 PM UPDATED December 07, 2017 04:29 PM WASHINGTON \nCongress on Thursday passed a stopgap spending bill to prevent a government shutdown this weekend and buy time for challenging talks on a wide range of unfinished business on Capitol Hill. The shutdown reprieve came as all sides issued optimistic takes on an afternoon White House meeting between top congressional leaders and President Donald Trump. \nThe measure passed the House 235-193, mostly along party lines, and breezed through the Senate on a sweeping 81-14 tally barely an hour later. It would keep the government running through Dec. 22, when another, and more difficult, shutdown problem awaits. \nThe bill now heads to Trump for his signature. \nTopics at the White House session included relief from a budget freeze on the Pentagon and domestic agencies, extending a key children's health program and aid to hurricane-slammed Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida. The trickiest topic, and a top priority for Democrats, involves protections for immigrants brought to the country illegally as children.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \nThese \"Dreamer\" immigrants are viewed sympathetically by the public and most lawmakers but face deportation in a few months because Trump reversed administrative protections provided to them by former President Barack Obama. \nIn back-to-back statements, both Democratic and GOP leaders declared the meeting \"productive.\" The White House called it \"constructive.\" Privately, congressional aides said little progress had been made. \n\"We had a productive conversation on a wide variety of issues. Nothing specific has been agreed to, but discussions continue,\" said Capitol Hill's top Democrats, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, ticking off a roster of Democratic priorities, including domestic spending increases, funding for veterans and money to battle opioid abuse, immigration and health care. \nGOP leaders said they agreed with the need to address immigration, including the almost 1 million immigrants given protections by Obama, many of whom have only known America as their home. \nSpokesmen for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said GOP leaders \"stressed the need to address border security, interior enforcement and other parts of our broken immigration system,\" adding that the tricky immigration issue \"should be a separate process and not used to hold hostage funding for our men and women in uniform.\" \nNegotiations are sure to be challenging. Pelosi staked out a hard line Thursday and insisted that any year-end deal solve the immigration issue. \nPelosi told reporters before the meeting that \"we will not leave here\" without helping the \"Dreamers.\" Her stance was noteworthy because GOP leaders are likely to require Democratic votes for the pre-Christmas spending bill. \nThe White House said \"negotiations on immigration should be held separately on a different track\" and not slow down funding increases for the Pentagon. \nPelosi returned from the White House to oppose Thursday's stopgap bill. Fourteen Democrats supported the measure, however, while 18 Republicans opposed it. \nAmong Republicans, the conservative House Freedom Caucus had resisted the pending stopgap measure earlier in the week, fearing it would lead to a bad deal for conservatives down the road. But on Thursday, the group's chairman, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said the group will likely give leaders whatever support they need to pass the legislation. \nMeadows said they'd help it pass to avoid distractions from the GOP drive to push their treasured $1.5 trillion tax bill through Congress this month. That measure, which mostly benefits businesses and upper-income people, is Trump's and the GOP's top remaining priority and would be their first major legislative triumph of the year. \nBut hours before Trump was to bargain with congressional leaders at the White House over longer-term spending decisions, Meadows said the conservatives would oppose any agreement they feel allows excessive federal spending. \n\"I want to avoid a headline that says President Trump's administration just passes the highest spending levels in U.S. history,\" Meadows told reporters. \"There will be zero support on numbers that are too high, regardless of anybody's position on that.\" \nHe also said Ryan promised he'd fight in coming weeks to pass a full-year budget for the military and leave fights with Democrats over domestic spending for later. It is unclear how that strategy would work, since Republicans control the Senate 52-48 and will need at least eight Democratic votes to pass any spending legislation. \nThe prospects for successful White House talks were buffeted Wednesday when the impulsive Trump blurted to reporters that a shutdown \"could happen.\" He blamed Democrats, saying they want \"illegal immigrants pouring into our country, bringing with them crime, tremendous amounts of crime.\" \nLast week, an unexpected attack by Trump on Schumer and Pelosi prompted the two to skip a bargaining session. \nThe two-week spending bill also makes money available to several states that are running out of funds for the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP. That widely popular program provides medical care to more than 8 million children. \nThe CHIP issue is among the year-end items where negotiations have gone positively, and aides say a long-term agreement is nearly in hand.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul ryan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "steve scalise", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "chuck schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. scott applewhite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark meadows", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin mccarthy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mobile & apps from", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "freedom caucus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap photo congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house freedom caucus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan fram associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "children's health insurance program", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "r-wis.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-la.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-n.y.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:10.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f52b40c68fb44798fbdae658f94457a5ebd7ad2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8SN9il7cGGTt7g.TSvhBp_rg.gonE.pEcRM2dRaMvIlOcwxgA6ySY_OCV8WRxgcI-", "site_full": "www.dpreview.com", "site": "dpreview.com", "site_section": "https://www.dpreview.com/forums/1061", "site_categories": ["photography", "hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Photographic Science and Technology Forum: Digital Photography Review", "title": "Does sRGB have colors not in Adobe RGB?:", "title_full": "Does sRGB have colors not in Adobe RGB?: Photographic Science and Technology Forum: Digital Photography Review", "published": "2017-12-06T02:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1469, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "70119174c6da909dbf2cae07e2c3b0a1bd8fae69", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8SN9il7cGGTt7g.TSvhBp_rg.gonE.pEcRM2dRaMvIlOcwxgA6ySYVcJMpkuID3R1H5dR1mzWxKDz4Kij1yfbLhisic2Iorc-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "techjedi", "published": "2017-12-06T02:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: :\nQuote: :\nWhile considering new HDTV technology and various color spaces, I came across this web page showing that Adobe RGB has only 85.7% the gamut of sRGB.\nhttps://www.noteloop.com/kit/display/color-space/srgb/\nHowever clicking Adobe RGB in another tab and comparing the diagrams, I don't see where the 14.3% missing colors could be.

Michael Balsamo, File AP Photo FBI director defends his agency against Trump's attacks By SADIE GURMAN and ERIC TUCKER Associated Press December 07, 2017 01:56 PM UPDATED 4 MINUTES AGO WASHINGTON \nCountering strident attacks on his agency from the president who appointed him, FBI Director Christopher Wray on Thursday defended the tens of thousands of people who work with him and declared, \"There is no finer institution.\" \nWray, who has led the agency just four months, fended off politically charged questions from lawmakers of both parties during a routine oversight hearing that was overtaken by questions about Hillary Clinton's emails and President Donald Trump's campaign. Citing pending investigations, he repeatedly declined to answer questions about either, while also refusing to give an opinion on whether Trump could be accused of obstructing justice. \nBut he did not hesitate to defend the nation's premier law enforcement agency following a weekend of Twitter attacks by Trump, who called the FBI a biased institution whose reputation is \"in Tatters \u2014 worst in History!\" and urged Wray to \"clean house.\" \nThe outburst from the president followed a guilty plea from his former national security adviser for lying to the FBI and the revelation that an agent had been removed from a special team investigating the Trump campaign because of text messages seen as potentially anti-Trump.

SUBSCRIBE NOW \nWray, who was nominated as FBI director by Trump, faced Republican criticism over perceived political bias in special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of possible Trump campaign ties to Russia during the 2016 presidential election and in the handling a year earlier of an FBI investigation Clinton's use of a private email server that ended without criminal charges. \nWhen asked about Trump's harsh tweets, Wray rebutted him directly, saying, \"My experience has been that our reputation is quite good.\" \nWray expressed pride in the agents, analysts and other personnel who he said were working to protect Americans. But he also conceded that agents do make mistakes and said there are processes in place to hold them accountable. \n\"There is no shortage of opinions out there, but what I can tell you is that the FBI that I see is tens of thousands of agents and analysts and staff working their tails off to keep Americans safe,\" Wray said of the agency he has led for just four months. \"The FBI that I see is tens of thousands of brave men and women working as hard as they can to keep people they will never know safe from harm.\" \nThe White House on Thursday tried to soften Trump's message, denying any discrepancy between his comments and those of the FBI director. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump agrees field agents are \"appreciated and respected,\" but said the president's \"issues are with the political leaders in the FBI under former director Comey, particularly those that played politics with the Hillary Clinton email probe.\" \nThe emphasis on the Clinton and Trump probes reflected how the FBI in the last two years has found itself entangled in American politics, with investigations focused on the Democratic presidential nominee and the Republican president and his successful campaign. Those investigations have transformed routine oversight hearings, like the one Thursday, into platforms for tense questions about the political leanings of an agency that prides itself on being removed from partisan consideration. \nWray's defense of the FBI came after the committee's chairman, Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said he was concerned by reports that Peter Strzok, a veteran counterintelligence agent involved in the Clinton investigation, was removed from Mueller's team last summer following the discovery of text messages seen as potentially anti-Trump. \n\"Even the appearance of impropriety will devastate the FBI's reputation,\" Goodlatte said. \nRep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, top Democrat on the House Judiciary panel, predicted Trump's attacks on the FBI will only grow louder as Mueller continues investigating. \"Your responsibility is not only to defend the bureau but to push back against the president when he is so clearly wrong, both on the facts and as a matter of principle,\" Nadler told Wray. \nWray's tenure as the new FBI chief would be difficult even without the intense scrutiny of the Russia investigation. Since he was sworn in on Aug. 2, the U.S. has experienced two of the deadliest shootings in its modern history and an attack on a bike path in Manhattan that officials have said was terrorism. \nTrump's weekend tweets created a fresh dilemma for Wray. With his bosses, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Sessions' deputy, Rod Rosenstein, staying publicly silent, it fell to Wray to defend the agency. But FBI directors traditionally have been low-key and stoic \u2014 with Wray's predecessor, James Comey, a notable exception.

There, Republicans from both sides of Congress generally agree on two big changes.\nSaving for private school \nTaxpayers can currently save money for college through a 529 plan, where earnings grow tax-free. Many states also offer deductions for contributions. In the proposals, Republicans want to let taxpayers use 529s to pay for K-12 tuition at private and religious schools, too. Families can already do that with a different plan \u2014 Coverdell Education Savings Accounts \u2014 but these have low contribution limits and aren't open to high-income Americans. The move to expand the 529 would dramatically increase who could use these plans and the money they could save.\n\"I think the only taxpayers who will be in a position to benefit from the 529 change are very rich people,\" says Nora Gordon, an economist and associate professor at Georgetown University. She says using these accounts to save for elementary or high school won't help much unless you can afford to set aside a lot of money early on. No wonder, when the Government Accountability Office studied 529s and Coverdells a few years ago, it found \"families with these accounts had about 25 times the median financial assets\" of those who didn't use them and \"about three times the median income.\" \nWhile the proposed expansion of 529 plans would largely help affluent parents who use private schools, Republicans are proposing another change that could hurt funding for the nation's public schools.\nThe SALT (state and local taxes) deduction \nUp to now, taxpayers who itemize their deductions \u2014 generally high-earners who make up about a third of households in the U.S. \u2014 have gotten a break from the federal government for paying state and local taxes.\nThink of it as a kind of rebate \u2014 courtesy of Washington \u2014 that ultimately helps state and local governments pay for important things, like schools, among other things.\nRepublicans now want to cut that discount, getting rid of the income and sales tax deductions and putting a $10,000 cap on the deduction for property taxes.\n\"This bill is going to make it more painful for residents to increase local property taxes to pay for public schools,\" says John Friedman, an associate professor of economics at Brown University.\nOn average, nearly half of public schools' funding (45 percent) comes from local taxes, often property taxes. In the past, when locals hiked these taxes to help pay for their schools, the federal government made the hike hurt less with that SALT deduction. So imagine, if Congress caps the property tax deduction, for high earners who already pay a lot \u2014 in places like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, even Texas \u2014 a new hike would hurt more than it used to.\n\"This is a really big deal for some states and no deal at all for other states. And the states that it's a really big deal for are blue states,\" says Nora Gordon of Georgetown. \"They're states with higher cost of living, higher property values and states that spend more on their state and local government.\"\nWhile local taxes provide nearly half of public school dollars, state taxes account for much of the rest (46 percent). Kim Rueben of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says states often use these sales and income taxes to help their poorest schools.\n\"The money from the state ends up helping to prop up school districts that have less ability to raise money from the property tax,\" she says. Getting rid of these deductions, Rueben says, will make state-level taxes more painful for some and, again, could make it harder to raise money for schools in the future.\nImportant context: All this is happening with many school districts still reeling from the Great Recession. According to a recent analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, after adjusting for inflation, \"twenty-nine states provided less overall state funding per student in the 2015 school year than in the 2008 school year, before the recession took hold.\"\nHigher education The two tax bills are farther apart when it comes to higher education.\nIn the House: fewer tuition benefits \nWe've heard a lot about graduate students' reaction to the proposal to tax their tuition waivers as income.\nAs Ariana Figueroa reported for NPR:\n\"Many grad students \u2014 especially in Ph.D. programs \u2014 receive tuition waivers in exchange for teaching classes or doing research. Under current law, that money isn't taxed as income. But the House bill calls for those tuition waivers to be counted as income and subjected to income taxes.\nThat means graduate students would be paying taxes on money they never receive.\"\nThe House bill also cuts or reduces other higher education tax benefits:\nThe Hope Scholarship Credit The Lifetime Learning Credit and tuition deduction The deduction on interest for those repaying student loans The American Opportunity Tax Credit, which students and families can use to offset college tuition payments, is limited to exclude part-time and graduate students, although it is also extended for a fifth year. Together, the axed benefits are worth about $6.5 billion a year to students and families, according to the American Council on Education.\nThe Senate bill doesn't include any of the above.\nState funding for public higher education may also be in jeopardy, for the same reasons we discussed above \u2014 a consequence of getting rid of the deductions for SALT. Scaling back, or cutting federal discounts to taxpayers may cause a squeeze on funding for state universities and colleges.\nPrivate college penalties \nBoth public and private colleges have expressed concern that fewer people are going to be taking the charitable deduction, because of the increase in the standard deduction. They're worried this will lead, in turn, to less money in donations. The American Council on Education estimates about $100 billion less a year in donations across all nonprofits.\nThere are also some provisions in the House and Senate bills that target private colleges specifically. One provision would levy a tax on investment gains for a small group of private colleges that have very large endowments on a per-student basis. Currently, this money grows tax-free thanks to the colleges' nonprofit status.\nThis affects about 65 private colleges with extremely large endowments. But even more colleges are worried about it, says Terry Hartle of the American Council on Education.\n\"Even though public universities are not affected by the endowment tax, they are very much opposed to it, for fear it would set a precedent that would be applied to them in the future.\"\nCulture war? \nThe tax plans, which passed on party lines in both the House and Senate, are aligned with a broader Republican agenda.

Thompson director of Transportation for America. \u201cLong-term, that means our country falls further behind, our economy suffers and the cost of any future infrastructure investments is even more prohibitive.\u201d \u201cWith this tax bill Congress has missed the opportunity to fix the insolvency of the national highway trust fund which pays for road, bridge and transit programs nationwide,\u201d said Carl Sedoryk, General Manager of Monterey-Salinas Transit. \u201cFor over a decade Congress has known that the current sources of funding no longer provide enough resources to maintain a state of good repair that ensures the safety and dependability of our transit programs. The current {tax} bill also takes away important bond financing tools from public entities to that will make it more expensive for local governments to use private funds to finance infrastructure projects.\u201d Pay more for less transportation Debbie Hale, executive director of the Transportation Agency for Monterey County said, \u201cThe federal tax bill will likely mean that taxpayers must pay more for infrastructure financing, and federal transportation funds will be even more scarce than before. \u201c \u201cWhat all of this means at a local level, \u201cSedoryk said, \u201cis that the current {tax} bill will result in less stable and dependable federal funding for local road improvement projects and make it more difficult and potentially more costly to purchase new buses and construct projects like planned bus rapid transit along the Monterey Branch Line or the construction of MST facilities in King City and Salinas.\u201d Greenfield bicyclist helps save pedestrian Buy Photo \nErnie Gallardo, the newest member of the County bike committee (Photo: MacGregor Eddy/Special to Salinas Californian) Ernie Gallardo, 70, of Greenfield, helped to revive a pedestrian who collapsed on Metz Road three miles south of Soledad on the afternoon of Nov. 22. Gallardo, who was featured in this column Nov. 3, was on his usual bicycle ride when he passed a man walking on the side of Metz Road on his outward trip. \u201cI went back the same way,\u201d Gallardo said. \u201cand he is lying alongside the road, so I call 911, I knew what I needed to do because I am trained as a first responder.\u201d Gallardo is a high school baseball coach and certified in CPR. \u201cAfter I put the phone down the guy had stopped breathing,\u201d Gallardo said. \u201c I could not find a pulse so I started giving him compressions, and it seemed like forever before the ambulance arrived, and then EMT\u2019s revived him.\u201d The man was then transported to Natividad Medical Center by ambulance, according to Ralph Flores of Cal Fire. On Wednesday, the Transportation Agency for Monterey County confirmed Gallardo\u2019s appointment to the TAMC Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities Advisory Committee. Gallardo will be a valuable addition to the Committee. How many trucks does the county need? Dear readers, How many trucks does the Monterey County Agricultural Office need? At the Monterey County Agricultural Office at 1428 Abbott Rd, I counted 36 extended cab pickup trucks parked at 10:30 am on Wednesday, all with the Monterey County emblem on their doors. That is a lot of vehicles to be parked, even for the offseason. Does the County use that many trucks? Buy Photo \nMore than 35 extended cab pickup trucks were parked at the Monterey County Agricultural Office. (Photo: MacGregor Eddy) At 7 p.m. Dec. 14, the Salinas Traffic and Transportation Commission will meet at the City Hall Rotunda, 200 Lincoln Salinas. Beginning January 2018, the commission meetings will begin at 6 p.m. The agenda will be available at www.cityofsalinas.org or call 758-7241 for more information.
