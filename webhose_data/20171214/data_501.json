Firstly, I'm with you on the fear about tomorrow. We all wait with bated breath. No point in 'what if's' anymore.\nAs for sex ed, I get what you're saying. It's much more complex than the 70's days of learning what a condom looked like. I didn't know what a 'homosexual' was until I read it in a sex Q & A book I stole off a news stand at 16.\nIn the early 80's when AIDs hit the mainstream, a fear campaign followed because of lack of info and it being life threatening. Even well meaning teachers had no clue due to conflicting stories.\nThe following couple of decades saw gender/sexuality issues come to the fore because of AIDs, but it was mainly on gay/lesbian identity, addressing gay bashings and equality, especially in the workplace.\nHere we are ten yrs on; AIDs sufferers have massive support no matter their gender or causative factor. Condoms are sold in supermarkets to anyone, young single parenthood is a non event, gay and lesbian school kids aren't bullied as much as they used to be and are out and proud in many cases. Equality in the workplace and beyond has protective legislation, and LGBTI+ is a household term.\nWhen my sis told me what the legal curriculum in sex ed contained, it took my breath. I'm liberal; I'm open and honest; I'm an advocate for participation and inclusion, but I wasn't ready for that conversation.\nAs for policing the internet, I don't know the answer. It's a doorway into the minds of 'Helter Skelter' and that scares the shit out of me. You too I guess huh?\nHow about we all (functional thinking adults worldwide) send an email a day to Mark Zuckerberg, Apple, Microsoft, etc, etc, etc, and keep them neck deep in cyber crap till they buckle???\nMy best...\nSez xo", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:17.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "90d5585bb92f159a305104d1760b5456eba9eeb2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrIWthqWHwhXMiHRdJgWlSWdFfb1y85sFsLRKT2fJ0jNK9tYHZuxZwcjCt22L0M_qQ3bi7bOMvN9uHKtNDE5HLOFb1NMYKZjAI-", "site_full": "sl4x.com", "site": "sl4x.com", "site_section": "http://sl4x.com/forums/canh-cao-xu-ly-vi-pham.4/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "C\u1ea3nh c\u00e1o, x\u1eed l\u00fd vi ph\u1ea1m | SL4x.com -

For example, the limited edition runs allows them to bring their latest designs to market sooner, and give their riders an edge. This year, Husqvarna joins the fray, bringing their own limited edition, the FC 450 Rockstar Edition. Upgrade Highlights The cylinder and exhaust system are more compact than before, helping to centralize the weight of the bike. Trimming 15mm and a full pound off the SOHC powerplant is a plus, as is the better intake and exhaust flow that it allows. It's fed by a 44mm Keihin throttle body. On the exhaust side, it has a very unique-looking resonance chamber, and you've got a much shorter and more compact silencer that maintains the same sound level. Mechanics will appreciate that it can be removed without having to remove the shock. It mates up with a new five-speed Pankl Racing Systems transmission. The DDS (Dampened Diaphragm Steel) clutch uses a single diaphragm steel pressure plate instead of traditional coil springs. The clutch basket is a single-piece CNC-machined steel component, and it's all controlled by a Magura hydraulic clutch lever. \nClaimed stock horsepower? 63 ponies. \nYou'll also find all the modern electronic goodies like a map switch and launch control, as well as traction control. \nThere was a lot of work done on the WP Performance Systems-produced steel frame to increase the longitudinal rigidity, and that was matched with the stiffer CNC-machined upper triple clamp. The 70% polyamide/30% carbon fiber construction subframe also got an update, and has also been simplified into a two-piece unit. It's also a claimed half-pound lighter than before, and provides a different flex feel to match the frame. \nWe often see the Rockstar Energy Racing Husqvarna team running the rear wheel well back into the swingarm slots, and they've added an additional 5mm of adjustment range to the back of the hollow, cast aluminum swingarm. \nFor suspension, the Husky continues on with the WP AER 48 fork, and uses a WP DCC rear shock with a new piston and updated setting. \nWant a batch of other team-inspired goodies? Here goes... There's the carbon fiber reinforced skid plate, a billet Rekluse clutch cover and a two-position holeshot device. There's now a triple clamp protector integrated into the front number plate. There are still Brembo brakes on both ends, and up front there's a 260 mm floating front disc with standard front disc protector.

This was a cross-sectional observational study by means of a quantitative survey of 1,000 general practitioners registered in Ireland exploring the frequency of diagnosis, methods of treatment and cost of AHZ and PHN in primary care. We recorded an 18% response rate ( n =\u2009184) with an 83% completion rate ( n =\u2009152/184). 80% of cases of AHZ occurred in patients aged 50 years or more with 81% of study participants encountering cases at a rate of 1\u20133 patients per month. Famciclovir (37%) and valaciclovir (36%) were the most commonly prescribed antiviral agents. Mild opioids (32%) were the most common analgesic agents used for first line AHZ pain, and pregabalin (37%) the most commonly prescribed analgesic agent for second line AHZ pain. Pregabalin was also the most commonly prescribed analgesic for both first and second line PHN pain (29% and 24%, respectively). The mean per-case direct cost (medication and GP visits) of treating AHZ and PHN in primary care was \u20ac195 (range \u20ac153\u2013\u20ac236) and \u20ac201 (range \u20ac140\u2013\u20ac313), respectively. Based on national sentinel data the estimated annual direct costs of treating AHZ and PHN in primary care is \u20ac2,278,196 (range \u20ac1,793,399\u2013\u20ac2, 763,445). The treatment of AHZ and PHN represents both a significant care and cost burden on primary care resources in Ireland in keeping with other European based studies.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2AEd7yV", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ahz", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pregabalin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:19.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "493b1fd045883e222e3124604148fe90844c6d2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxRSP64UrI3qEMnmS9yb4fC_PslT8YmUp_09fpqfSkmAvPFftwIwWgggh3qme_oNzpoj7BYItpYXk_LCrgHQPPqjU9iBxHkMEA-", "site_full": "fmrbookgrind.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://fmrbookgrind.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "FMR Book Grind", "title": "BEHIND THE BARS by Brittainy C.

Cherry is LIVE! \nBehind the Bars by Brittainy C. Cherry Release Date: December 7th, 2017 Genre: Contemporary Romance When I first met Jasmine Greene, she came in as raindrops. I was the awkward musician, and she was the high school queen. The only things we had in common were our music and our loneliness. Something in her eyes told me her smile wasn\u2019t always the truth. Something in her voice gave me a hope I always wished to find. And in a flash, she was gone. Years later, she was standing in front of me on a street in New Orleans. She was different, but so was I. Life made us colder. Harder. Isolated. Caged. Even though we were different, the broken pieces of me recognized the sadness in her. Now she was back, and I wouldn\u2019t make the mistake of letting her go again. When I first met Jasmine Greene, she came in as raindrops. When we met again, she was the darkest storm. \nRead Today or download FREE in Kindle Unlimited!

How much are the American people going to take before they replace the reckless Republicans in the next election? Low and middle-income Americans are bracing for the likely passage of a Trump-supported tax bill that deviously redistributes even more of the people\u2019s income to the richest one percent (including a big tax cut for Trump) and the unpatriotic giant corporations. \nGreased through Congress with the support of Republican mega-donors, over the inept opposition of the Democrats who astonishingly offered no tax plan of their own, this tax legislation does exactly the opposite of what House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and their prevaricator-in-chief, Donald Trump, are declaring. \nNamely, this utterly complex brew of greed and handouts for the super-rich gives a gut punch to the masses, including people making below $30,000. Far from a tax cut the Republicans are trying to Peddle to the people, the Senate bill is projected to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over ten years to pay for the huge tax cuts enriching the corporate plutocrats who are laughing all the way to the bank. Such unsustainable losses in revenue sets the stage for cutting Medicare, Medicaid and other critical services to vulnerable Americans, with Republicans using the ballooning deficit they created as their excuse. \nSlashing and burning in every direction, this legislation endangers the financial security of regular Americans of every age, every occupation and, by ending many deductions for local sales and income taxes, hurting state and local budgets. \nRyan and McConnell undermined the integrity of the legislative process by banning public hearings on this tax legislation in the House and Senate. In doing so, they denied the American people, including honest tax experts, the opportunity to adequately examine these dangerous proposals, especially the huge giveaways to multinational corporations at the expense of working class families. No Congress has ever gone this far. If this shameless lack of transparency proves successful, Congressional Republicans will succeed in driving Capitol Hill further under the dictatorship of the oligarchs, using the people\u2019s delegated power against them. \nTo make matters worse, Senate Republicans prevented their Democratic colleagues from even seeing clean portions of the bill until just before the final vote at 1:25 am on Saturday, December 2. When faced with such hyper-partisan foul play, the Democrats should have shut the Senate down with a sit-in until they were given a reasonable amount of time to read this raid on the regular taxpayers, before the final vote. \nHere are some malicious items from the House and Senate bills: \n1. The Senate bill widens the double standard of favoring corporations over individuals, with a top corporate tax rate of 20% compared to a highest tax rate of 38% for individuals. Such blatant corporate favoritism shows which \u201cpeople\u201d the Republican Congress truly represents. Chalk one up for corporate supremacy for further inequality. \n2. The House bill retains business entertainment deductions for hard liquor but takes away deductions from teachers who use their own money to buy needed classroom materials for their students, along with taxing fellowships for graduate students. \n3. The Senate bill repeals the individual mandate for buying health insurance, setting the stage for higher health insurance premiums and 13 million more people going without health insurance over the next ten years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. \n4. The House bill repeals the medical expense deduction used by millions of ailing citizens. The Senate bill does not. \n5. The House phases out the estate tax, while the Senate bill exempts more rich people from that tax, which only applied to less than 5000 estates a year, according to the Tax Policy Center. These measures were vigorously opposed by 400 very rich Americans, in a public letter to Congress and by another responsible organization called Patriotic Millionaires. \n6. There is a new tax on university and college endowments and tax breaks for parents to send their elementary students to private schools. And this massive piece of legislation is full of escape hatches, such as credits, for preferred vested interests in commercial arenas. Cash register politics. \nThe Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that beginning in 2021 taxpayers with incomes of only $10,000 to $30,000 will be worse off, paying nearly $6 billion more in taxes. The Committee also concluded that by 2027, taxes will go up for taxpayers with income below $75,000 by over $27 billion. \nIncrease a standard deduction here, get rid of an exemption there, cause the increase in deductibles for health insurance policies here, but decrease deductibles used by consumers there \u2013 this cruel deception produces a mind shattering complexity and bonanza for accountants and lawyers. \nThe last minute gifts to monied interests emerged as usual from the darkness at the last minute \u2013 what the New York Times called \u201cLast-Minute Breaks for Developers, Banks and Oil Industry\u201d plus tax breaks for offshore profits by the likes of Pfizer, Google and Apple, lower taxes for the top one percent, benefits for car dealers and other goodies for people dealing with speculative security derivatives on Wall Street. \nThe Republican leadership justifies everything they are doing to the powerless people back home by claiming the tax bill will increase wages, investment and economic growth. This trickery could spark the voters to say \u201cenough\u201d and send the Republican scoundrels packing. \nDozens of impartial experts laugh at the fanciful Republican predictions about the \u201cbenefits\u201d of the tax bill, citing historical evidence, and the existing economic growth, enabled by low inflation and low interest rates. \nNothing was more embarrassing for Donald Trump and the Republicans than when Gary Cohn, Trump\u2019s chief economic advisor, asked a business audience how many of them would increase jobs and wages due to what he called this \u201ctax reform.\u201d Almost nobody raised a hand. \nThe corporate bosses in the audience knew what the Republicans don\u2019t want us to know. These big companies are already neck-deep in massive uninvested capital, so they\u2019re wasting trillions of dollars on stock buybacks which don\u2019t produced any jobs. They don\u2019t need more tax breaks for any more capital. \nIt is time for a voter\u2019s revolt! \nTell your members of Congress there is still time to reject the Republican attack on the working class. A shift of just two more votes in the senate (e.g. Senators McCain, Collins and Flake) will defeat the existing legislation.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/CounterPunch-official-172470146144666/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gary cohn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mccain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "collins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul ryan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tax policy center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pfizer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congressional republicans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joint committee on taxation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicaid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congressional budget office", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:19.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8b09cedcda198b78c5281a2490f874ba26df5598", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrGjj_QCZ89PdWxqpeLxfSmzVf5PgED89lheiCs.wTJC.9d9QO7oMy4jxZXaitGt1OSRctMMxGNzA--", "site_full": "secretsun.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://secretsun.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The Secret Sun", "title": "Babylon's Burning", "title_full": "Babylon's Burning", "published": "2017-12-07T11:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8b09cedcda198b78c5281a2490f874ba26df5598", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrGjj_QCZ89PdWxqpeLxfSmzVf5PgED89lheiCs.wTJC.9d9QO7oMy4jxZXaitGt1OSRctMMxGNzA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The Secret Sun (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "Babylon's Burning", "text": "\nWell, California wildfires are back in the news, this time in the south. Because these fires are striking at a major nerve center, so to speak, they seem to be getting a lot more attention in the news. And because of this we're getting a flood of truly terrifying images, film and video.  \nTerrifying and apocalyptic. Is 2017 working up to a Hollywood climax? \n\n\n\n\nI mean, if you're looking for straight-up,  End of Days apocalyptic imagery, there it is. \n\n\n\nThe fires are being fed by the Santa (In)Ana winds, named for the mother of the Virgin Mary. Their scope and intensity is said to be downright Biblical and firefighters are struggling to even begin to contain them. \nThe City of Angels is ablaze: in the end, how could it be any other way?  \n\nWe have family that lost their home in the Santa Rosa fires, but they were luckier than the 44 people who lost their lives. That \"All-Important\" 44 again. It's like a bad penny-penny. \n\nAnd all too fitting for 2017, the flames are descending on Getty Center, the complex containing the artwork of the famous oil magnate and current focus of a new feature film featuring Braintree's own Mark Wahlberg. \n\nAnd until quite recently, Kevin \"Little\" Spacey. He is being replaced by veteran star Christopher Plummer, a gray eminence who will spare movie-goers of Spacey's spectacularly horrid makeup job.  \nThe film is directed by Ridley Scott, who brought us Alien:Covenant this year and is launching a series on Jack \"Antichrist\" Parsons called Strange Angel . Timely. \nWe might be seeing plenty of strange angels in the days to come. \n\nAlso quite timely is the Getty's new exhibit on Medieval manuscripts. Here we see David and his lyre, which brings us back to those strange angels from Vega in Lyra, aka \"King David's Harp.\" \n\nINVOCATION  \n\n\nThe Getty-Scott-Parsons connection is particularly interesting in that J. Paul Getty Jr. financed Invocation of My Demon Brother and Lucifer Rising , along with the CIA's Ford Foundation.  \nDo also note that Jean Cocteau of Beauty and the Beast fame, who had just made the Lyra-resonant Orpheus film, became a friend and supporter of Anger's work as well.  \nAlso note the Vegas superimposed on that photo of Anger there. Gustave Dore does it every time. \nThe influence Cocteau had on Anger's filmmaking is impossible to overstate. As is Cocteau and Anger's influence on music video and MTV.  \nBut there's been another Getty in the spotlight this year, hasn't there? \n\nAnd that's J.Paul Getty's great-grandson Balthazar, who played a very Dennis Hopper-like drug dealer in Twin Peaks: The Return .  \nWhich of course brings us back to Elizabeth Fraser --which everything eventually does-- and that's through Getty's starring role in the music video for \"Song of the Siren\" that  David Lynch  embedded within Lost Highway for no perceptible reason. \n\n\n\nAnd here's a little screencap from the sequence. \nStarting to get the picture now? Do you think I'd go so far out on a limb with this thing if it didn't keep coming up aces? Don't ask me to explain it. The world is a very strange place. \nNote also that Lost Highway featured the acting debut of Satanist Marilyn Manson, who's been in the news quite a bit lately. Why is anyone's guess. I suppose it has something to do with the apocalyptic mood that is being ratcheted up in the media.  \n\n\nDEMONS OF THE AIR \n\nSpeaking of which, I couldn't help but notice that Bel Air is in the line of fire, quite literally. The exclusive enclave is finding out that infernos don't really care how rich you are, only that you're inflammable.  \nSomething we see in the Book of Revelation, which seems inspired by a volcano eruption, quite possibly the eruption at Pompeii and Herculanum: \n\n\nLet's not forget earthquakes. There was one in Southern California earlier tonight, because they don't have enough problems already. \n\nBel Air  also seems to fit into the overarching narrative we're seeing: Bel means \"ruler,\" as in \"ruler of the kingdom of the air.\" How exactly it fits-- and why-- is still a very open question.  \n\n\nLET'S ALL GO TO THE FIRE DANCES \n\n\n\nAnd speaking of fires, note that a different Bel is the patron god of the Beltane Fire Festival in Edinburgh, which is now expanding into the Samhuinn Fire Festival.  \n\nBut Beltane seems to making a major comeback all over Britain. Yeah, there's a comforting image for you. How long before they start putting people in those things? I'd reckon within the next decade. \nI love The Wicker Man as much as anyone but I'm not sure I'm ready for the real thing. \n\n\nFIRE FROM THE HEAVENS \n\n\n\nI guess Fireball Season came early to Tampa, because shit was falling from the sky all over the place.  \n\nOf course, \"Fireball Season\" is a total lie created a few years back to cover for flaming crap falling at sub-meteorite speeds that no one can seem to explain. \n\nAnd then there's the star falling from Heaven, burning as if it were a lamp ( ASTEROID!!!! ). The asteroid Phaeton 3200- which they named it so because \"Lucifer Babylon \" was a bit louche-- is scheduled to give Earth a little trim on the 17th.  \n\nI'm not liking the numbers here, but let's hope for the best. \n\nBut let's not forget that Phaethon is also associated with Cygnus, the Swan, which our astronomers seem particularly fascinated by.  \nAs does Donald Trump, who's perched atop Cygnus like Draco, the Dragon. Or King Cepheus. Or both. \n\"King Dragon.\" \nHuh. Is he trying to tell us something here? \n\n\n\"FIRE WITH NO END IN SIGHT\" \n\n\nIf so then what do you make of Trump announcing the relocation of the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. That seems a bit, I don't know, audacious ? \n\nAnd Muslims don't seem too overjoyed either, with the Palestinian Authority accusing Trump of playing with fire. Interesting day to say so. \n\nKeep an eye out for fire symbolism--and actual fire-- in the reaction to this move. \n\n\nWhich may be the intended effect. \n\nI can't help but wonder if this is part of an upcoming season of the Apocalypse Reality Show, where the new US Embassy will be the de facto Third Temple. Keep an eye out for Babylonian influences in the design for the new building, something we've been seeing quite a lot of recently.  \nI'd say that was a gimme at this point. \n\n\nLAKE OF FIRE AND BRIMSTONE \n\nYou won't need to be an SJW to sniff out the prophetic implications here. The far-left New York Daily News seems presold on the Antichrist idea.  But is the Pope-pot calling the kettle black here? \n\nFrancis- the last in the line if you believe Saint Malachy-- isn't too happy over this latest move either. But I'm struck by the use of \"wisdom and prudence,\" in light of the Sophia symbolism out there. \nIs the Pope a 4-9er?  \nSince Prudent is a given name that became an adjective is he inviting us to see \"wisdom\" the same way? The possibilities are tantalizing.  \n\nBut given the fact that so many people think Francis is the Antichrist, maybe it's a clever bit of deflection. A way to take the focus off his own diabolism.  \n\nOr maybe Trump is the Antichrist and Francis is the False Prophet? There are too many choices these days. Note here that Franny is flashing the OK gesture, which Trump loves to do as well.  \nIs it a secret 666 like you hear told so often these days, or is it just that the Pope is Italian and Trump is from Queens? \nI guess we'll find out soon enough. \n\n\n\n\nSpeaking of lakes of fire. Read in your best Dr. Evil voice. \n\nBURNED AT THE STAKE \n\nSpeaking of the Poor Knights of the Temple of Jerusalem, they're the stars of a new series debuting on History tonight . Will we see DeMolay et al burned at the stake? Probably. \nYou really gotta love the timing.  Meticulous. \n\nI should probably mention that the Archangels are the Knights of Heaven. And we saw an occultation of Aldebaran-- called the \"Torch\" and associated with Michel-- during the other night's Supermoon. \n\nAnd of course this story broke this week as well. According to The Intercept Trump is assembling his own intelligence agency, intended to override the CIA. At the head of this project are Lt Col Oliver North of Iran-Contra fame and Blackwater's Erik Prince. \n\nPrince being the best-known Templar of our times. If any of this is true, look for things to get very, very hairy, because these are not men famous for their reasoned moderation.  \nMaybe it is the Apocalypse after all. \n\nAnd in a all-too-fitting bit of highly-charged symbology, we hear now that Da Vinci's Salvator Mundi is being moved to the Louvre's new franchise outlet in Abu Dhabi. From the Pyramid to the Dome.  \n\n\nIGNITE THE LIGHT \nIn the last post we looked at the horrific deaths at the gate of the Gate of Heaven cemetery in Valhalla (\"Hall of the Slain\"), and the sickening symbolic links it had to Katy Perry's Super Bowl appearance, where she literally entered the stadium as the Whore of Babylon, greeted by a sea of orange orbs.  \nSome readers pointed out some trenchant details in the narrative, such as the fact that the train- its head car numbered 4333- hit the 49 year-old Ellen Brody as it was going 49 MPH. \n\n\nAnother reader pointed out Brody's maiden name, Schaeffer. \n\nSchaeffer being the original name of the stadium in which Super Bowl 49 champions once played. \n\nWhich began construction on September 23. \n\nI should also point out that Perry's final number at Super Bowl 49 was \"Firework\"-- as in \"Baby, you're a firework.\" The bit where she flew around as a binary star. \nDo you ever feel already buried deep Six feet under scream But no one seems to hear a thing Do you know that there's still a chance for you \n\n'Cause there's a spark in you You just gotta ignite the light And let it shine Just own the night Like the Fourth of July 'Cause baby you're a firework \n\nAnd the meaning of the name of the woman who was literally incinerated alive at \"the Gate of Heaven\" in the \"Hall of the Slain?\" \n\nA firework, alright. \nThere was also  a full moon the night of the collision. \n\nBrody worked at Bill and Hillary Clinton's favorite jewelry store, ICD. They created the charm bracelet that Hillary liked to show off on the campaign trail. \n\nPerry was also closely connected to the Clintons, having acted as a very prominent supporter and surrogate for Hillary's campaign. \"Roar\" and \"Firework\" were popular at campaign events. \n\n\"Roar\" being the big Whore song, where Perry played Mystery Babalon the Great (or April Bell, if you want to be slightly more current) at the Super Bowl.  \n\nA song Hillary herself chose to be her theme song. \n\nAnd used for her closing advertising.  \nThe Antichrist and the Whore of Babylon. And you wonder why I didn't vote? \n\n\nKaty is doing a different take on the Scarlet Woman more recently. \nTHE FORTY-NINE ANGELS \n\n\nSo realizing all of this, let's look at the 49er a bit more closely. The moribund old media are crawling over one another to heap praise on him-- and certainly no one skeptical of state power (or who's watched those sickening compilations of unarmed citizens being gunned down with absolutely no provocation) can argue with his professed motivations-- but knowing the N-ph-L the way I do I can't help but wonder about it all . \n\n\nAll the more in light of this manufactured controversy, when right-wing talk show host Tomi Lahren tore into the Queen of All Media Rituals BeyoncIsis for handing the 4-9er his sacred crystal phallus on behalf of Sports Illustrated. \n\nYou see, that got me to thinking about Super Bowl 50, when BeyoncIsis appeared with Chris  Martin (literally \"Martian\") of Coldplay and Bruno Mars, singing in front of this weird symbol... \n\n...which The Sync Book's Alan Green likened to this symbol... \n\n...of the Martian locust-gods who rise from the titular pit in Quatermass and the Pit. A bit of sacred geometry that Quatermass likens to a \"Kabbalist\" sign, somewhat erroneously. Or is it? \nTHE EQUATION OF TIME \n\nThe day the 4-9er began his protest is rather significant as well- it was the date of the rare \"Equation of Time\" phenomenon. There was also a New Moon and a Solar Eclipse. \n\nNow, I'm not going to quarrel with the ostensible reason for these protests but in light of everything we're seeing everywhere-- especially in the N-ph-L , I feel obliged to point something out.  \n\nAnd that's that the kneeling protests.... \n\n...are essentially identical to pre-and post-game prayers. Same exact poses- on one knee, arms joined. \n\nSo you do have to wonder, has Kaepernick's original protest- where he stayed sitting on the bench-- been appropriated for some other agenda, something no one is actually talking about? \n\n\nI mean, the evidence is right there. Go look for yourself in case you think I'm cherry-picking. Are the N-ph-L'ers actually being manipulated into praying-- or at least appear to be praying-- for some entirely unspoken purpose? Or is that even a question? \n\nOh, I know- I'm just flying off the handle with irresponsible speculation. But who is actually the author of the kneeling protest?  \nHint: it's not Colin Kaepernick. \n\nIt's a former football player with an extensive background in military intelligence. And Hollywood .  \nAnd military intelligence in Hollywood. \nI mean, did you actually expect anything else?  \n\nPOSTSCRIPT: VULCAN'S RING \n\nThe eclipse the night that the kneeling protest began saw a \"Ring of Fire\" eclipse, another one of these terms that astronomers seem to be pulling out of their asses recently. \n\nBut it does turn our attention to the situation in Bali, which could still get rather apocalyptic. We also recently saw a story in which Eleven- aka Millie Bobbie Brown-- was trapped on the island, though that could be entirely ritual in nature. The fact the felt obliged to mention that she flew on Virgo Airlines might bear that out. \nOr maybe it's a bit of foreshadowing of her future playing the Volcano Girl. \n\n\nThe Onion nails it. \n\n\nAs does the late, lamented Malcolm Owen. \nUPDATE: I forgot to mention Tracy Twyman's piece on September 23 and the Kneeling ritual of Freemasonry . Do give it a read. \n\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "elizabeth fraser", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name":

In this case, North Korea would assert its status as a nuclear-weapons state, while the US would insist the dialogue is about eventual denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. This may sound like an unbridgeable divide, but that\u2018s what diplomacy is for.\nBut as 2017 nears its end, the two countries still appear to be on a collision course. Kim Jong-un\u2019s bellicose rhetoric matches President Trump\u2018s. There\u2019s an odd mutual fascination, too, which one foreign diplomat describes as \u201clove/hate.\u201d\nSpeculation about talks increased, paradoxically, after North Korea\u2018s latest missile test on Nov. 29, which appeared to demonstrate Pyongyang\u2019s capability to strike the continental United States. In a statement, Kim announced \u201cwith pride that now we have finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force.\u201d\nTo some analysts, Kim was declaring victory -- and preparing a pivot. Russian emissary Vitaly Pashin told Interfax news agency on Dec. 1, after a visit to Pyongyang, that senior officials there \u201ctold me that the North was prepared to sit at the negotiating table.\u201d The Tass news agency said North Korea affirmed it is \u201cready for talks with Washington on the condition that it is recognized as a nuclear power.\u201d\nNorth Korea\u2018s insistence on its nuclear-weapons status was conveyed to Song Tau, a senior Chinese emissary who visited Pyongyang on Nov. 17. The North Koreans are said to have reminded Song that since 2012, the North Korean constitution has formally characterized the country as \u201ca nuclear state.\u201d\nPyongyang seemingly wants negotiations with America, but on its own terms. Analysts speculate that to justify keeping its existing stockpile of several dozen nuclear weapons, North Korea might promise not to share its nuclear technology with others, and not to attack the US. The US would be wary of such assurances, given Pyongyang\u2019s history of broken promises and proliferation.\nNorth Korea evidently wants to be like India and Pakistan, which became de facto members of the nuclear club after building weapons secretly. It doesn\u2018t want to be like Libya or Iraq, whose leaders were deposed and killed after giving up their nuclear programs.\nThe Trump administration has publicly dismissed the latest overtures. A State Department spokesman said Sunday: \u201cWe do not see any indications of North Korea being committed to or interested in credible talks for denuclearization.\u201d And on Monday, State again rejected, as it has for months, Chinese and Russian calls for a mutual \u201cfreeze for freeze\u201d on North Korea testing and US military exercises: \u201cIt is not enough for [North Korea] to stop its program where it is today.\u201d\nAn interesting visitor to Pyongyang this week is Jeffrey Feltman, UN undersecretary-general and a former US assistant secretary of state. He\u2019s the highest-ranking UN envoy there in six years. What\u2018s he up to? Diplomats aren\u2019t talking.\nThe US strategy for pressuring North Korea remains centered on China, and the hope that the Chinese will tighten sanctions so much that they squeeze Pyongyang into backing down. Many analysts are skeptical this will work: The North Koreans resent Chinese interference, and they have stockpiled a year or more of energy supplies to cope with such pressure tactics.\nChina doesn\u2018t want a nuclear North Korea; but it doesn\u2019t want a US strike on its border, either. It seeks a diplomatic solution that will resolve the irreconcilable. That\u2018s been a US desire for three decades, too, with no success yet.\nHistory tells us that an unconventional solution was found to avert nuclear war 55 years ago, and interestingly, Washington and Beijing are reviewing those very lessons. According to a senior Pentagon official, a high-level Chinese-American military gathering last week in Washington conducted a joint case study of the Cuban missile crisis.\nHas North Korea crossed the nuclear threshold? Pyongyang\u2019s recent statements suggest they have, but some analysts have doubts. North Korea hasn\u2018t shown it can control an ICBM\u2019s re-entry, and it hasn\u2018t fitted an actual warhead atop a missile, sources say.\nWill the Trump administration try to block North Korea from crossing this final goal line, by military means if necessary? Or will it seek a diplomatic formula that could, over time, leave all sides better off than the cataclysm of war? At this holiday season, that conundrum is hidden in the dark box in the corner.\nBy David Ignatius\nDavid Ignatius can be reached via Twitter: @IgnatiusPost. -- Ed.\n(Washington Post Writers Group)\n[ \ucf54\ub9ac\uc544\ud5e4\ub7f4\ub4dc ] [ K-POP HERALD ] [ \ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ubd81 ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/thekoreaherald", "http://imgnews.naver.net/image/044/2017/12/07/20171207000761_0_20171207174642565.jpg?type=w540"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david ignatius", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "jeffrey feltman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david ignatius david ignatius", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vitaly pashin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "will the trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "song tau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong-un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "washington post writers group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "icbm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "interfax", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us-north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "libya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korean peninsula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pyongyang", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:20.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d390e5909764ae5fbf260583cb25ce17750e9988", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSyp1xw3WsNx_3AUvk9EYALA-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "EnGameMenu", "title_full": "EnGameMenu", "published": "2017-12-07T11:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d390e5909764ae5fbf260583cb25ce17750e9988", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSyp1xw3WsNx_3AUvk9EYALA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "EnGameMenu", "text": "name: '&rGame Menu'\r\ncommand: 'EnGameMenu'\r\nrows: 3\r\nItems:\r\n  EnZS:\r\n    id: '145'\r\n    slot: 16\r\n    glow: false\r\n    name: '\u00a7aZombieSurvival'\r\n    description:\r\n     - '&7It will be scary!'\r\n     - '&7You are alone or with other people ended up in the future 5000 year.'\r\n     - '&7Lost all the achievements of humanity.'\r\n     - '&7All the people turned into zombies and other scary creatures.'\r\n     - '&7To survive the battle with zombies, open doors and chests.'\r\n     - '&7Upgrade weapons and stay the longest alive!'\r\n     - '&r'\r\n    command: 'select ZS'\r\n  EnSubway:\r\n    id: '328'\r\n    slot: 11\r\n    glow: false\r\n    name: '\u00a7aSubwayCities'\r\n    description:\r\n     - '&8Subway and cities'\r\n     - ''\r\n     - '&7\u0423\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c, \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c '\r\n     - '&7\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e '\r\n     - '&7\u0438 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438.

I'm even okay with paying for medical bills of everyone including this dipshiat running with bulls. I just don't think we should use this as our case. That's all.\nI dunno, I think this a perfect case to discuss. If I'm gong to be forced to pay for other people's health care, I can talk well tell you I don't want to subsidize poor decisions. So, unless we can have some limitations, and I mean well defined ones again subsiding elective surgery, self injuries due to idiocy, etc I'm not to interested.\nThe amount of our tax dollars that already perpetuate idiocy is infuriating.\nEven dumbasses deserve health care.\nI actually do not agree that healthcare is a basic inalienable right. It's not in the constitution, it is absolutely possible to be free and persue happiness without it.\nBut, if we're going that route, which I am open to, I don't want to follow the model we have for education, which is actually another thing you absolutely do not have a inalienable to. No child left behind is a shiatshow of epic proportions, wasting an unbelievable amount of money on something I believe strongly in. The problem is education is supposed to be about giving all future citizens training in how to reason, reading, writing, math, history, things they would need to participate in society, and things they need to profit in society. It's an investment in our children as a society which is supposed to better society, and those children should then be able to pay back that investment and pay it forward for the next generation in perpetuity. But you see, chasing the bottom and trying to get every last child ruins that investment. Money is taken from good bets to chase sure losses.\nAccidents happen to geniuses and idiots. Crime, illness, cancer, calamity, sure. All of those things can happen to anyone, and I can see the benefit to covering this. But for the same reason life insurance doesn't pay out if you commit suicide, maybe, just maybe self inflicted injuries should be on you to cover yourself. If, for instance, you Plasico yourself... Maybe society shouldn't be on the hook for that particular injury. If you get lost in the woods due to your own idiocy they charge your ass for search and rescue. I'm just saying I like that model, and despite some of the clear fiscal benefits for patients of a single payer, maybe if we are practical about it, there'd be fewer objections to potential misuse, and actually less misuse.\nLife insurance does pay out for suicides, just not in the first two years. It's to prevent fraud and anyone who plans a suicide more than two years out is considered insane by the industry rather than a fraud.\nSo there's people in the industry who take out huge policies 2 years and 1 day before running a rental convertible at full speed under semi stopped at a light. Tends to be actuarials who do that once they live \"too long\" according to their own charts.\nThere will always be folks who game the system, any system. If we define what is acceptable to exclude all possibilities of system gaming, then no system will meet our expectations.\nIt is better to let ten people scam the system than to deny benefits to one person who needs it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:20.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "16e6e577c9113c936975fdd963b42451689fc569", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj2ZX5u28yn6vc50InS2dDvw02j1hzLucb_b40QwF3.NF62Bw4fs4e7hMmyvdryIGUh4D0yHSQ_f4", "site_full": "forums.warframe.com", "site": "warframe.com", "site_section": "https://forums.warframe.com/?/forum/34-warframes-abilities/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Warframes &amp; Abilities - Warframe Forums", "title": "Gara's Mass Vitrify sugestion", "title_full": "Gara's Mass Vitrify sugestion - Warframes & Abilities - Warframe Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T08:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://content.invisioncic.com/Mwarframe/monthly_2017_07/warframe_share.png.bec3c989c4517e865df9b45a300e63e0.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7793, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "08fcb3eac65904c839c15d492434b42d779cecd4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj2ZX5u28yn6vc50InS2dDvw02j1hzLucb_b40QwF3.NF62Bw4fs4e7hMmyvdryIGUmw8huVVJENzMAgBfvGXSng-", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "Faaaii", "published": "2017-12-07T11:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Making the wall regenerate passively or being healed actively sounds interesting to me", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:20.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c89a29e39cd2c5c176b2aa52e050b497456c680", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacxFV2iQfJlPhzT75tBHj0Qzjld7cHm9VnEBBQHW5LDa1XjyAMBL01Mi6xbDO6OxCUxAS64YEsu8c-", "site_full": "www.nairaland.com", "site": "nairaland.com", "site_section": "http://www.nairaland.com/jobs", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Jobs/Vacancies - Nigeria - Nairaland", "title": "Graduate Trainee Recruitment At DKT International", "title_full": "Graduate Trainee Recruitment At DKT International - Jobs/Vacancies - Nigeria", "published": "2017-11-15T12:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 951, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "07568be341157cc946e6d3a8d0d7a935ffdc493f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacxFV2iQfJlPhzT75tBHj0Qzjld7cHm9VnEBBQHW5LDa1XjyAMBL01Mi6xbDO6OxCU7zQRxNvUmK5QFFN1sCKMIvQG7ETeVW2P", "ord_in_thread": 19, "author": "eduresearch", "published": "2017-12-04T08:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "eduresearch :\nDKT International is a social marketing organization whose core mission is the provision of safe and affordable options for family planning and HIV prevention.

That sentiment varies with race, sex, and current party affiliation, but holds strong majorities in every demographic.\nThere\u2019s nothing particularly new here. In every presidential election, pluralities or majorities say they\u2019re \u201cwilling to vote for\u201d or \u201cinterested in seeing\u201d a third party candidate. In between, pluralities or majorities proclaim the \u201cneed\u201d for a third party.\nThat excites third party activists like me (I\u2019m a long-time Libertarian). But in election after election, the actual voting returns Republicans and Democrats to Congress and the White House.\nWhy? For part of the answer, consider pizza toppings.\nAccording to a 2011 Point of Sale survey by Brian Roemmele, pepperoni accounts for 36% of topping orders. That leaves 64% as a \u201cdifferent topping\u201d market which could presumably out-sell pepperoni.\nBut there\u2019s a problem: Customers don\u2019t agree on what that different topping should be. 14% order sausage, 11% prefer mushrooms, 8% just want cheese. Tomatoes, peppers, and anchovies account for 2% each. 64% of customers want something other than pepperoni on their pizzas. But they don\u2019t want the SAME something.\nThink of the Republicans and Democrats as the pepperoni of politics \u2014 and consider the fact that in politics, when a bunch of people put in their various orders (that is, vote in an election), only the pizza with the most popular topping actually gets made. Everyone else goes hungry.\nMany, maybe most, Americans want a third political party. But some of them want it to be a party of the left and some of the right, while still others want a centrist party or are obsessed with different sides of single issues (like abortion or guns or drugs).\nPlurality or majority support for a generic third party in principle is not the same thing as plurality or majority support for a specific third party in the voting booth.\nIn practice, most voters who say they want a third party end up voting Republican or Democrat, or just not voting. Why?\nPerhaps they can\u2019t find a third party they agree with any more than they agree with the Democrats or Republicans.\nOr maybe they find a third party they like, but fear-mongering supporters of the \u201clesser evil\u201d variety of pepperoni convince them that their preferred party can\u2019t win and that the \u201cgreater evil\u201d pepperoni type absolutely must be defeated.\nOr, as too often happens, the pepperoni lobby makes it difficult or impossible for the restaurant to even put anchovies on the menu. Er, that is, major party legislators pass \u201cballot access\u201d laws to exclude the option of voting for third party candidates.\nIs it impossible for third party candidates to win elections? No. They often do at the local level and occasionally for state legislature or Congress. But it\u2019s a tough row to hoe.\nFor a new party to consistently get into the winner\u2019s circle, voters are going to have to coalesce around something more specific than \u201csomething else.\u201d Hopefully, that something else will be freedom.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian roemmele", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nbc news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:21.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d58a061939a85e9374f7af6939116438c7002cbd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSskW.GkDTkF0_14Cy4mijvx7AglJtEw59iEMGs7C5O63ziBNg6dbvLoq_094GaU5fk4jtdWbmtJluOAF7vDcSDgmOmbtcr4vqTbVwc6adxoyzR2npdsc0JlSwodoDjfLZJRUw7DwFIansuRj_VIzx4oq5ii7H2nphXFPO.xOIlS5wtbULluOJ.", "site_full": "motivationfortheday.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://motivationfortheday.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "He who walks in the middle of the road gets hit from both sides. -George P.
