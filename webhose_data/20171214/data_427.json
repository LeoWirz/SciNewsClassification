Saudi Prince buys Leonardo Da Vinci art piece, brings it to AD Louvre December 7, 2017 1:35 pm \nThe recent opening of the Louvre Abu Dhabi puts into perspective the nature of the GCC region as one moving towards a steadfast cultural openness and art appreciation. \nThat is the first universal museum in the Arab World reflecting the dialogue between cultures. \nWith such a great sense of openness, it is no surprise to witness the planned move to the museum of Salvator Mundi, a painting of Christ by Leonardo Da Vinci, which was recently sold for a record of $450 million (AED1.6 billion). \nCheck this:   \nThe New York Times identified the buyer as Saudi Arabia\u2019s Prince Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan Al Saud, and it was said that he had no history as a major art collector. \nWe might be witnessing the birth of a trend to further invigorate art collection in a region that is already home to serious buyers and prominent art collectors. \nArt collection in the ME \nArt Advisor Edward Gibbs said that the region had relatively young collectors, a segment that auction houses were trying to appeal to. \nGibbs is also Sotheby\u2019s Chairman in the Middle East and India, a British multinational and one of the world\u2019s largest brokers of fine and decorative art, jewelry, real estate and collectibles. \nSotheby\u2019s Dubai launched its first auction named Boundless: Dubai last November. \nRead: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman\u2019s top 7 achievements to date \nThe auction featured an eclectic mix of art, from ceramics by Pablo Picasso to drawings and letters by Khalil Gibran, with estimated prices ranging from $1,000 to $300,000. \nThe inaugural auction raked in $3.6 million from participants spanning 33 countries. The auction had a sell through a rate of 80 per cent, with 30 per cent of bids coming from the UAE. \nGibb notes that the first auction comes after growing interest from art collectors in the Middle East. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve been selling Middle East and contemporary art in London over many years, we\u2019ve built an international platform there,\u201d says Gibbs. \u201cBut talking to our clients we felt there was also a desire here particularly among UAE clients to have a sale in Dubai.\u201d \nSotheby\u2019s has enjoyed an 84 per cent increase in UAE auction participants in its global sales in the past five years. Middle East participants increased 76 per cent in the same time period. \nDid you know that there were prominent art collectors in the region? \nDon\u2019t miss: A Fintech spinoff looks to change the way we bank and eat \nProminent art collectors in the region \nGlobal Citizen, a guide to luxury living craftsmanship, design, art and culture, identified major collectors in the region. \nRamin Salsali: An Iranian expatriate and a Dubai-based property developer, who opened the Salsali Private Museum in 2011 in Al Quoz before it became a magnet for art lovers. The museum showcases his collection of more than 800 contemporary works by Middle Eastern artists. \nBasel Dalloul: He is based in Cairo and the Chairman and Chief Executive of Noor Group, a telecom and computer technology firm operating in 135 countries across the globe.

Based in Kuwait, he is the founder of the Contemporary Art Platform (CAP), a non-profit organisation. \nTony Salame : As a Lebanese retail mogul, Tony Salame has promoted arts through his fashion franchise and even blended art and fashion further by opening the Aishti Foundation, a museum in Beirut exhibiting his massive private collection.

So how difficult is it for the average American? How will Meghan Markle become a British citizen? \nFreddie O'Farrell and his American partner Bethany Birdsall are right at the start of the process and applied for a fianc\u00e9e visa just as news of Prince Harry and Ms Markle's engagement broke. It is complicated, they say, and already proving stressful. \nMiss Birdsall is at home in Minnesota while the application is processed. Image copyright Freddie O'Farrell Image caption Freddie O'Farrell and his American partner Bethany Birdsall have just begun the process of securing a fianc\u00e9e visa \nMr O'Farrell, 24, said she is \"killing time\" until she comes back to the UK, where she will not be able to work while holding the fianc\u00e9e visa, waiting instead until she has a marriage visa. \nIt has put extra pressure on their finances - around \u00a33,000 needed for visas and legal fees. \n\"Because we have no dependants, we are quite a simple case,\" he said. \"But even for us we are looking at spending a lot of money and being apart for three or four months. \n\"It's definitely a strain on any relationship, but it's much harder for her because she can't work when she gets here, so it's a lot of waiting around.\" \nMs Birdsall has previously worked with children of undocumented migrants in Chicago and, when she is legally allowed to work, wants to do a similar job in the UK. \nMr O'Farrell added: \"Frankly, the system is very difficult to navigate, prohibitively expensive - though I imagine that is probably on purpose - and very slow.\" \nA Home Office spokesman said the fees charged, to apply for citizenship for example , are \"key\" to the government's aim to make the system fully-funded by those who use it and \"reduce the burden on the UK taxpayer\". 'Confusing and frustrating' system \nAmerican writer Jessica Pan, from Texas, recognises Ms Birdsall's fledgling struggles as part of a \"confusing and frustrating\" system that she says is constantly changing. \nShe moved to London to be with her now-husband following a period working in China and dating long-distance. \nShe originally planned to apply as a skilled migrant. \n\"I had a Master's degree and made enough money in China to qualify for it. I planned my life around this,\" she remembers. \nBut rule changes threw this plan into chaos; suddenly her Chinese salary no longer met the new requirements. \nAs a result, she applied for a fianc\u00e9e visa and moved to London in 2012. \n\"People plan their entire lives around these rules that change at the drop of a hat,\" she said. \nThis instability drove Mrs Pan to apply for citizenship as she \"wanted to see an end to that constant feeling of the unknown\". \n\"I couldn't bear thinking I might suddenly have to pay an exorbitant amount of money to stay in the UK and live my life here with my husband or be kicked out,\" she said. Image copyright Karen Marshall Image caption Mrs Marshall with her two sons Kenny and Jeff and British husband, Ian \nAs part of proving their eligibility, Americans must take the Life in the UK test - based on an accompanying textbook - but are exempt from the English language examination . \nThe 45 minute test costs \u00a350 and contains 24 questions, with a 75% pass threshold. Those who fail must wait seven days to resit. \nKaren Marshall, 61, who became a British citizen in 2013 after living in the UK and being married to a Briton since 1986, described the intricacies of the test as \"a challenge from start to finish\". \nShe failed her first attempt, not over the test itself, but rather a mistake in the paperwork. \n\"I accidently ticked biometric residential permit on the online form, not realising the difference between my normal residential permit,\" she said. \n\"Despite taking my passport and permit to the assessment centre, I was barred from taking the test as it did not match the online form. \n\"This really annoyed me as I had to pay and re-sit a week later.\" \nMrs Marshall, a retired piano teacher, also found the questions \"somewhat ambiguous\". \n\"One asked 'which group is better off now than in the 1920s?'. I think they wanted the answer to be women, but everyone now is better off now than in the 1920s,\" she added. \nApplicants can request for their test to be remarked and will be given feedback on the number of questions answered incorrectly across each area, although they do not find out exactly which questions they got wrong. \nBeyond the test, the practical challenge of collating all the paperwork is another difficulty for applicants, who must provide detailed travel information in and out of the UK over the past five years. 'People take me more seriously' \nBut despite the struggles, Americans see many advantages gained. \nFor Mrs Marshall the \"fantastic\" NHS proved a key factor. \n\"I have lived with both systems and, believe me, the people in the UK have it made as far as health care goes,\" she said. \nThere are also political and travel motivations, although the Brexit vote will remove a key current benefit - freedom of movement around the EU. \nMrs Pan feels she is \"taken more seriously,\" through her new-found status, especially after gaining the right to vote. \n\"I became eligible right before the EU Referendum. It was important to me that I got to have a say and vote Remain.\" \nBut despite the result, Mrs Pan says the greatest strength of citizenship is \"knowing you have a say\".

The countries included in this report are Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia, The Philippines, Malaysia, Laos, and Myanmar.The report uses regional and country focused analysis to explore inbound tourist markets, infrastructure and attractions, as well as risks and opportunities. The report provides clear insight into current and future tourism developments in the region.The ASEAN welcomed over 110 million international arrivals in 2017. The ASEAN Tourism Strategic Plan 2016-2025 aims to create a unique and diverse tourism offering across the region, with the agreement to create a more collaborative tourism strategy. The regions tourist industry has experienced substantial growth in recent years, which has brought a number of benefits including jobs and incomes. However, there are a number of issues which need to be addressed if growth is to be sustained.Scope- Thailand is the ASEANs leading tourist destination, welcoming 31% of total arrivals to region in 2017. However, Myanmar is the fastest growing destination, experiencing 211% growth in arrivals between 2009 and 2017. - A key goal of the ASEAN Tourism Strategic Plan 2016-2025 is to promote the ASEAN as a single tourist destination. By moving towards a collaborative tourist strategy, the region will benefit from arrivals being less concentrated in a few countries and therefore growth in the future can be more easily sustained. However, there currently remain a number of barriers which make moving towards a more singular market difficult. - International tourists most commonly travel to the region for leisure purposes. For example, leisure trips comprised over 80% of international arrivals to Thailand in 2017.Reasons to buy- This report provides clear and detailed insight into new developments in a fast growing tourist destination. - The report uses data and analysis to explore future trends related to international arrivals, airlines, and hotel developments. - The reader gains a strong understanding of the opportunities in the market, as well as the risks, to support better business decisions.Browse Full Report with TOC: www.marketresearchhub.com/report/tourism-destination-mark...

[ Re: SteveM ] Joined: Jan 2017\nPosts: 218 TR7RVMan\n TR7RVMan\n Jan 2017\nPosts: 218\nPleasant Hill, California USA Hi Steve, I like long rides. 60 miles is my coffee run. Lunch run 150-200. A good all day ride 300-350 miles. 300 mile day on my '73 TR7RV, no problem.\nCross the USA is about 3000 miles. That's a long way on a bike seat. You want to do many practice rides to condition your body & prove your bike.\n2 questions. First for comfort I find the T140 type bike to be a little better. To my butt the seat is more comfortable & the high US type bars tend to be easier on my back. I don't use windshield, but that really reduces fatigue. I find wearing ear plugs really reduces fatigue also. Cuts wind & bike noise. I like the cheap rollup soft foam type. The seat is a killer for many on long rides. There are various seat pads available that seem to really help especially if your padding is not enough. They just strap on over the normal seat.\nRegarding reliability all the unit motors are similar in construction so no huge advantage. Even preunit motor is similar in concept & from what I observe on club rides is about the same it reliability.\nAs Hawaiian Tiger says it's the build quality that counts. His best bike was made of used parts. Good used parts are good & work good. However, again the build quality is everything. Build quality is not just installing new parts, but how the parts are installed. This goes from end to end on the whole bike. Some new parts are junk. Every part must be examined on its own merit used or new.\nIf I may I'll state some observations on reliability. First, will this be a supported ride with a parts truck that has spares, oil, & can haul your bike in case of break down. If yes that's easy.\nRemember parts will often need to be ordered when you're on the road. You'll have to carry all your tools.\nIf no you are 100% on your own. I've traveled much in this land & even today many (most) remote areas & many canyons have no cell phone service. Fuel stops can be a good 100+ miles apart. Then they may be closed or have a power failure & can't pump gas. I recently ran into that, then a 50 mile detour with no gas. I was sweating it, but was ok.\nFirst thing I see is parts falling off bike on the road. Various fasteners came loose. Lock nuts & Loctite can pretty much prevent that as well as proper tightening. No telling what might fall off.\nNext is electrical issues that cause not spark. Almost always looking at bike the wiring is substandard. Frayed/cracked insulation, loose connections. Connector nuts coming loose like on points, coil, battery connections. Many times fuse holder problems. Very often bike works ok in dry, but in rain or wet fog bike starts running poorly. Again poor connections & when wet get too bad to work. Also water in points housing is often found. Short circuits where wire chafes through insulation & blows fuse. That is fairly common. Most of this is 100% avoidable by examining every last inch of wire & all the connectors on entire machine.\nBroken cables is seen. Most often the clutch cable end pulls off unexpectedly. This had been my bikes only failing. Pulled end off of 4 cables. Barnett cable has been only one to last with the swaged steel ends. I still am gun shy, so carry a spare.\nOverall carb issues are few. Most I see are carb flooding out tickler hole continuously. Almost always removing needle & flowing fuel flushes out the dirt & all is well. Examining bowl often shows tiny rust particles. Tank often has rust. A real fuel filter, not just the screens can reduce this a great deal. Of course a clean tank is a must.\nRegarding carb drains, the later Concentric bowl with drain is what I'd call a must. It's almost impossible to ride across country & not encounter rain. While I don't see water actually entering carb while riding I've seen it get wet parked in heavy rain. The drain allows one to drain out any water & loose dirt. I've ridden in rain many times & many miles. Seen lots of water in carb, again can't say how it got there. Maybe even through gas cap hole? My tank had light rust & caused me carb problems.\nThe large gas tank on some of the Tigers is very helpful when fuel stations are hard to come by. To my ears I think the wider tank deflects some engine clatter noise also.\nThe later trans cover with the oil filler plug allows very easy access for clutch cable.\nThe 1970 & later primary breather makes the oil level in primary self leveling so you never have to worry about primary oil level. Not a big deal, but saves some time & hassle.\nOil filter is a good idea on the long haul. Personally I'd ride 3000 miles across country without oil change using filter & synthetic oil.\nElectronic ignition or points is an issue only you can decide. Well serviced points will go 3000 miles no problem. Electronic needs no service. You can start & ride bike with dead battery with points, not with EI. So it's a personal choice.\nRegarding 1 or 2 carbs. I've serviced many Bonnies & Tigers. When I needed a commuter bike I bought a Tiger due to servicing was a little easier. A little easier to access intake adjusters, no carb syncing. I don't think 2 carbs actually make the bike less reliable. Just a little more to work on.\nRear chain wear can be an issue. You need to find a chain lube that actually reduces wear. I can't figure that one myself. This chain I've been using 85w GL5 differential fluid. A big mess, but seems to wear well. I'd like to do better though with less mess.\nFor sure I'd ride a vintage Triumph across USA. On a well prepared bike I'd expect to do the trip without a single break down. 60-65 mph is no problem on these bikes. I like 20t front sprocket. When temps get near 100f ping can be a problem. Never lug the motor, keep it spinning freely, even if you have to ride at 55mph all day in 3rd. West bound highway 10 in California with a 35 mph head wind comes to mind. Vicious!\nMy personal choice would be the 1970 Tiger, especially an early production with the plunger for shift cam, for the reasons I stated. But again all these bikes are very good well prepared.\nDon\n1973 Tiger 750 #717636 - 12/04/17 6:00 am Re: If you wanted to cross the country (USA)...

The bike is a great machine but just not big enough physically or in terms of torque or power. Headwinds, bad weather, hot days are tough on the little motor. Ted Simon must have been more aerodynamic than me....\nBest advice I can offer is go with what you will enjoy riding. It's your trip.\nAlso, ride your chosen steed as a commuter every day in fair weather or foul for a few months before you set sail. That will tell you what is going to cause you trouble on the road. I carry some minor spares, puncture kit and small tools. Anything I can't fix gets the credit card thrown at it. I'm not rich, but I'm not prepared to carry extra gear for the sake of it.\nI'm chasing a Norton at the moment for this very purpose. If I can't get one it'll be a 5 speed Triumph twin. Single carb incidentally...\nGinge\n#717659 - 12/04/17 1:23 pm Re: If you wanted to cross the country (USA)...

After a few days in Morocco we started the return trip, choosing to go over to the Algarve and up through Portugal. From that moment it was rain pretty much all day, every day - horrible! For the 1st time we took to staying in rooms, otherwise we'd have died of wet rot. We were well into November by now.\nWhen we got about half way up Portugal, my mate said he'd had enough and suggested we dump the bikes and fly back. I didn't care to throw my bike away and he gallantly wouldn't desert me, so we compromised and caught the ferry from Santander to Plymouth, rather than go up through France, saving about 400 continental miles in exchange for 150 very cold and still wet miles back to the IoW.\nI stuck a few pics in this onedrive folder:\nhttps://1drv.ms/f/s!AoiOPRO1kWdxgRj44bhGWeeZiQ0r\nI'm the hairy one, someone pls let me know if you can see them as it's the 1st time I've played with onedrive.\n#717690 - 12/04/17 5:13 pm Re: If you wanted to cross the country (USA)...
