The new figure is higher than the $94-$95 per tonne premium PREM-ALUM-JP in the current quarter, and the increase is the first in three quarters. Japan is Asia\u2019s biggest importer of aluminium and the premiums for primary metal shipments it agrees to pay each quarter over the London Metal Exchange cash price set the benchmark for the region. One of the major buyers reached the deal with two producers while another buyer struck an agreement with a single seller, according to the sources. \u201cWe\u2019ve done the deal at $103 a tonne with one of the sellers as we believed the figure represented the current market situation,\u201d said one of the sources who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. They are still negotiating with other global suppliers while many other Japanese buyers are in talks with all of the producers, with further deals expected later this month. The latest quarterly pricing negotiations began late last month between Japanese buyers and global producers, including Alcoa Corp, Rio Tinto , South32 Ltd and Rusal, with initial offers ranging between $110 and $118 a tonne. But buyers have sought lower prices at around $96-$105 a tonne, forcing some producers to compromise, the sources said.

LONDONDERRY \u2014 A $129 million high-voltage transmision line will bring lower energy costs and better reliability of keeping the lights on, according to Eversource\u2019s New Hampshire president.\u201cWhen we have big storms and we have interruptions across our system, if we have a flexible system, if we have transmission capacity, it allows us to move power around to restore customers,\u201d Bill Quinlan told local officials and project workers Wednesday. \u201cIt also allows us to lower energy costs by getting power from the low-cost generation to our customers.\u201dQuinlan delivered the remarks in an enclosed farm stand at Elwood Orchards in the shadow of the transmission line that joined other lines in an existing right of way next door. The 24.5-mile line, which is scheduled to go into service around Dec. 20, runs from Londonderry to Tewksbury, Mass., and is a partnership between Eversource and National Grid, which estimated the project cost lower, at $123 million.Electric customers from all six states will pay for the reliability project, which was approved by the manager of the regional power grid, ISO New England. New Hampshire uses about 10 percent of New England\u2019s overall electricity usage, so Granite Staters will pay that percentage of the project pricetag.The project will deliver around $1.5 million in new property taxes yearly.Hudson and Londonderry, the two towns where Eversource\u2019s portion of the line will run through, will reap more than $500,000 combined annually, Quinlan said.National Grid said the line in its territory will furnish $140,000 more a year to Hudson, $571,700 additional to Pelham and $235,000 more to Windham.Quinlan said the line was more than a decade in the making.Londonderry Town Manager Kevin Smith said energy is a top concern of business owners.\u201cThe amazing amount of commercial and industrial growth we\u2019ve seen in Londonderry in particular would not be possible with out the reliability and capacity of energy that Eversource provides, and we have a lot of industry here in Londonderry,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHaving reliability and capacity for energy in the future is a huge concern of all of these businesses.\u201dQuinlan said Eversource at any one time had 250 or more construction workers on the project, including many Granite Staters.National Grid\u2019s portion of the line runs through Pelham, Windham and a section of Hudson.\u201cThis project was specifically designed to use existing transmission corridors to minimize impacts on the host communities and project neighbors and to be cost-effective while enhancing long-term grid reliability,\u201d said National Grid spokesperson Jackie Barry. Matthew Kakley with ISO New England said it doesn\u2019t comment on specific projects.\u201cHowever, from 2002 through October, 746 transmission projects to address reliability needs were put into service in the six New England states,\u201d he said.The New Hampshire side cost $72 million, including $37 million by Eversource, said Eversource spokesman Kaitlyn Woods.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bill quinlan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "windham.quinlan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quinlan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackie barry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaitlyn woods", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eversource", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew kakley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "quinlan said.national grid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elwood orchards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iso new england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eversource\u2019s new hampshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eversource", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merrimack valley reliability project", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mass.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tewksbury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "londonderry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "windham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iso new england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new hampshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hudson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pelham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eversource", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "londonderry", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:28.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "04b33a85ac37009a90e8c9420b55aa434aeec1b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jd9_OlvDo_Fcybv.eS8odq8dBYmFBlFPaZDIuuz37VZkitp3RrsEaObw8xI6oh0xzgJKH9Bd9iY42ah3.bgm.sM6cww4zXgKE8-", "site_full": "cassiascarano.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://cassiascarano.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "O Lado de C\u00e1", "title": "Como descascar kiwi com colher", "title_full": "Como descascar kiwi com colher", "published": "2017-12-07T11:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "BR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "04b33a85ac37009a90e8c9420b55aa434aeec1b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jd9_OlvDo_Fcybv.eS8odq8dBYmFBlFPaZDIuuz37VZkitp3RrsEaObw8xI6oh0xzgJKH9Bd9iY42ah3.bgm.sM6cww4zXgKE8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cassia Scarano (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:56:00.000+02:00", "title": "Como descascar kiwi com colher", "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFontes: pinterest https://www.facebook.com/PortalAmoReceitas \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fontes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:28.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c7e058cd7fa9d48660755ca7c0376ddbbd74650e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8QCcCcruEEqLPUQAOuYeiFfOUhzALDjm9RCeygiwzerz2GxMAp36maGw8jhHZlMSY8mTEJlTuiE5B3GwnPk4uKHJSskagngB0-", "site_full": "www.fow24news.com", "site": "fow24news.com", "site_section": "http://www.fow24news.com/", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "FOW 24 NEWS", "title": "Bro.

Joshua Iginla, has joined his voice to the widespread condemnation \ngreeting the alleged killings of migrants and human trafficking going on in the country, describing it as man's wickedness against another. \nSpeaking at his church service last Sunday in Abuja, the revered man of God also decried the desperation of Nigerian nationals and other Africans to seek greener pastures abroad, revealing that there was no machine out there that guaranteed instant prosperity once they land abroad. \nRecall, last month, the popular Cable News Network (CNN) brought into our living rooms a video clip of black migrants being sold in night markets in Libya. It showed migrants auctioned off for as little as four hundred dollars. \n\u201cI have never seen this level of heartlessness, wickedness from one human being to another. I saw how young ladies were molested and I begin to wonder if the people doing these are human beings. \n\u201cThat is why in this ministry, we are doing our best to assist. It is really wicked to see how people price human beings like food. I pray that the government of the day will take cogent steps because there are a lot of poor brothers out there in pains. \n\u201cPlease, like I always say to Nigerian youths, don\u2019t be too desperate to relocate abroad that you now travel through desert. Let me tell you, what you are going through here is better than what people are going through out there\u201d \nBro Iginla said he once nursed the idea of joining the bandwagon of fortune seekers abroad but God held him back. According to him, \u201cI said to myself that all the days of my life will I wait until my change comes before God lifted me up. I had taken that decision before to travel out by all means but God said to me that I should relax and that he would take me abroad as a glorified wealthy person just to add colour to what is there and that is what God has done for me.\u201d \nHe said through the prayers of the faithful, and by the grace of God, those who are in this act of slavery business will be exposed by Heaven, and if they refuse to repent, death will visit them. He also declared that fellow Nigerians involved in the human trafficking business as if they were selling eggs, deceiving people into their wickedness, God would also expose and bring them to judgment if they refuse to repent. \nThe televangelist cum philanthropist advised Nigerian youths not to be in a hurry to travel abroad. \u201cIf you go abroad, you will labour, in fact, you will work harder than when you are in Nigeria. Our people who are there can testify to what I am saying. \n\u201cNigerian laws are more human-friendly than those of other countries. I have never seen a law like Nigeria that is so friendly to the citizens unlike the foreign countries. \n\u201cMy brethren, we are crying every day that Nigeria is bad; no, Nigeria is a good, blessed country and it will prosper.\u201d \nHe opined that where most people miss it is that they wait on the government for everything, adding that the best way to survive in Nigeria for now is entrepreneurship. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for the government because in the next 30 years, they will continue to promise, create your Jerusalem yourself. \n\u201cPlease don\u2019t be in a hurry to travel out, let\u2019s join hands together in prayers to make Nigeria better.\u201d?

(KIMBERLEY HAAS/Union Leader Correspondent) ROCHESTER -- There\u2019s a gaping hole and part of the 350-year-old home she grew up in is in ruins, but Irene Turner says she\u2019s just grateful that her beloved dog wasn\u2019t killed when the pickup truck crashed into the house early Wednesday. Turner, 72, who lives on the corner of Lowell Street and Tebbetts Road in rural Rochester, said 9-year-old Abbey usually sleeps in the patio area that was destroyed when the GMC 2500 hit the house. The patio and newly redone (and only) bathroom were destroyed. Turner said she decided to bring Abbey inside as she went to bed Tuesday night. She\u2019d heard news reports predicting thunderstorms and the dog does not like thunder and lightning, she said. \u201cSomething told me not to leave her out there for some reason,\u201d Turner said. At about midnight, Turner woke up when she heard a boom. Brad Locke, a neighbor and a relative, also heard the crash. As neighbors and police arrived, the occupants of the truck were nowhere to be seen. Police were working Wednesday to determine who was driving it. According to Rochester police Capt. Jason Thomas, officers have spoken with owners of the Sanbornville contracting company whose phone number was painted on the tailgate of the truck. Thomas said police believe the truck had been sold to someone else, and the contractor was not involved. Thomas said he could not disclose whether there was evidence of alcohol or drug use inside the truck because the investigation is continuing. Turner said this isn\u2019t the first time someone has crashed into her home; another driver plowed into the home in 2004. Hannah Dowaliby, Turner\u2019s 20-year-old granddaughter, arrived at the scene soon after the crash and was at the house again Wednesday.\u201cI was just like, \u2018Here we go again,\u2019\u201d Dowaliby said. Turner said she grew up in the historic home and now lives there with her husband, Floyd, 77, and three other dogs. All of the dogs are 9 or 10 years old.

Last Thursday, he met with the MSU team for the first time, had the customary ring of the cowbell at his introductory press conference and immediately went to work. One glance at Moorhead\u2019s Twitter timeline proves he hasn\u2019t wasted time in the early days of his MSU tenure. There are multiple pictures of Moorhead alongside Bulldog recruits. There are retweets of the coaching staff hires he has already made. There\u2019s even a retweet of a promotional picture urging State fans to buy their tickets for the upcoming TaxSlayer Bowl. It\u2019s becoming readily apparent just seven days into the Moorhead era that it\u2019s highly unlikely he\u2019ll ever be outworked. \u201cYou don\u2019t build your reputation on what you\u2019re going to do,\u201d Moorhead said last week, quoting Henry Ford. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure that we understand that we don\u2019t get what we wish for. We get what we work for.\u201d Moorhead has practiced what he\u2019s preached in the days since his hire. He has already officially gotten a pair of assistants. He picked Charles Huff his assistant head coach/running game coordinator/running backs coach. Huff worked alongside Moorhead the last two seasons as Moorhead served as the offensive coordinator at Penn State. On Wednesday, MSU officially announced Moorhead\u2019s hire of Fordham head coach Andrew Breiner to be State\u2019s pass game coordinator and quarterbacks coach. Breiner and Moorhead have known each other for years and perhaps no one better understands Moorhead\u2019s offense than Breiner. \nMore hires are soon to come. \n\u201cI\u2019m looking for guys with intelligence, loyalty and a great work ethic who will be great mentors to (the players in) our program and give them the tools to be successful in the classroom, on the field and in the community,\u201d Moorhead said. \nPerhaps the most anticipated hire Moorhead has to make hasn\u2019t yet happened. Moorhead, well-regarded as an offensive mastermind, will call MSU\u2019s offensive plays and serve as the de facto offensive coordinator, but Moorhead hasn\u2019t yet hired a defensive coordinator. \nHe said last week that it\u2019s not for a lack of options. He\u2019s simply covering all of his bases. \n\u201cIn terms of the timetable of hiring staff, I could make 10 calls right now and have a staff filled,\u201d Moorhead said. \u201cI want to measure twice and cut once and make sure that we\u2019re not just hiring for the sake of getting this thing filled up. We want to make sure that we\u2019re getting the right people in here to give us the opportunity to be successful in the long term.\u201d \nIt\u2019s a safe bet that Moorhead is hard at work to find the man who\u2019ll serve as his defensive coordinator and the rest of the men who\u2019ll fill out his coaching staff. Working hard is just what Moorhead does. \nMoorhead attributes much of that to his father. Moorhead\u2019s dad worked for 35 years in a steel mill. \n\u201cHe worked three jobs to put two kids through college,\u201d Moorhead said of his father. \u201cI really think in terms of my formation as a person and what I stand for was that understanding of what a blue-collar worker meant. It didn\u2019t matter how cold it was. It didn\u2019t matter how warm it was, how early in the morning or late at night. He got up every day and went to work.\u201d \nMSU Director of Athletics John Cohen said Moorhead\u2019s ingrained work ethic was one of the qualities that made Moorhead an attractive head coaching candidate. \n\u201cWe were looking for someone who had a blue-collar attitude, but an intellectual personality at the same time,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cJoe fits both of those bills.\u201d \nOne week into things, Moorhead is proving all that chatter about hard work isn\u2019t just talk. He continues to work the recruiting trail ahead of the NCAA early singing period which will last for 72 hours starting on Dec. 20. Moorhead also continues to assemble the staff that will assist him as he guides the Bulldogs forward. \nThe jury is still out on exactly how well Moorhead and his new staff will do at MSU. There are high expectations, but Moorhead\u2019s success or lack thereof will ultimately be determined on the field. \nThere does seem to be one certainty though. It\u2019s going to be hard for any other team or coach to outwork Joe Moorhead and the Bulldogs. \n\u201cWe\u2019re going to finish everything we do,\u201d Moorhead said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight tooth and nail. We\u2019re going to scratch and claw. We\u2019re going to make sure everybody understands that when you step on the field with the Mississippi State Bulldogs, you\u2019re in for a 15-round fight and we\u2019re not stopping until the bell rings.\u201d Category:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "moorhead", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cohen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles huff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "breiner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew breiner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "henry ford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john cohen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe moorhead", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huff", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "msu home", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "msu moorhead", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ncaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penn state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bulldogs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mississippi state bulldogs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fordham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mississippi state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "msu", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "starkville", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:28.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "727ffbe5506f5ddc7324545ec153b743b1776632", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.uSBWMUrwxL4eega2HEd7_TdUmqIqDv501lG9X0p8TLEfOAHZ9GzbbvTHkSMKxKa5ZS_nilKdwA4dtkXl5fic4aa3CMoPKDrl9ixjCjZYN5IYtgKx6ZbwF", "site_full": "www.wlox.com", "site": "wlox.com", "site_section": "http://www.wlox.com/Global/category.asp?C=13537&nav=DYFw&clienttype=rss", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "WLOX - Business - Headline", "title": "Global shares mostly calm as investors focus on US tax, jobs", "title_full": "Global shares mostly calm as investors focus on US tax, jobs", "published": "2017-12-07T09:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://images.worldnow.com/AP/images/15576147_G.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82674, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "727ffbe5506f5ddc7324545ec153b743b1776632", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.uSBWMUrwxL4eega2HEd7_TdUmqIqDv501lG9X0p8TLEfOAHZ9GzbbvTHkSMKxKa5ZS_nilKdwA4dtkXl5fic4aa3CMoPKDrl9ixjCjZYN5IYtgKx6ZbwF", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Global shares mostly calm as investors focus on US tax, jobs", "text": "Global shares mostly calm as investors focus on US tax, jobs 2017-12-07T07:30:41Z 2017-12-07T09:50:54Z (AP Photo/Vincent Yu).

Germany's DAX gained 0.2 percent to 13,028.86. Futures augured flat opening on Wall Street. Dow futures remained unchanged while S&P futures added 0.1 percent. \nASIA'S DAY: Asia closed mixed. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.5 percent to 22,498.03 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.5 percent to 5,977.70. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index reversed earlier losses, adding 0.3 percent to 28,303.19.

(AP) - Columbus North swimmer Nick Green didn\u2019t quite understand how severe his condition was when he was diagnosed with osteochondritis dissecans right before his freshman season. \nMultiple doctors informed Green and his family that he could lose his ability to walk if he didn\u2019t treat the condition in a timely manner. \nSome bone in Green\u2019s right knee was dying and getting absorbed, which was creating a hole. Doctors told him that more would continue to break off if he didn\u2019t get it fixed. \n\u201cIt definitely took me by surprise,\u201d Green said. \u201cI don\u2019t really know the word for it. I was just shocked. I was very upset. I didn\u2019t think I was going to have my high school season, to be honest. But we found a doctor who said I could swim and have my high school season.\u201d \nGreen finished his freshman swim season before having his surgery in March. Doctors had to drill on the sides of his knee and insert screws to establish blood flow for his bone to grow. \nThe doctors took bone from his hip and partially filled the hole with bone plugs in hopes of having the rest of his bone grow back. Green received good news when a doctor told him at his most recent checkup that the bone was growing back. \nGreen\u2019s next check up is on Thursday, where doctors will check the progress and see if any screws in his knee have migrated. \nGreen, who has been swimming competitively since he was 6 years old, wasn\u2019t sure if the surgery would work, which put his entire swimming career in jeopardy. Fortunately for Green, he spent eight weeks on crutches, but was allowed back in the water just two weeks after the surgery. \nGreen eventually transitioned to a custom-fit unloader knee brace to help shift the weight from the healing portion of his leg. He participated in physical therapy once a week at the Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital for about four months. \nAlthough he could get back in the water, Green wasn\u2019t allowed to kick for six months. He put a pull buoy between his legs to prevent himself from kicking, which put a lot of strain on his upper body muscles. \nGreen had to push off with one leg for his flip-turns and did only upper body lifts in the weight room. He couldn\u2019t even carry weights around because he couldn\u2019t have any more than the weight of his back pack weighing down on him. Green spent almost an entire year not kicking his legs in the water. \n\u201cIt\u2019s just a long process, and it\u2019s still not over,\u201d Green said. \u201cThey said it\u2019s going to take up to two years to completely heal all the way because I guess bone grows back really slowly.\u201d \nGreen still is dealing with a lot of pain, but said he is happy he still gets to compete this year. He swims the 200- and 500-yard freestyle events for the Bull Frogs and is also hoping to get on relay teams this year. \nGreen is not yet able to do any impact activity like running, but his doctor informed him that moving his leg around in the pool can actually be good for his recovery. \nGreen is back to regular swimming workouts and competitions for his sophomore season. He isn\u2019t all the way back to where he was, but is slowly working on getting there. North coach Logan Schaefer said they both have been working on focusing on the things Green is able to do and do the best they can. \n\u201cI think once we start to move and progress overall to getting back to full swimming, I think those things that we could do are going to be some strengths as we build back into more of the kicking and those types of things that we couldn\u2019t do a whole lot of recently,\u201d Schaefer said. \nGreen already is getting close to the times he swam last season, which is a good sign of how his recovery is going. He has aspirations of gaining a college scholarship for swimming and said he is glad osteochondritis dissecans hasn\u2019t taken those opportunities away from him.

Shastri spoke about Dalits and untouchability at an event held in memory of BR Ambedkar on his death anniversary.\nBizay Sonkar Shastri claimed that, many of the 6,500 castes and 50,000 sub-castes in India did not exist until the 12th century.\n\"In his (Ambedkar's) book who were the Shudras? Ambedkar said Dalits of the era are not the shudras of the vedic era and that they have no association with Shudras. Today we see many people saying that in Hindu religion, Shudras were treated poorly,\" Shastri said.\nDuring his speech, Shastri emphasised on the existence and roots of Dalits.\n\"Ambedkar is an authority on this issue. If he has said that present day Dalits are not Shudras, then they are not. We should try and figure out who they are; there should be research on this,\" Shastri said.\nHe said that Ambedkar had Quote: d professor MA Sherring of the Oxford University who said today's Dalits were most probably Brahmins and Kshatriyas during an earlier period.\n\"Everybody knows that Ambedkar burnt the Manusmriti but do people know that he also gave a written clean chit to Manu? In his book The Untouchables, he wrote that there was no untouchability in the Manu era,\" said Shastri.\n#FYI Varna as per Lord Krishna\nIn the Bhagwat Gita, Lord Krishna elaborates on why he created the four 'varnas'. The 'varna', according to him, was not determined by birth but deeds. For instance, a shudra, considered to be the lowest sect out of the four varnas these days, could become a brahmin if he attains certain characters such as concentration, innocence, contemplation and ability to hear God's voice.\nThe BJP leader has been talking about the roots of Dalits since a long time. In an interview with The Hindu in 2015, he said, \"Dalits were upper castes.\"\nHere's a copy of his 2015 interview:\nPhoto: Bharatkalyan97 (blog)\nRajinder Kashyap, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Law and Justice, however, disagreed with him.\n\"Manu codified the system which was in place for long before him in which there was graded inequality. To say that untouchability and caste system came into practice in the 11th century will perhaps not be the truth,\" he said.\nWith inputs from PTI", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bizay sonkar shastri", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bizay", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ma sherring", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neha vashishth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ambedkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajinder kashyap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shastri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sonkar shastri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oxford university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of law and justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jawaharlal nehru university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india today", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "br ambedkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kshatriyas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:29.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4d575cd6d889ffedeab59c439ffcd97e0f180a62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_yRPOivCwx7u6ANA18C396L", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/x/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/x/ - Paranormal - 4chan", "title": "Suppressed Human History Movie", "title_full": "/x/ - Suppressed Human History Movie - Paranormal - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-06T08:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 21, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e9f73301ddeebb418979d8eccfddd299affc4762", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_yRPOivCwx7u0s09y7vyad25SqyP6Su0XI-", "ord_in_thread": 17, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T04:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>19998444\nChecked", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:29.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4d575cd6d889ffedeab59c439ffcd97e0f180a62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_yRPOivCwx7u6ANA18C396L", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/x/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/x/ - Paranormal - 4chan", "title": "Suppressed Human History Movie", "title_full": "/x/ - Suppressed Human History Movie - Paranormal - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-06T08:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 21, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "873f4c6695e41e98941ef662807e5ac2d6ca4cfe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_yRPOivCwx7u7Tn4usYrs_Jl3Df4SM2QTM-", "ord_in_thread": 11, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-06T12:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>19996785\nThey don't know what they have now either.\nI understand how it appears harsh from their perspective.

Stocks in Southeast Asia were mixed. \nANALYST'S VIEW: \"Asia equity investors found themselves standing in a sea of pain at yesterday's market close and are likely breathing a sigh of relief that both EU and U.S. equity investors appear a bit more level-headed for the time being,\" said Stephen Innes, head of trading at OANDA. \nTAX: The U.S. Senate voted to begin negotiation with the House to reconcile their two tax bills on Wednesday in a sign that they can iron out differences. Republican leaders are pushing to send a final blended package to President Donald Trump to sign before Christmas. \nGEOPOLITICAL ISSUES: Market reaction was muted to President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, ending decades of unwavering U.S. neutrality on the issue. In other global developments, the British and Irish prime ministers spoke, seeking to overcome a logjam in Brexit talks, but there was no sign of an imminent breakthrough. \nU.S. JOBS: A report from payroll processor ADP showed private employers added 190,000 jobs last month, slightly better than expected. The report comes two days before a government jobs report, among the last key economic indicators before the Federal Reserve's meeting next week. \nOIL: Benchmark U.S. crude recovered slightly. It added 7 cents to $56.13 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Wednesday, the contract sank $1.66 to settle at $55.96 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 29 cents to $61.51 per barrel. It lost $1.64 to $61.22 a barrel on Wednesday. \nCURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 112.66 Japanese yen from 112.27 yen while the euro weakened to $1.1790 from $1.1796.

(AP) - The Seminole Tribe of Florida is warning that an attempt by legislators to clear up the legal status of fantasy sports could result in the state losing millions in payments from the tribe. \nThe tribe runs several casinos in the state. This week the Seminoles sent a letter to top legislators regarding pending bills that would declare fantasy sports legal and not subject to regulation. A Senate committee is scheduled to take up one of the bills (SB 374) on Thursday. \nThe letter contends the legislation would violate the deal that allows the tribe to offer blackjack as well as slot machines at several locations. \nFlorida\u2019s attorney general in 1991 issued an opinion saying football fantasy leagues were a form of illegal gambling. But fantasy leagues have continued to expand since then.

Sinopec alleges it never received full payment for 45,000 tons of steel rebar it agreed to sell PDVSA for $43 million and which was delivered in 2013.\nThe lawsuit, while small in size, says PDVSA through its U.S. subsidiary Bariven reneged on repeated promises to pay Sinopec, at one point costing the Chinese company $2 million in losses after it entered into arbitration with a supplier it agreed to purchase the steel from to carry out the deal.\n\"This is not simply a case of a broken promise to pay,\" Sinopec said in the court documents, accusing PDVSA of \"deceit\" and \"willful deception\" in its refusal to pay its bills. \"Rather, this case involves a complex commercial transaction specifically calculated to leave Sinopec without a remedy.\"\nThe Chinese \"usually take a more diplomatic tone\" and are clearly angry, Russ Dallen, head of local brokerage Caracas Capital, wrote in a report Wednesday in which he revealed the existence of the lawsuit.\nThe dispute comes as Venezuela is seeking fresh financing to restructure its huge foreign debt on which it is behind payment.\nChina has been one of Venezuela's biggest creditors, providing it loans, cash and investment totaling more than $65 billion between 2007 and 2016, according to a database maintained by Boston University and the Inter-American Dialogue. But it has so far failed to come to President Nicolas Maduro's rescue as he tries to shield the OPEC nation from triple-digit inflation, fast-declining oil production and financial sanctions imposed by the Trump administration.\nA spokesman for Beijing-based Sinopec Group confirmed that a U.S. subsidiary of a Sinopec trading company had launched a lawsuit against PDVSA about \"a dispute over payment owed.\"\n\"As a big company, it is normal for us to have such commercial dispute and it is normal to resort to law if there is a dispute,\" Sinopec spokesman Lu Dapeng said by phone.\nGeng Shuang, a spokesman of China's Foreign Ministry, said the issue was nothing more than a regular commercial dispute and that China remains willing to cooperate with Venezuela on an equal and mutually beneficial basis.\n\"I think this is a common commercial dispute and there is no need to make over-interpretations of it,\" Geng said. \"I want to stress that China attaches great importance to the development of China Venezuela relations.\"\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAssociated Press researchers Yu Bing and Shanshan Wang in Beijing contributed to this report.\n  Chinese firm sues Venezuela as crisis tests ally's patience Southern     Gymnastics   Ex-cop sentenced to 20 years for killing of unarmed black man Keillor: Radio station fired me without full investigation Drivers open fire on each other in Houston street after road rage incident Some Senators avoid comparing Al Franken and Roy Moore   Trump   FBI still stumped over Border Patrol agent's death Police land helicopter, chase down suspect after being flashed with laser FBI director defends agency amid Trump criticism Pearl Harbor survivors to remember those killed Dangerous winds, snow come to the UK with Storm Caroline Melania Trump, Karen Pence visit Whataburger for their fast food fix Tillerson says Ukraine key sticking point in US-Russia ties Experts scramble to monitor long-dormant Iceland volcano Parents of suspected serial killer to face judge after their refusal to testify Palestinians, Israeli forces clash after Trump\u2019s Jerusalem decision Trump's Jerusalem decision could be dangerous, experts warn Powerful allies molded Trump's view on Jerusalem $450 million Leonardo painting headed to Louvre Abu Dhabi US fails to enforce smog rules, 14 states allege in lawsuit Jimmy Kimmel's son 'recovering well' after 2nd heart surgery 'Games of Thrones' not returning until 2019, Sophie Turner says Comedian releases novel inspired by his Irish roots Female high school quarterback throws TD on 1st pass in varsity game", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yu bing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russ dallen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geng shuang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lu dapeng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicolas maduro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shanshan wang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "boston university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sinopec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pdvsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sinopec group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foreign ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caracas capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "opec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "inter-american dialogue", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caracas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:30.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d332e8fbf06d8b93ee3f035bbcc8632707995d89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYyoODA_sG6MMGxFh26nSAvKpj5w8xLbBD.gyLOJ2223tS3ud5zrXRNVaTIIG3l6ZT4yLyFKKFv.vq7sPwyIuedxkU5Lo0fCm6", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.co.za", "site": "tripadvisor.co.za", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/ShowForum-g186591-i88-o40-Ireland.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Ireland Forum, Travel Discussion for Ireland -

(Meghan Pierce/Union Leader Correspondent) NEWPORT \u2014 The attorney for a Plainfield man accused of conspiring to have his ex-wife murdered says he is the victim of a plot.The claim came during opening arguments Wednesday in Sullivan County Superior Court at the trial of Maurice Temple, 63. He and his 83-year-old mother, Pauline Chase, both of Plainfield, were arrested July 27 and charged with conspiring to hire Mark Horne to kill Jean Temple, the ex-wife.Defense attorney Donna Brown said her client is the target of a plot, not the instigator of one.\u201cTwo people were behind the setup and those two people were Mark Horne and Jean Temple,\u201d Brown said.Mark Horne, a volunteer firefighter and friend of Jean Temple, went to authorities after a June 25 conversation with Chase in which he told police she offered to pay him to kill Jean Temple. This followed her son\u2019s arrest for non-payment of a court-ordered settlement of the couple\u2019s 1999 divorce.Horne agreed to wear a wire and record conversations with the mother and son. Prosecutors allege Chase later gave Horne a $5,000 down payment and wrote an IOU for another $5,000 if the job was completed.In court Wednesday, prosecutors argued the recordings show Temple\u2019s complicity. Brown contends the recordings show the opposite \u2014 that Temple never plotted to kill his ex-wife.Horne, Brown said, was in a years-long legal battle with Chase over a piece of property that resulted in Horne having to pay a mortgage each month to Chase on property he believed he already owned.The defense attorney said Horne also attributed the failure of a horse business to Temple, who had refused to allow riders\u2019 use of trails on the property.Two days after Temple\u2019s arrest for non-payment in June, Brown said, Horne and the ex-wife met up at a party at the fire department. There, Jean Temple informed Horne of her ex-husband\u2019s arrest for non-payment, Brown said in court Wednesday.\u201cMark Horne and Jean Temple were kindred spirits,\u201d Brown asserted. \u201cThey were kindred spirits in the dislike of my client, Mr. Temple.\u201dAfter leaving the party, Horne called Chase knowing she would be upset her son had been arrested, Brown said.\u201cHe knows how to push her buttons and he does,\u201d the attorney said. \u201cIt was the start of the setup.\u201dBrown said the recordings that prosecutors say prove Temple\u2019s guilt in fact demonstrate her client did not take the idea seriously and instead mocked Horne.\u201cHorne knows. Horne knows that Maurice Temple wants no part of it because he thinks it\u2019s a joke, thinks it\u2019s not real that some elderly shut-in woman is going to be part of some murder conspiracy,\u201d Brown said.Last month, Sullivan County Superior Court Judge Brian Tucker ruled Chase is mentally incompetent to stand trial and dismissed the indictment against her. He ordered Chase to remain in custody for a 90-day mental health evaluation to determine is she should receive \u201cinvoluntary treatment\u201d in a state psychiatric hospital.Temple is being held at the Sullivan House of Correction in Unity in lieu of $1 million cash bail. mpierce@newstote.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "meghan pierc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brown said.mark horne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian tucker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pauline chase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maurice temple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meghan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donna brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark horne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "temple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "horne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chase", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jean temple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maurice temple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "temple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sullivan county superior court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sullivan house of correction in unity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chase", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "plainfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean temple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newport", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:30.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4d575cd6d889ffedeab59c439ffcd97e0f180a62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_yRPOivCwx7u6ANA18C396L", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/x/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/x/ - Paranormal - 4chan", "title": "Suppressed Human History Movie", "title_full": "/x/ - Suppressed Human History Movie - Paranormal - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-06T08:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 21, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2a4772eee8598cea042ad18cda057f21465b7041", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_yRPOivCwx7u_cZ6TmtFCVaayv0kzU7KeM-", "ord_in_thread": 20, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T09:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>19996350\n>spirit science\nFuck off", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:30.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d332e8fbf06d8b93ee3f035bbcc8632707995d89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYyoODA_sG6MMGxFh26nSAvKpj5w8xLbBD.gyLOJ2223tS3ud5zrXRNVaTIIG3l6ZT4yLyFKKFv.vq7sPwyIuedxkU5Lo0fCm6", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.co.za", "site": "tripadvisor.co.za", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/ShowForum-g186591-i88-o40-Ireland.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Ireland Forum, Travel Discussion for Ireland - TripAdvisor", "title": "Dublin - Dublin", "title_full": "Dublin - Dublin Message Board - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-03T13:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10000, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7fc54c2a56e3a79ddf70a0549c6e250b58bb0544", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYyoODA_sG6MMGxFh26nSAvKpj5w8xLbBD.gyLOJ2223tS3ud5zrXRNVaTIIG3l6ZT4yLyFKKFv.vq7sPwyIued7MGbGpqTRHKpj12OvHtoVs-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "TA_Maryjane", "published": "2017-12-05T17:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hello Roberto F,\nWelcome to the TripAdvisor Forum.\nI have moved the topic on your behalf to the Dublin forum.

But before we look at the impact from the Autumn 2017 Budget, it is worth reminding ourselves of one of the key legislative change due to be enforced next year, that was announced within previous Budget papers. Capital Allowances \nWriting down allowances (WDA\u2019s), are based on a car\u2019s CO2 with the current threshold being 130g/km. Any car above 130g/km is limited to 9% writing down allowance per annum (on a pooled basis) with cars between 76g/km and 130g/km having a 19% allowance per annum. For cars at 75g/km and under (termed Ultra Low Emission Vehicles \u2013 ULEVs), allowances are accelerated to 100% in the first year. \nFrom April 2018 the 130g/km threshold is reducing to 110g/km and ULEV\u2019s will be classed as cars with 50g/km or lower. \nTherefore, for any business that does not amend their car policy in terms of CO2 limits to cater for these lower thresholds, costs will increase in the form of higher lease rentals and loss of corporation tax allowances. Company Car Benefit in Kind (BIK) \nFrom next April, company car BIK will be determined not solely by CO2 emissions but also by a new testing standard called Real Driving Emissions Step 2, or RDE2 for short. \nRDE2 was not due to impact until 2021 and as such there are virtually no diesel cars currently capable of meeting this new emissions test. \nRDE2 is an open road test of how closely a car\u2019s \u2018real world\u2019 emissions of CO2, NOx and particulates match the results of the international rolling road test (called WLTP) that determines the official figures published by the manufacturer. RDE2 is being called \u2018real world Euro 6\u2019 because it reveals whether a car really does conform to Euro 6 in real life. \nUnfortunately for fleets and drivers, there are no RDE2-compliant diesels to choose from yet. It will be 2021 before all diesels sold in Europe and the UK are mandated to have a Real Driving Emissions rating. Only those that remain within Euro 6 limits for CO2 and NOx during the open road test will pass RDE2. That will matter to company car drivers because RDE2-compliant diesels, when they become available, will be fully exempt from the diesel surcharge on company car tax \u2013 i.e. they will attract the same BIK percentage as a petrol car with the same CO2 emissions. In the meantime, the Budget controversially increased the current 3% diesel surcharge to 4% from next April for non-RDE2-compliant models. Company car tax rates to 2021 \nExcept for the increase in the diesel surcharge from April, the Budget left company car BIK rates to 2021 unchanged: Rates 2020-2021 *For diesels that meet real world Euro 6 emissions (RDE2), there will be no 4% surcharge: the % BIK rate will be the same as petrol. Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) \nThe Budget also ties VED on diesel cars to the Real Driving Emissions standard. All new diesel cars registered after 1 April 2018 that do not meet the RDE2 emissions standard will be subject to a supplement so that their First-Year Rate will be calculated as if they were in the VED band above. Examples range from an additional \u00a320 on a typical Ford Focus diesel to a \u00a3400 increase on a Land Rover Discovery. The First Year VED band move will not apply to light and medium commercial vehicles, which will be subject to the RPI increase only. Vehicle Excise Duty rates for all cars, vans and motorcycles will increase by RPI from next April. The Heavy Goods Vehicle VED and Road User Levy rates will be frozen from 1 April 2018. To promote take-up of zero-emission capable taxis, the government will exempt them from the \u00a3310 VED supplement for expensive cars from April 2019. New diesel VED bands from April 2018 Other Budget Measures Announced Company Van Benefit Charge: The taxable cash equivalent where a van is made available to an employee for private use will increase by 3.7% next April from the current \u00a33,230 to \u00a33,350. Company Car Fuel BIK: The multiplier for car fuel benefit-in-kind will increase by 3.5% next April from \u00a322,600 to \u00a323,400. The van fuel benefit charge will increase from \u00a3610 to \u00a3633. Charging private EVs at work: From April 2018, there will be no benefit in kind charge on electricity that employers provide to charge employees\u2019 own electric vehicles. This rule already applies to plug-in company cars. Electric goods vehicle first year capital allowance: The 100% First Year Allowance (FYA) on zero-emission goods vehicles was due to end next March. The government will extend it for three years to 1 April 2021 together with the 100% FYA on installing refuelling equipment for natural gas, biogas and hydrogen vehicle. Fuel duty: The Budget announced that fuel duty will be frozen for an eighth successive year. Changes to fuel duty rates for alternative fuels will be announced in the next Budget. In the meantime, the government will end the fuel duty escalator for Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), freezing it in 2018-19, alongside the main rate of fuel duty. Employee business expenses: Following a consultation earlier this year, the government will make several changes to the taxation of employee expenses. To reduce the burden on employers, from April 2019 they will no longer be required to check receipts when reimbursing employees\u2019 subsistence claims using benchmark scale rates. The existing concessionary scale rates for accommodation and subsistence overseas will become statutory, to provide greater certainty for businesses. Comment \nIt does seem extraordinary and illogical that the new regime of taxing diesel engine vehicles (via BIK and first year VED) is being centred on new vehicles rather than those that are more polluting \u2013 after all it is the pre-Euro VI standard engines that are causing the harm. To then escalate RDE2 test regulations to April 2018 when these are not even mandatory for manufacturers until 2020 does seem to be rubbing salt into the wound. \nAll of this and the previous tax actions already applied are substantially increasing the cost to the employee (and employer via National Insurance Contributions) in taking a company car. If people are unaware currently, it\u2019s only a matter of time before irate employees are berating their HR departments asking where all the additional cost has come from. The changes are likely to be keenly felt: As an example, the BIK applied to a 99g/km diesel car (which is not even at the top end of the scale) is set to increase between 2016/17 and 2019/20 by 42% . To put that in context, for a car with a P11D value of \u00a325,000 and for an employee in the 40% income tax rate bracket, they will see an increase of \u00a3700 per annum in monetary terms by 2020. \nIt seems to us a short sighted and irrational decision; especially in a market where new car sales are expected to fall for the first time since 2011. It certainly doesn\u2019t appear to address the fundamental issues of emissions and climate change and rather seems designed only to address the shortfall in tax revenue. Ten years ago, the number of company cars in Britain exceeded 1.5 million; today there are less than a million. If you want to understand the true extent to which the taxation has increased for employers and employees consider this: the government will take more in tax revenue from less than a million cars under this scheme, than they were taking from 1.5 million cars ten years ago. \nThe increasing cost and complexity in operating company cars is why UK business should be constantly assessing and reviewing car policies. The landscape is complicated, constantly changing and in many cases, counter-intuitive, as we have seen. \nIn order to manage your fleet operations for maximum benefit and minimum cost to you and your employees, contact us at ERA Fleet Cost Management for some impartial advice from knowledgeable experts.

(AP) \u2014 Closing arguments are scheduled in the sentencing hearing of a politically connected Florida eye doctor convicted of stealing $100 million from Medicare, one of the largest individual thefts in the program's history. Prosecutors are expected to argue Thursday that Dr. Salomon Melgen deserves a 30-year sentence for convincing mostly elderly patients to undergo painful tests and treatments for diseases they didn't have. Melgen's attorneys will push for less than 10 years, saying the government's estimate of the amount stolen is exaggerated and the doctor's crimes were honest mistakes. U.S District Judge Kenneth Marra could give Melgen a life sentence but has wide discretion. Marra indicated Wednesday that he might not sentence Melgen immediately because he might need time to think. Melgen is separately charged with bribing New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez.

But I felt like I was in the middle of the story over the first few pages. So I looked it up on Goodreads and sure enough, there's a novella that happens first. Thankfully it was available on Kindle. So I bought it, charged my Kindle, and read it.\n\nThis novella is the story of how Charles and Anna met, and what exactly happened to her. She was changed against her will and told for three years she was a useless submissive wolf. Charles is the one who tells her the truth: she is not a submissive, she's an Omega. Omegas has are rare and fall outside of the regular werewolf hierarchy; Anna wasn't submissive, her pack had to beat submissiveness into her. \nTogether, Charles and Anna confront her pack. Unexpectedly, Charles' wolf claims Anna as it's mate (after knowing her for only a few hours). Together they discover why Anna's pack was so sick. And now she agrees to accompany Charles and the Marrok back to Chicago. \nThat was a bit annoying, but now I'm ready to actually read Cry Wolf.\n\nNote: I didn't read the version in On the Prowl, but I like the cover better than what the Kindle version had.

Capt. Michael Boyle will take charge of Navy Region Korea, Naval Forces Korea and the naval component of United Nations Command, said a Defense Department statement issued this week. The selection was made by Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer and Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson. Boyle \u2014 who was selected for appointment to the rank of rear admiral in October \u2014 now serves as director for international engagement for the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. Before that, he commanded the Japan-based Carrier Air Wing 5, which is the aviation wing of the Navy\u2019s 7th Fleet. The region has seen an uptick in naval activity in recent months, as North Korea conducted a string of ballistic-missile tests \u2014 including three intercontinental ballistic missiles \u2014 and detonated its sixth and most powerful underground nuclear blast. Last month, the USS Ronald Reagan strike group conducted a rare tri-carrier exercise with the USS Nimitz and USS Theodore Roosevelt strike groups east of the peninsula. In October, U.S. ships took part in a four-day exercise with the South Korean navy, followed by a port visit by the Ronald Reagan to Busan. The Ohio-class guided-missile submarine USS Michigan also visited the port that month. The deployment of U.S. bombers, submarines and aircraft carriers to the peninsula always infuriates Pyongyang, which considers them signals of preparations for an invasion. Green-shirted hook-runners, who ensure the arresting cable is reset for each aircraft, wait for a jet to land on the USS Nimitz during a rare tri-carrier exercise near the Korean Peninsula, Monday, Nov. 13, 2017.

Photo: HANNAH MCKAY / POOL / AFP \nKAMPALA \u2013 Ugandan leader Yoweri Museveni said on Wednesday he supports extending a president's term to seven years from five but one critic said any such move would help enable one of Africa's longest serving leaders to rule for life. \nMuseveni did not directly propose that term limits be stretched in Uganda but instead said extending the time between elections would give African leaders more opportunity to promote development because they would not be distracted by politics. \n\"For these countries with all these problems ... five years is just a joke,\" a statement from the presidency quoted Museveni as saying. \"Leaders in Africa have much more to do and need adequate time (between elections) to develop the continent.\" \nMuseveni fought his way to power in 1986 and has won a series of elections, the most recent of which was in 2016. His opponents say the government uses repression to stay in power and rigs polls. \nThe rapid fall of Zimbabwe's leader Robert Mugabe last month after 37 years in power has highlighted the potential vulnerability of the small group of African leaders who have ruled for decades. \nREAD: Uganda bans live media in parliament after brawls \nThe government has proposed a change to the constitution that would enable the 73-year-old leader to stand in 2021 by scrapping a limit on the age of a presidential candidate. There is no current bill to extend the presidential term but Museveni's comments make such a proposal more likely. \nSecurity forces have detained opponents of the constitutional change and also used live bullets and teargas to quash demonstrations. Andrew Karamagi, a rights activist and critic of Museveni said the president's comments are: \"an insult to our intelligence.\" \n\"To invent a fresh bogeyman, particularly by the same person who said that Africa's problem is leaders who stay too long in power, is unfortunate. If five years are so few ... can he show us what he has done in 31 years,\" he told Reuters. \nMuseveni has won praise for sending troops to join an African Union peacekeeping force in Somalia and for maintaining stability at home in a region that has been beset by conflicts. His critics say prolonging his tenure is his central objective.

You'll have to be as observant as Sherlock to pinpoint the differences between the two smartphones. The Redmi 5A, at best, can be considered as a high-definition remaster of the Redmi 4A, launched by Xiaomi to celebrate its fine form: the Chinese brand just joined South Korean giant Samsung to become the number one smartphone vendor in India after all: all in a matter of three years. \nXiaomi is, without a doubt, well at home in India and the Redmi 5A, it says, is a smartphone that it has designed specifically for the Indian consumers. And therein lies the biggest difference that sets the Redmi 5A apart from its predecessor, the Redmi 4A, which was launched by Xiaomi not so long ago. Not only is the Redmi 5A designed for India, it will also be made (assembled) in India. Xiaomi, to recall, now assembles a considerable chunk of phones that it sells in India -- more than 90 per cent, according to Xiaomi -- here in the country itself. \nThe made for India aspect also stems from the fact that although the Redmi 5A launched in India shares much of the hardware specs with the Redmi 5A that's already available in China, the one that will sell (and will be made) in India will come with some India-specific nuggets likely to appeal to India's masses. \nThe Redmi 5A India version, will for one, come with a dedicated slot for two nano SIM cards and one micro-SD card for storage expansion. Secondly, Xiaomi is also introducing a 3GB RAM/32GB storage version of the Redmi 5A in India. In China only one 2GB RAM/16GB variant is available. Elsewhere, the Redmi 5A will house the same dual graphite sheet -- to save the phone from over-heating -- which the company ships inside its premiere phones like the Mi A1, and will also include a power charger that can adapt to India's fluctuating power scenarios. \nXiaomi is immensely proud of the Redmi 4A and it should be. The company has sold 40 lakh units of the Redmi 4A within eight months of its launch, it claims. With the Redmi 5A, it is merely looking to get more consumers on-board: consumers who missed out on the Redmi 4A: which is probably why the Redmi 5A retains much of its predecessor's hardware set as well its ultra-affordable price tag. Design and build quality \nThe Redmi 5A is still rocking an all-plastic body and there's still no fingerprint scanner on-board the device, trade-offs that seems fair considering the phone's low price tag. At its price point, it doesn't really matter whether it is plastic or metal. What really matters is that it's beautiful and very ergonomic. It's a good looking plastic phone, the Redmi 5A, and it certainly feels nice in the hands too. The phone has a metallic matte finish on the back that's smooth to the touch and because the rear seamlessly wraps around its front, the phone feels all the more comfortable in the hands. \nThe right edge houses the volume rocker and the power button while the left edge houses a dedicated slot for two SIMs and one micro-SD. The speaker vent is, meanwhile, located on the lower end of the back. The lower end of the display panel houses three capacitive keys for navigation, without any backlit. There's also an LED notification light on the front. \nThe Redmi 5A -- just like the Redmi 4A - is thin and light-weight, even more so considering that it packs in a fairly respectable battery (3,000 mAh) inside. But that's something that we've grown to associate with Xiaomi over time, so much so that it isn't even a thing anymore. It will be surprising if Xiaomi came out with a thick and chunky phone out of the blue tomorrow: now that will be some news. \nAll isn't hunky dory with the Redmi 5A though. While the Redmi 4A took great pride in its Mi 4i looks - the Redmi 4A, in fact, shared its DNA with the Mi 4i, according to Xiaomi - the Redmi 5A looks like any other smartphone in the market right now. It is generic to look at. You can go and say, well, at least it looks great for its price and it does. You can also go on and say that no other smartphone, at its price point, looks as good as the Redmi 5A, and that's true. But one look at where the Redmi 5A comes from - from the Redmi 4A - and you're bound to be a little disappointed. I know I was, but then again, design is purely subjective. In Xiaomi's defence, the Redmi 5A comes in three appealing colours: Dark Grey, Gold and Rose Gold. Display \nThe Redmi 5A comes with a 5-inch HD IPS LCD display with a 720x1280 pixels resolution. The quality of the panel may not be as good as the one on-board the Redmi 4, but, at its price point, the Redmi 5A can afford to get away with it. Colours look rich and vibrant and there's a manual mode inside that helps achieve slightly better results. There's also an in-built reading mode that turns colours to the warmer end of the spectrum for night-time reading. Software \nThe Redmi 5A runs Xiaomi's new MIUI 9 software. Xiaomi's custom ROM, aka MIUI, although it offers a seamless experience across the board, is known for some heavy skinning on top of Android, something that hard-core geeks don't really appreciate. Also, because there's third-party skinning involved -- and because Xiaomi likes to update each and every device in its portfolio more or less on similar lines -- the fact that users have to wait longer for updates, doesn't go down well with many. That besides the fact that the company is known to kill some key Android features just so it can maintain uniformity across its devices is a subject of much debate. The MIUI 9 update is a little different. \nThe MIUI 9 update, in addition to Xiaomi's custom built features, brings back key Android nuggets like split-screen multitasking and Google Assistant, something that was missing in the previous iteration. At the same time, Xiaomi has brought about some tweaks that help enhance usability: in split-screen mode, for instance, if you want to switch the app that's on the bottom to the top, you'll just have to double tap the bar in the middle. With the Redmi 5A, Xiaomi is looking to get more consumers on-board: consumers who missed out on the Redmi 4A \nElsewhere, MIUI 9 -- much like MIUI 8 -- offers all the bells and whistles that you'd want from a fully-functional operating system, including themes. Popular features like dual apps (imagine, running two WhatsApp accounts on one phone), secure folder (imagine, two different home screens one for home another for work) and scrollable screenshots (imagine longer screenshots of complete webpages that can be edited at will) have been kept intact, while adding new ones that add a breath of fresh air to Xiaomi's colourful user interface. \nAdditionally, the Redmi 5A also comes with an IR-blaster that can be used (in tandem with the Mi Remote app or even some third-party solutions) to control smart home appliances: a first for any smartphone in its price category. Performance and battery life \nOn the inside, the Redmi 5A comes with the same entry-level 1.4GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 processer coupled with Adreno 308 GPU as the Redmi 4A and up to 3GB of RAM. The phone comes with up to 32GB of internal storage which is further expandable by up to 128GB via a dedicated micro-SD card slot. The dual-SIM phone supports 4G LTE and VoLTE. \nJust like the Redmi 4A, the Redmi 5A is also the most powerful (and most power-efficient) smartphone that you can buy in the Indian market right now. The Redmi 5A is quick and responsive in every sense of the word -- with occasional hiccups -- and MIUI 9 (based on Android 7.1.2 Nougat) does add a whole new dimension to the user experience. \nFYI: Because the Redmi 5A is an entry-level phone, it's only fair that it is treated like one. It should do just fine as long as you're aware of its limitations. Nay, it should do better. \nI have been using the basic 2GB RAM/16GB storage version for this review, and let's just say, it didn't disappoint me much as far as all-round performance is concerned. There were no immediate visible lags or stutter while navigating between home screens and/or multitasking in my review unit. Remember, its speed and multitasking prowess are being compared with phones in this price range. The phone does have a tendency to slow down or stutter when you have too many apps running simultaneously in the background, something that isn't very surprising if you take into account the hardware that is inside it. One of the first things to do, then, is to ensure you're not treating the Redmi 5A as a multitasking beast. It isn't. Xiaomi is, without a doubt, well at home in India and the Redmi 5A, it says, is a smartphone that it has designed specifically for the Indian consumers \nBasic games like Candy Crush and Subway Surfers are handled well by the phone, but GPU-intensive games like Asphalt 8: Airborne are prone to occasional lags and frame rate drops even at low graphical settings especially when being played for longer periods. \nElsewhere, the Redmi 5A is prone to some overheating every now and then, but it is also quick to cool down which is nice. \nThe mono speaker on-board the Redmi 5A is average at best. It gets loud but there is often some digitisation observed at peak volume. Also, its rear placement means sound is muffled when the phone is kept with the back facing down. Voice quality during calls made with the Redmi 5A was excellent. \nThe Redmi 5A is backed by a 3,000mAh battery which is smaller than the one on-board the Redmi 4A, but, Xiaomi is claiming up to 21 hours of music playback and up to 7 hours of video playback and up to 8-days of stand-by on single charge. Moderate to extreme usage saw me cross the one whole day barrier with ease, while toning down further should get most users one and a half days out of the phone. Extreme usage scenarios got me close to 13 hours on the Redmi 5A, which is more or less similar to what you get on its predecessor, the Redmi 4A. Camera \nMoving on, the Redmi 5A comes with a 13-megapixel camera on the rear with f/2.2 aperture, Phase Detection Autofocus and LED flash. The rear camera is capable of shooting 1080p videos at 30fps. On the front, the Redmi 5A comes with a 5-megapixel camera with f/2.0 aperture. It's the same deal, as the Redmi 4A, only addition of PDAF means the Redmi 5A is slightly faster to lock focus on subjects than its predecessor. X Previous Next \nIt's not any better or worse than the Redmi 4A as far as performance is concerned though. The phone captures some good-looking photos in good light with good amount of detail and mostly spot-on colours. But, zooming into these photos -- more often than not -- gives out the real picture. It isn't that good. Noise is quite evident and resolved detail missing. The phone, for the lack of a better word, has a rather hit or miss camera in good light. Still, it should suffice for most budget-conscious buyers. \nThe Redmi 5A is a pretty disappointing camera phone in tricky and low light. The front-facing selfie camera is, meanwhile, just about average clicking average at best selfies with some noise, even in good lighting. Should you buy it? \nFor Mukesh Ambani-led RIL, the JioPhone is the most potent means of connecting the hundreds of thousands of unconnected Indians. For Micromax, it's the Bharat 1. For Samsung and Lenovo/Motorola, it's the Galaxy J2 and the Moto C respectively. For HMD Global, it's the Nokia 2. While the JioPhone and the Bharat 1 are 'smart' feature phones, the Galaxy J2, the Moto C and the Nokia 2 are full-scale 4G smartphones. Without diving into the technicalities, let me just put it out there in simple terms: while the JioPhone and the Bharat 1 are physical numpad-toting feature phones, the Galaxy J2, the Moto C and the Nokia 2 are smartphones rocking archaic hardware. To be more precise, all these phones, essentially offer entry-level experience that some may say justifies their entry-level price tags, but what if the hundreds of thousands of unconnected Indians still want more? That is where Xiaomi's new Redmi 5A comes in. \nThe Redmi 5A is directed towards first-time Internet users and users who are looking to switch from a feature phone to a smartphone, without having to spend a fortune on a good handset. Much like the JioPhone, the Bharat 1, the Galaxy J2, the Moto C and the Nokia 2. Unlike the JioPhone, the Bharat 1, the Galaxy J2, the Moto C and the Nokia 2, however, the Redmi 5A doesn't compromise much in terms of hardware specs; it doesn't compromise much in terms of looks and feel either. \nThe Redmi 5A is not very different from the Redmi 4A. At the same time additions like dedicated slots for dual-SIM and micro-SD, dual graphite sheet and the 'Make in India' adds some variety to it. But more importantly, it's the price that Xiaomi will be selling its new phone. The Redmi 5A 2GB RAM/16GB storage version at an introductory price of Rs 4,999 is in fact cheaper than what Xiaomi was asking for the Redmi 4A back in the day. It's quite a steal, is what it is. \nFYI: The Rs 4,999 price tag for the 2GB RAM/16GB storage version will however be applicable for a limited period (50 lakh units) only. The Redmi 5A 2GB RAM/16GB storage version will thereafter be available for Rs 5,999, the company adds.
