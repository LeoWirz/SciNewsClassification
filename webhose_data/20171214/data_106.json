She was last seen on 19 or 20 August 2006, following an apparent argument with Phakane. \nThe cause of her death could not be determined due to the level of the decomposition of her body. \nThe North Gauteng High Court judgment said that another woman, who was also Phakane\u2019s girlfriend at the time, Martha Manamela, gave the police a statement in which she said Phakane had visited her on 20 August. She made her statement on 2 September 2006. \nManamela told the police Phakane had told her he had a fight with Boshomane and that he assaulted her with a waist belt. \nShe said Phakane admitted to leaving Boshomane in a veld, adding that he told her he had returned to Boshomane\u2019s home the following day but that she was not there. He also told her Boshomane was not in the veld, where he had left her, either. \nPhakane was arrested and subsequently charged with assault and murder, where he pleaded not guilty to both charges. \nThe state\u2019s case against him was largely based on circumstantial evidence and his alleged confession to Manamela. \nHe was then convicted and sentenced to 20 years in a largely circumstantial case. \nHis appeal against his sentence and conviction was dismissed by the North Gauteng High Court after it found that the absence of a key witness\u2019s evidence and transcripts was not detrimental to him successfully appealing his case. \nThe full bench found that the absence of Manamela\u2019s transcript was not such that the court could not fairly determine the appeal. \nPhakane then turned to the Constitutional Court seeking to overturn the decision. \nHis lawyer told the court that the absence of such key evidence meant that Phakane\u2019s appeal could not be determined fairly. He argued that this was an infringement of his right to a fair appeal, therefore his conviction and sentence should be set aside. \nIn a majority judgment, the Constitutional Court said Manamela\u2019s evidence in court was critical to his conviction by the trial court and, without the transcript of that evidence, the appeal could not be fair. \nTherefore, he should be released from prison immediately. \nThe judgment said that, while there was no longer sufficient evidence to convict Phakane of murder, there was still evidence from Phakane\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony that implicated him, leaving the possibility of the NPA to recharge him. \n-TNA Reporter ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "boshomane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manamela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raymond zondo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "klaas lesetja phakane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phakane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martha manamela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matilda chuence boshomane", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "north gauteng high court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "constitutional court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images  the national prosecuting authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "npa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "manamela", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:16:16.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "58d98d83f569a8a4065ac14288000e8d39164b34", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS3la0fciKapSe7DzWdFy.bg-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:13:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "58d98d83f569a8a4065ac14288000e8d39164b34", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS3la0fciKapSe7DzWdFy.bg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Non Host Infinite Ammo (MasterQ9999)\r\nC2AC5108 00000009\r\nFC00001E 3C208E23\r\n618CED60 60005678\r\n900E0000 EC00E028\r\n6000DEF0 900C0070\r\n60000000 D8010028\r\n39800006 919E06B0\r\n60000000 81DE06B0\r\nEC0007B2 7C600774\r\n3B5A0007 00000000", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:16:17.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7ba2ecd07fe659509e9acb8bbf2260cb44860811", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ50HWkEALmJMhgrQ5d93EilL3B29ELNT2tB5Eehjds8T5hCaP4TNQc4rvw8lJbwiGu47ukL9cWUA--", "site_full": "thefiringline.com", "site": "thefiringline.com", "site_section": "https://thefiringline.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=29", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "The Skunkworks -

elephants, sources said, as the government aims to halt mining in the area.\nSteel Authority of India Ltd ( SAIL ) was banking on the mine in the country's east to supply a big chunk of its raw material needs for a multi-billion-dollar expansion of its steel production capacity.\nSAIL produces only around 800,000 tonnes a year from a section of the Chiria mine but was targeting to raise that to 7 million tonnes in the next few years, to lift its steel capacity nearly four times to 50 million tonnes by 2030/31.\n\"Getting forest clearance for the mine under existing guidelines is a challenge,\" Sunil Kumar Barnwal, the mines secretary of Jharkhand state where the mine is located, told Reuters.\n\"There are also special environmental conditions in Saranda forest region that need to be fulfilled to get clearance.\"\nSaranda is home to endangered species of flying lizards and is also an integral part of an elephant corridor. But years of mining around the area by various companies have led to a 21 percent drop in the elephant population between 2010 and 2016, according to an environment ministry report.\nThe federal government is now considering stopping all mining activity in the area, two government sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.\nIf the expansion does not go through, it would also be a disappointment for resources conglomerate Adani Enterprises , which was working on bidding for a contract to operate the mine on behalf of SAIL.\nAdani, which has been struggling to secure funding for a big coal project in Australia, is looking to enter the iron ore and copper mining business in India amid soft demand for other businesses such as coal trading, analysts say.\nSAIL and Adani did not respond to requests for comment. An environment ministry spokesman did not comment.\nChiria has proven reserves of around 1 billion tonnes and SAIL had announced its ongoing modernisation and expansion plans factoring in iron ore from the mine, said a company source.\nSAIL's other iron ore mines have reserves likely to last only up to eight years more, added the source, who declined to be named as he did not have permission to talk to the press.\n0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "adani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sunil kumar barnwal", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "steel authority of india ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adani enterprises", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saranda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jharkhand state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chiria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:16:19.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7e38fee6cac8ea2b659ddf46085a135871c69963", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQOY2Vu62HdS2fx3k67ipt6upNUj_7ZtN4Kh2cPjkyh77QK.q9w2dSlR_ONSefUSZ48fo4JNvX99sKWYuHyL7tjsSEpLPmLepswDVxNrRGCJQQLbRi3WzKWWy8tt9tacgA-", "site_full": "article.wn.com", "site": "wn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.wn.com/English/keyword/europe", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WN.com - Europe News", "title": "Did you hear the one about the five men who walked into a bar?", "title_full": "Did you hear the one about the five men who walked into a bar? - Worldnews.com", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5594, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7e38fee6cac8ea2b659ddf46085a135871c69963", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQOY2Vu62HdS2fx3k67ipt6upNUj_7ZtN4Kh2cPjkyh77QK.q9w2dSlR_ONSefUSZ48fo4JNvX99sKWYuHyL7tjsSEpLPmLepswDVxNrRGCJQQLbRi3WzKWWy8tt9tacgA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "wn.com", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Did you hear the one about the five men who walked into a bar?", "text": "On an afternoon in January 2013 , five men walked into a bar in London ; a business owner with his consultant and three corporate brokers looking to secure some business. \n\nThe drinks flowed and the banter was good.

Prosecutors say he accepted a $2 million bribe from Rosneft\u2019s influential CEO, Igor Sechin, for giving the company the green light for privatizing another oil firm. \nThe circumstances of the case have ignited speculation that Ulyukayev was caught in a Kremlin power play against Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin. \nIn his final argument on Thursday, Ulyukayev pleaded not guilty and accused Sechin of setting him up. \n\u201cA horrific and cruel provocation has been perpetrated against me,\u201d he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies. \nSechin, whose testimony was the cornerstone of the case against the former minister, was summoned to testify in court four times but he did not show up, citing urgent matters of business. \nReferring to a common perception of Sechin as a dark force in Russian politics, Ulyakayev said in court on Thursday that the key witness \u201cdisappeared \u2014 what was left was a whiff of sulfur in the air.\u201d \nUlyukaev went to Sechin\u2019s office in November last year to discuss Rosneft\u2019s affairs, and was arrested as he was leaving the building with a bag full of cash that Sechin had given him. Ulyukayev told the court that he thought the bag contained a bottle of wine and a basket filled with sausages. \nIn wire tapes played out to the court earlier in the trial, Sechin was heard telling Ulyukayev to take the bag with the sausage. Russian media has reported that Sechin has a tradition of gifting people baskets of sausages from his own butcher\u2019s shop. \nUlyukayev could face a lengthy prison term if found guilty. Prosecutors have asked the court to send him to a high-security prison for ten years, arguing that Ulyukayev\u2019s actions \u201care undermining the authority of the government.\u201d \nUlyukayev told the court on Thursday that he is not guilty of \u201cthose absurd accusations but guilty of a different thing: I often compromised. I was a hypocrite. I love taking gifts and giving gifts. When you\u2019re doing all right, you shamelessly turn your back on other people\u2019s misfortunes.\u201d \nUlyukayev asked for \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d forgiveness and pledged to devote rest of his life to \u201cdefending people\u2019s interests.\u201d \nThe court is expected to deliver the verdict next week.

They\u2019re perfectly soft, a little bit chewy, with the right amount of tang from the sour cream. Don\u2019t forget the buttercream frosting! Grandma\u2019s Best Sugar Cookies is one of our most popular recipes (originally posted December 12, 2014), so I\u2019ve updated the photos and included a how-to video! Enjoy! \nGrandma\u2019s Best Sugar Cookies are the only thing getting me through right now, because yikes! \nThere\u2019s so much going on. \nI KNOW you\u2019re all with me on that one. \nBut instead of focusing on getting everything I need to get done, I\u2019m avoiding it all by baking Grandma\u2019s Best Sugar Cookies! Duh. \nPriorities people, priorities. \nSeriously though, can we all just hang out, eat cookies and watch Christmas movies together?! \nLet me just take a second to say that Trevor\u2019s grandma was sweeter than her sugar cookies\u2026the sweetest person in the world if you ask me (along with Trevor\u2019s grandpa, \u201cHi, Gramp!\u201d). \nI only met her once, but the first time we met, she hugged me like she\u2019d known me forever. She is the amazing person behind these cookies, and I think of her every time we make them. \nWhen Trevor was growing up, she would send a tin of them to him for Christmas. So this post today is dedicated to her and hopefully will bring back some wonderful memories for Trevor and anyone who was lucky enough to taste her cookies. <3 \nThis recipe is for the soft, super fluffy, perfectly sweet drop sugar cookies. If you want to keep it super traditional, you can frost these will store bought frosting, like Trevor\u2019s grandma did, but I\u2019ve also included a homemade recipe (that\u2019s pretty darn fantastic) below if you prefer! \nStart by making the cookies. Cream together butter and sugar in a large bowl. Then add in two eggs. \nNext you\u2019re going to stir in some sour cream and vanilla. \nLastly, you\u2019re going to stir in some flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. \nNow comes the hard part. Place saran wrap around the bowl, place in the fridge, and let it chill for an hour. \nAn hour?! \nI know, it stinks, but here\u2019s the thing, during that hour you can be soooo productive. For example: you can do that cleaning you\u2019ve been meaning to do, or finish start your holiday shopping, make the buttercream, stare at the computer screen or\u2026let\u2019s be honest, sit down, take a load off and catch up on the latest episode of Top Chef. Just keep yourself distracted so you don\u2019t go crazy waiting for the cookies to chill. \n*One hour later* \nYou made it! Congrats \ud83d\ude42 Now all you have to do is shape the cookie dough into balls (I used this cookie scoop for smaller cookies or this cookie scoop for larger cookies) on a baking sheet lined with a silicone mat and bake! \nLet them cool completely before frosting them with store bought buttercream, or my recipe! \nFor the buttercream, cream softened butter in your stand (or hand) mixer. Then add in powdered sugar, heavy cream, vanilla, and a pinch of salt. I keep my frosting white because #lazygirlprobs, but feel free to make these as festive as you\u2019d like! \nNow just frost, decorate, and enjoy! \nThese sugar cookies are perfectly soft, a little bit chewy, with the right amount of tang from the sour cream and I\u2019d definitely suggest topping it with that ultra fluffy buttercream! \n\u2013 Jennifer", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gramp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2013 jennifer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trevor", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "best sugar cookies", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:16:21.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "edc90ab16dac5d9a81318229a2cde4b7957c6ad9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9QBwq_.YKB3Z1oQQcF1oDNWC0eCa6L8PAm0N7GLe2MyljcvBDvEvrqvgloQKaBS39ZhTLvj4jyajlfMqZ5ZqEnj.xXI6SB1mfGhnOQWfmkAw--", "site_full": "www.3dinosaurs.com", "site": "3dinosaurs.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/3dinosaurs/UjAl", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "3 Dinosaurs", "title": "Christmas Themed Number Color & Trace", "title_full": "Christmas Themed Number Color & Trace", "published": "2017-12-05T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "edc90ab16dac5d9a81318229a2cde4b7957c6ad9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9QBwq_.YKB3Z1oQQcF1oDNWC0eCa6L8PAm0N7GLe2MyljcvBDvEvrqvgloQKaBS39ZhTLvj4jyajlfMqZ5ZqEnj.xXI6SB1mfGhnOQWfmkAw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cassie", "published": "2017-12-05T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Christmas Themed Number Color & Trace", "text": "Tweet Shares 18 \nNumbers are something we work on all year long and it is fun to change up how we work on them. I love having the Number color and trace for different seasons. And today we have some fun Christmas themed to use! \nThese are a   Christmas Printables on the site. Plus you have the option of what Christmas themes you want to use. \nThere are two sets of these number coloring and tracing printable. The first set has a number to color and objects that count up to that number. They have number and number word to trace. The second set has the numbers that you write in. These come in three themes for Christmas: general Christmas theme, gingerbread man, and reindeer. \nClick here to buy your copy of the Winter Number Color and Trace Bundle at Teachers Notebook. \nThe first set is perfect for those in PreK and Kindergarten because they can work on the number formation of the digit and word together. You can see that there are numbers to color and matching objects for the number. You can see the page below has 7 and seven with a gingerbread man with 7 gumdrops to color. \nThe second set is ideal for those in late kindergarten and early first grade to work on writing their numbers. It has the same numbers that match up to the coloring and writing. You can see the reindeer has 14 ornaments and you have one fourteen to trace and then write. \nI like how flexible the sets are.

As a former Green Beret from back in the day, I can appreciate what you endured more than most, my hats off to you. \nAll I can add is I hope to hell that no government including ours every gets your source code; as a former military officer and student of history, I know what our government is capable of. \nI do wonder if China will survive the coming collapse in the west, aren\u2019t they too tied to us? \n\u2026 \nANSWER: They will push you to the edge, hoping you break. There is a fine line and if you cross it you lose all fear of death. Then the table is turned. There is no threat they can make that will change your position. Some ask, \u201cWhy did you not just turn over the code?\u201d They assume that they will actually honor what they tell you. They NEVER tell the truth, and if you turn over what they demand, you lose everything for they can kill you and pretend it was some accident, heart attack, or whatever. The press will believe them of course. That\u2019s why they are there. You are dancing with the devil and it becomes a dance to the death. I was released ONLY because I got into the Supreme Court. Once they were taking the case, the New York boys had to release me. \nConcerning China, the reason that they will succeed is because they are turning inward by building their economy into a consumer reservoir and eliminating their dependence upon the West.

AM \nNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 Kenya\u2019s opposition leader is rejecting U.S. advice to cancel a planned mock inauguration of him as president, saying he doesn\u2019t recognize the legitimacy of President Uhuru Kenyatta. \nRaila Odinga alleged Thursday that dozens of Kenyans have been killed by the security forces and \u201cnobody is talking about it. Yet they have the audacity to come and advise us to forget and move on.\u201d \nHe spoke outside a morgue in the capital Nairobi while accompanying families collecting bodies of the police\u2019s alleged victims. \nA U.S. Embassy statement Wednesday called Odinga\u2019s planned protest event on Dec. 12 \u201cextra-constitutional\u201d and urged him to cancel the event. \nOdinga successfully challenged Kenyatta\u2019s August re-election but then boycotted a rerun vote in October, demanding electoral reforms. Kenyatta was inaugurated last week.

That\u2019s what I think. You\u2019re going to watch fights just to see how long these mother(expletives) can survive against this guy. That\u2019s what I think. That could be their big, breakout star.\u201d \nMeanwhile, interim middleweight champion Robert Whittaker has found himself in a UFC mess after an illness relegating champion Georges St-Pierre to the sidelines put a hole in the Aussie\u2019s plans. \nMiddleweight fighter Luke Rockhold doubted St-Pierre would ever defend his new title, and took aim at the confusion surrounding the middleweight title. \n\u201cWhere\u2019s the clarity in the division?\u201d he said on MMA Hour this week. \n\u201cI did say that if he (GSP) did win, he wouldn\u2019t fight any one of us and we\u2019d just be more tangled up. \n\u201c(He\u2019s) backtracking on all these other levels. It\u2019s clear as day, he\u2019s not fighting. He\u2019s not fighting any of us. He\u2019s too small. Guys like me will feast on Georges. He won\u2019t last here. \n\u201cHe had his opportunity, he got his belt, good for you. Move along. Let us handle our business here.

The use of nitric acid in etching steel and photoengraving and its wide application in the metal processing industries are key factors fueling the growth of the market. The growing use of concentrated nitric acid in the purification of metals and in the manufacturing of drugs are notable trends expected to unlock exciting opportunities for market players in the coming years. Owing to its marked oxidizing properties, nitric acid is preferred as an oxidizer in liquid-fueled rockets.The global nitric acid is projected to be valued at US$16,839.5 Mn by 2017 end and is projected to be worth US$20,420.8 Mn by 2022 end.
