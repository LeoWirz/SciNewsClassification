We hope we can reach an agreement to resolve these issues soon,\u201d Google said.\nAmazon said in a statement, \u201cGoogle is setting a disappointing precedent by selectively blocking customer access to an open website.\u201d\n\nIt said it hoped to resolve the issue with Google as soon as possible but customers could access YouTube through the internet \u2013 not an app \u2013 on the devices in the meantime.\n\nThe break has been a long time coming.\n\nAmazon kicked the Chromecast, Google\u2019s television player, off its retail website in 2015, along with Apple Inc\u2019s TV player.\n\nAmazon had explained the move by saying it wanted to avoid confusing customers who might expect its Prime Video service to be available on devices sold by Amazon.\n\nAmazon and Apple mended ties earlier this year when it was announced Prime Video would come to Apple TV; not so with Google.\n\nIn September, Google cut off YouTube from the Amazon Echo Show, which had displayed videos on its touchscreen without video recommendations, channel subscriptions and other features.\n\nAmazon later reintroduced YouTube to the device.\n\nHowever, the voice commands it added violated the use terms and on Tuesday Google again removed the service.\n\nThe Fire TV loses access to its YouTube app on Jan. 1, Google said.\n\nAmazon has sold that device for longer than the Echo Show, meaning more customers may now be affected.

He fell four metres off a ladder which is quite a way up. \n\"We are thankful to everyone who has donated money. It means a lot to us. The money is going to be going towards a flight to get him home. It will cost quite a bit.\" \nMr Williamson is currently being treated in Middlemore Hospital, Auckland. \nFriend Scott McKeon, who lives in Rogiet, described Mr Williamson as a \"larger than life\" character. \n\"I have known him since primary school in Caldicot,\" said the 30-year-old. \n\"He is a great guy to be around and is always up beat. \n\"Understandably he wants to come home after what has happened in Auckland. He has been left paralysed from the chest down - but he can move his arms which is great.\" \nHe added: \"I know Matt well and that is how I know he will pull through this.\" \nMr McKeon said his friend hoped to be home in about three months. \nHe said: \"He is currently at a spinal rehabilition centre. \n\"He can only fly once he has had rehabilitation. That should take about three months - that is what we are all hoping for and so is Matt. \n\"Because of what has happened Matt cannot just get on a plane and fly home. \n\"I hope people keep on donating for my friend.\" \nFor more information or to donate to help Mr Williamson come home, visit www.givealittle.co.nz/cause/lets-get-matthew-home", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matthew williamson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "matt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew page", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justine bennett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gwent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zealand caldicot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auckland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middlemore hospital", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:34.024+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dded529722f57fb608b66ef4c43085efc38a2097", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_vCLDx9iTsV2UI3GEtHezKPU9D8PH7Tsj1egp_P2OjFZVLANGofHsLpYwIbqbSeaqxb6Or3DEn6IPX7KELV_aX1oPnSWU5vEshltrH7hYH0TGjVlhR7mmsK0duEISa8_4-", "site_full": "www.sfgate.com", "site": "sfgate.com", "site_section": "http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/", "site_categories": ["media", "social"], "section_title": "San Francisco Arts, Entertainment, Movies, Nightlife and Events - SFGate", "title": "Global shares mostly calm as investors focus on US tax, jobs", "title_full": "Global shares mostly calm as investors focus on US tax, jobs - SFGate", "published": "2017-12-07T09:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/01/14663796/3/rawImage.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 943, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dded529722f57fb608b66ef4c43085efc38a2097", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_vCLDx9iTsV2UI3GEtHezKPU9D8PH7Tsj1egp_P2OjFZVLANGofHsLpYwIbqbSeaqxb6Or3DEn6IPX7KELV_aX1oPnSWU5vEshltrH7hYH0TGjVlhR7mmsK0duEISa8_4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sfgate.com", "published": "2017-12-07T09:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "Global shares mostly calm as investors focus on US tax, jobs", "text": "Photo: Vincent Yu, AP Image 1 of / 2 2 A man stands in front of a bank electronic board showing the Hong Kong share index outside a Hong Kong local bank Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017.

Containers and DevOps may be thought of as different trends, but one would be much less powerful without the other \nContainerisation is one of the most exciting tech trends to emerge over the last few years . Designed to work at operating system level, it's a popular virtualisation method that allows IT professionals to deploy and distribute applications easily. \nThis form of application management, which is named after shipping containers, allows almost any application to be stored and transported quickly. Containers, which are simply encapsulated systems, are given their own environments and hosts to run on. This process strips the need for potential dependencies. Developing agile practices for newer DevOps microservice applications will be key to embracing digital transformation. Learn more in this free whitepaper. Download now \nContainerisation is being used in a range of areas in technology, particularly DevOps, a software practice that results in the unification of software development and software operations . There's a growing demand for new ways of managing application systems and containers represent a big change in the industry, enabling easy migration from legacy platforms to more modern ones, including the cloud. Reliable storage option \nBased in London, StorageOS is one of the companies at the cutting edge of this technology. The firm has developed a software-based, decentralised storage platform that provides container storage. It's been designed specifically for developers and professionals working in the field of DevOps. Chris Brandon, CEO of the company, says there's an increasing need for reliable storage options for teams working on large numbers of applications on a weekly basis. \n\"In order to meet the requirements of existing applications, and specifically with the increase of cloud native apps, we are seeing a rapid increase in the adoption of persistent storage for containers in the enterprise. This is being led by DevOps teams who, as they create and develop hundreds of new applications weekly, are reliant on the right environments to give them the agility to spin up projects with their databases quickly. Containers are ideal for these scenarios,\" he tells Cloud Pro . \nWhile container technology has certainly created a lot of buzz in the industry, it's not perfect, Brandon says. He calls on companies to keep their options open and explore cloud native storage options in particular. \"Even though container technology has passed the early adopter phase, organisations are still struggling to find the right storage solutions for the evolving container world,\" he adds. \n\"Organisations need to look for cloud native storage that offers persistent enterprise storage designed specifically for the container ecosystem. Containers are the engine running the DevOps industry and as the container market continues to explode, getting the storage right will allow everyone to take advantage of the technology.\" Easing processes \nDeploying multiple applications can be a time-consuming process, but containers are capable of making this easier for companies. Derek Weeks, of software automation specialist Sonatype, says this technology is transforming the DevOps industry in a number of ways. \n\"The simple fact is that adopting containers eases successful deployment of applications on premises or in the cloud. Fast development and deployment is the backbone of a DevOps culture, so it stands to reason that something that enables this, such as containers, is the backbone of the backbone. This is backed up by Docker 's predictions that container pulls from DockerHub alone would double from 6 billion in 2016 to 12 billion in 2017,\" he says. \nBut there are caveats, he says, explaining that containers aren't universal and can differ in terms of quality, especially when it comes to security. Companies need to be aware of this. \"Not all containers are created equal. With every organisation that adopts containers relying on a software supply chain which can include hundreds of suppliers and thousands of container versions, quality and security are paramount. But there is still some way to go; in our DevSecOps Community Survey, 88% of companies revealed that they were concerned about security, yet only 53% were using technologies to help them regularly assess their containers' security,\" he continues. \n\"To drive maximum value from containers and improve security practices, companies must continuously assess their container images for vulnerabilities and vulnerable dependencies. After all, if you can't see them all, you can't fix the ones at risk. As no container can be perfectly secure, the best organisations will use software supply chain automation to locate those vulnerable containers, recall, and update the image, and then redeploy safer versions within minutes. \n\"The first rule of DevOps is to never pass a known defect downstream. The second rule is to enable rapid correction when failures occur. Managing containers in an automated software supply chain is the true DevOps approach.\" Boosting productivity \nJitendra Thethi, assistant vice president of technology and enterprise at software company Aricent, has worked with container technology in the past. Much of his role involves scaling cloud services and developing new software by leveraging emerging technologies. He says containers can improve efficiency and performance in DevOps. \n\"Containers enable applications to be scaled and can run on different environments across clouds. The developers will be responsible for packaging container images that get published on a repository. \n\"The operations team can then pull these container images and run them without the need for change. This makes DevOps practices much more effective and efficient, as it eliminates the need for manual input where errors can happen. It's worth bearing in mind that automation tools enable the construction of container images as part of their build cycle. Continuous Integration (CI) tools can take a source code, construct the build, run unit tests, coverage and [create] an image that becomes environment agnostic. \n\"Filesystems from software containerisation platforms can make the incremental additions to images much more efficient by enabling the layering of applications. New versions will affect only the application layers and the other layers, like dependencies, can be reused.\" \u2018The ADC Guide to Managing Hybrid (IT and DevOps) Application Delivery\u2019 delves into the primary drivers and implications for a hybrid application delivery infrastructure. Download now Security focus \nTim Mackey, a technical evangelist for Black Duck Software, also specialises in container solutions. His company's software helps firms locate, manage and secure open source code and he recently gave a talk at DevSecCon, where he spoke about what happens when good containers go bad. Mackey says companies need to ensure they have the right security in place if container technology is to be effective. \n\"For all its virtues, containerisation doesn't overcome the need for application security. And since a substantial element of most application software is open source code, organisations need to have processes in place to ensure any vulnerabilities in open source, including in containers, are patched as soon as fixes are published,\" he says. \n\"When you're using commercial software, the vendor is responsible for deployment guidance, security vulnerability notification, and solutions for disclosed vulnerabilities. If you're using open source software, those responsibilities shift. When Black Duck analysed audits of over 1,000 commercial applications we found the average application included 147 unique open source components. Tracking down the fork, version, and project stability for each component is a monumental task for development teams. \n\"We know that containerisation has increased the pace of deployment, creating questions of trust for many administrators. The key to protecting your applications in production is by maintaining visibility into your open source components and proactively patching vulnerabilities as they are disclosed. And if you assume from the outset your containers will be compromised, you can prepare by making changes that make it much harder to mount an attack from a compromised container.\" \nMany businesses are still relying on ageing infrastructure to handle their application needs, and while container technology is relatively new, it offers so much potential. DevOps specialists deal with great workloads, but by making use of containers, they're able to ease processes and boost productivity. It's also clear that they speed up operations. We'll no doubt see more firms adopt this innovation as it continues to evolve.

Separately, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has questioned the Punjab government\u2019s decision not to take action against the police when after, according to the report, they deliberately ignored the chief minister\u2019s call to \u201cdisengage\u201d and continued with the operation to remove street barriers.Mr Qadri presented his analysis of the report at a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, insisting that the report had clearly fixed responsibility of the killings in Model Town on June 17, 2014 on the chief minister, the law minister and certain other officials of the Punjab government.He read out a part of the report\u2019s conclusion in which the head of the inquiry commission had asked the Punjab government to empower it under \u201cSection 11 of the Punjab Tribunals Ordinance\u201d so that the commission could fix responsibility for the incident, but the government had refused to do so.\u201cHad the commission gone ahead and fixed responsibility beyond its terms of reference (TORs), the whole report could have been declared null and void,\u201d Mr Qadri argued, and claimed that whatever was written in the report was enough to indict CM Sharif and Mr Sanaullah, as well as other officials of the provincial government. \u201cThe party has an attested copy of the report, but not the original one. We are trying to get the original copy as well and compare them to see if the one given to us has been tampered with or not,\u201d he told the press. There was some doubt regarding an incorrect date on one of the pages, but the party was not in a position to claim that the report had been tampered with, he said.The PAT and its lawyers have been studying the report and are expected to make a carefully crafted move, he said, adding: \u201cWe do not want to act in haste or jump to conclusions. The lawyers are studying it and the next course of action will be finalised in a joint meeting of the core committee and legal team. However, PAT\u2019s workers should get ready for any kind of call. Even my container is ready. But we will not act in haste.\u201dHe said, \u201cSince I am also a student of law, today\u2019s analysis of the report is my own. The report has clearly called Shahbaz Sharif a liar (referring to his orders to disengage).\u201d Mr Qadri insisted that the police only did what they were told to do. The entire operation had political underpinnings, which, of course, were of the Sharifs\u2019, not of the police. So, the responsibility is that of the Sharif brothers, he added.Separately, PTI leaders Shafqat Mahmood and Mian Mahmoodur Rashid claimed in separate pressers that the Najafi report had exposed the Punjab government\u2019s conspiracy which was aimed at using force to stop the PAT chief from holding a sit-in in Islamabad. The document carries reports from all departments which show that the removal of barriers was just an excuse, whereas the real intention was to intimidate PAT workers, they claimed. \u201cThe chief minister had lied that he did not know about the firing incident. His house is so close to the spot, how could he feign ignorance?\u201d Shafqat wondered. If the chief minister had actually ordered disengagement, why were his orders ignored by the police? The fact is that he only invented the term \u201cdisengagement\u201d afterwards to save himself. The fact of the matter is that the entire planning and execution was overseen by Mr Sanaullah on behalf of the chief minister, he added.\u201cThe firing took place on instructions of the chief minister and that is precisely why the report was not made public in the first place,\u201d he said.Mr Rashid questioned why the chief minister had not acted when his disengagement orders were ignored by the police. He termed it an end of the \u201cwrit of the government\u201d.They said that CM Sharif and Mr Sanaullah must quit, and criminal proceedings should be initiated against them.

After that they slit their necks with machetes and left the females for dead (Image: Getty Images AsiaPac) 3 of 15 \nRoshida said after the military attacked her they left her and set her home on fire.

They took her husband out of the house and to the riverbank and shot him (Image: Getty) 5 of 15 \nThen they came back into her house and grabbed Dildar's baby from her arms and stabbed him in the head. They killed another one of her children by cutting his throat, and another by beating her over the head with a rifle. She was then raped. (Image: Getty) 6 of 15 \nThey then beat her and she pretended to be dead. When they left, they set her house on fire. Her 10 year old daughter, Nurkalima, was severely injured when the military beat her over the head with the blades of machetes, but she helped her mum crawl past the burning bodies of her children and out of the burning house. (Image: Getty Images AsiaPac) 7 of 15 \nFor five days Dildar hid in the hills and when the military left, she went back to Tula Toli on her way to the Bangladesh border. All that was left of her village was smoke and ask where houses used to be.

The military shot her son in the stomach and cut off his head as she watched. They then gang raped Sunuara in a six hour ordeal. She was eight months pregnant. She was punched in the stomach and kicked. Her husband and brother carried Sunuara to the border for six days where she eventually gave birth in hospital. Her baby died the next day.

She managed to flee but five others in the house all burned to death. Minwara spent days hiding in the paddy field and forest until a group of other people came through and helped her. She spent days walking with them to the Bangladesh border, where she took a boat across to Bangladesh. (Image: Getty) 11 of 15 \n\"Here in Bangladesh, I feel so restless and worried.

In total, the list named 17 countries for 'failing to meet agreed tax good governance standards'. The UAE was named as part of that list while an additional 47 countries are said to have committed to addressing deficiencies in their tax systems and to meet the required criteria, following contacts with the EU. The UAE's Undersecretary of the Ministry of Finance, Younis Haji Al Khouri, said: \"The UAE has worked to meet the European Union's requirements in terms of exchanging tax-related information.\" He added: \"We have committed to a reform process which will be finalised by October 2018, and we are absolutely confident this will ensure the UAE is swiftly removed from the list. We look forward to moving into the next phase of cooperation with our EU partners on the important issue of tax regulation.\" The UAE government's official statement noted that, \"since early 2017, the UAE has worked transparently with our European Union counterparts to ensure that we meet the criteria laid down by European Union Member States. So, what's EU's problem? While releasing the list on December 5, the EU noted that \"this unprecedented exercise should raise the level of tax good governance globally and help prevent the large-scale tax abuse exposed in recent scandals such as the 'Paradise Papers'. However, the UAE has addressed every issue raised by the EU, and the latter has acknowledged the same. \"As the European Union has itself noted, we have addressed each and every issue the EU has raised. We have drafted, legislated and implemented significant reforms to ensure that we remain in lock-step with our OECD partners and international best practice,\" the UAE government said in the statement. \"The sole outstanding issue is the implementation of the BEPS Minimum Standard, which we have committed to finalise by October 2018 and ratify by March 2019 - giving our federal structure sufficient time to allow for ratification across the seven Emirates. We stand by this realistic timeline,\" it noted. BEPS, or base erosion and profit shifting, refers to tax avoidance strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to artificially shift profits to low or no-tax locations. Under the inclusive framework, over 100 countries and jurisdictions are collaborating on the implementation of the OECD/ G20 BEPS Package. \"We will continue to work with our international partners on this issue, and are confident that we will be recognised as an internationally compliant partner at the EU's next review,\" the UAE said in the statement.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

financial assistance to anyone that would invest in ranches and animal husbandry in any part of the state. Ikpeazu said this in Umuahia, adding that the gesture is part of government\u2019s measures to discourage open grazing and the resultant clashes.\u201c I wish to state that this government will pay N1 million grant as incentive to anyone that would heed my call to set up a ranch or engage in commercial animal husbandry in Abia,\u201d  he said. The governor advised people of the state to revive animal husbandry and he charged the people to consider rearing of local species of some animals in order to increase the sources of meat protein and reduce reliance on beef. He opined that establishing ranches would minimize clashes between herdsmen and farmers, adding that the anti-grazing bill, which is awaiting passage in the state house of assembly \u201c will not on its own completely solve the problem of herdsmen/farmers conflict\u201d ,  he said. \n\nHe feared that the implementation of the law, might suffer some encumbrances just like similar laws in the country. Meanwhile, the governor has discouraged Nigerians from eating foreign rice and urged them to embrace Nigerian-made rice, saying there is no justification for Nigerians not to grow what they eat, since the country has the potential to achieve food security. The Commissioner for Information, Mr. Okiyi Kalu, also said that the administration is passionate about reviving oil palm production in the state. Okiyi added that government is working out incentives to encourage farmers resuscitate oil palm plantation. He described palm oil as \u201c oil of peace\u201d,  saying it is a very good source for foreign exchange and has never been a source of conflict or environmental degradation like crude oil. The governor, last year set up a committee comprising security agencies, traditional rulers, representatives of farmers\u2019 associations, to regulate the activities of herdsmen through reviewing their relationship with their host communities. The Commissioner of Police and chairman of the committee, Mr. Anthony Ogbizi,said that the governor also promised to pay compensation to any farmer or herdsmen for damages suffered as a result of open grazing. \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "okezie ikpeazu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ikpeazu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "okiyi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "okiyi kalu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony ogbizi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "abia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umuahia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:37.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b6612aad66ee946e6e200eec7667e23ef7a851be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRDAGWeT3fXPlaUaFMJLiGFsh3OWALC61weK8A5O73CgOqKE2sgBPLkk_3KdiKAoyc-", "site_full": "www.alrakoba.net", "site": "alrakoba.net", "site_section": "http://alrakoba.net/rss-action-feed-m-news-id--feed-rss20.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0643\u0648\u0628\u0629 | \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631", "title": "\u0645\u062c\u0644\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0627\u0631\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u064a\u062c\u064a \u0648\u0644\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u0632\u0641\u0627\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0633 ..!

Never have truer words been spoken, and they were delivered in the best speech Trump has ever given. \nWhat Trump did was stunning. He could just have signed the waiver of the law passed in 1995 compelling the executive branch to move America\u2019s embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He did it six months ago, just like his three immediate predecessors did every six months since 1996. Or he could have not signed the waiver and simply said he was going to start the process of building the new embassy. \nInstead, he called the international community\u2019s seven-decade bluff and ended a delusion about the future that has prevented Palestinians from seeing the world and their own geopolitical situation clearly. It is a bold shift. \nThe idea that Jerusalem is not Israel\u2019s capital has been a global pretense for decades, including here in the United States. It\u2019s a pretense because Jerusalem has been Israel\u2019s capital from the moment the new country secured a future by winning a bloody war for independence waged against it by Arab nations after they rejected the UN partition of the old British mandate into a Jewish state and an Arab state. \nUnder the plan, Jerusalem was to be an international city governed by the United Nations. But the Arab effort to push the Jews into the sea \u2014 an effort no other nation on earth intervened in to prevent \u2014 left a divided Jerusalem in the hands of the Jews in the West and Jordan in the East.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "podhoretz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arab", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "all-new middle east trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:37.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c37c8a5d8b445fca98c9949afe92ff5ffcc45518", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUusH4M9dfhLXFU5LmgHV0zo", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/lgbt/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/lgbt/ - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, &amp; Transgender - 4chan", "title": "/femgen/ - Pawe\u0142 Paulus Mazur edition", "title_full": "/lgbt/ - /femgen/ - Pawe\u0142 Paulus Mazur edition - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender - 4chan", "published": "2017-11-29T03:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 133, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.046, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b4f1b74c62f44f3e184a07c98023aeb60eeffacd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUusH4M9dfhLXOd4dnUASTcDYs98n8FAyaQ-", "ord_in_thread": 125, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-06T15:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>9246131\nget breasts removed?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:37.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c37c8a5d8b445fca98c9949afe92ff5ffcc45518", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUusH4M9dfhLXFU5LmgHV0zo", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/lgbt/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/lgbt/ - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, &amp; Transgender - 4chan", "title": "/femgen/ - Pawe\u0142 Paulus Mazur edition", "title_full": "/lgbt/ - /femgen/ - Pawe\u0142 Paulus Mazur edition - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender - 4chan", "published": "2017-11-29T03:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 133, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.046, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ceb3313b59f08ea3bdd49939f476227c2410647e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUusH4M9dfhLXOd4dnUASTcDKXFhatpFWBk-", "ord_in_thread": 128, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-06T17:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>9246039\nUh, I wasn't that poster.

Norton and Matt Murphy \nSTATE HOUSE NEWS SERVICE \nBOSTON -- Their chamber seemingly adrift, state senators were in constant contact with each other in the days leading up to Monday night's dramatic vote to elect Harriette Chandler as acting president, and the chatter is unlikely to diminish in the weeks ahead. \nThree senators - Sens. Eileen Donoghue, Linda Dorcena Forry and Karen Spilka - have now publicly acknowledged their desire to seek the presidency if a \"vacancy\" occurs, and a fourth - Sen. Sal DiDomenico - all but confirmed his interest in the post in an interview Tuesday night. The self-acknowledgement of those senators' ambitions marks a rare spilling out into the public of a process typically reserved for back-channel jockeying. \n\"I don't imagine the discussion going forward will die down at any time soon given the nature but there are at least three or four names that are being put out there and mine is one of them as being a potential candidate for president,\" Sen. Eileen Donoghue of Lowell said Tuesday morning on WCAP-AM. \nDonoghue's name was in the mix over the weekend in a volley of phone calls among senators uncertain about the fate of their now former president, Stanley Rosenberg of Amherst, who is being investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee while law enforcement officials begin examining allegations that Bryon Hefner, Rosenberg's husband, sexually assaulted men with business pending on Beacon Hill and bragged about his alleged influence in the Senate. Advertisement \nDiscussing the tumultuous few days with her local radio station, Donoghue said she did not call her colleagues seeking their support for the presidency, but said several senators asked her if she would be interested in serving as president. There were \"many, many phone calls\" to and from senators, said Donoghue, describing how she spoke to her colleagues while she attended a higher education conference in North Carolina over the weekend. \n\"Sometimes if you know there's going to be a vacancy, lots of jockeying happens and lots of conversations take place but I can assure you I was not making calls trying to solicit votes,\" Donoghue said. \"I don't deny that I was getting calls and people asking me if I would consider serving in that capacity. And one thing I have said is that until there is a vacancy and we know there's going to be a vacancy I'm not going to be disloyal to the president. I'm not going to try to undermine him. He's going through a very difficult time right now and I want to be supportive of him.\" \nShe later added, \"I'm not going to go out and solicit any votes while we have a president in place, period. If there is a vacancy I would certainly explore that if there was support.\" \nSpilka, an Ashland Democrat, has also denied lobbying for votes over the weekend, but indicated that she is interested in the position. The Ways and Means Committee chairmanship, which she was given by Rosenberg, has been a powerful launching pad to the presidency in past years, and could become a committee to watch as budget season rolls around early next year and her vice-chairman, DiDomenico, also eyes the presidency. \n\"It is with a great sense of responsibility for the important work of the Senate, and with the utmost respect for the good work of my colleagues, that I have decided that I will seek the Senate Presidency should the vacancy arise,\" Spilka said in a statement Wednesday. \nForry, a Dorchester Democrat and assistant majority whip, also confirmed her aspirations to the presidency. Asked Monday about her interest, Forry told the News Service, \"We'll have to see how it goes.\" But on Wednesday, she issued a more direct statement. \"If there is a vacancy for Senate President, I do intend to pursue that opportunity. However, right now, my focus is squarely on supporting acting President Chandler in all ways and my other colleagues. We have vital work to conduct for our constituents and the people of the Commonwealth.\" \nLawmakers over the years have frequently pledged loyalty to legislative leaders, but vacancies are rare and the odds of seizing a post like House speaker or Senate president are enhanced, or diminished, by a lawmaker's ability to round up commitments before the actual vacancy occurs. \nNo one knows if Rosenberg will return to the presidency, just as senators also did not know over the weekend whether he would dig in, give up the presidency temporarily or permanently, or resign. On Thursday, Chandler said Rosenberg would remain Senate president but recuse himself from the investigation. On Friday, Rosenberg said he was confident an investigation would show Hefner had no influence on Senate policy and said Hefner was heading into treatment for alcohol dependence. By Monday, Rosenberg relinquished the presidency with what he called a \"leave of absence\" for the duration of the investigation, saying he hoped the move would help ensure a \"fully independent and credible\" investigation and encourage people to come forward and cooperate with investigators. \nDonoghue, who chairs the Senate Steering and Policy Committee, said Tuesday it was \"appropriate\" that Chandler made it \"abundantly clear\" that she would hold the president's post only temparily. \"If there is going to be a vacancy, it should be a level playing field,\" the Lowell senator said. \nIn a statement Wednesday, Donoghue said, \"I will run for Senate President if a vacancy exists. I appreciate the encouragement I have already received from some of my colleagues.\" \nDuring her radio appearance, Donoghue said Rosenberg was paying a \"heavy price\" for the actions of his spouse, but said the allegations outlined in the Boston Globe \"bombshell story\" had unsettled senators. \nEven if Rosenberg is exonerated by his colleagues, who are on track to make a recommendation based on the results of an independent investigator they plan to hire, he may not return to the president's chair either by virtue of his own choice or the collective decision of his colleagues, Donoghue said. \n\"We're in uncharted territory,\" she said. \"You can't say, 'Well, this has happened before and people have come back. We don't know. This hasn't happened before. Is it difficult to do so? I think that's something that if he were to be exonerated of any wrongdoing he may still have to make that decision whether he can be effective, and then the body would have to make that decision.\" \nForry, in an television interview on WGBH's \"Greater Boston\" on Tuesday night, also made the the point that Rosenberg's return to the rostrum is not guaranteed even though he stated his desire to take a \"leave of absence\" and Chandler has said she will give up the presidency once the Ethics Committee investigation is complete. \n\"It is not temporarily....,\" Forry said, later in the interview explaining, \"It will be up to the body. We're having an investigation, but also if the investigation finds nothing, we don't know what's going to happen.\" \nRosenberg's shared leadership model contrasts sharply with the House, where Speaker Robert DeLeo is viewed as the shot caller in chief in a branch that he has run since 2009, after shattering his own term limit rule. In the days since Rosenberg stepped aside, it's becoming clear that Senate members feel empowered - the goal of his leadership style - so much so that they're already not shy about giving voice to succeeding him. \nDiDomenico, an Everett Democrat and vice chair of Ways and Means, resigned from the Ethics Committee ahead of the start of the Rosenberg investigation to avoid an appearance of a conflict after his name surfaced as a possible contender for the presidency. Asked whether he did aspire to the presidency, DiDomenico was less declarative than the other contenders, but said, \"You never know what the future will bring.\" \nOn Wednesday, DiDomenico told reporters, \"I think this is a very fluid time in the Senate.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donoghue", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sal didomenico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bryon hefner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eileen donoghue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linda dorcena forry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanley rosenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spilka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harriette chandler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hefner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "everett democrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lowell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "didomenico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt murphy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert deleo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael p. norton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam doran/shns", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karen spilka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chandler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forry", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "senate steering and policy committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate ethics committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ways and means committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ways and means", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "news service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston globe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wgbh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethics committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashland", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amherst", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beacon hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorchester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:38.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5528d364bd590e0c1ede00e297501528f02ffb64", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPZcJnGZhyogXCXXvoVAD3CseTWjbG9uTLcrJaTE2xpviDO9IrNc.mCSmuc0sH4sSuvgsQvNQzd0gy1LXijN.0hWmcHnMQ92q3MmcKLJY3yzg", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com", "site": "tripadvisor.com", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g293951-i7006-Malaysia.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Malaysia Forum, Travel Discussion for Malaysia - TripAdvisor", "title": "One day in langkawi - Langkawi", "title_full": "One day in langkawi - Langkawi Forum - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-07T10:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 189, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5528d364bd590e0c1ede00e297501528f02ffb64", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPZcJnGZhyogXCXXvoVAD3CseTWjbG9uTLcrJaTE2xpviDO9IrNc.mCSmuc0sH4sSuvgsQvNQzd0gy1LXijN.0hWmcHnMQ92q3MmcKLJY3yzg", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ZeeS345", "published": "2017-12-07T10:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "One day in langkawi - Langkawi", "text": "Hi , We will be travelling to KL in late jan and hoping to fly into langkawi for 24hrs (arrival 2pm depature next day 3 pm) we are hoping to cover island hoping and parasailing the day we arrive , and cable car, sky dome and the 3D art museum the day we r leaving( need to finish up by 12pm to catch the flight) Looking for advice , have we planned too much for 24 hrs?

In addition to voting to create the strategy, in coordination with the city, the committee also voted unanimously to ask the City Council to identify funding for the repairs. They were adamant that the money should not come out of the district's already tight budget. \n\"It's getting to the point where systems are starting to break down, things are starting to break down all at once,\" committee member Steve Gendron said, acknowledging that the plan will do no good without the money and enough staff to do the repairs. \nSome progress has already been made. The high school, and all other Lowell schools, are fully heated again and maintenance staff plans to fix 14 broken boilers that are part of redundancy systems by the end of December. \nOn Wednesday, the committee also: \nn Entered into contracts for the busing of homeless students. \nn Reviewed a report on participation in school breakfast and lunch programs. \nn Received a report on diversity recruitment efforts.

I'm there sometimes in the Key West Writers Guild booth, and there are lots of local artists, craft beers, music, and delicious food. But our must-stop is Tennessee Steve's BBQ rib booth. Oh my the ribs are tasty! And I would not even attempt to make them. But I can and do make the healthy and delicious cole slaw that we serve along with the ribs. \n\nI have started buying Fresh Express packages of super kale salad in the supermarket. It comes with packets of pumpkin seeds and cranberries, along with a poppyseed dressing that I don\u2019t use because of sodium content.  \n\nSince I always like to try to have extra vegetables on hand, especially during the holiday treat indulgence period, I decided to make a big pile of this coleslaw that I could eat for lunches and dinners all week, in addition to a rib side dish. The \"recipe\" is very flexible, so you could add carrots or peppers or onions or various herbs as you choose. The secret is to prepare the vegetables ahead of time, and then take them out and dress them as needed. I suppose you could even add them to soups and stews if the whim hits you. Ingredients 1/2 cabbage 8 to 10 Brussel sprouts Two broccoli stalks Large handful of kale 1/3 cup pepitas (pumpkin seeds) 1/3 cup dried cranberries, raisins, or cherries For the dressing 2 tablespoons good mayonnaise 1/8 cup or more cider vinegar 1/4 cup olive oil 1 teaspoon celery seed 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon sugar \n\n\nFresh black pepper Either chop, or even better, put the vegetables through your Cuisinart so they are all shredded. Mix. Stir the mayonnaise with the vinegar, celery seed, salt and sugar, and then whip in the olive oil. Taste to be sure it\u2019s seasoned to your liking. An hour or two before serving, mix the dressing with the vegetables, then fold in the pepitas and cherries. You could even add a sprinkle of goat cheese if the mood struck you! We served this with Tennessee Steve\u2019s ribs and baked beans Yum! (Recipe for beans to come...) \n\n\nBecause my purchased copies of SNOWBOUND, this year's anthology of best New England Crime Stories from Level Best Books arrived yesterday, and because it's holiday season, and because my short story \"Dorothea and the Case of the Noxious Nanny\" got the lead position (wow and yay!), I'd love to give a copy away. Leave a comment telling us who on your list would enjoy the short stories (of course, it can be you.) I'll post a winner on Monday, December 11! \n\n\n\n\nLucy Burdette  writes the Key West food critic mysteries--find them wherever books are sold! Find her on  Facebook ,  Twitter , and Pinterest--Instagram too... \n\n\n\nAnd the next Artisan Market at the Restaurant Store is December 17, 10-2.

If she did not, he would begin a formal search process. \nUnder state law, superintendents have the sole authority over principal hiring, but Khelfaoui's proposed strategy did not satisfy a majority of the School Committee. \nBefore voting to instruct Khelfaoui to begin a hiring search regardless of Busteed's performance, committee members Steve Gendron, Jackie Doherty, Connie Martin, and Robert Gignac decided not to request a legal opinion on whether they could issue such an order. \nGendron said the vote adhered with the district's existing policies, but some of his colleagues, including Gignac, who eventually voted for the motion, questioned whether that was the case. \nRobert Hoey, Andre Descoteaux, and Mayor Edward Kennedy voted against the motion. \n\"I think it's pretty foolish for us to spend the time and the money to go searching for somebody when we already have somebody that everybody is happy with,\" the superintendent said. Advertisement \"It's not ethical for us to carry out a search if our mind is already set on keeping a person.\" \nFollowing the meeting, he said that he would adhere to the committee's wishes by beginning a search but that if he decided Busteed was the best person for the job he would simply ask her to apply along with any other candidates and then hire her. \n\"At the end of the day, it's my decision anyway,\" he said, adding that reviewing resumes and checking references was no comparison for observing somebody actually do the job. \nKhelfaoui hired Busteed as the interim after a search process for a permanent head of school earlier this year produced an unsatisfactory pool of candidates. \nSeveral committee members said Wednesday that they have received nothing but positive comments about her performance from school staff. \nThe committee members who voted to instruct Khelfaoui to form a new search committee said they were not expressing a lack of faith in Busteed, rather they were urging the superintendent to follow the same hiring process that his predecessor had. \n\"We are simply requesting that you put forward a process that is transparent, that includes public input,\" Martin said. \nFollow Todd Feathers on Twitter @ToddFeathers.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "todd feathers", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lowell", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jackie doherty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salah khelfaoui", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marianne busteed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert gignac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gignac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gendron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andre descoteaux", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edward kennedy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve gendron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connie martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khelfaoui", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert hoey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "busteed", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lhs", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "school committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lowell high school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the school committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "khelfaoui", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "busteed", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:38.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dcdd1e79e35ba23c59e720dc3abf113ff77a68f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.YyO6OhKhkrFcqqHFPgZMisc1_OHKqNDzxObPIFua0L7FLWmTetSyZgPCHjOkYl.TIbO3Hr5dpDL8k98ZVMuzzIojhBCH44B0L.EwxoHSpIAvyIpARLc4BdAxRT6nj2hsbO8rWuSiVrHRz7l_eSn", "site_full": "www.khaleejtimes.com", "site": "khaleejtimes.com", "site_section": "http://www.khaleejtimes.com/services/rss/citytimes/rss.xml\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "KT Mobile", "title": "Man sprays hotel receptionist with fire extinguisher", "title_full": "Man sprays hotel receptionist with fire extinguisher", "published": "2017-12-07T14:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "NO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.khaleejtimes.com/storyimage/KT/20171207/ARTICLE/171209322/AR/0/AR-171209322.jpg&NCS_modified=\r\n&imageversion=1by1&exif=.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 7403, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 159, "comments": 0, "shares": 159}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dcdd1e79e35ba23c59e720dc3abf113ff77a68f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.YyO6OhKhkrFcqqHFPgZMisc1_OHKqNDzxObPIFua0L7FLWmTetSyZgPCHjOkYl.TIbO3Hr5dpDL8k98ZVMuzzIojhBCH44B0L.EwxoHSpIAvyIpARLc4BdAxRT6nj2hsbO8rWuSiVrHRz7l_eSn", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T14:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "Man sprays hotel receptionist with fire extinguisher", "text": "Video: Man sprays hotel receptionist with fire extinguisher Web Report Filed on December 7, 2017 Share Vote \n(YouTube screengrab) The man retaliated in the most bizarre way after an argument with the woman as she refused to book a room.

The school, located on the existing site, is set to open in 2019. \n\"I can't wait to be back at the future home of the Indians,\" said Jack McCarthy, executive director of the Massachusetts School Building Authority, moments before construction workers put up the final beam. \nTown Manager John Curran pointed to the amount of collaboration, communication and teamwork for this project. \n\"This obviously is a great day for the town of Billerica,\" he said. \nState Rep. Marc Lombardo graduated from the high school in 2000. Back then, he thought the building needed to be replaced, he said at the ceremony on Wednesday. \n\"It's great to see the progress here,\" Lombardo said. \n\"You can really see the investments we're making as a community for our children,\" he added. Advertisement \nSelectmen Chairman Andrew Deslaurier's daughter attends Hajjar Elementary School, where more than 12 native languages are spoken. While residents in town share different pasts, everyone -- including those students who speak various languages -- shares this building, he said. \n\"The promise has been made to them,\" Deslaurier said. \"No matter where they came from, they are part of Billerica now, and this is their inheritance to invest in themselves and we invest in them.\" \nSen. Cindy Friedman, of Arlington, was the late Sen. Ken Donnelly's chief of staff when they worked to secure funding for this project. She said the new school will provide students with the most up-to-date technology, preparing them for higher education and the workforce. \n\"We must continue to give our students all the support they need to excel, and I know that Billerica is committed to doing this,\" Friedman said. \nSuperintendent of Schools Tim Piwowar was the emcee for the ceremony. \n\"This is an amazing, amazing day,\" he said. \nIn June, construction workers erected the first steel beams for the new high school. \nThe goal has been to get the building weather-tight before winter. Trucks delivered materials five to six days per week throughout the summer, feeding the on-site steel progress. \nThe groundbreaking of the new school was in March. \nLast year, residents voted overwhelmingly to support the debt exclusion for the new school. \nThe new school designed for 1,610 students will cover grades 8-12 and the district's preschool program. \nLast year, the Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA) approved its $72 million share for the new school. Billerica's share is about $100 million after reimbursement from the state. The average Billerica homeowner -- with a house valued at $320,400 last year -- will pay an estimated additional $200 a year for the high-school construction cost for about three decades. \nFollow

He has studied it in the name of caste, class, prestige and many others. He often visits spaces which are supposed to challenge the assumptions behind the hierarchies. However, does they? The significant question henceforth is whether one can at all withstand the programme installed in the name of socialisation in the phase of child development. Malinowski decades ago mentioned something about the difference between what people say they do and what people actually do! To comprehend and make sense of the difference he mentioned something like participant observation. Participation to such an extent that you can actually write a whole ethnography based on Memory \u2013 remember Srinivas in his The Remembered Village \u2013 after his field notes were accidentally burnt. \nTo know the habitus of the people you really don\u2019t always have to have a long years of participant observation. It is possible, even more so, when you slither yourself through a microscopically different habitus carrying a sufficient experience of the underlying structure of the social whole. Hence, while you have read Homo Hierarchicus by Dumont, you also tend to find hierarchies beyond the arrangement of people, but also in the arrangement of objects. For example, caste is casted in our dreams, in ghosts ( petni is lower than Brahmadatti ), in flower ( jaba happens to be a low graded flower), so on and so forth. \nHowever, all of a sudden Kaleidoscope is slithering through organisations which are supposed to question and deconstruct the existing order of things, is ingrained within. \nHence, when the power centre arrives all others stand on their feet. Whenever, some power embodied persons are being felicitated the rest are on their feet. Kaleidoscope, incidentally referred a junior\u2019s name before naming the senior one\u2019s in their joint work he was immediately reminded about who works with whom in the \u2018proper\u2019 hierarchical order. \n\nHence, the mechanism of doing research remains to be the same. From the definition of the delivery of resources, the power equation remains to be the same. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kaldeidoscope", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dumont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "homo hierarchicus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malinowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "srinivas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "brahmadatti", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:38.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f73e27d1f8c53d99f7a71ac1213ef038aab55622", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS76VDaDFrrEZfSg47lFq8qPXBVcIHVr9Y8Vhh_35NwoPyPorbFwIpNCG.2Lz.8MYPawlq.MzwyOeG.p.ECfx60y1AerQRlPltF96CnpN1bPMGO.Wxl0oqoaVPbIOylC9hqv2agZG09Tc76dVowYkFo", "site_full": "www.prnewswire.com", "site": "prnewswire.com", "site_section": "http://rss.prnewswire.com/geography/MD/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "PR Newswire:", "title": "Holiday Program Brings Hope Home to Lung Cancer Patients", "title_full": "Holiday Program Brings Hope Home to Lung Cancer Patients", "published": "2017-12-07T11:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/616652/Bonnie_J_Addario_Lung_Cancer_Foundation_Logo.jpg?p=facebook", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3190, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f73e27d1f8c53d99f7a71ac1213ef038aab55622", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS76VDaDFrrEZfSg47lFq8qPXBVcIHVr9Y8Vhh_35NwoPyPorbFwIpNCG.2Lz.8MYPawlq.MzwyOeG.p.ECfx60y1AerQRlPltF96CnpN1bPMGO.Wxl0oqoaVPbIOylC9hqv2agZG09Tc76dVowYkFo", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bonnie J.

Addario Lung Cancer Foundation (ALCF) and Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., have joined forces to make the season brighter for lung cancer patients through the \"Bring Hope Home for the Holidays\" partnership. This program is helping lung cancer patients make holiday memories across the nation through December 20, 2017 . \nWith the support of ALCF, Boehringer Ingelheim volunteers are visiting lung cancer patients' homes, delivering holiday help for people fighting lung cancer -- the leading cause of cancer deaths nationally and in every state.  To help raise their spirits during the holidays, these volunteers will help lung cancer patients with holiday activities, such as trimming the tree, wrapping gifts, writing cards, or lighting the outside of the house.\n\"The holidays are hectic and wonderful moments for most. As a mother of three, I always wanted to make them magical for my family,\" said Bonnie J. Addario , lung cancer survivor and founder and chair of the ALCF. \"When I was diagnosed with lung cancer during the holidays, I found it almost impossible to make 'magic' for them. It broke my heart. This year it is our goal to ease the burden of patients by going to their homes and helping them prepare for the season. We are excited to partner with Boehringer Ingelheim and their amazing employees to help make a little magic for these patients and their families.\"\n\"'Bring Hope Home for the Holidays' is a unique effort to give back to the lung cancer community and deliver cheer and joy to their homes during this special time of year,\" said Jean-Michel Boers , president, Human Pharma, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. \"With the support of caring volunteers from Boehringer Ingelheim, we hope to make a positive difference in their lives and demonstrate the personal connection we feel with these remarkable people.\" \nDespite being the most deadly form of cancer, the stigma of lung cancer leads to underfunding. In fact, according to The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute, lung cancer is the number one cancer killer of men and women in every ethnic group in the U.S., taking more lives than breast, prostate and colon cancers combined. However, lung cancer research receives less funding than any other cancer, so it's important to understand that eight in 10 lung cancer patients never smoked or quit smoking decades ago. \n\"'Bring Hope Home for the Holidays' is a seasonal reminder that we need to provide loving support to people fighting this leading cancer killer,\" Addario said. \"Our goal is to transform lung cancer into a chronically managed disease and eventually find a cure.\"\nTo learn more about \"Bring Hope Home for the Holidays,\" visit http://www.lungcancerfoundation.org/bringhopehome/ \nAbout \"Bring Hope Home for the Holidays\"\nThe Bonnie J. Addario Lung Cancer Foundation (ALCF) and Boehringer Ingelheim are committed to making this holiday season brighter, with their \"Bring Hope Home for the Holidays\" national effort.

As fate has it, he might finally be ready to go,\n\u201c(I feel) good, day by day and trying to prepare myself to play in the game,\u201d Hogan said.\nThe wide receiver practiced yesterday for the first time since he injured his shoulder in Week 8 against the Chargers. The four-game absence was surprising, not because of the extent of the injury but because of Hogan\u2019s reputation for playing through just about everything.\nIn October alone, Hogan injured his ribs, spent a moment in concussion protocol and lost his two front teeth in practice. But it was pretty obvious that something was wrong when he remained on the turf after taking a shot during the victory against the Chargers.\n\u201cYeah, it hurt pretty bad,\u201d Hogan said with a grin.\nThrough Week 8, Hogan was tied for third on the team with 33 receptions, third with 438 yards and tied for the lead with Rob Gronkowski with five touchdowns. So with Gronk suspended against the Dolphins, a healthy Hogan could mitigate that loss.\nHe wouldn\u2019t declare himself ready to go, but put off positive vibes yesterday.\n\u201cToday was like the first day of school for me getting back out there on the field,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cI was excited to be out there. The competitor in you wants to be out there no matter what.\u201d\nRowe-verly excited\nIt wasn\u2019t too difficult to decipher Eric Rowe \u2019s excitement Sunday when he returned from a seven-game absence.\nRowe broke up the final pass of the game to secure the Patriots\u2019 23-3 victory against the Bills, and he celebrated as if the stakes were a lot higher. But it was a challenging recovery from a torn groin, and a breakup never felt so good.\n\u201cEven though it was at the end of the game and we had the game in hand,\u201d Rowe said, \u201cto me mentally, it was a confidence thing like, \u2018OK, it\u2019s coming back.\u2019\u2009\u201d\nRowe initially injured his groin in Week 2 against the Saints, missed a game and then tore it on the first play of the second half in Week 4 against the Panthers. The initial pain made it obvious that he\u2019d miss some time, and that became even clearer the next day with the swelling.\nRowe said it really hit him hard a week later when he was still struggling and couldn\u2019t run. Even the return to practice was a challenge, as he took a while to adapt to that speed.\nSo with all that behind him and a nice play in his return to game action, the emotion hit him.\n\u201cThe minute I hurt my groin again, obviously I was feeling down with all the work I had to do to get back up to full speed,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cI was happy just being out there, and then to make a play, too.\u201d\nTreatment day\nQuarterback Tom Brady opted for another maintenance day yesterday, marking the third consecutive week when he has sat out the opening workout to recover from the ongoing pounding that he has taken this season.\nThere is little reason to be concerned about Brady\u2019s array of ailments. His Achilles was the only injury listed on the team\u2019s official report in the past two weeks, but they didn\u2019t release an injury report yesterday due to the upcoming Monday game. They\u2019ll issue an injury report today after practice.\nBrady has also taken a couple shots to the hand this season, including Week 4 against the Panthers and Week 12 against the Dolphins. And he had a significant scrape on his left arm a couple weeks ago, among whatever else has bothered him this season.\nBrady was just one of five key players who didn\u2019t suit up yesterday in the bubble, which had the heat on full blast to get the Patriots ready for Miami. Cornerback Malcolm Butler , defensive end Deatrich Wise , linebacker Kyle Van Noy (calf) and right tackle Marcus Cannon (ankle) were also out.\nIt\u2019s unclear why Butler and Wise were out. Neither had an apparent issue against the Bills.\nVan Noy injured his calf against the Dolphins and aggravated it Sunday when he had a limited role to protect the issue. So it wouldn\u2019t be the least bit surprising for the Patriots to throttle back his workload to get himself right again.\nBack in the fold\nThe Patriots re-signed linebacker Jonathan Freeny , who took Gronkowski\u2019s roster exemption. Gronk won\u2019t count against the 53-man roster until Tuesday.\nFreeny said he has retained enough knowledge of the system to play Monday if called upon.\n\u201cI would definitely hope so,\u201d said Freeny, who was with the Patriots from 2015 until he was cut Labor Day Weekend. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for two years. In practice, I felt pretty good today. My recall was pretty good. If my number is called, I\u2019m going to do my best to prepare and study and get ready for Monday night.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://embed.sendtonews.com/player3/embedcode.js?fk=KG5SCeOG&cid=4407&offsetx=0&offsety=0&floatwidth=400&floatposition=bottom-right"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeff howe", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "chris hogan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "decem", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kyle van noy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill belichick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rex burkhead", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom brady", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick caserio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rowe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dwayne allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm butler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dion lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brady", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcus cannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan freeny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "achilles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcom brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gronkowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "butler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh mcdaniels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gronk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deatrich wise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "van noy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob gronkowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brandin cooks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric rowe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt west credit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "freeny", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gillette stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chargers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "panthers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england patriots", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dolphins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gillette stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foxboro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foxboro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:38.024+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5fb69bb96e1733a58729569c4f17e44b8b87a431", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWbvfsAuXZHi8_BNIxQXmXfccEP05meau0rgDgVxJbpu_.lLAl5kb.dTtlfqnJuM3YWZZDGFDJmKDZrkhIb.4vqJ507Ub2FIlxO3PYxrd6yB6Q--", "site_full": "headandneckdiseases.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://headandneckdiseases.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Head and Neck Diseases by Alexandros G.Sfakianakis", "title": "The effects of renal function on the reliability of intraoperative parathyroid hormone (ioPTH)", "title_full": "The effects of renal function on the reliability of intraoperative parathyroid hormone (ioPTH)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5fb69bb96e1733a58729569c4f17e44b8b87a431", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWbvfsAuXZHi8_BNIxQXmXfccEP05meau0rgDgVxJbpu_.lLAl5kb.dTtlfqnJuM3YWZZDGFDJmKDZrkhIb.4vqJ507Ub2FIlxO3PYxrd6yB6Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alexandros Sfakianakis (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "The effects of renal function on the reliability of intraoperative parathyroid hormone (ioPTH)", "text": "\nPublication date: December 2017\nSource: European Journal of Surgical Oncology, Volume 43, Issue 12\nAuthor(s): Richard Egan, Helen Iliff, Michael Stechman, David Scott-Coombes\n\n\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2kvDNxy", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "richard egan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael stechman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david scott-coombes     http://ift.tt/2kvdnxy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helen iliff", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "european journal of surgical oncology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:39.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c80e31f4ede0c87d3e3bbb65034bef87ba52b12b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8zICCHuagPh2Tas67WRGvCys6Yab5GtTK9NrYiOzSlCnI7iKKhEWgb", "site_full": "www.dailymotion.com", "site": "dailymotion.com", "site_section": "http://www.dailymotion.com/rss/en/1", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Dailymotion -

Nattrass 7th December 2017, 8:50 am Updated: 7th December 2017, 8:58 am CORONATION Street\u2019s Gary Windass has changed a lot since he first burst onto our screens as a wannabe tough-man. \nHaving made the transition from trouble-making layabout to army hero, Eddie and Anna\u2019s first born has had his fair share of ups and downs since he first appeared in Weatherfield nine years ago. Handout Corrie\u2019s Gary Windass has changed a lot since he first burst onto our screens as the chavy wannabe tough-man Who is Gary Windass and why is he a Cobbles favourite? \nGary first burst onto the scene in 2008, when his mother and father tried to swindle Gail Platt\u2019s boyfriend Joe McIntyre (father of Michelle Keegan\u2019s Tina) out of money for fitting a brand new kitchen. \nThis set him up to enjoy a long-running feud with David Platt, who was working for Joe and dating Tina at the time. \nAfter the Windass\u2019 moved into a house on the street Gary kept up his feud with the Platts. \nHe ends up heading to prison as a result of it, but following that he finds himself swaying towards a career in the military. \nGary\u2019s army career sees him back-and-forth between Weatherfield, though he is later the victim of a roadside bomb in Afghanistan, which brings him back to the Cobbles for good. Does Gary have a reputation on the street? \nDespite his ups and downs Gary is something of a lothario. \nHe\u2019s enjoyed a number of dalliances and relationships during his time as a Weatherfield resident. \nSettling down with Izzy Armstrong following a one-night stand with Kylie Turner (later Platt), Gary set about starting a family. \nHowever, things soon got messy, and he tried to cheat on her with Tina McIntyre. \nFollowing the demise of his relationship with Izzy he and Alya Nazir start a clandestine romance. \nDespite proposing to Alya the two split and Gary has more recently found himself loved-up with Sarah Platt. Rex Features Gary is currently playing the role of street love rat, and is cheating on girlfriend Sarah Platt What\u2019s is his storyline at the moment? \nThings, as usual, have become complicated. Having set himself up as a soldier of fortune/bodyguard in the Ukraine, Gary\u2019s PTSD has come back to haunt him and put pressure on his relationship. \nMore recently he\u2019s strayed from Sarah and ended up bedding Pat Phelan\u2019s daughter, who is now pregnant with his child. \nHe has now been killed off from the soap however, he will return on Christmas day after faking his own death . ITV Mikey North is the man behind Gary, and has played him since the character first appeared in 2008 Who plays Gary Windass? \nMikey North has played Gary since the character was first introduced back in 2008. \nThe Yorkshire-born star began acting at the age of 12, and was picked up by an agent whilst he was performing in a play at Scarborough Sixth Form College. \nHis first TV role was on The Bill in 2006, which he followed up with bit parts on other soaps. Where else would I know Mikey from? \nPrior to landing his role on Corrie Mikey starred as Helmsley in series two of BBC\u2019s Waterloo Road (2007). \nHe also landed a role in the TV Mini-Series Place of Execution the same year he bagged the role of Gary. \nMikey landed a supporting role in Dutch movie The Mark of Cain.
