By: Linda Stouffer Dec 7, 2017 - 4:49 AM Loading... of 0 \nMany children are coughing and suffering from the flu but it\u2019s not the only virus showing up in local schools as we get closer to the holidays. \nChannel 2\u2019s Linda Stouffer met baby Imogen, who was under the weather on Wednesday. Her mom brought her into the Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta\u2019s Care Center on Buford Highway where the decorations remind us: Santa\u2019s on his way. \n\u201cEvery time they\u2019re sick, even if it keeps you from seeing friends and celebrating the holidays, it makes a difference,\u201d said Imogen\u2019s mother, Alice Asher. \nDr. Vivian Lennon said they're seeing more respiratory viruses; the flu, and RSV. \nIt\u2019s an important decision whether to send a sick child to school where they might get sicker and other students might get it. \n\u201cIf your child has a fever, they cannot go to school,\u201d Lennon said. \u201cFirst of all, they are most likely to be contagious, second of all they don\u2019t feel well, they are not going to be able to learn.\u201d \nVomiting?

With President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un exchanging threats and insults, why would the media bother with something innocuously labeled \u201cMalabar 17\u201d?\nThey should have.\nMalabar 17 brought together the U.S., Japanese, and Indian navies to practice shutting down a waterway through which 80 percent of China\u2019s energy supplies travel and to war game closing off the Indian Ocean to Chinese submarines. If Korea keeps you up at night, try imagining the outcome of choking off fuel for the world\u2019s second largest economy.\nWhile Korea certainly represents the most acute crisis in Asia, the diplomatic maneuvers behind Malabar 17 may be more dangerous in the long run. The exercise elevates the possibility of a confrontation between China, the U.S. and India, but also between India and Pakistan, two nuclear-armed countries that have fought three wars in the past 70 years.\nThis tale begins more than a decade and a half ago, when then Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, Douglas Feith \u2014one of the most hawkish members of the George W. Bush administration\u2014convened a meeting in May 2002 of the US-India Defense Policy Group and the government of India.\nAs one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement, India traditionally avoided being pulled into the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.\nBut the Bush administration had a plan for roping Indian into an alliance aimed at containing China, with a twist on an old diplomatic strategy: no stick, lots of carrots.\nAt the time India was banned from purchasing uranium on the international market because it had detonated a nuclear weapon in 1974 and refused to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). There was a fear that if India had nuclear weapons, eventually so would Pakistan, a fear that turned real in 1998 when Islamabad tested its first nuclear device.\nPakistan also refused to sign the NPT.\nUnder the rules of the Treaty, both countries were excluded from the 45-member Nuclear Suppliers Group. While the ban was not a serious problem for Pakistan\u2014it has significant uranium deposits\u2014it was for India. With few domestic resources, India had to balance between using its uranium for weapons or to fuel nuclear power plants. Given that India is energy poor, that was a difficult choice.\nWhen the Bush administration took over in 2001, it immediately changed the designation of China from \u201c strategic partner\u201d to \u201cstrategic competitor.\u201d It also resumed arms sales to New Delhi despite India\u2019s 1998 violation of the NPT with a new round of tests.\nThen Washington offered a very big carrot called the 1-2-3 Agreement that allow India to bypass the NPT and buy uranium so long as it is not used for weapons. This, however, would allow India to shift all of its domestic fuel into weapons production.\nAt the time, Pakistan\u2014which asked for the same deal and was rebuffed\u2014warned that the Agreement would ignite a nuclear arms race in Asia, which is precisely what has happened. India and Pakistan are busily adding to their nuclear weapons stocks, as is China and, of course, North Korea.\nThe 1-2-3 Agreement went into effect in 2008, although it has not been fully implemented.\nComplicating this whole matter are on-going tensions between India and Pakistan in Kashmir, over which the two have fought three wars, the last of which came close to going nuclear. Rather than trying to defuse a very dangerous conflict, however, the Bush administration ignored Kashmir. So did the Obama administration, in spite of a pre-election promise by Barack Obama to deal with the on-going crisis. ,\nIt would appear that a quid pro quo for India moving closer to the US is Washington\u2019s silence on Kashmir.\nIn 2016, the Obama administration designated India a \u201cMajor Defense Partner,\u201d made Japan a permanent member of the Malabar exercises, and began training Indian pilots in \u201cadvanced aerial combat\u201d at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada.\nThe Trump administration has added to the tensions between India and Pakistan by encouraging New Delhi to deploy troops in Afghanistan. While India already has paramilitary road building units in Southern Afghanistan, it does not have regular armed forces. From Islamabad\u2019s point of view, Indian troops in Afghanistan will effectively sandwich Pakistan, north and south. So far, India has resisted the request.\nThe government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also rolled out a new military strategy called \u201cCold Start,\u201d which allows the Indian military to attack and pursue \u201cterrorists\u201d as deep as 30 kilometers into Pakistani territory.\nThe danger is that a \u201cCold Start\u201d operation could be misinterpreted by Islamabad as a major attack by the far larger Indian army. Faced with defeat, Pakistan might resort to tactical nuclear weapons, a decision that Pakistan has recently delegated to front-line commanders . Since India cannot respond in kind\u2014it has no tactical nukes\u2014New Delhi would either use its high yield strategic nuclear weapons or accept defeat. Since the latter is unlikely, the war could quickly escalate into a general nuclear exchange.\nSuch an exchange, according to a recent study by Scientific American, would not only kill tens of millions of people in both countries, it would cause a worldwide nuclear chill that would devastate agriculture in both hemispheres. In terms of impact, as scary as the Korea crisis is, a nuclear war between Pakistan and India would be qualitatively worse.\nDuring his recent Asia tour, Trump used the term \u201cIndo-Pacific\u201d on a number of occasions, a term that was originally coined by the rightwing Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe. Japan is currently in a tense standoff with China over several uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, and Abe is trying to dismantle Japan\u2019s post-World War II \u201cpeace\u201d constitution that restricts Japanese armed forces to \u201cself-defense\u201d operations.\nAbe is also closely associated with a section of the Japanese political spectrum that argues that Japan was simply resisting western imperialism in World War II and denies or downplays its own colonial role and the massive atrocities committed by the Japanese army in China and Korea.\nAsia looks like a pretty scary place these days. A rightwing Hindu fundamentalist government in India and a revanchist Japanese Prime Minister are allied with an increasingly unstable administration in Washington to surround and contain the second largest economy in the world.\nThere are some hopeful developments, however. For one, following the recent Communist Party Congress, China seems to be looking for a way to turn down the heat in the region. After initially threatening South Korea for deploying a US anti-missile system, the THAAD, Beijing has stepped back and cut a deal: no additional THAAD systems, no boycott of South Korean goods.\nThe Chinese also dialed down tensions in the mountainous Doldam region on the border of China and Bhutan with an agreement for a mutual withdrawal of troops. There has been some progress as well in finding a non-confrontational solution to China\u2019s illegal claims in the South China Sea, although Beijing is not likely to abandon its artificial islands until there is a downsizing of US naval forces in the region.\nAnd in spite of the tensions between the two, India and Pakistan formally joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organization this past summer, a security grouping largely dominated by Russia and China.\nThe danger here is that someone does something stupid and things get out of hand. There are those who point out that in spite of similar tensions during the Cold War, all concerned survived those dark times. That, however, ignores the fact that the world came very close to nuclear war, once by design\u2014the Cuban missile crisis\u2014and several times by accident.\nIf you keep rolling the dice, eventually they come up snake eyes.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

So that complicates things as well because then it becomes well which time matrix are we from etc. Thus it's possible the paa-tal and the draconians have been fighting from different universes. It gets.. super complicated... Permalink Reply by Seraphim Angel 16 hours ago Yes but it says that angels or ncarnated into paa tal race so it could be that they have created paa tal as their vessels to incarnate Shawn Dall said: \nthe reason I say I don't think they are angels is because the angels exist in dimensions 13-15, while the paa-tal exist in dimensions 12-10, and it is stated that they existed in orvonton, on their home planet (valaris or valaria comes to mind, I could be wrong though, its a lot of time to sift through). \nSo my hypothesis, and this will evolve as time goes on, is that the elohim seeded orvonton before our local universe even EXISTED. The paa-tal might have evolved out of the wingmakers, which ties in urantia's info, which are central soul stewards of a grand universe to go out and seed that reality. I dunno I have to re-read the urantia info, it does nicely structure the universe into realms and whatnot. I suggest you all to check it out too. Permalink Reply by Shawn Dall 15 hours ago \nit could be, but then it also stated that the elohi seeded the races here, so the paa-tal seem to exist somewhere between the elohim seeding this time matrix and that one. So do we simply refer to the paa-tal as elohi, or do we refer to them as their incarnate paa-tal? Permalink Reply by Seraphim Angel 1 hour ago \nI am trying to understand the system of incarnation. \nFrom the paa tal information it seems that angels incarnated into paa tall and then paa tal incarnates into an human. It is so confusing . why do angels need intermediate vessels why not incarnate directly into an human body. \nThe only thing that would make some sense is that there were no humans at that point and so they first created paa tal and incarnated into them and then later paa tal created human race and incarnated into them but the question is was for example yahuweh aware of his true self", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:50:10.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0f111fb7af2de6888055cfefac55325456c707b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pCImt8UBblXmGIjW9E2f9kBU4cW9_5PbM", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/fa/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/fa/ -

After the first few minutes I found myself in a relaxed peaceful state of mind having a really great meditation....so of course I wound up meditating with all seven audios during the following days meditating every day and looking forward to it ! All 7 meditations are simple and easy to follow, and yet powerful and Divinely inspired and I feel are beneficial for both beginning meditators as well as people who have been meditating for many years and they are also free to listen to and download (MP3 audios). Here's the link: http://www.emissariesofthelight.net/meditations.html \nI've continued to meditate and enjoy guided meditations that God led me to, and i have recorded quite a few guided meditation videos to help others get into a habit of daily meditation, which I feel is a key practice - meditation - to help everyone in your spiritual growth. You can easily find and enjoy these powerful guided meditations found in my YouTube channel with this link: My Guided Meditation Videos. \nThe home page for my YouTube channel is: http://www.youtube.com/user/devananda1000/feed \nBelow you will find a few of these guided meditation videos that can get you on your way to some great meditations. Enjoy all of them with Unbounded Blessings of Love & Light, \nSteve \n\nHere's a wonderfully uplifting guided video meditation by Susan Shumsky with activations that take you into deep communion with your Divine Self & The Ascended Masters. Enjoy with Unbounded Blessings of Love & Light, Steve Partial Transcript: We are all being lifted right now into the Light of our Divine Self...into the Light of the Creator. Let's all take a big deep breath together of relaxation...of Divine Peace....of Divine Love. We now know & recognize that there is only one power in the universe and in our lives - the Light of God...the power of The Creator ! The Light of God surrounds & enfolds us...and the Power of God protects us. And we allow ourselves to merge with this Divine Light now...we now merge with our Divine Self - the Creator within us. There is now separation now between us & God. We now call forth into our sacred space all of the beautiful Beings of Light helping mankind...the Ascended Masters....the angels & Archangels, the Elohim, the Chohans of the Rays, the energies of the Crystalline Kingdom & the Elemental Kingdom, & the Goddess vibrations. We ask these beautiful beings to lift us to an ascension vibration or better...increasing our vibrations & Light quotient...and purifying all of our bodies in the Violet Flames...lifting us into beautiful ascension vibrations together.... \nVideo: \"Ascension Activations For You\" - https://youtu.be/F6ErEqYgsQk \nPartial transcript of \"Guided Ascension Meditation\" video: \nLet yourself tune into and merge with the highest vibrations of the Creator coming through this video to raise your own vibrations and light quotient and help you ascend. Imagine the light within you shining brightly. Give yourself a moment to inhale deeply, and as you exhale imagine a golden light beam moving from the base of your spine into the earth. As you continue to breathe, feel this deep connection to the earth relax you and provide a strong base within you. Now, bring your attention to your heart center, the energy field in the middle of your chest. Imagine there is a glowing flame of light burning there. As you breathe in, this flame grows larger and brighter. As you breathe out, the light from this flame begins to fill your body. Continue to breathe and imagine this light expanding behind your shoulders and down your back, feel it filling every organ and every cell. This is the light of pure spirit, the healing love of God. This light fills you with the Divine presence and radiates from you in waves of love.... \nVideo: \"Guided Ascension Medtation\" - https://youtu.be/fXVHpf2wC2Q \nRecently Spirit had me create three audio transmissions\u2026 Opening to the New You Breaking through the Limitation Matrix The 8.8.8 Lionsgate Transmission The names of the first two explain their effects. The third 8.8.8 Lionsgate Transmission will activate power and potential. The 4th track from Judy is called \"Lack of Motherly Love\", which I also found to be very healing & uplifting. The short music track at the end is called \"Little Pearl\" from Parijit When you listen to the 8.8.8 Lionsgate Transmission in conjunction with the two previous transmissions so much power and strength will be activated within you. What may have seemed impossible for you to accomplish before will become easy and effortless. This is the time for you to reach for the stars and to hold your \u201cstar\u201d, your special gifts, talents and abilities in the palm of your hand for all to see and benefit from. Previous challenges will fall away. It\u2019s time for all of us to stand tall and be ALL that we are and have the potential to be and become. When you listen to these transmissions you will change at a very deep level and begin to express more of your true essence. The audio recordings are a gift from Spirit ... from God \u2026 for everyone on Earth. You can either listen once or three times at one session for seven consecutive days, or three times at one session for three consecutive days. The energy works like alchemy, which is a complete change of state \u2026 like a new energy being imprinted into the fabric of your being. Judy asks us at different points in this transmission to be repeating to yourself affirmations like the following: 1. I release all limitations causing pain and discomfort in my physical body. 3. I Am in the New. My Soul releases all limitations that do not serve me. 4. I Am in the New. My Soul releases all thought forms and repressed emotions that do not serve me. 5. I Am in the New. My Soul releases everything that is not of God's Divine Joy, Love, & Abundance. 6. I An in the New. My soul releases everything that is not of God's Joy, Love, & Abundance. 7. I Am in the New. My Soul releases everything not of God. Steven Hutchinson: I just meditated with all three of Judy's transmissions, three times in a row like Judy recommends...and I can testify that they are extremely powerful & uplifting...so much energy & kundalini was moving through my body that at times I could hardly sit still.

All Rights Reserved. Follow Story CRIME Bodycam footage released of UGA players' arrest, raises more questions The Barrow County Sheriff's Office has released bodycam footage from this weekend's arrest of two UGA football players on drug and motor vehicle charges. Author: Michael King , WXIA Published: 10:11 PM EST December 6, 2017 \nThe Barrow County sheriff has released police bodycam footage of the arrest of the two University of Georgia football players from early Sunday morning. \nThe Chevrolet Camaro the two were initially in was pulled over by deputies on Georgia Highway 316 after midnight, only hours after the Bulldogs victory over the Auburn Tigers in the SEC Championship. \nThe players, Jayson Stanley and Natrez Patrick, were charged with marijuana possession. In addition, Stanley, the driver of the Camaro, was charged with DUI and speeding. \nEarly in the video, the players can be seen standing handcuffed, illuminated by the lights of the police car behind them. \n\"Sir, unfortunately, the marijuana was in your seat - where you were sitting and the bottle of the leftover marijuana - was underneath your feet,\" one officer explained to Patrick. \nHe then tells Patrick that he's under arrest for possession. To that, Stanley responds \"hold on, it's mine. It's my car though.\" \nThe marijuana was on Patrick's seat but in Stanley's car. 11Alive's legal expert and host of The Late Feed Vinnie Politan said, \"if they're in the courtroom, that could be a defense for Patrick. So this could be the gray area in the marijuana controversy that could keep Patrick on the field for the Rose Bowl.\" \nThe nearly hour-long video shows the entire arrest and search process that deputies undertook during the traffic stop early Sunday morning. At one point, one of the handcuffed men can be heard pleading with deputies. UGA players Jayson Stanley and Natrez Patrick were arrested by Barrow County Sheriff's Deputies on GA 316 early Sunday morning, just hours after the Dawg's SEC Championship win in Atlanta. \n\"It's my car, though. Please, please, please. If you've got a heart, please listen,\" one of the players said, although it is not clear which one. \"Please, if you've got a heart, we've been through the biggest s--- of our life. We're sorry. We not no bad kids. That's the end for him, man! If we go to jail, that's it, man, his career, bruh! That's his life, his family...\" \nLater on in the video, the deputies more fully search the Camaro and can be heard talking to each other, wondering aloud if the two are actually UGA players. \n\"They both football players, I take it?\" one deputy said. \n\"I have no idea,\" the other replied. \n\"That's what I gathered,\" the first one said. \"That they played football together at Georgia.\" \n\"They played -- or play?\" the second one said, looking for clarification.

The UAE wants to grow tomatoes. French fries and ketchup in space? 06 December 2017 Matthew Priest \nSpace isn\u2019t so much the final frontier, but rather a modern day Gold Rush. \nWhile tech start-up poster boy Elon Musk\u2019s company SpaceX is making gradual progress on infrastructure that could significantly reduce the cost of sending resources (and at some point, people) into orbit, even more grandiose plans are afoot much closer to home. \nAt last month\u2019s Dubai Airshow, not only did the space sector feature significantly \u2014 with exhibitions, conferences, and speakers that included former NASA Apollo 15 astronaut, Al Worden \u2014 but it was also the setting for the country to announce its next, ahem, moonshot. \nWhile the UAE Space Agency\u2019s intention to launch a Mars probe in 2020 is already well-known, the latest announcement of plans to grow tomatoes (and date palms) on the red planet demonstrates a whole new level of ambition. \n\u201cThere are similarities between Mars and the desert. The landscape of the UAE, the soil, are similar,\u201d Rashid Al Zaadi, senior strategic planner at the UAE Space Agency told media at the airshow. \u201cWell, when we get there, we\u2019ll have to eat.\u201d \nFor the actual science aspect, it might actually be possible to grow food on Mars. The Wageningen University in The Netherlands has spent four years experimenting with Martian soil simulants and procedures in an attempt to mimic the atmospheric conditions of the planet. \nBought from NASA, the researchers have been using soil from a volcanic cone in Hawaii, which is as close as they can get to a soil with similar Martian properties, short of flying over to the planet, scooping some up and bringing it back to Earth. \nHowever, despite having been able to harvest the crops \u2014 peas, potatoes, rye and, ahem, rocket \u2014 the question now is whether they would be safe to eat, considering high levels of lead and mercury. \nIt\u2019s fair to say, that any interplanetary work is rather expensive. Since the UAE Space Agency was set-up in 2014, the country has invested approximately AED 20 billion in its Mars project, according to the BBC. That includes a Mars probe, a final full-scale mock-up of which was unveiled at the airshow. \nThe UAE has also begun work on its Mars Science City, a centre dedicated to studying the colonization of the planet. The series of domes in the desert, with two million square feet of living space and research facilities, will investigate food, water and energy needs. \nWhile the world has grown rather accustomed to the UAE\u2019s limitless ambition, there is actually a simple economic reason for its continued investment in the space industry. \nThe country is keen to transition away from any economic dependence on oil and tourism (and the associated services and engineering), and instead towards growth in the science and hi-tech sectors, which would provide new jobs and future-focused skill sets. \nWith approximately 100 million young people in the Gulf region, the UAE\u2019s latest grand idea is as much about growing tomatoes on Mars, as it is about growing its own sustainable future. \n* Tomatoes are a fruit \nGet the Esquire Newsletter.

So, it only makes sense that Trump's only time meeting George Clooney was equally as unpleasant. \nCheck out this bizarre anecdote Clooney told to The Hollywood Reporter about the one time he met Trump: \"I was sitting down at a restaurant in New York [several years ago] and he came in and we talked for a while,\" he recalls. \"I'd had neck surgery, and he said, 'I'll give you the name of a doctor,' and he wrote me a couple of times with the name. Then he went on Larry King Live and told him I was very short. I'm 5-foot-11 - I'm not the tallest actor in the world, but I'm not short. That made me laugh.\" \nThis certainly sounds like the Donald Trump we know - a man who will A) do whatever he needs for your approval, then B) screw you over if it happens to slightly benefit him. \nAt least Clooney seems above this petty behaviour.

They thoughts were conveyed to readers by local news outlet Press of Atlantic City . \nCommenting on the state of Atlantic City\u2019s economy, Marcus Glover, the recently appointed President and Chief Operating Officer of the Borgata, said that it was robust but that the city was still suffering the consequences of previously created negative perceptions. Mr. Glover has been part of Atlantic City\u2019s casino industry for three months now. He touted the idea of making better use of the city\u2019s international airport. \nMatthew Harkness, President of Hard Rock Atlantic City, said that he saw bright future for Atlantic City and its casino industry. Parent company Hard Rock International is currently redeveloping the former Trump Taj Mahal, after buying it from New York billionaire businessman Carl Icahn this spring. The company is planning to spend the amount of $500 million on its project in the city. The redeveloped property is slated to open doors next May . \nResorts Casino Hotel CEO and President Mark Giannantonio, an Atlantic City casino industry veteran, said he was optimistic about the future of the city . According to Mr. Giannantonio, the upcoming opening of Hard Rock Atlantic City will further boost the north end of Atlantic City\u2019s Boardwalk. Expansion of Non-Gambling Options \nThe past several years have shown that the addition of services beyond gambling at casinos could be a good way for boosting the properties\u2019 profitability. The four casino executives said during the Wednesday panel that Atlantic City should invest more in such non-gambling services . eSports and daily fantasy sports have been among the options considered by the local gambling venues as potential means for attracting a wider number of diverse visitors. \nTony Rodio, President and CEO of Tropicana Entertainment Inc., said on Wednesday that they have also diversified their entertainment offering beyond gambling through the launch of weekly firework and light shows, among other things. \nThe four executives also agreed that more convention space could, too, help Atlantic City boost visits. The convention model was adopted by Las Vegas more than three decades ago and has proved to be quite successful. \nThe Great Recession and the growing competition from neighboring states inflicted serious damage to Atlantic City\u2019s casino industry. Five of the city\u2019s twelve casinos closed doors within a two-and-a-half-year span as a result. It is now believed that the city is entering its years of revitalization and the interest from outstate investors, such as Hard Rock International, has come as proof to this.

Surya has spent over 2000 hours on this project by working for more than 12 months. She is gunning for the Guinness record keeping the fingers crossed. This kind of flag has never been made in UAE before. It is one of its own kind using the tiny strips of paper. The surveys were taken which were witnessed by officials from Indian consulate, Sharjah Police and Sharjah Municipality. These evidences along with the complete videos shall be submitted to the Guinness record as a part of procedure. There were more than 1000 visitors at the venue to witness the flag.

She is displaying the flag as an attempt to Guinness World Records for which she will submit all the evidences. The current world record is of a paper-quilled mosaic measuring 5mx5m.
