The director of the Northern Oregon Regional Correctional Facility disputed the findings reported in The East Oregonian but said there is room for improvement at the facility that takes in juveniles from 17 Oregon counties, some southwest Washington counties and federal immigration cases. The facility also houses some teens from the Warm Springs Indian Reservation. Disability Rights is authorized to inspect jails and other facilities that house people with disabilities under a federal designation. In the report, organization attorney Sarah Radcliffe said she interviewed 23 youth at the NORCOR juvenile jail during three visits between June and September. The teens told her about long stays in isolation for minor infractions and most reported spending between three and six hours per day locked in their cells, the report said. \u201cI was just really shocked by the conditions,\u201d she said. \u201cKids are getting disciplined for normal behavior, and some for mental health-related behavior.\u201d Offenders as young as 12 faced discipline for talking in line or not looking forward, according to the report. Youth could spend weeks \u201con disciplinary status,\u201d according to Radcliffe, in which they cannot participate in any group activities, must eat alone, receive solitary education in their housing unit and cannot have phone calls or visits from family. Radcliffe called NORCOR\u2019s disciplinary process \u201cregressive and aggressive.\u201d NORCOR also does not document how long youth remain in isolation, a violation of Oregon law. Dr. Ajit Jetmalani, the director of child and adolescent psychiatry at Oregon Health and Science University and a member of the statewide juvenile justice mental health task force, said in the report the NORCOR juvenile detention facility \u201cappears to be unaware of the neuroscience of adolescent development\u201d that shows \u201cthe critical importance of attachment and sustained positive relationships\u201d for juveniles. \u201cThe key to recovery for these kids is not enforcing strict compliance with rules, but rather in forming healthy relationships that help to foster an intrinsic desire to engage positively with the world,\u201d he said. NORCOR Director Bryan Brandenburg disputed much of Radcliffe\u2019s report. \u201cWe really are about teaching kids better behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t punish, as she said in her report, nor do we treat them inhumanely.\u201d Staff do isolate teens who are disruptive or who break rules by locking them in their cells. But staff and mental health workers regularly check on youth in segregation, he said. Rules against looking around or looking out of windows during class had been done away with after Radcliffe\u2019s report. The facility will also do a better job of documenting how long youth are in isolation, Brandenburg said, and is working on a grievance and appeals processes for youth who get into trouble. Oregon law requires juvenile jails to offer a hearing prior to imposing \u201croomlock\u201d in excess of 12 hours or denial of any privilege in excess of one day. Inmates in Oregon\u2019s state prisons can file complaints against staff and file appeals for discipline, Brandenburg said, and youth in NORCOR should have those same rights. \u201cWe are in the service business, so we will look at those recommendations we see as legitimate and valid and make an effort to address them,\u201d he said. 18949212 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bryan brandenburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "radcliffe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ajit jetmalani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah radcliffe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "radcliffe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oregon health and science university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brandenburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dalles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norcor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern oregon regional correctional facility", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the dalles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:09.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c53b7189023fccbb1fd156662c5537ec7f36df1b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSyTlJo9Od1ONIVb4Q_5TwSmxnpAnCWCtdB4zbA2HsmCYJ7dZpt.FG.tVp6449D6KMWRs.kbGhqg0U57Mc__5U2CQ6Q5.57Pr9", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/movies", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Movie News and Discussion", "title": "About to see the disaster artist", "title_full": "About to see the disaster artist : movies", "published": "2017-12-07T10:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 18, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7e1505921ac9272a738ed70ad959eb02ae9e56d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSyTlJo9Od1ONIVb4Q_5TwSmxnpAnCWCtdB4zbA2HsmCYJ7dZpt.FG.tVp6449D6KMWRs.kbGhqg0U57Mc__5U2C4qWgEHwwQdpneLfxc14sBumt1dO9CTzA--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Jordanoceros", "published": "2017-12-07T11:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "So am I;

Foragers had no choice but to consume what they had discovered without waiting any further. Farmers could store food to survive during harsh conditions and they could also accumulate wealth in this manner, which is the origin of social stratification in which people are grouped into hierarchical social classes. A civilization cannot exist without a hierarchical society.\nThis seems like a speculative history. Foragers were known to make and trade tools, and before the onset of full agriculture, would store excess collected nuts and grains in pots and underground, to return for them during the winter or next year. Although it's hard to come by direct evidence of smoked or otherwise preserved meats, it seems entirely possible (I think, likely) that such organic matter is just lost to the historical record even though it existed. They very likely also did a lot of things that were not immediately gratifying like tattoos, scarification, ceremonially inflicting pain on themselves in other ways. They overcame fear during war. I doubt characterizing them as instant gratifiers is accurate.\nIn fact, one thing I think is really interesting about our evolutionary ancestry is that all known primates are absolutely, uncontrollably terrified of fire. They like cooked food more than uncooked food, but they cannot tolerate their fear of fire enough to cook it. Homo erectus seems to have been the first primate in our ancestry to very likely have controlled or even started fire, and it had a much bigger brain made of a lot more proteins, likely gathered from cooked meat. I think our control of our emotions is likely one of the most distinctive features of human beings, and a key to our history.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:09.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "098df3398722483a38c6729e115c7bd1fb500d38", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/qp0TC1ajDjgYeZ177f4HOWMrd5dreVkRspbkuGu26MI9D3LzwatG6qfHdCfEwJH80RRkxf.qxro-", "site_full": "67.227.255.239", "site": "67.227.255.239", "site_section": "http://67.227.255.239/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=22", "site_categories": ["adult", "business", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Off-Topic Discussion - NeoGAF", "title": "Canadian ISPs & Movie Industry poised to strike pirate sites", "title_full": "Canadian ISPs & Movie Industry poised to strike pirate sites - NeoGAF", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.neogaf.com/forum/images/neogaf2/icon_social.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "098df3398722483a38c6729e115c7bd1fb500d38", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/qp0TC1ajDjgYeZ177f4HOWMrd5dreVkRspbkuGu26MI9D3LzwatG6qfHdCfEwJH80RRkxf.qxro-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "llien", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Canadian ISPs & Movie Industry poised to strike pirate sites", "text": "Better stop downloading stuff.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.canadalandshow.com/bell-pushing-end-to-net-neutrality-in-canada/&quot;", "http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2017/12/bell-leads-radical-proposal-crtc-backed-mandatory-website-blocking-system/&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:09.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "053ed8b80d18f8a7fb4df104de42f6cb5835fe86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoMMu2kEjyYBUMf9iYVEcpu3yuiwJkRy86H3o8MCI2z8SemzDjKFQDg5gFn4I3A_gbhcN0ZM67MIa9GzZC2mEPWnqeS0DD5XJUlQprk9rpfxg--", "site_full": "bohtong2ndlife.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bohtong2ndlife.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Another blog by Boh Tong the ex- SIA cabin crew", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "053ed8b80d18f8a7fb4df104de42f6cb5835fe86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoMMu2kEjyYBUMf9iYVEcpu3yuiwJkRy86H3o8MCI2z8SemzDjKFQDg5gFn4I3A_gbhcN0ZM67MIa9GzZC2mEPWnqeS0DD5XJUlQprk9rpfxg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Boh Tong (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "\n4 thick slices of 6 types of fish for the price of 500 Yen which is S$5.15cents.

The British government had stuck to its vague pronouncements that didn\u2019t cohere, while the EU seemed to be on a loop in restating its principles and red-lines. \nThe apparent clarification on finances helped to open this up: the UK committed more clearly to honouring the large bulk of current liabilities, including the RAL (which makes up most of these), which removed one of the biggest blocks in the road. More importantly, the finances was the most fungible of the Phase I issues and the most pressing for most of the EU27, so it set a positive tone for what might come next. The money was thus both important in itself and as a marker of intent, not to mention signalling that the UK might come round much more to the EU\u2019s position than the other way around. \nEven if citizens\u2019 rights was still stuck on the role of the CJEU \u2013 something that will be coming back before long \u2013 the second key development was a consensus among the negotiators that a statement of intent on the Irish border would be enough to move this latter topic on to \u2018sufficient progress\u2019. \nThis matters because the underlying difficulties of resolving the border question remain as stark as ever. The incompatibility of the EU\u2019s single market, the Good Friday Agreement, the common travel area, UK territorial integrity and UK withdrawal from the single market/customs union has no solution in purely formal terms. Even the UK\u2019s vagueness about \u2018technical solutions\u2019 couldn\u2019t really address this point, as Dublin had made repeatedly clear. \nImportantly, Phase I is the point at which Ireland has the most leverage , especially since the rest of the EU appeared to stand squarely behind it: to let the UK get away with what it had offered previously would be to risk losing any chance to pin it down, as the agenda moved on. \nThe compromise then was to work on a statement of principles that would apply whatever the outcome \u2013 i.e. including a no-deal scenario \u2013 to keep the border open and the GFA operative. With some linguistic fancy footwork on \u2018 regulatory alignment \u2018, it was possible to carve out a bit of space whereby the EU could claim no regulatory gap \u2013 so removing on key arm for needing a hard border \u2013 and the UK could claim it had its own regulatory process \u2013 albeit one that one have to very closely follow EU rules. \nPut differently, the EU moved on form \u2013 from a detailed plan to a detailed set of principles \u2013 while the UK moved on substance \u2013 effectively tying themselves into the EU\u2019s preferences and regulation. \nThis compromise seemed to work well enough for all the principals to sign off on it, right up to the point that the DUP raised their objections. But this shouldn\u2019t obscure that the movement took place at all. It now sets the agenda for the work going on right now. \nAnd this is the second big positive to take away: everyone\u2019s working very hard for a deal . \nOf all the counter-productive language since last June, \u2018no deal is better than a bad deal\u2019 has been the most problematic (and the one producing the firmest response from experts ). \nEvery since Monday afternoon, when the wheels came off the compromise deal, figures on all sides have been very keen to stress the positives. The May-Juncker press conference was very brief, but couched entirely in such language, while briefings on all sides kept to the script too. While it would have been tempting to stick the boot into the DUP, the Irish government has made repeated positive noises about the chances of salvaging a new text this week or next, and appears determined not to rock the boot for May. \nJust as important has been the language in the UK. With Davis distracted by the impact assessments this week \u2013 which also says something about the British situation \u2013 it was May taking the lead and again pushing the line that agreement was still possible. While it might be understandable, given her position, it was also apparent that most of her party wasn\u2019t trailing the \u2018no deal\u2019 line and that Labour was challenging her competence, rather than the substance of what she had negotiated. \nMost importantly in all of this is the Douglas Adams point about deadlines. Yesterday had been set by the EU as the last date to get text agreed in time for the EU27 to discuss prior to next week\u2019s European Council. That has now drifted out to at least tomorrow and possibly early next week. Moreover, Leo Varadkar\u2019s statements also open up the possibility of a special European Council early in the new year, should things not pan out, so that Phase II doesn\u2019t have to wait until February. \nTaken together, the impression is that Article 50 is still a going concern and that all sides are serious about making it happen. Certainly, the UK still has tremendous problems with its internal politics, but the fact that it could move as it did should give cause for some positivity about it all. \nBut a final word of caution. This past week also suggests that the outcome of Article 50 is now likely to be only one of two outcomes: either a deal very largely on EU terms, or a complete lack of agreement. The middle path of a more tailored deal looks less and less probably now. That might sound good to some, but the polarisation of outcomes also raises dangers, especially as and when Phase II opens.

Although Christmas, New Year\u2019s Eve and a lot of time off work calls for care free evenings and more than a few boozy drinks, you could be seriously risking your health. \nA health complication known as \u201choliday heart syndrome\u201d (HHS), which causes palpitations and irregular heart arrhythmias, is on the rise during the holiday period \u2013 according to spokesperson for Pharma Dynamics \u2013 SA\u2019s leading supplier of heart medication \u2013 Nicole Jennings. <a href=\"http://ads2.hsmdns.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a916b384&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-mce-href=\"http://ads2.hsmdns.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a916b384&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE\"><img src=\"http://ads2.hsmdns.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=1149&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a916b384\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" data-mce-src=\"http://ads2.hsmdns.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=1149&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a916b384\" /></a> \nJennings describes HHS as a condition which typically occurs during the holidays when people who don\u2019t suffer from heart disease experience irregular heart rhythms following heavy alcohol consumption. \n\u201cHoliday Heart Syndrome is typically associated with the consumption of an excessive amount of alcohol in a short period of time and can cause acute cardiovascular effects such as heartbeat irregularities, shortness of breath and chest pain. The effects are reversible if you stop drinking or greatly reduce the amount you consume, but can be alarming when you first experience it,\u201d she says. \nMost of the irregular heart rhythms one would experience with HHS are atrial. Atrial fibrillation, or AF \u2013 when you experience heart palpitations, fatigue and shortness of breath \u2013 is the most common, but atrial flutter (a fast heart rate of more than 100 beats per minutes) and ventricular ectopy (when your heart skips a beat) are also common. \nJennings says HHS isn\u2019t fully understood, but alcohol affects the conduction paths of the heart, which explains the onset of health palpitations, fatigue and shortness of breath. \n\u201cAbstaining from alcohol for a while is usually the recommended treatment for HHS, but it\u2019s best to see a doctor who will check for a dangerous drop in blood pressure or signs of acute heart failure. It\u2019s better to always err on the side of caution, when it relates to your health of your heart,\u201d she advised. \nExcessive drinking can pose serious health complications, but you can still enjoy the festive season without putting your heart at risk. The National Department of Health NDoH) recommends that women should limit their alcohol intake to two drinks per day, and men should limit it to three boozy beverages. \nSo, how do you keep your heart happy throughout the festive season? Jennings suggests the following \n\u2013 Limit your alcohol intake. Jennings says one should limit their alcohol intake especially if they have \u201ccongenital heart disease or have an increased risk of heart disease as a result of obesity, smoking, high cholesterol or hypertension\u201d. \n\u2013 Lay low on coffee, energy drinks and fizzy drinks. Jennings says one should limit these \u201cas they all contain caffeine which can act as a heart stimulant and cause AF\u201d. \n\u2013 Stay hydrated. \u201cWhen at a party be sure to eat something before taking alcohol and remember to drink enough water in between drink since alcohol strips water from the body,\u201d recommends Jennings. \nPhotography Unsplash <a href=\"http://ads2.hsmdns.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=ad0eea61&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-mce-href=\"http://ads2.hsmdns.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=ad0eea61&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE\"><img src=\"http://ads2.hsmdns.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=1122&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=ad0eea61\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" data-mce-src=\"http://ads2.hsmdns.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=1122&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=ad0eea61\" /></a> Article written by Nikki Louw Nikki Louw is an avid food eater and wine drinker with a passion for writing about it too.

It is, in essence, an hour of fresh complications: In addition to the turn against the Dark Army, there\u2019s the revelation that ECorp CEO Phillip Price (Michael Cristofer) knew about 5/9 and the Cyber Bombings; Darlene (Carly Chaikin) and Dom\u2019s (Grace Gummer) tryst; Angela (Portia Doubleday) going around the bend. It also deepens the creeping suspicion I\u2019ve had, as the season\u2019s worn on, that Mr. Robot \u2019s confidence, at the episodic level, masks a certain doubtfulness in its season-long arc. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s fitting or frustrating yet\u2014there\u2019s still next week\u2014but \u201ceps3.8_stage3.torrent\u201d reads to me as a comedown from the series\u2019 midseason height, as if it\u2019s unsure of all that\u2019s preceded it. This is the risk, I suppose, of Season Three\u2019s central themes: When your subject is erasure, deletion, redemption, might not the desire to return short-circuit the need to move forward? \nIn tonight\u2019s Mr. Robot , after all, past is present, and prologue. Like several other entries this season, it begins with a flashback\u2014this time to the day Price, seemingly smitten with Angela, signs AllSafe to that fateful contract. For her part, poor Angela, piling copies of Lolita into a fire engine red shopping cart and ignoring her father\u2019s phone calls, suggests that Tyrell Wellick (Martin Wallstr\u00f6m) being named ECorp\u2019s CTO is \u201cproof\u201d that \u201cwe\u2019re going back to the way things should be.\u201d The post, which Price assures him is merely ceremonial, leads Wellick to remark that he\u2019s \u201ca prisoner, just like before.\u201d Darlene, held for questioning in the FBI\u2019s interrogation room after Dom catches her\u2014predictably, as Dom\u2019s an insomniac FBI agent and that safe is loud as fuck\u2014attempting to steal her badge. As if to underscore the point, creator Sam Esmail deploys one of the episode\u2019s most striking stylistic departures, a series of jump cuts, as Elliot paces the floor in some undisclosed location, explaining the need for (digital) backups: \u201cIn case our revolution failed.\u201d \nThe one subplot that appears to be approaching an end is Agent Santiago\u2019s (Omar Metwally) role as the Dark Army\u2019s inside man at the Bureau\u2014as Mr. Robot ( Christian Slater ) scratches into a mirror for Elliot to read, a message Elliot passes on to Darlene, who in turn piques Dom\u2019s suspicions, \u201cTHEY OWN THE FBI.\u201d But Santiago is a minor character, and his treason has largely been treated as a narrative convenience, something to slow Dom down: His exposure, in the finale (should it even come), isn\u2019t exactly the coup de gr\u00e2ce one wants from a season-long suspense thriller. Which leads me to ask the same question Mr. Robot does of Wellick, the one that\u2019s been niggling me since we learned of the Cyber Bombings: Was it worth it? \nDespite being peppered with references to Back to the Future , and almost obsessed with the impulse to reclaim the past, Mr. Robot nonetheless seems thinner, thematically speaking, than it once was. More than its humorously ham-fisted quotation of Trump (\u201cNo puppet. No puppet. You\u2019re the puppet!\u201d Wellick cries), this comes across in Mr. Robot \u2019s description of \u201cMen who fuck over the rest of us for profit, for fun,\u201d or Whiterose\u2019s (BD Wong) claim that \u201cPeople like Phillip Price do not respect mercy. You only get their attention with force, and a lot of it.\u201d (The glass-rimming\u2019s a bit much, no?) It\u2019s a strange betrayal of the season\u2019s thrust, if \u201cbetrayal\u201d is not too strong a word, to resolve the potential complications of Elliot\u2019s \u201cfailed revolution\u201d by pinning that failure on Price\u2019s conspiratorial involvement in it, rather than pushing harder on the moral compromises made by those (Elliot, Angela, Darlene) whose motives were pure, if personal. \u201cWorld catastrophes like this, they aren\u2019t caused by lone wolves like you,\u201d Price tells \u201cMr. Alderson,\u201d in one of those pat proclamations that always leave me leery of embracing Mr. Robot too much. \u201cThey occur because men like me allow them.\u201d \nFor what its worth, \u201cworld catastrophes\u201d are not, in my estimation, Esmail\u2019s strong suit. The series, the season, and indeed \u201ceps3.8_stage3.torrent\u201d tend to soar higher on intimate moments with big implications, from the conversation set to \u201cWhere Is My Mind?\u201d to Dom\u2019s late-night talks with Alexa . It remains as true as ever: This week\u2019s highlight, for me, is the camera circling Darlene and Dom in the latter\u2019s apartment, swaying like a soused dancer, or Darlene\u2019s earlier remark that she\u2019s \u201cone hell of a wingwoman.\u201d This is the stuff\u2014personal, emotional, messily human\u2014that makes the series\u2019 politics real, the stuff that generates our impulse to erase, delete, return, redeem, and I only wish Mr. Robot managed to integrate it more fully, more consistently, into its broader narrative. At least, that\u2019s what\u2019s required, now that that the series is once again an effective actioner, for Mr. Robot to reclaim its own past as one of TV\u2019s most formidable dramas. As Price notes at one point, by way of advice, \u201cYou can\u2019t force an agenda, Mr. Alderson. You have to inspire one.\u201d \nMatt Brennan is the TV editor of Paste Magazine .

This move marked the start of a series of events that have boosted his creativity and brought about changes in the focus of his writing. Around the time of the move, Martin learned he had won the Louis Award, a competition organized each year by Concrete Wolf publishing in Tillamook for poets aged 50 or older who have not yet published a full-length poetry collection. Martin\u2019s prize was the publication in July of a collection of his poetry as a full-length book. What: Second Sunday, featuring poet John Martin When: 2 p.m. Sunday Where: Downtown Bend Library \u2014 Brooks Room, 601 NW Wall St. Cost: free View More Martin will read and discuss selections from that book, \u201cHold This,\u201d at the Downtown Bend Library on Sunday. He will also read some more recent poems written in over the past year. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of an autobiography in poetry or verse,\u201d Martin said of \u201cHold This.\u201d \u201cI think of it as a story that takes in all the emotionally important aspects of my life, although it\u2019s not necessarily chronological.\u201d Martin\u2019s poetry and essays had previously been published in various journals and anthologies, and his chapbook, \u201cThe Nick of Time,\u201d was published in 2006. Much of his verse in \u201cHold This\u201d uses the imagery of nature and the elements while examining death and its impacts. He also admits to a \u201cpreoccupation\u201d with birds, which are featured in many of the poems and also on the cover of the book. The publication of \u201cHold This\u201d brought Martin full circle in one chapter of his artistic life. He was notified the collection would be published just as he was about to begin working at PLAYA. That also happens to be where he wrote and arranged the first iterations of many of the book\u2019s poems, during a monthlong residency at the facility in 2012. \u201cHold This\u201d also includes some older poems dating back to 2005, along with more recent work. Prior to 2017, Martin\u2019s work was more inwardly focused on his emotional landscape than poetry of place. However, the physical beauty of his surroundings at Summer Lake has triggered some changes in his writing. \u201cPLAYA has to some degree pulled me more into the landscape, and maybe I\u2019ve moved a little more from my emotional geography to the external landscape,\u201d Martin said. The poet, who describes himself as an introvert, also suspects that the requirements of his new job are also encouraging him to look outward more often in his poetry. As the residency manager at PLAYA, Martin coordinates all the application processes and logistics for the resident artists at the facility, as well as coordinating alumni awareness and communication after they leave. \u201cI spent 37 years being a landscaper working with rocks and plants and wheelbarrows full of soil, so it\u2019s been really challenging but really rewarding to spend my time talking to people rather than talking to rocks,\u201d Martin said with a laugh. After living in Bend for 16 years, the move to Summer Lake has been a significant lifestyle change for Martin. Among the things he misses are the monthly collaborations with his friends and fellow poets in the High Desert Poetry Cell and another writers\u2019 group he\u2019s a member of in Bend. He\u2019s only been able to get together with them once or twice since January, but is planning to reconnect with both groups in December. Martin is an entertaining and animated presenter, as anyone who has attended a High Desert Poetry Cell reading can attest. At his event on Sunday, he\u2019ll provide some background on each poem he reads and take questions from the audience. \u201cThe worst thing for anyone to go to is a sing-song poetry reading,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be great to bring a bit of this PLAYA landscape and mindset back to Bend and see what effect that has.\u201d 18923960 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john martin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "martin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "playa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "concrete wolf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooks room", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the nick of time", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central oregon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "summer lake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "playa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "downtown bend library", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tillamook", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:14.061+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8e0564cfea9bf692922ec115ad9de398573e6e3d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB6Xcpri5CKX4WvNgBdOlbdxKIGUE5fm0rhR65WCZRwcwD7OPSABbwAgm380kSWe70WtU7M2LZjHdw--", "site_full": "forums.stevehoffman.tv", "site": "stevehoffman.tv", "site_section": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/forums/music-corner.2/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Music Corner | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "title": "Which song you are listening right now?", "title_full": "Which song you are listening right now? | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "published": "2017-11-29T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 22, "participants_count": 23, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.895, "main_image": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/styles/default/xenforo/avatars/avatar_male_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19660, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0597711dcc7451cf060ab816a942e782e5105004", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB6Xcpri5CKX4WvNgBdOlbdxKIGUE5fm0rhR65WCZRwcwD7OPSABbwAgm380kSWe70UScaamhSa8HdrB52qpbSqB", "ord_in_thread": 17, "author": "MikeManaic61", "published": "2017-11-30T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Van the Man is killing the \"Autumn Song\".

Rules and laws of child adoption in India.  47 PM ISD \n\nUnder Indian law, adoption of a child is termed as a legal coalition between the party (parents) willing to adopt and a child. Adoption can be legal as well as illegal but in India, only legal adoption is recognized. \nWhat is legal adoption? \nAccording to section 2(aa) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Amendment Act, 2006, \u201cAdoption means the process through which the adopted child is permanently separated from his biological parent and becomes the legitimate child of his adoptive parents with all right, privileges and responsibility that are attached to the relationship\u201d. \nWho has a right to adopt a child in India? \nUnder the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956, only the underneath category of people has a right to a child: Any male Hindu who is of sound mind and is not a minor has the capacity to take a son or a daughter for adoption. Provided that, if he has a wife living, he shall not adopt except with the consent of his wife unless the wife has completely and finally renounced the world or has ceased to be a Hindu or has been declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be of unsound mind. Any female Hindu, who is of sound mind, who is not a minor and who is not married, or if married, whose marriage has been dissolved or whose husband is dead or has completely and finally renounced the world or has ceased to be a Hindu or has been declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be of unsound mind, has the capacity to take a son or daughter in adoption. \nIn India, there are no separate laws for adoption for Muslims, Christian, Parsis, and Jews. So, if they wish to legally adopt a child, they have to approach court under the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 for adoption.

Here comes Airtel to beat JIO.  26 PM ISD \nAirtel, the no.1 telecom operator in the country is giving a tough competition to Reliance Jio as it is also rolling out new data plans at competitive prices. Recently, the company revamped its existing plans and is now offering more data to its prepaid customers. \nThe telco recently introduced Rs 349 and Rs 549 plans and has now revised both of them. Under the Rs 349 plan, the service provider was earlier offering 1.5GB data per day with unlimited local and STD calls and SMS. Now the telco has revised it and is offering 2GB data per day. On the other hand, under the Rs 549 plan, the telco used to give 3GB data and is now offering 3.5GB data per day with unlimited calling and SMS benefits. Both the plans come with a validity of 28 days. \nThis means that Airtel subscribers will now get 56GB data under the Rs 349 plan and 84GB data under the Rs 549 plan. This is the second time that the company has revamped its Rs 349 plan. In the beginning, the company used to offer 1GB data, which later changed to 1.5GB and has now become 2GB. \nBoth the plans are better to Reliance Jio as the telco offers only 1GB data per day in both the Rs 399 plan and Rs 499 plan. However, the plans are valid for a longer period but the data offered is less when compared to the plan rolled out by Airtel. \nLast month, Airtel introduced a plan for Rs 999 for its postpaid users. Under the Rs 999 plan, the Airtel postpaid users will get 50GB data, unlimited local and STD calls as well as free roaming calls. The plan falls under the \u2018My Infinity Plan\u2019 of the company and is available for both existing and new Airtel customers. \nUnder this plan, the subscribers will also be able to avail the company\u2019s \u2018data rollover\u2019 offer. As part of the \u2018data rollover offer\u2019, the unused data will be forwarded to the next billing cycle of the user. According to the plan, once a user exhausts his 50GB data limit, then he will be charged at a rate of 50 paise per MB.

His new movie, The Shape of Water , an ageless story of true love between a human woman and a fish-man, references his filmography both at and below surface levels: It suggests a riff on Abe Sapien, the psychic ichthyoid sidekick in both Hellboy films (who is himself a riff on Creature from the Black Lagoon \u2019s Gill-man, fed through a copyright strainer by his creator, Mike Mignola ), but directly invokes the structure and fairy tale trappings of his 2006 breakout picture, Pan\u2019s Labyrinth . \nDel Toro has us set down in 1960s Baltimore, where Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) works the janitorial night shift for the not-at-all-shady Occam Aerospace Research Center, scrubbing the floors clean of piss stains left behind by America\u2019s greatest minds. She\u2019s alone, mostly: She lives by herself in a timeworn loft where she has set her existence to a routine of boiling eggs, bathing, masturbating, making sandwiches, and indulging in television with her next door neighbor, Giles (Richard Jenkins), a commercial artist fallen on hard times. At the lab, she\u2019s never without her coworker and friend, Zelda (Octavia Spencer). Giles and Zelda give Elisa a voice she quite literally lacks: She\u2019s mute, and spends most of the film communicating with sign language. \nElisa\u2019s clockwork days are disrupted by the arrival of the Asset (Doug Jones, the actor behind Abe Sapiens\u2019 prosthetics), the aforementioned fish-man, carted into the lab in a pressurized tank. The Asset is in the custody of Colonel Strickland ( Michael Shannon ), at once the epitome of the del Toro villain and the average Shannon role: He\u2019s abusive, violent, dictatorial to a fault, but mannered, the kind of bastard who thinks his dastardly bastard deeds are right and never thinks twice about his own morality. Elisa, ballsier than Strickland and basically every other man in the film, develops instant kinship with the creature. Like her, the Asset can\u2019t speak. Like her, the Asset is achingly alone. She understands him, and as she introduces him to the joy of a good egg and a Benny Goodman song, so too does he understand her. \nThe success of their relationship hinges on performance as much as on direction. Del Toro cares about the well being of freaks and aberrations more than most people care about the well being of other actual people, and there you have step one. Step two rests on the shoulders of Hawkins and Jones, both capable, proven actors facing one of the most unique challenges of both their careers in The Shape of Water . She has a knack for playing spirited and undaunted types. (And, apparently, a talent for sign. If this whole \u201cacting\u201d thing falls through for her, she\u2019d make a terrific interpreter.) He has a gift for showing us the humanity in the monstrous. Her pluck and cherubic longing pair beautifully with Jones\u2019 physicality, such that the bond they dramatize onscreen stands out as one of the most genuinely romantic of the year. Contrasted against the movie\u2019s three-pronged institutional threats their love story is one we\u2019re happy to root for. Up with love! Down with authoritarianism! \nInstitutions are never safe in del Toro movies (and so it seems that neither are cats). But The Shape of Water harbors a subdued though searing anger toward institutions unmatched even by Hellboy . It takes a lot to make an American government agent a meaner heavy than the Nazis. Maybe it\u2019s Shannon. Maybe it\u2019s the general temperature of the moment we\u2019re in, as taken by the film. The love at its center is so pure that it deserves to be carefree. Instead, it\u2019s set upon from all sides. The U.S. brass wants the Asset for study. The Russians, having installed Dr. Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg) as a mole within Occam\u2019s walls, want him dead so that the U.S. can\u2019t study him. In between, there\u2019s the side-eye Elisa gets from Giles and from Zelda, both bewildered by biological matters at first, though they\u2019re quick to get over their own hangups. Love is strange, and so The Shape of Water is altogether strange and equally as sweet. \nVisually, The Shape of Water screams dieselpunk, signifying Bioshock more than the brothers Grimm, but the film bears the indelible stamp of folkloric mythmaking all the same. Del Toro weaves together his influences so finely, so delicately, that the product of his handiwork feels entirely new: We recognize the pieces, and we cannot mistake the author, but cast in the warm, beryl glow of Dan Laustsen\u2019s gorgeous cinematography, we feel as if we\u2019re seeing them afresh. That\u2019s the magic of the movies, and, more importantly, the magic of del Toro.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "giles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grimm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "strickland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike mignola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael shannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hoffstetler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sally hawkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benny goodman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abe sapien", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elisa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doug jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan laustsen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guillermo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "del toro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard jenkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elisa esposito", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zelda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abe sapiens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael stuhlbarg", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "occam aerospace research center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nazis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "black lagoon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baltimore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "occam", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:16.086+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3dcab7f91b5c6c69e99e3a6ee25b09d1bf83536c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.06xDR0sX.JMTjMkL.MAMF42auL9WeGF93lLyqwdl7E7NqdQqrJHpKrDeIOdEHfhOKg5efDIIDKKUVZVyRr7Gw", "site_full": "www.capetownetc.com", "site": "capetownetc.com", "site_section": "http://www.capetownetc.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CapeTown ETC", "title": "PICTURES: What would you do for a parking spot in Cape Town?", "title_full": "PICTURES: What would you do for a parking spot in Cape Town?", "published": "2017-12-07T10:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.capetownetc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/parking.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3dcab7f91b5c6c69e99e3a6ee25b09d1bf83536c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.06xDR0sX.JMTjMkL.MAMF42auL9WeGF93lLyqwdl7E7NqdQqrJHpKrDeIOdEHfhOKg5efDIIDKKUVZVyRr7Gw", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nikki Louw", "published": "2017-12-07T10:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "PICTURES: What would you do for a parking spot in Cape Town?", "text": "\u2014 Abigail Holden (@TriangularRoom) August 10, 2017 \nPhotography Unsplash <a href=\"http://ads2.hsmdns.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=ad0eea61&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-mce-href=\"http://ads2.hsmdns.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=ad0eea61&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE\"><img src=\"http://ads2.hsmdns.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=1122&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=ad0eea61\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" data-mce-src=\"http://ads2.hsmdns.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=1122&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=ad0eea61\" /></a> Article written by Nikki Louw Nikki Louw is an avid food eater and wine drinker with a passion for writing about it too.

It\u2019s not all doom and gloom.\u201d\nElected a Tory councillor in 2007, Mr Clews defected to Labour in 2011, and left elected politics in 2012, but remains an \u201con/off Labour member\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cI would describe ourselves as populist. We believe that in Scotland there\u2019s a need for a much more aggressive pro-UK campaign, one that can remind people of the hope that being part of the UK can bring.\u201d\nSNP MSP George Adam said: \u201cIt's refreshing to see the ultra-unionists experiment with independence - taking their own future into their own hands. But it's little wonder that this right-wing front is tearing itself apart over Brexit - much like the Tory party.\u201d\nThe split comes amid signs of strain at Scotland in Union.\nANALYSIS: Meet Scotland's alternative unionists\nA \u00a3250-a-plate fundraiser at Edinburgh \u2019s Prestonfield House raised an estimated \u00a3350,000 in late 2016 thanks to blue-chip patrons and a jaw-droppingly extravagant auction.\nWith guide prices up to \u00a312,500, lots included stays at private safari lodges in Kenya and Botswana, French and Swiss skiing chalets, centre court seats at Wimbledon, a polo festival in India, and assorted deer stalking, fishing and grouse shooting events in the Highlands.\nThere was a \u00a3100-a-ticket raffle to win a Mini Cooper convertible, a VIP tour of the Rangers FC training facility and seats in a director\u2019s box courtesy of Paul Murray, and a signed copy of the JK Rowling novel, A Casual Vacancy.\nIn January, with speculation mounting Nicola Sturgeon would call a second referendum, it hired former Labour MSP Graeme Pearson as its \u00a350,000-a-year chief executive.\nHe admitted he had \u201cnever heard\u201d of the group, which claims to have 25,000 supporters.\nBut after Ms Sturgeon delayed her plans, Mr Pearson quit in August and was replaced by Pamela Nash, the former Labour MP for Airdrie & Shotts.\nThis autumn, Scotland in Union held \u00a3150 and \u00a3100-a-plate fundraisers in London and Edinburgh, but on a far more modest scale than last year.\nAuction lots in London included a team building event at the Go Ape Tree Top Adventure, golf at Woburn, a brewery tour, and three nights in an Edinburgh flat.\nRaffle prizes included Union cufflinks, a sports shop voucher, and, instead of JK Rowling, a signed copy of Alex Salmond : My Part in His Downfall by Telegraph veteran Alan Cochrane.\nAsked if Scotland in Union was still cutting it, Mr Pearson said: \u201cI would like to hope so.\u201d\nHe said: \u201cThe challenge for Scotland in Union, given the Nationalist debate has gone into a cupboard because it\u2019s inconvenient, is to maintain some kind of opposition and be ready when the Nationalists come out to fight their argument again.\u201d\nAlastair Cameron, Scotland in Union\u2019s founder and executive director, denied it had lost its way.\nHe said: \u201cScotland in Union has no link to them [UK Unity] at all. I would not call them a breakaway group. I\u2019d call them individuals who were with Scotland in Union who have decided to do something else.\n\u201cIn terms of their suggestion that Scotland in Union has had is day, I don\u2019t think any of us who are with Scotland in Union would believe that is the case.\n\u201cWe think there is still an urgent need for a pro-UK, non-party campaign. Scotland in Union does not take a position on Brexit. Neither Leave nor Remain strengthens the case for separating Scotland from the rest of the UK.\n\u201cThe new group is not in any way connected to Scotland in Union. They\u2019ve gone and done something different - analogous to someone working for a medium-sized company going and setting up their own venture, but it\u2019s not in any way connected to or endorsed by [us].\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jk rowling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan cochrane",
