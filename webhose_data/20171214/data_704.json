Clark 401-863-1638 \nHaving achieved an initial fundraising milestone, the University will replace loans with scholarship funds in financial aid awards, building on need-blind admissions and other initiatives to make a Brown education more accessible. \nPROVIDENCE, R.I. [Brown University] \u2014 Brown University has achieved its initial fundraising goal of $30 million to pave the way for replacing loans with scholarship funds in financial aid packages for all returning and incoming undergraduate students starting in the 2018-19 academic year. The move comes less than three months after launching an ambitious campaign to eliminate loans from all University-packaged undergraduate financial aid awards. \nThe ability to implement The Brown Promise: The Future of Financial Aid at Brown on such a rapid timeline is the direct result of an outpouring of support from members of the Brown community. With gifts ranging from $1 to others in the millions, a total of 2,087 donors have pledged their financial support since fundraising kicked off in September. The University is pushing forward to raise an additional $90 million to ensure the sustainability of the financial aid initiative. \n\u201cThe response so far to The Brown Promise has been nothing short of phenomenal,\u201d said Brown President Christina Paxson. \u201c This initiative takes financial aid at the University to the next level, helping us do more for moderate-income students and families. It amplifies our commitment to bringing the best and brightest students to Brown regardless of their socioeconomic background. \u201d \nThe elimination of loans from all University-packaged financial aid awards builds on a dedicated effort launched nearly 15 years ago to make a Brown education more accessible to students from all income backgrounds. The first step, in 2003, was a need-blind admission policy, which eliminated any consideration of an applicant\u2019s ability to pay tuition from Brown\u2019s undergraduate admission decisions for U.S. applicants. \nBy replacing all packaged loans with grant funds that do not have to be repaid, The Brown Promise represents the next major step. The move is a direct response to the challenges faced by families with moderate incomes, who often do not qualify for the generous financial aid offered to low-income families by Brown and some other universities, yet also do not have the full resources to cover the cost of attending college. \nVIDEO: Our promise: To replace all loans with scholarships in all University packaged financial aid for Brown undergraduates. \nDonors to the first phase of fundraising for the initiative span all ages and backgrounds, including Brown alumni across the generations \u2014 from the 1950s to the 2010s \u2014 along with members of the current senior class, parents and friends of the University. \nOne such alumna is Sue Buffum of the Class of 1974. She has long directed her philanthropic support to financial aid at Brown. She said she sees particular promise in The Brown Promise , however, to bring a greater diversity of talented students to College Hill and to encourage those students to pursue fulfilling, high-impact lives and careers rather than ones designed to repay loans. \n\u201cAs the cost of a college education has risen, I\u2019ve become concerned that middle-income students \u2014 like I was during my undergraduate years \u2014 were finding it more and more difficult to afford a Brown education and were choosing to go elsewhere,\u201d Buffum said. \u201cOther students become exclusively career-focused and feel pressure to earn money after graduation to pay off loan debt, but studying at Brown is also about exploring and finding your passions. The Brown Promise allows students to do just that and not be consumed by financial burden.\u201d \nThat\u2019s important to students like Conor Regan , a Class of 2018 undergraduate from Newburyport, Mass. Capitalizing on the flexibility of Brown\u2019s Open Curriculum, he created his own philosophy, politics and economics concentration at Brown to integrate his own interests into a course of study that would also result in a unique set of skills and expertise. \n\u201cIn a world where students are less reliant on loans, you\u2019re going to have more people who are passionate about what they do ultimately,\u201d Regan said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re not constrained financially, you\u2019re able to pursue whatever you\u2019re genuinely interested in. Long-term, I think that benefits the broader economy, and it\u2019s better for Brown as well.\u201d \nBuilding on momentum \nWhile the $30 million raised gives Brown the ability to replace loans in University financial aid packages for all returning and incoming students starting in the 2018-19 academic year, it marks only the start in a longer-term fundraising effort to ensure the initiative\u2019s permanence. \nIn total, the new initiative requires an additional $4.5 million each year for the financial aid budget \u2014 $100 million in endowed funds, plus $20 million in \u201ccurrent-use\u201d funds for use prior to income realized from investment returns on the endowment. To help future generations of students experience a Brown education with less debt, the University must raise the additional $90 million to reach the $120 million needed to fully fund the initiative. \n\u201cIf the enthusiasm we\u2019ve seen in the past few months is any indication, and having seen firsthand the power and dedication of the Brown community, I feel confident that we can rise to this challenge,\u201d Paxson said. \nFundraising for The Brown Promise is part of the overall $500 million goal for undergraduate financial aid set in 2015 as part of the $3 billion BrownTogether campaign , which launched in 2015. Corporation member Theresia Gouw, a Class of 1990 graduate and longtime supporter of financial aid at Brown, says she knows members of the extended Brown community will continue to give to The Brown Promise . \n\u201cWherever you were in the financial aid spectrum at the time you were in school, this initiative should resonate with you,\u201d Gouw said. \u201cWhen we were on campus, we were fortunate to experience the Open Curriculum and follow our academic interests. The Brown Promise will make that same experience more affordable for many undergraduates. This is a moment in time when Brown \u2014 and Brown\u2019s alumni \u2014 can take a leadership role.\u201d \nThe Brown Promise builds on a series of investments in financial aid the University has made to ensure that financial considerations do not prevent talented students who qualify for admission from choosing Brown. \nFive years after the adoption of need-blind admissions for U.S. students, the University eliminated parent contributions for families with incomes below $60,000 and replaced loans with scholarships for students from families with incomes below $100,000. Today, Brown meets 100 percent of every undergraduate\u2019s demonstrated financial need through grants, scholarships, loans and work/study employment. Donor support has been instrumental in turning each of those efforts into reality. \nThe elimination of loans in University financial aid packages through The Brown Promise will apply to all Brown undergraduates who receive financial aid. This will include members of next year\u2019s incoming undergraduate class (the Class of 2022) as well as enrolled undergraduates returning to campus. It will apply to both domestic and international students.

We accept it far too easily, in terms of the culture we live in. Accountability lies with leadership. It is not enough to report a nil return. We need to take responsibility to ensure that no woman will ever be intimidated from reporting, be challenged by the difficulty of doing so or frightened of the implications for her career. \n\" Everyone is entitled to a workplace that is free from harassment and discrimination, and until we achieve that goal, we will see inequality in pay and opportunity, and a waste of some of the brightest talent owned by half the human race. We want to find out what is working and what the barriers are and identify the leaders who are making a difference. \" \nJemima Olchawski, Head of Policy and Insight at the Fawcett Society, said, \"No one should have to experience the humiliation and intimidation of sexual harassment. We all have a responsibility to take action to prevent and challenge these behaviours. Employers must ensure they are doing all they can to protect the women who work for them and to create a positive working culture. As a society we\u2019ve turned a blind eye for too long, enough is enough and now is the time to act.\" \nA deadline to respond to the letter has been set for 19 January 2018. The Commission has also produced legal guidance to help businesses understand the law better and will ask people who\u2019ve experienced sexual harassment to submit their thoughts on how best to deal with it in the workplace via online evidence gathering. Drawing on practical experiences will help to develop solutions and potential improvements, rooted in real people\u2019s views, and make sure that the voices of individuals which have driven the visibility of this issue are heard. \nSexual harassment occurs when someone engages in unwanted behaviour which is of a sexual nature and which has the purpose or effect of violating someone\u2019s dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for them.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "westminster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rebecca hilsenrath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jemima olchawski", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "equality and human rights commission", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ehrc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fawcett society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:41.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cc112552cbc7f4d5f7317fc71aeb8cb15fbcebee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TtNjGj9FMWIQeNCh192idgOpsXj4CXYZi9vyhwIAK0oTNjyLYq0LUiIquKDOR4UpKQrvQPE7JMJI4wF_RmcwhKkgAYS0AUCUo-", "site_full": "a-new-hope4u.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://a-new-hope4u.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "new hope", "title": "Google Alert - income tax india", "title_full": "Google Alert - income tax india", "published": "2017-12-07T12:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cc112552cbc7f4d5f7317fc71aeb8cb15fbcebee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TtNjGj9FMWIQeNCh192idgOpsXj4CXYZi9vyhwIAK0oTNjyLYq0LUiIquKDOR4UpKQrvQPE7JMJI4wF_RmcwhKkgAYS0AUCUo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Murali s (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "Google Alert - income tax india", "text": "income tax india As-it-happens update \u22c5 December 7, 2017 NEWS 'There Is No Stay From The SC On Linking Aadhaar, Deadlines Are Valid': UIDAI Outlook India Refuting social media messages, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) said that as on date there is no stay from the Supreme Court on ...

\u2013 2024", "text": "Source: imported from this press release . \nCritical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) is a notion that relates to the vigilance and response to serious incidents that involve critical infrastructure of a region or nation. Critical infrastructure includes banking and finance, transportation, food production and distribution, energy, water systems, law enforcement agencies, federal and municipal services, and other emergency services\u2013 both government and private. These CIP systems are required for minimum operations of the economy and government. In short, these systems serve as a backbone of a nation\u2019s economy, security, and wealth. Critical infrastructure protection is getting increasingly automated and interlinked. However, the advancement in technology related to infrastructure protection has created new susceptibilities to human errors, equipment failure, physical and cyber attacks. Various public and private organizations are adopting technologies to protect their critical infrastructure from malevolent objects, generate immediate response to block suspicious activities, and protect the critical systems. Growth of the critical infrastructure protection market is attributed to the increasing number of cyber threats and implementation of government regulations and practices for the nation\u2019s safety. The increasing IT expenditure, deployment of automation solutions, and efficient policies and regulations also drive the market. However, lack of technically skilled force and knowledge about industrial control systems is a key factor hampering the growth of the critical infrastructure protection market. \nRequest Report Brochure @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=22244 \nBased on service offered by the manufacturer, the global CIP market has been segmented into maintenance & support, designing, integration & consulting, and risk management services. Out of these, the risk management services segment accounted for a major share of the market, followed by designing and integration & consulting. The risk management services segment is anticipated to remain the leading segment of the market for critical infrastructure protection during the forecast period. \nBased on security technology, the global critical infrastructure protection market has also been segmented into physical security, network security, SCADA security, building management systems, secure communications, radars, vehicle identification, and CBRNE. Out of these, the physical security technology segment holds a major share of the critical infrastructure protection market and is anticipated to remain the leading segment of the market during the forecast period. Increasing terrorist attacks across the globe, threats to physical assets, and government regulations are the key factors likely to propel the market during the forecast period. \nRequest For Customization@ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=CR&rep_id=22244 \nBased on vertical, the CIP market has been segmented into transportation systems, energy & power, and sensitive infrastructure & enterprises. The sensitive infrastructure & enterprises segment accounts for a leading share of the critical infrastructure protection market and the trend is anticipated to continue during the forecast period. The sensitive infrastructure & enterprises segment has been sub-segmented into government facilities & defense services, stadiums, holy places & public places, banking & financial services, communication systems, chemical sector, and manufacturing sector. These sub-segments are highly critical assets and they form a country\u2019s important infrastructure. Critical infrastructure protection provides solutions for this infrastructure to offer security and safety to customers. \nBased on region, global critical infrastructure protection market has been segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Middle East & Africa North America dominated the global critical infrastructure protection market in 2015 and the same trend is likely to continue during the forecast period. The U.S. is a major market in North America, due to its susceptibility to terrorism, cyber hijacking, and other local threats. However, the market in Asia Pacific is anticipated to expand at a rapid rate during the forecast period. Constant threat of terrorism, rising cyber threats, and increasing investment in infrastructure protection are the major factors expected to propel the demand for critical infrastructure protection in the region during the forecast period. \nThe global market for CIP is highly competitive with the presence of global and regional players. Some of the leading players are BAE Systems, Honeywell International Inc., EMC Corporation, General Electric, and McAfee Inc.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "critical infrastructure protection market volume analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "general electric", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emc corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bae systems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcafee inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "honeywell international inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east & africa north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "latin america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:42.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2fd603db2640d39d2c26ae55bfbc0a2c139304c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5CFytXEILZ36KqifXSeys3vbAjB5QoGDDlsrGRMK9Ni.pV7HR_Lmi0tPm_biDywzp_byuX.0pgnw--", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/o-t-lounge/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "O-T Lounge | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "Yesterday, December 7, 1941...", "title_full": "Yesterday, December 7, 1941... | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T07:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "00efbb1c5da6a9aced8304351beb01e33214fc1d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5CFytXEILZ36KqifXSeys3vbAjB5QoGDDlsrGRMK9Ni.pV7HR_Lmi0tPm_biDywzpav3MiXXAP87KMAiI5dNkd", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "Jones", "published": "2017-12-07T08:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "pretty impressive to say the least. do they take you through from the side and you can see below?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://news.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/2016/12/06/Pearl-Harbor/uss-arizona-pearl-harbor-anniversay_5.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:42.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2fd603db2640d39d2c26ae55bfbc0a2c139304c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5CFytXEILZ36KqifXSeys3vbAjB5QoGDDlsrGRMK9Ni.pV7HR_Lmi0tPm_biDywzp_byuX.0pgnw--", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/o-t-lounge/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "O-T Lounge | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "Yesterday, December 7, 1941...", "title_full": "Yesterday, December 7, 1941... | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T07:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "66cadadbce29afb9afce8e06b99cbd9a99cefbf3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5CFytXEILZ36KqifXSeys3vbAjB5QoGDDlsrGRMK9Ni.pV7HR_Lmi0tPm_biDywzqH42M25QgI97Y3N5iwlEMX", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "terd ferguson", "published": "2017-12-07T08:17:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "You ever been to the Arizona memorial?

President Emmanuel Macron has arrived in Qatar for a one-day trip to the small Gulf country as it faces a boycott by some of its Arab neighbours.Mr Macron travelled to the al Udeid air base, home to some 10,000 American troops and the forward headquarters of the US military\u2019s central command.France also has a contingent of soldiers at the base, which is crucial to the ongoing fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria and to the war in Afghanistan.Mr Macron smiled and shook hands with the French and American soldiers who greeted him at the base before walking into a meeting with the base\u2019s top commanders.Speaking to coalition soldiers, he said the next few months will determine the outcome of the war against the IS group in Iraq in Syria.\"This military win does not signify the end of the operations and the end of our battle because first we need to stabilise and win peace in Iraq and Syria,\" he told troops.\"Next spring is decisive in the situation in Iraq.\"Mr Macron also stressed in his remarks at the air base that France wants to avoid partition in Syria and \"avoid the domination of certain international elements whose interests contradict peace\".The French president later will hold talks with Qatar\u2019s ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.Mr Macron is travelling with his foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who in 2015 as defence minister helped negotiate a multi-billion dollar deal with Qatar to buy 24 Rafale fighter jets.Qatar may announce during Mr Macron\u2019s visit that it will purchase up to 12 more of the French-made Dassault Rafale jets.Mr Macron\u2019s visit comes just days after a Gulf Cooperation Council meeting in Kuwait failed to bring the stand-off any closer to a resolution in the dispute engulfing Qatar.In June, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut relations with Qatar over allegations it supports extremists and has too-close relations with Iran.Qatar has long denied supporting extremists and shares a massive offshore natural gas field with Tehran.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons":

Lakewood Drive home Lou Whitmire , Reporter Published 12:28 p.m. ET Dec. 6, 2017 CLOSE The Richland County 911 tape from 2331 Lakewood Drive, Mifflin Township, Richland County, details an assault on Dec. 5, 2017 where two adult brothers have been fighting and one is cut with a knife. Lou Whitmire News Journal video Trustin Hale CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE MIFFLIN TOWNSHIP - A man has been accused of stabbing his older brother with a knife, causing deep lacerations, at their family's 2331 Lakewood Drive residence late Tuesday. According to the Richland County Sheriff's Office, Jeremy L. Hale, 36, suffered several lacerations to his body. Suspect Trustin W. Hale, 22, also suffered injuries but refused treatment from Mifflin Township Fire Department rescue personnel, according to the report. He was charged with felonious assault, a felony of the second degree. He remains in the Richland County Jail. Their father Randall Hale, 60, also was treated by Mifflin EMS. He was found lying on the floor, possibly having a heart attack, when deputies arrived, the report said. Jeremy Hale was transported by squad to OhioHealth Mansfield Hospital for his injuries, and Trustin was transported to the same hospital by a deputy. Due to Trustin's intoxicated state and noticeable head injuries, he was taken to the hospital. Jeremy received staples to larger wounds on his upper bicep/shoulder area and stitches to a lower forearm wound, according to the report. Trustin Hale suffered an orbital fracture to his face, according to the report. Trustin Hale told deputies he didn't know what happened and he didn't have a knife, refusing to answer most of the deputy's questions. Janet Hale told deputies her two sons had been drinking earlier in the day together. Trustin had left the residence and went drinking at a bar. Trustin had called her to pick him up and Jeremy ended up riding along with her to get Trustin, according to the report. They began drinking beer again with an uncle. Both boys finished off a bottle of vodka, Janet Hale said. She and her husband went upstairs to watch a movie in bed, then heard the two sons arguing. She yelled at them to stop fighting, and then called 911 at 10:44 p.m. She said she saw Trustin come upstairs and grab a kitchen drawer, pull it out of the cabinet onto the floor and then pull another drawer out. She said she did not see a knife nor see Trustin grab a knife, but he went back downstairs after leaving the kitchen, the sheriff's report said. Jeremy Hale told authorities his brother Trustin became upset when he wouldn't go with Trustin down to the end of the street in order to pick something up. His response upset Trustin and that was the beginning of the altercation, Jeremy Hale told deputies. Trustin grabbed a TV off Jeremy's table and Jeremy then took Trustin to the ground and held him because he was afraid that Trustin was going to break his TV, according to the report. Trustin went and got a knife and stabbed the knife through the locked door, Jeremy told deputies. Jeremy said he tried to subdue Trustin with a bear hug and then Trustin stabbed him several times, he told police. Trustin was asked to give a statement but he kept repeating to the deputy he didn't do anything wrong and that his brother has just \"beat the ---- out of him.\" He said he was intoxicated and did not remember much about the night, according to the sheriff's report. Authorities located a knife believed to have been used in the assault on the kitchen counter. lwhitmir@nncogannett.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

In recent months, the government has taken a number of positive steps to reaffirm the importance of international norms and cooperation to protect against threats to global health security. This includes participating in an international external evaluation of Australia's capacity to prevent, detect and respond to potential outbreaks, and appointing a new ambassador for regional health security. Australia has also established the Indo-Pacific Centre for Health Security and committed in the Foreign Policy White Paper to a series of important global health outcomes. \nThis ambition makes for a refreshing contrast to a global political environment of retreat from the lessons of international cooperation. \nAs people move more rapidly and efficiently, so do pathogens. The industrial revolution and the steam engine accelerated the spread of diseases such as cholera and plague across Europe in the mid-19th century. Outbreaks of infectious disease in capital cities prompted the development of international laws for cooperation, without unnecessarily hindering economic advances brought by international travel and trade. \nIn a similar way, a new era of international cooperation was triggered by the efficiency of modern air travel and the spread of pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The public health and scientific community continuously monitors a number of avian influenza strains, most in the Indo-Pacific region, for the real risk of mutation into a strain that could cause a human influenza pandemic. The outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in South Korea and the 2013-2016 Ebola epidemic reinforce the need for constant vigilance against unexpected threats. \nIn 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted the revised International Health Regulations (IHR). This binding international law requires that member states, including Australia, have the capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to threats to public health. This includes updates to national legislation, ensuring surveillance and laboratory capacity to detect potential outbreaks, building rapid response capabilities, and promptly notifying the WHO of potential global threats. \nUnfortunately, global implementation of these IHR capacities has been slow. In 2014, in the midst of the Ebola outbreak, only a third of countries reported meeting these requirements. In response, then US president Barack Obama launched the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), a partnership that bought together the WHO, non-governmental organisations and more than 60 countries, including Australia. The aim was to accelerate the implementation of IHR obligations. Two years later, the Joint External Evaluation (JEE) process was adopted to assess standards, with expert evaluation from the WHO, World Organisation for Animal Health, Food and Agriculture Organisation, INTERPOL, and other countries. \nLast month, the JEE team commenced an assessment of Australia's preparedness to respond to global health threats. While the JEE process is voluntary, results are published online and will be available for review. Australia's engagement is a chance to examine areas for improvement, but also potentially a way to offer examples to other countries on how to best meet international obligations and protect national health. \nYet recent political moves to draw away from the cooperative laws and norms of the international system threaten to undermine global health security. The Trump administration's 2018 budget \u2013 'A New Foundation For American Greatness' \u2013 proposed a cut of US $1.25 billion from health-security related programs (however, Congress has since reversed most of the proposed cuts during the budget approval process). \nThe Foreign Policy White Paper addresses Australia's commitment to preventing and responding to infectious disease threats. While silent on the GHSA, the White Paper reiterates Australia's commitment to the WHO and combatting antimicrobial resistance, and highlights the establishment of the Indo-Pacific Centre for Health Security . The new centre, launched in October by Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, will receive $300 million over five years and aims to promote global and regional cooperation, drawing on Australia's experience responding to infectious disease threats in the region. It follows the appointment of an ambassador for regional health security in June this year, and marks Australia's ambition to play an active role shaping the norms and technical capacities in the Indo-Pacific region and globally. \nThese steps are a long way from the international criticism of the Abbott government's decision to impose visa bans on West African nations during the Ebola epidemic. Then WHO chief Margaret Chan took the unusual step to condemn Australia , warning that such measures were not only ineffective but may also worsen the spread of Ebola by disrupting the movement of health care workers and goods. Australia's actions were more restrictive than WHO recommendations and not founded on a scientific or public health basis, violating Australia's international legal obligations under the IHR. Global health security relies on compliance with the IHR, especially by well-resourced countries integral in setting global norms, such as Australia. \nAt a time when some countries seek to retreat from the international order, risking collective security and human suffering, Australia's renewed leadership is promising. Investing in global health security when global health threats have left the media cycle highlights Australia's commitment to the importance of vigilance and international cooperation, even in the absence of an obvious crisis. With adequate resources and political will, these new measures will promote and safeguard the better health and security of not just Australians, but the global community.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margaret chan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julie bishop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world health organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "interpol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new foundation for american greatness", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indo-pacific centre for health security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global health security agenda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ghsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world organisation for animal health, food and agriculture organisation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "who", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:44.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d8e4c5aff411d2c257a58e66d3e8f7365672924", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5CFytXEILZ3.au4Mic3voL7DBnkIru.F_epz7iVL5AYRnIgSa0GY7lN2zUDZkc7l4-", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/o-t-lounge/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "O-T Lounge | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "Is Water (H2O) Wet?

Rich in culture and resources, the world\u2019s largest archipelago offers a wide array of opportunities for lifestyle business as well as the corporate behemoths that have vested interest and flocking to the nation to grab market share. Yet, for the individual investor and entrepreneur who has lived or considered building a small business here in Indonesia there are plenty of tall tales and myths accompanying such enterprises that need to be dispelled. \nSome claims are so ingrained that even those who have lived in Indonesia for a length of time have trouble differentiating between what is true and false. The rumours shared through the expat community are not usually spread with bad intentions, but perhaps are based on misguided and outdated information. Many of these myths can be (and are) easily debunked below. \nThe Local Shareholder Myth \nOne of the most common misconceptions about doing business in Indonesia is that a local shareholder is required for starting a company. In reality, many business lines are open to full foreign ownership. \nForeign investors are allowed to set up 100 percent foreign-owned trading and real estate companies in Indonesia. In the hospitality industry, that means hotels with three or more stars classification can be fully controlled by a foreign business entity. However, it\u2019s the lesser rated hotels that requires percentage ownership with a cap at 67 percent for foreign holdings and the remaining stakes held by Indonesian shareholders. \nForeign shareholding depends on your business classification. The document regulating restricted industries is the Negative Investment List or Daftar Negatif Investasi (DNI), and it is revised every three years. The purpose of the DNI is to protect local companies, especially smaller and aspiring businesses, from foreign competition. \nBusiness through Partnerships \nAnother common misconception in Indonesia is that partnerships, specifically marital partnerships, allows business in Indonesia to be more conducive. Whether these partnerships are purely to secure residence permits, company registration or simply for further insight into the Indonesian business culture; it\u2019s all speculative. And, although Indonesians do have a smaller capital requirement when starting a company, asset control is a huge issue \u2014 especially if the expat partner in question doesn\u2019t legally hold any. \nFor local perspective, it is oftentimes wiser to turn to a professional consultant or lawyer as regulations in Indonesia can change overnight and the information from a \u201ctrusted\u201d advisor might become outdated or simply untrue. And, there are alternatives to partnerships for all other issues such as visas and company establishment,. \nUnsecure nominee agreements is one of the diciest ways of starting a business anywhere. As a foreigner in Indonesia, you would not have any legal claims to your business should the marriage go south. \nThere are non-financial ways to contribute since paid up capital can be in the form of money or other assets. A personal nominee is only based on good will whereas professionally pledged shareholding agreements keep your assets safe. \nThe Question of Marriage \nIn Indonesia, religion plays a significant role. Foreigners who wish to marry an Indonesian partner often think they are required to convert to their future spouse\u2019s religion, but there are ways around this statute. Most foreigners who change their faith do it because it is the wish of their spouse or their spouse\u2019s family and they do it by choice, and perhaps a bit of obligation. \nWeddings conducted abroad are currently recognised in Indonesia. It takes a little bit of time and paperwork, but your marriage can be acknowledged by the Indonesian government. However, dual citizenship is not recognised in Indonesia so any move to change citizenship must be scrutinised with a fine-toothed comb. \nLand and Property Ownership \nThe Basic Agrarian Law No. 5 Year 1960 dictates that foreigners are not allowed to own freehold land in Indonesia. The same law stipulates that foreigners can only obtain land under the following rights: Hak Guna Bangunan Right to Build, Hak Guna Usaha Right to Cultivate, and Hak Pakai Right to Use. \nIt is common practice among foreign investors to buy land or real estate using a local nominee, but this is a high risk maneuver that would waive any legal protection over your investment. Human relations have a tendency to change and there is no guarantee that your nominee won\u2019t take over your land or property. The safest option to invest in property in Indonesia is through a foreign-owned company, which would allow legal ownership of the property. \nConclusion \nConducting business in Indonesia may seem arduous. Most businesses that struggle in Indonesia struggle for the same reason anywhere in the world \u2014 for lack of demand, high competition or poor management. \nThe real issue here is red tape, so be prepared to invest a lot of time into your business venture. Seek advice from experienced people who have a proven track record in the relevant industry and try to ignore hearsay and horror stories. Investors entering Indonesia face entry barriers, but these obstacles are some of the reasons why the competition is relatively low. Opportunities abound, and playing it wisely can provide some lucrative rewards.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "daftar negatif investasi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hak guna bangunan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hak pakai", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hak guna usaha right to cultivate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dni", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:45.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dbf54499ddf50dd7eb1aabb2b833b2ec0c0751ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvcIM99duwIPlFbCRbswfuH1MPH8ARjUzgWxuPadPl_ckgJB0Wf.LESrCFNLLFE6SRBtUbpn7LtwJzG2VFT4Zmwap_zBOMd1nBRuLApMhcGS2Se.mXpGRM", "site_full": "www.benzinga.com", "site": "benzinga.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.benzinga.com/benzinga", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Benzinga - Stock Market Quotes, Business News, Financial News, Trading Ideas, and Stock Research by Professionals", "title": "Earnings Scheduled For December 7, 2017", "title_full": "Earnings Scheduled For December 7, 2017", "published": "2017-12-07T11:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn3.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/bz2_opengraph_meta_image_400x300/images/story/2012/earnings_scheduled_1054.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23263, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dbf54499ddf50dd7eb1aabb2b833b2ec0c0751ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvcIM99duwIPlFbCRbswfuH1MPH8ARjUzgWxuPadPl_ckgJB0Wf.LESrCFNLLFE6SRBtUbpn7LtwJzG2VFT4Zmwap_zBOMd1nBRuLApMhcGS2Se.mXpGRM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lisa Levin", "published": "2017-12-07T11:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "Earnings Scheduled For December 7, 2017", "text": "Lisa Levin , Benzinga Staff Writer {{following ? \"Following\" : \"Follow\"}} December 07, 2017 4:55am Comments Share: Companies Reporting Before The Bell Conn's Inc (NASDAQ: CONN ) is projected to report quarterly earnings at $0.04 per share on revenue of $362.19 million.

On Tuesday night we saw the level that even Anderlecht are at and the quality that they have. For us to come through the group and get into the Europa League is a big achievement for us.\n\u201cWe had some good performances. I thought we played really well against Bayern Munich at home. Away we got the result against Anderlecht which has now be shown to be a fantastic result.\nRead more: Scott Brown: I feared my record-breaking Champions League record was doomed after one match\u200b\n\u201cYes, we have had some lessons along the way as well. But we should, particularly given where we are at domestically, take huge pride as players and as a club to be in the Europa League in February.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be too negative. We are disappointed that we lost the game, but how we stuck in there was good. That mentality that we have built up over a period of time got us through the game.\n\u201cThere has been a huge psychological shift in the team. We went 1-0 behind, but we still stayed calm. We also had to change the shape of the team to try and block out the central area of the pitch while giving us enough cover behind. Tactically and psychologically we were good in that moment not to fall away. But, of course, I will always demand us to be better in possession.\u201d\nCeltic may not be drawn to face a Bayern Munich or a Paris Saint-Germain in the knockout rounds of the Europa League, as they were in the group stages of the Champions League, but they could still be paired with a club from a major footballing nation next week.\nRodgers anticipates, though, that his players will acquit themselves better than they did against Anderlecht whoever they are pitted against.\nRead more: Europa League hasn't altered Celtic's plans for January window, says Brendan Rodgers\n\u201cWe will play against a tough opponent,\u201d he said. \u201cLet us learn the lessons from the six games we have had here. We want to be better, we want to improve. We have made strides in the last 18 months which have been incredible really. They have absolutely earned the right to go there.\n\u201cWe have qualified for the Europa League last 32 where the club hasn\u2019t been for a number of years and are disappointed we have lost the game. That is a really good sign for me. It is good that we put that demand on ourselves to be better. When it comes around in February we will be better again.\u201d\nRodgers revealed he had relished the challenge he was faced with on Tuesday night as Anderlecht, who needed to win 3-0 to book a Europa League place, immediately took control as Celtic struggled to gain a foothold in the game.\n\u201cI enjoy that side of it, the in-game management,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was getting away from us in that early stage of the game. I could see very quickly the rhythm of the game. We weren\u2019t passing it well enough. We were getting rid of it instead of passing it and there is a huge difference.\nRead more: Scott Brown: I feared my record-breaking Champions League record was doomed after one match\u200b\n\u201cWe changed the structure to keep it together and get us through to half-time at 0-0. Then we brought on two players who could keep the ball better than the two players who came off were doing. So that allowed us to be better in the second half and enjoy longer spells with the ball than we had done. It also allowed us to play the shape we wanted to.\n\u201cOkay, we lost the own goal. We could have been better in that moment. But we stayed calm. We knew if we had conceded another one then we would have been under real pressure. They didn\u2019t have too many opportunities and we had a couple of chances we could have done better with ourselves.\n\u201cI felt a lot more comfortable in the second half in terms of our ability to keep the ball. That is absolutely vital at this level. We had too many players giving the ball away cheaply. We were technically short. We are not always technically short, but on Tuesday night we were technically short. This is a level where if you cannot look after the ball you get punished.
