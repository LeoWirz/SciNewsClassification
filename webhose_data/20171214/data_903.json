[2] Furthermore, Boles\u0142aw , who already had two wives, wanted to marry Predslava , one of Vladimir 's daughters, in order to cement ties between the two families. Despite Boles\u0142aw 's best efforts, the offer was refused and instead he had to accept a less prestigious connection to the house of Vladimir through the marriage of Boles\u0142aw 's daughter to Vladimir 's son, Svyatopolk . [2] [3] Between 1005 and 1013, Vladimir arranged Svyatopolk 's marriage to Boles\u0142aw 's daughter, whose name has not survived in sources. [4] [5] \nIt is possible that Vladimir decided that neither Svyatopolk nor Yaroslav would succeed to the Kievan throne after his death, as both Svyatopolk and Yaroslav revolted against their father. [4] [6] Vladimir perhaps intended that Svyatopolk would only receive the remote town of Turov ( Tura\u016d ) after his death, and perhaps choosing his younger sons, Boris and Gleb , as successors despite Svyatopolk being older. [4] Although Svyatopolk is known to have been older than Boris and Gleb , the exact birth order of Vladimir 's sons is not known and Svyatopolk is alleged in some sources to have been a bastard. [7] Perhaps unhappy by his rule being restricted to only a small appanage , Svyatopolk plotted to overthrow his father. [4] Those theories, however, are based on very little evidence, and in the words of two historians, the origins of their \"quarrels with their father are obscure\". [8] According to Thietmar of Merseburg , Boles\u0142aw encouraged Svyatopolk 's revolt through his daughter and the latter's wife, though he does not specify the goal of the revolt. [9] Svyatopolk 's conspiracy was, in the event, thwarted by Vladimir , who called Svyatopolk and his entourage to Kiev and jailed them in 1013. [4] \nThe planned overthrow, if it existed, may have been supported by Bishop Reinbern of Ko\u0142obrzeg , who had traveled with Boles\u0142aw 's daughter. [9] According to the same chronicler, Reinbern actively took part in converting pagans in and around the Rus lands, but was imprisoned with Svyatopolk and the latter's wife. [9] Reinbern, who might have acted in the interest of Catholic Rome , died shortly after being imprisoned. [9] [2] It is of note that Boles\u0142aw invaded Kiev's lands in 1013. This was possibly Boles\u0142aw 's first attempt to re-take the Cherven Towns, [10] though it has also been argued that his goal might have been to free Svyatopolk . [4] Edit Boles\u0142aw the Brave \nJust before Vladimir died, he had sent his son Boris on campaign against the nomads in the south. [11] According to the Primary Chronicle , Svyatopolk seized Kiev while those of Vladimir 's retainers who were with Boris on campaign encouraged Boris to take power, an offer Boris refused apparently stating \"Be it not for me to raise my hand against my elder brother\". [12] In the confusion resulting from the death of Vladimir , Svyatopolk was able to seize power in Kiev, as Yaroslav was in the north, Mstislav in the south, Svyatoslav of the Derevlians , Gleb in Murom and Boris on the aforementioned expedition against the Pechenegs. [6] [13] As Franklin and Shepard put it, Svyatopolk 's \"previous arrest turned to his advantage, for it ensured that he was already ... closest to the center of power\". [8] According to the Primary Chronicle , Svyatopolk successfully arranged the murder of three of his brothers, Boris of Rostov , Gleb of Murom and Svyatoslav of the Derevlians . [8] [14] \nWhen news of the fratricides reached Vladimir 's fourth son, Yaroslav in Novgorod , he came to Kiev from the north with Novgorodians and Varangians . Svyatopolk 's reign in Kiev was threatened. After a 3-month stand-off near Lyubech , Svyatopolk was defeated and \"fled to the Poles\". [15] [16] Boles\u0142aw , who had recently agreed a peace with the German Kingdom (the Treaty of Bautzen ), agreed to support his son-in-law through military intervention. [4] Sources Edit \nThere are three main sources that provide historians with evidence for these events. The best and most reliable account is from a chronicle by Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg , who obtained detailed information from Saxon knights fighting for Boles\u0142aw . [17] \nThe Primary Chronicle attributed to Nestor the Chronicler is another sources giving a detailed account of events, its reliability being variable, depending event-by-event on the sources from which it was compiled. Nestor's writing reflects the typical Rus' admiration of SAint Vladimir , while Bishop Thietmar's account, despite a generally positive attitude towards the Rus', paints both Boles\u0142aw and Vladimir exclusively in a negative light. [2] \nA third source is the Chronicle of Polish Dukes , a semi-legendary ode to the early Polish dukes written in the 1110s by the Benedictine monk Gallus' . [18] This account portrays Boles\u0142aw in a very positive light. Expedition to Kiev Edit Yaroslav the Wise \nAccording to Thietmar, Boles\u0142aw 's army crossed the border in 1018 and reached Kiev later that same year. Little is known about the armies. Thietmar relates: \"Among those rendering assistance to the aforesaid duke, were three hundred of our [German] warriors, five hundred Hungarians, and one thousand Pechenegs \". [19] Polish historian Rafa\u0142 Jaworski states that the estimates of the size of Boles\u0142aw 's army range between 2,000\u20135,000 Polish warriors, in addition to Thietmar's reported 1,000 Pechenegs , 300 German knights , and 500 Hungarian mercenaries. [1] Less is known about Yaroslav 's army, but it is assumed that he managed to collect a force of similar size. It is also believed that he was aware of Boles\u0142aw 's intentions and had time to make defensive preparations. [1] \nThe narrative of Boles\u0142aw 's invasion is almost entirely dependent upon the account of Thietmar: \"We may not keep silent regarding the sad and harmful events that occurred in Rus. For, on our [German] advice, Boles\u0142aw attacked it with a large army and caused much destruction. On July 22, the duke Boles\u0142aw came up to a certain river, where he ordered his army to set up camp and separate the necessary bridges. Also camped near the river, along with his army, was Yaroslav the king of the Ruthenians .\" [20] Probably after concentrating his forces during June, in July Boles\u0142aw led his troops to the border - the banks of the Southern Bug River, near one of the settlements of the Volhynia region. [1] In the meantime, Boles\u0142aw 's Pecheneg allies approached Kiev, forcing Yaroslav to detach a part of his forces to ensure the safety of his capital. [1] According to Jaworski, Yaroslav , in turn, wanted to prevent Boles\u0142aw from uniting with the Pechenegs , defeat Boles\u0142aw 's main force and then take care of the less organized Pechenegs . [1] \nThe two armies met on opposite banks of the River Bug. [1] Yaroslav 's forces may have taken position with archers covering the crossing points. Boles\u0142aw seems to have taken his time, allowing his army to rest, and started work on makeshift bridges. [1] The Battle of the River Bug (1018) finally occurred around July 23. [21] \nThietmar's near-contemporary account offered the following: The Poles provoked the enemy into fighting and, with unexpected success, drove them from the river bank which they [the Rus] were supposed to defend. Elated by this news, Boles\u0142aw hastily notified his companions and quickly cross the river although not without effort. In contrast, the hostile army, drawn up in battle formation, vainly attempted to defend its homeland. It collapsed at the first attack, however, and failed to mount any effective resistance. Among those who fled, many were killed, but only a few of the victors were lost. On our side, the dead included Erich, an illustrious knight whom our emperor had long held in chains. From that day on, with every success, Boles\u0142aw drove the scattered enemies before him; and the whole populace received and honoured him with many gifts. [22] \nAccording to the later Chronicle of Polish Dukes by Gallus, the battle occurred by accident: When Boles\u0142aw decided to throw a feast to boost his army's morale, Yaroslav 's archers and scouts decided to create trouble for the Polish servants who were gutting the animals and preparing them near the river. However, they only annoyed them enough that the servants themselves crossed the relatively shallow river and chased away Yaroslav 's surprised troops, who had been guarding the river. [21] Boles\u0142aw learned of the skirmish sooner than Yaroslav , and managed to move most of his army across the river, defeating the surprised Yaroslav . [21] \nThe Russian Primary Chronicle gives a different version of events, in which both armies were combat ready and separated by the river before Boles\u0142aw , enraged by insults from across the river, charged with his army, surprising Yaroslav and scattering his forces. [16] [21] All accounts agree that the Polish prince was victorious in the battle. [21] Yaroslav retreated north to Novgorod, rather than to Kiev - likely suspecting that he lacked enough strength to defend Kiev, which was besieged by the Pechenegs and had a significant pro- Svyatopolk faction within its walls. [21] Nestor notes that after reaching Novgorod, Yaroslav attempted to flee \"overseas\" in hopes of coming back with a Varangian force, but according to the Primary Chronicle , the citizens of Novgorod pressured him to lead the fight back to Boles\u0142aw and Svyatopolk . [16] [23] Fall and occupation of Kiev Boles\u0142aw Chrobry and Svetopelk at Kiev, in a legendary (if ahistorical) moment of hitting the Golden Gate with the Szczerbiec sword. Painting by Jan Matejko . \nBoles\u0142aw 's victory opened the road to Kiev, already under harassment from his Pecheneg allies. [1] At Boles\u0142aw 's instigation, the very strong city of Kiev was disturbed by the constant attacks of hostile Pechenegs and severely weakened by fire. It was defended by the inhabitants, but quickly surrendered to the foreign warriors, after its king Yaroslav fled and abandoned it. [22] \nThe city, which suffered from fires caused by the Pecheneg siege, surrendered upon seeing the main Polish army on August 14. [24] The entering forces, led by Boles\u0142aw , were ceremonially welcomed by the local archbishop and Vladimir 's family. [24] On 14 August, the city received Boles\u0142aw and Sventipolk [i.e. Svyatopolk ], its long-absent lord. Thereafter, through his favour, and from fear of us, the whole region was brought into submission. When they arrived, the archbishop of that city received them, at Saint Sophia's Cathedral in Kiev , with relics of the saints and other kinds of ceremonial apparatus. [22] \nA later popular Polish legend related to the history of the Polish coronation weapon , the Szczerbiec sword, is the tale of the Golden Gate of Kiev , upon which the Szczerbiec was supposedly notched when Boles\u0142aw 's entered the city. [24] This legend has no historical basis, however, and the gate was only built approximately 20 years later, while the sword itself was not forged until 200 years later. It is of course possible, however unlikely, that Boles\u0142aw notched another gate with another sword, thus giving rise to the legend. [25] \nBoles\u0142aw sent his German and Hungarian mercenaries home after Svyatopolk was re-established on the Kievan throne, \"the populace\" having \"flocked to him\" and having \"appeared loyal\". [19] It is not known how long Boles\u0142aw remained in and around Kiev. The 10 months given by the unreliable account of Gallus is fanciful. [26] Boles\u0142aw in fact departed within a few months and, as Thietmar died on December 1, 1018, Boles\u0142aw must have been back in Poland a good time before December. [26] \nThe Primary Chronicle alleges that as the result of Polish plundering, Svyatopolk ordered \"that any Lyakhs [i.e. Poles] found in the city should be killed\". [23] [27] The resulting unrest, according to the same source, forced Boles\u0142aw to leave Kiev, whereupon Svyatopolk was left to fend for himself. [2] [23] [27] [28] This negative turn of events is omitted in the only contemporary source, Thietmar of Merseberg's Chronikon . [29] By contrast, his summary of the expedition, written in a part of the Chronikon not devoted to the expedition, recounts that: Duke Boles\u0142aw invaded the Ruthenian king's realm with his army. After placing his long-exiled brother-in-law, the Russian's brother, on the throne, he returned in high spirits. [30] \nAccording to Thietmar, Boles\u0142aw asked Yaroslav to return his daughter, whom Yaroslav had taken prisoner. [24] As Yaroslav refused, Boles\u0142aw took members of Yaroslav's family to Poland as prisoners when he returned to his country in September. His captives included Vladimir 's widow and Yaroslav 's sister, Predslava , whose hand Boles\u0142aw had sought earlier. Having been rebuffed, Boles\u0142aw now took her as a concubine . [24] The Polish duke also took some commoners as well as much of the treasury of Kiev. [28] Among the notable commoners was the venerated Saint Moses the Hungarian . [2] \nIn the past some historians (such as Zhylenko and Kostomarov) have conjectured that Boles\u0142aw decided to rule Kievan lands himself, though Boles\u0142aw had no power base there and no Rurikid blood. [2] [24] [31] Boles\u0142aw 's main motivation, according to the interpretations of modern historians, was to regain the Cherven Towns for his patrimony, while at the same time aiding his kinsman, to whom he had an obligation. [32] [33] The expedition also furnished an occasion to enrich his followers from Kiev's famous wealth. Boles\u0142aw , soon after his arrival, sent a significant force to quarter in Kiev and nearby towns, forcing Kievans to sustain them, and collected significant tributes that he divided among his allies. [24] It was related by Thietmar that before departing, Boles\u0142aw was shown an unspeakable amount of treasure, most of which he distributed among his friends and supporters. [19] \nOn many later occasions in the Kievan period the rulers of Poland, as well as Hungarians or Pechenegs , were paid to intervene in Rus succession disputes; in the case of Boles\u0142aw II , the Polish monarch took the money without making any expedition. [34] Aftermath Edit \nSvyatopolk lost the throne soon afterwards and lost his life the following year. [25] As Boles\u0142aw was involved in a conflict with Holy Roman Emperor Henry II , he did not intervene on behalf of his son-in-law when he was deposed and instead signed a pact with Yaroslav , who had successfully regained the throne. Although he lost control of Kiev, Boles\u0142aw succeeded in keeping the Cherven Towns captured by Vladimir the Great in 981; he was crowned King of Poland in 1025. [25] Yaroslav outlived Boles\u0142aw and contributed greatly to the strengthening of Kievan Rus' .

Technological advances in artificial intelligence are fuelling a new race between hackers and those toiling to protect cybersecurity networks.THE CANADIAN PRESS/Paul Chiasson \nMONTREAL \u2013 Technological advances in artificial intelligence are fuelling a new race between hackers and those toiling to protect cybersecurity networks. \nCybersecurity is always a race between offence and defence but new tools are giving companies that employ them a leg up on those trying to steal their data. \nWhereas past responses to cybercrimes often looked for known hacking methods long after they occurred, AI techniques using machine learning scan huge volumes of data to detect patterns of abnormal behaviour that are imperceptible to humans. \nExperts expect machines will become so sophisticated that they\u2019ll develop answers to questions that humans won\u2019t clearly understand. \nDavid Decary-Hetu, assistant professor of criminology at the University of Montreal, says defenders have an edge right now in using artificial intelligence. \n\u201cBut who knows what\u2019s going to happen in a few years from now,\u201d he said in an interview. \n\u201cThe main issue is that if you\u2019re defending a system you have to be good 100 per cent of the time, but when you\u2019re attacking the system you only have to be successful once to get in.\u201d \nDecary-Hetu said a growing list of corporate and government officials, including Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz, who say infiltrations are their top worry have a very good reason to fear. \nThe Bank of Canada warned in its semi-annual review released this month that the high degree of interconnectedness among Canadian financial institutions means any successful cyberattack could spread widely throughout the financial system. \nReports suggest cybercrime costs the Canadian economy between $3 billion and $5 billion a year, including ransom paid to foreign criminals. \nHacks of Sony Pictures, Uber, Ashley Madison, Yahoo and multinational retailers have sparked unsettling headlines about security of personal information. \nOne of the latest to face scrutiny is global credit-reporting firm Equifax. Hackers accessed the personal information, including names, social insurance and credit card numbers, as well as usernames, passwords and secret question/secret answer data of 19,000 Canadians and 145.5 million Americans. \nCurrent detection systems tend to only recognize improper activity based on past events, often long after the damage is done. \nAn example of this is Equifax, which discovered the breach in July, months after hackers first infiltrated the system. It only notified the public in early September. \nNiranjan Mayya, founder and CEO of Toronto-based Rank Software, said it takes on average 143 days for a breach to be detected. \nThe challenge is growing as the number of connected devices in the world continues to soar. \n\u201cClearly the old style techniques of looking at cybersecurity threats and having people go through each threat aren\u2019t working anymore, so automated means of detecting threats has become more and more important,\u201d he said. \nDavid Masson, Canadian manager for U.K.-based Darktrace, said artificial intelligence will help to keep up with threats by quickly identifying and stopping attacks by picking up on subtle markers that identify bad behaviour. \nHe said his company\u2019s systems map a customer\u2019s entire network, including every user and device, to discern even the slightest deviations as they emerge. \nMasson said AI is needed to keep up with threats by automating defence responses to growing machine-on-machine attacks launched by sophisticated hackers. \n\u201cYou\u2019re kind of looking at a cyber arms race,\u201d he said in an interview. \n\u201cIf you want to keep up with this threat and put the advantage back in the hands of the defenders you\u2019re gonna have to use AI.\u201d \nOntario-based utilities company Energy+ Inc. said installed Darktrace technology alerted it to a user going to a malware site in Russia and uploading undisclosed sensitive data to a third-party cloud provider that its existing security was unable to catch. \nSome observers temper the current exuberance about AI, saying it\u2019s not a silver bullet and these are nascent days for the technology. \nReceptiviti CEO Jonathan Kreindler says the hype around artificial intelligence has accelerated and has almost become a branding exercise for some companies that aren\u2019t even offering truly leading edge technology. \n\u201cThe term AI is now being applied to any sort of algorithmic reasoning unfortunately,\u201d said Kreindler. \nHis firm uses AI to scour writings for unconscious use of language to understand the psychological state of company insiders who are responsible for 80 per cent of cybersecurity issues. \nCanada\u2019s largest IT company, CGI Group, said artificial intelligence is a growing field of interest for customers, although the average client is in the fairly early stages of considering AI adoption in cybersecurity. \nCGI cybersecurity expert Andrew Rogoyski said that still puts them one step ahead of most hackers, who are typically interested in stealing data using the cheapest tools possible. \nRogoyski added that he expects a strengthening of defensive mechanisms might force hackers to also adopt innovative techniques such as AI. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a race, it\u2019s been going on for 20 years plus and the race just keeps evolving. We keep leapfrogging each other,\u201d he said. Join the conversation Sign in to comment (not connected to your Insider Club login). You're logged in as Loading profile... Unexpected error.

Trump, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, French President Emmanuel Macron, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, British Prime Minister Theresa May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker pose during a group photo for the G7 summit in the Ancient Theatre of Taormina ( 3rd century BC) in the Sicilian citadel of Taormina, Italy. THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP/Andrew Medichini \nOTTAWA \u2013 The Liberal government wants to lift the mystery surrounding the G7 summit as it prepares to host the gathering next year, in hopes that Canadians will feel more included and, perhaps, less inclined to protest on the periphery. \n\u201cThe idea is to get input from Canadians,\u201d Peter Boehm, the Canadian G7 summit sherpa, said in an interview with The Canadian Press. \n\u201cWhat are they thinking about some of the big themes in the world, whether it\u2019s economic inclusion, what the jobs of the future might look like, climate change, energy and, indeed, some of the big foreign policy and security questions that might be out there?\u201d said Boehm. \nThe efforts to open the process up to Canadians includes Boehm speaking at a public event Thursday night, organized by the Toronto branch of the Canadian International Council and the G7 Research Group at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto. \n\u201cA lot of this is listening and then feeding it through, but also a chance for us to demystify what the G7 is,\u201d said Boehm, who is preparing for Canada to assume the G7 presidency in January, six months before it hosts the summit at a resort in La Malbaie, Que. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a big gathering where you see a lot of people and even more security.\u201d \nHeavy \u2014 and armed \u2014 security presence is a common sight on the edges of G7 summits, where the need to protect the leaders of powerful countries takes on added urgency due to crowds gathered for demonstrations, which have sometimes turned into violent clashes with police. \nThe turbulent Toronto G20 summit in 2010, which included mass arrests and cases of police misconduct, reverberated for years. \nBoehm suggested involving Canadians along the road to the G7 summit is one way to get ahead of the issue. \n\u201cWe all have the right to express our views and we fully expect that there will be people who will be expressing their views,\u201d said Boehm. \u201cMy own view is that it is best to do that from an informed perspective, so that\u2019s part of the reason for the outreach.\u201d \nStill, Boehm said the summit organizers will nonetheless be prepared for protests. \n\u201cIn the past at large gatherings there has also been infiltration by less desirable elements who do not want to express views nor hear views, but they want to create mayhem,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, on the security side, we will certainly be ready for that.\u201d \n\u2014 Follow @smithjoanna

While the films trumped everything in terms of continuity (and the prequels did retcon and decanonize quite a few facts that the tie-ins had established), in the pre-Disney era, the tie-ins were doing the heavy-lifting in terms of advancing the timeline and shaping the larger [I]Star Wars[/I] world.\nPost-Disney, new movies are becoming a regular thing. The tie-ins no longer have the freedom to tell the Galaxy-changing events or change the course of the franchise, that's the movie's job now. Hence, most of the tie-ins these days are building off the movies rather than creating larger narratives of their own.\nPersonally, I think that's fine. It works better with the current franchise model (much like Legends worked better with the franchise model then) and it does lessen the possibilities of future continuity errors if a filmmaker wants to tell a story that would've been otherwise covered elsewhere in canon.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:23:07.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "caea2eb64571cfd2955295cff53d03377c0e8605", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOoMa4YuFnl7W_yilW8E..GgCpo4lY4XG7l_5v.iUWvykFK_iF6b2baaCZEIxQOczaZdqLJF1teq55OzCtERWu0f.sBkH3ygVzI-", "site_full": "stoswaldsleeds.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://stoswaldsleeds.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "St Oswald's C of E Primary School", "title": "5S creating the Solar System", "title_full": "5S creating the Solar System", "published": "2017-12-07T00:43:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "caea2eb64571cfd2955295cff53d03377c0e8605", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOoMa4YuFnl7W_yilW8E..GgCpo4lY4XG7l_5v.iUWvykFK_iF6b2baaCZEIxQOczaZdqLJF1teq55OzCtERWu0f.sBkH3ygVzI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rupert Madeley (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T00:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "5S creating the Solar System", "text": "\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:23:07.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "61a1257ec99fe2450b3ce4cb9e68ba3cbbc664f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog631sQyVFj_TRAub1WBI36GMajkO.Wai4hlZjOpLM4sK1ge6lv0A6uNqKghoGM2TtXg--", "site_full": "community.comicbookresources.com", "site": "comicbookresources.com", "site_section": "http://community.comicbookresources.com/forumdisplay.php?11", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "painting", "sports", "adult", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "scuba_diving", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Marvel Comics", "title": "Will Star Wars under Marvel ever be as 'new' as dark horse?", "title_full": "Will Star Wars under Marvel ever be as 'new' as dark horse?", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.03, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4126, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "61a1257ec99fe2450b3ce4cb9e68ba3cbbc664f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog631sQyVFj_TRAub1WBI36GMajkO.Wai4hlZjOpLM4sK1ge6lv0A6uNqKghoGM2TtXg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Eller44", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Will Star Wars under Marvel ever be as 'new' as dark horse?", "text": "[Quote: =WebLurker;3302850]Yeah, I don't think Dark Horse ever had a [I]Star Wars[/I]breakout character like that (although I will concede that the Dark Horse stuff is not my strong suite).[/Quote: ]\nHow about Aalya Secura who not only had her own action figure but was in 2 movies?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:23:07.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6bfa2ec0f412b179154fbb8688ade64fea775843", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSVhxeW_jLAEnSUuO7c8bGtmSF4O_VFsdkKol.6RGbNng--", "site_full": "www.zerochan.net", "site": "zerochan.net", "site_section": "http://www.zerochan.net/?xml", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Page 1 - Zerochan Anime Image Board", "title": "Yu-Gi-Oh!

In addition to reducing the pollution menace and heavy traffic congestions on the street, the startup also aims to resolve the challenges faced by commuters for the last mile commute of 3 to 6 KMs. Instead of limiting the moment to the availability of a parking station, these dockless bikes can be rented and parked anywhere, with the only exception of gated communities, private compounds etc. Launching its operations with currently 5,000 Smart Bikes, Mobycy plans to increase the number to 50,000 in the next 6 months. These Smart Bikes are available across Delhi/NCR regions, including Noida, Gurgaon, Chandigarh and Faridabad. App users can discover these bikes around public places like metro stations, markets, and popular haunts like North Campus, Cyber City etc. Furthermore, to help students with better mobility, Mobycy will be making its smart bikes available across several colleges and universities, such as Amity Noida and MDI Gurgaon. Commenting on the launch, Akash Gupta, Co-Founder of Mobycy said, \u201cWe are excited to announce that Mobycy is India\u2019s first dockless bicycle sharing app which is now live on Google Play Store. Everyone has suddenly started talking about bicycle share, but proud to highlight that the app that you can use & try the service now is Mobycy\u2019s only so far. The app presents users with a greener, healthier means of commute with complete last-mile connectivity, in the form of Smart, Dockless Bikes. Going by the need of fitness in our sedentary lifestyles and curbing the growing menace of pollution in urban cities, I am hoping, and would urge users to switch to cycling and join us in turning India into a greener, fitter, cycling nation. In a couple of days, the app will be live on Apple Appstore too.\u201d Users can sign up on the Mobycy app with Aadhaar identification and pay a nominal, fully-refundable security deposit of INR 999. For students the security deposit is subsidized at INR 499. Beginning with its operations in Delhi/ NCR regions, Mobycy intends to soon scale up to 12 more cities in next 6 months and 20 key cities within a year.

Respondents to a CIBC survey said they felt pressure to buy gifts and more than half expect to spend more than they want. (Associated Press) Related Stories Prairie residents spending less on gifts this holiday season \nMany Canadians believe their holiday spending is out of control, with more than half saying they'll spend more than they budgeted, an online survey for CIBC suggests. \nWhen asked how much they're planning to spend, respondents said an average $643 on gifts and another $300 on decor and entertaining. \nThat's an eight per cent increase on what respondents to the same survey said ahead of Christmas in 2016. \nThe 2017 Angus Reid survey of 1,512 randomly selected Canadian adults was performed Nov. 27 and 28 of this year for CIBC. \nNearly three-quarters of respondents agreed they \"wish they could save more money\" at this time of year. About 52 per cent said they would end up spending more than they liked. Holiday stress \nIn addition to spending too much, there were plenty of complaints about the craziness of holiday shopping, the time crunch and feeling pressure to give gifts. \nYet only nine per cent were Scrooges who said they hate giving gifts because it's so stressful and expensive. And only eight per cent said they didn't participate in holiday gift giving in any way. \nA surprisingly high number said they were \"modern-day Santas\" and agreed with the statement \"I absolutely love giving holiday gifts to friends and family; it's part of the holiday magic.\" \nAbout 47 per cent of respondents aged 18 to 34 agreed with that statement and 40 per cent of those age 35 and up. \n\"People are spending more over the holidays than they have in the past and they're telling us they can't really afford it,\" says David Nicholson, vice-president of CIBC Imperial Service. \nThis is part of the stress that people feel at the start of the holiday season, he said. It plays into Canada's high household debt levels . How to keep spending under control \n\"A lot of people do put together a budget, but if they're saying they'll spend more than they want to, that begs the question how realistic is the budget.\" \nWhile a large number said they enjoy giving gifts, about half of respondents said they feel duty bound to give. \nNicholson suggests a conversation with friends and family to set expectations for holiday giving. Some families set a limit on spending or eliminate gift giving and pool resources on a get-together that gives everyone warm memories. Top 10 tips to rein in your holiday spending \nUsing rewards points and prepaid cards can help keep spending under control, he says. About 12 per cent say they use loyalty program points at this time of year, with women, millennials and Atlantic Canadians most likely to take advantage of rewards. \nGiving and receiving gift cards and cash also can help people stick to a budget, Nicholson said. For overseas giving, it can work to order from an online retailer in the same country and have the gift delivered directly to the friend or family member.

Hackers accessed the personal information, including names, social insurance and credit card numbers, as well as usernames, passwords and secret question/secret answer data of 19,000 Canadians and 145.5 million Americans. \nCurrent detection systems tend to only recognize improper activity based on past events, often long after the damage is done. \nAn example of this is Equifax, which discovered the breach in July, months after hackers first infiltrated the system. It only notified the public in early September. \nNiranjan Mayya, founder and CEO of Toronto-based Rank Software, said it takes on average 143 days for a breach to be detected. \nThe challenge is growing as the number of connected devices in the world continues to soar. \n\"Clearly the old style techniques of looking at cybersecurity threats and having people go through each threat aren't working anymore, so automated means of detecting threats has become more and more important,\" he said. \nDavid Masson, Canadian manager for U.K.-based Darktrace, said artificial intelligence will help to keep up with threats by quickly identifying and stopping attacks by picking up on subtle markers that identify bad behaviour. \nHe said his company's systems map a customer's entire network, including every user and device, to discern even the slightest deviations as they emerge. \nMasson said AI is needed to keep up with threats by automating defence responses to growing machine-on-machine attacks launched by sophisticated hackers. \n\"You're kind of looking at a cyber arms race,\" he said in an interview. \n\"If you want to keep up with this threat and put the advantage back in the hands of the defenders you're gonna have to use AI.\" \nOntario-based utilities company Energy+ Inc. said installed Darktrace technology alerted it to a user going to a malware site in Russia and uploading undisclosed sensitive data to a third-party cloud provider that its existing security was unable to catch. \nSome observers temper the current exuberance about AI, saying it's not a silver bullet and these are nascent days for the technology. \nReceptiviti CEO Jonathan Kreindler says the hype around artificial intelligence has accelerated and has almost become a branding exercise for some companies that aren't even offering truly leading edge technology. \n\"The term AI is now being applied to any sort of algorithmic reasoning unfortunately,\" said Kreindler. \nHis firm uses AI to scour writings for unconscious use of language to understand the psychological state of company insiders who are responsible for 80 per cent of cybersecurity issues. \nCanada's largest IT company, CGI Group, said artificial intelligence is a growing field of interest for customers, although the average client is in the fairly early stages of considering AI adoption in cybersecurity. \nCGI cybersecurity expert Andrew Rogoyski said that still puts them one step ahead of most hackers, who are typically interested in stealing data using the cheapest tools possible. \nRogoyski added that he expects a strengthening of defensive mechanisms might force hackers to also adopt innovative techniques such as AI. \n\"There's a race, it's been going on for 20 years plus and the race just keeps evolving. We keep leapfrogging each other,\" he said. \n\nRoss Marowits, The Canadian Press More news stories", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stephen poloz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan kreindler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashley madison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "masson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rogoyski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew rogoyski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david decary-hetu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kreindler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "decary-hetu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david masson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niranjan mayya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ross marowits", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rank software", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.-based darktrace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yahoo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank of canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of montreal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "energy+ inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cgi group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sony pictures", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "equifax", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "montreal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darktrace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:23:09.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "70f309fa5b599e3b5f567e1fbc6b6928ca78fee2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WMuXTosIDFKLtFge97IUcULuKDo3ujlaBKJeaWIP.HCxhD7592NGSEqoYLWGfPcazM5FHGsAYeugD.pPUtUPA", "site_full": "www.pistonheads.com", "site": "pistonheads.com", "site_section": "http://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/forum.asp?h=0&f=210", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_cars", "vehicles", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "The Lounge - Page 1 - PistonHeads ", "title": "F@&\u00a3ing Amazon again 3", "title_full": "F@&\u00a3ing Amazon again - Page 3 - The Lounge - PistonHeads", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8486, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7619dbbbe90623a9b74b1765fead787ee5880558", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WMuXTosIDFKLtFge97IUcULuKDo3ujlaBKJeaWIP.HCxhD7592NGSEqoYLWGfPcazM5FHGsAYemhZ7h9KpzamBnvRyDIpzDs-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Stormfly1985", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Ructions said:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:23:09.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "70f309fa5b599e3b5f567e1fbc6b6928ca78fee2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WMuXTosIDFKLtFge97IUcULuKDo3ujlaBKJeaWIP.HCxhD7592NGSEqoYLWGfPcazM5FHGsAYeugD.pPUtUPA", "site_full": "www.pistonheads.com", "site": "pistonheads.com", "site_section": "http://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/forum.asp?h=0&f=210", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_cars", "vehicles", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "The Lounge - Page 1 - PistonHeads ", "title": "F@&\u00a3ing Amazon again 3", "title_full": "F@&\u00a3ing Amazon again - Page 3 - The Lounge - PistonHeads", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8486, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f1098a4ca18fe2cd9ca47f6fbf46e34d0666122d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WMuXTosIDFKLtFge97IUcULuKDo3ujlaBKJeaWIP.HCxhD7592NGSEqoYLWGfPcazM5FHGsAYemhZ7h9Kpzam5k0mU6IXYF0-", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "Zooks", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "No idea who delivers my stuff but i'm getting pissed off of them falsely claiming they tried to deliver but nobody home.

Most of my stuff is DPD and I almost always have the same driver, get updates on the app saying what hour he'll be within, normally between 2pm and 3pm and he's there at 2:05pm. RM don't try to deliver and put a card in so I have to go to depot. In some ways it's easier as I can pick it up the next day going to work as it's on the way.\nHermes though are a shower. Ordered a Logitech G29 wheel on Amazon, ordered early Thursday, nothing Friday even though it said despatched. Stayed in all weekend and nothing so I got onto Amazon chat. Said where is it. This was at 8pm Sunday. They said it was out for delivery so would look into it. 8:45pm I get a knock at the door from some kid half cut saying it got left at the depot. Yeah OK then... Took the box and when I got back to my PC, Amazon chat responded with it must have got lost in transit, here's \u00a3180 back. That's fine by me! The chat are helpful and if you have issues they normally just refunded if it's under \u00a320 as it's easier.\nI've experienced this myself and have heard from someone who works there that they do have stock issues sometimes which much be getting more frequent. I ordered GT Sport, never got it and found out they put too much stock on the system so loads ordered but they couldn't fulfill. They have issues when it's booked in. Say it's clothing and each t-shirt is one item but it's in a bag of 5, it's been scanned in and 1 and not 5.
