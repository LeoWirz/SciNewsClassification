But I was far from fine.\n\"When I tried to get up after the surgery, I put one foot in front of the other and was hit with a searing pain.\n\"Taking steps was impossible and just like that I was left disabled.\"\nIn the year after her daughter's birth, Tammy was hit with a debilitating depression.\nShe said: \"I used to be such an active person, and just like that, I was in a wheelchair, unable to walk.\"\nHer depression led her to eating an unhealthy diet - including for several weeks eating only ice cream.\nTammy quickly gained weight and within a year the 4ft9 mum's weight had crept up to 22st and had a dangerously high BMI of 66.6.\nThe mum was so overweight that she had to be lifted out of the house by four men just to attend a hospital appointment.\nTammy Peel and her family (Image: Tammy Peel / SWNS) Read More Woman, 22, fears looking in mirror after friend sliced face with Stanley knife at party leaving FOUR-INCH slash She said: \"My world felt as if it had ended and the only way that I could deal with what I was faced with was by eating.\"\nAt the peak of her weight increase, she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.\nShe said: \"Being diagnosed with diabetes was a shock to me and made me realise that I needed to sort myself out.\"\nThe mum began eating a healthier diet and shedding weight despite her inactivity.\nThis year, she tipped the scales at a healthier 12st.\nBut despite the weight loss, Tammy's nightmare was only just beginning in January of this year.\nShe said: \"I noticed that I had a boil on my groin, which isn't uncommon as a diabetes sufferer.\n\"When I first noticed it, I thought that it deserved some antibiotics as it looked a bit angry so I went straight to the doctor.\n\"Another day went by and there was fluid leaking from the boil, so I went back to the doctor and they sent me straight to hospital.\n\"The medic at the hospital said that it was an abscess and they would need to take me into surgery to have it drained.\n\"Ever since giving birth to my daughter, I had a massive fear of hospitals so decided to go home before the surgery the next day.\"\nTammy Peel and her daughter Molly-May (Image: Tammy Peel / SWNS) During the routine procedure, medics realised that her condition was far worse than they had anticipated and she was suffering from necrotising fasciitis.\nThe bacterial disease can start from a relatively minor injury, such as a small cut, but gets worse very quickly and can be life-threatening if not recognised and treated early on.\nPeople who suffer from diabetes are at risk from such infections because their condition weakens their immune system.\nSurgeons had to rush to remove the tissue from Tammy's labia, part of her thigh, up to her belly had to be removed to stop the spread of the disease.\nTammy said: \"When I woke up I was in the most extreme pain ever.\n\"A doctor sat me down and told me that they had to remove tissue from all my groin area, right down my leg and up to my belly.\n\"I was reeling. I felt as if what defined me as a woman had been completely taken away.\"\nTammy was discharged from hospital early and treated with daily visits by a nurse to clean the wound.\nFor eight weeks, Tammy was bed-bound until the wound had healed.\nShe said: \"It was such a horrible thing to go through.\n\"I was upset that it had happened, that I nearly died and feared that my husband and I might never be able to have sex again.\n\"I was mortified about what happened and too embarrassed to tell anyone.

But if you have any interest in a future where the world moves beyond fossil fuels, you and I should both start paying attention now. \nLast week, the value of a single bitcoin broke the $10,000 barrier for the first time. Over the weekend, the price nearly hit $12,000. At the beginning of this year, it was less than $1,000. \nIf you had bought $100 in bitcoin back in 2011, your investment would be worth nearly $4 million today. All over the internet there are stories of people who treated their friends to lunch a few years ago and, as a novelty, paid with bitcoin . Those same people are now realizing that if they\u2019d just paid in cash and held onto their digital currency, they\u2019d now have enough money to buy a house. \nThat sort of precipitous rise is stunning, of course, but bitcoin wasn\u2019t intended to be an investment instrument. Its creators envisioned it as a replacement for money itself\u2014a decentralized, secure, anonymous method for transferring value between people. \nBut what they might not have accounted for is how much of an energy suck the computer network behind bitcoin could one day become. Simply put, bitcoin is slowing the effort to achieve a rapid transition away from fossil fuels. What\u2019s more, this is just the beginning. Given its rapidly growing climate footprint, bitcoin is a malignant development, and it\u2019s getting worse. \nCryptocurrencies like bitcoin provide a unique service: Financial transactions that don\u2019t require governments to issue currency or banks to process payments. Writing in the Atlantic, Derek Thompson calls bitcoin an \u201cingenious and potentially transformative technology\u201d that the entire economy could be built on \u2014 the currency equivalent of the internet. Some are even speculating that bitcoin could someday make the US dollar obsolete . \nBut the rise of bitcoin is also happening at a specific moment in history: Humanity is decades behind schedule on counteracting climate change, and every action in this era should be evaluated on its net impact on the climate. Increasingly, bitcoin is failing the test. \nDigital financial transactions come with a real-world price: The tremendous growth of cryptocurrencies has created an exponential demand for computing power . As bitcoin grows, the math problems computers must solve to make more bitcoin (a process called \u201cmining\u201d) get more and more difficult \u2014a wrinkle designed to control the currency\u2019s supply. \nToday, each bitcoin transaction requires the same amount of energy used to power nine homes in the US for one day . And miners are constantly installing more and faster computers. Already, the aggregate computing power of the bitcoin network is nearly 100,000 times larger than the world\u2019s 500 fastest supercomputers combined. \nThe total energy use of this web of hardware is huge\u2014an estimated 31 terawatt-hours per year . More than 150 individual countries in the world consume less energy annually. And that power-hungry network is currently increasing its energy use every day by about 450 gigawatt-hours, roughly the same amount of electricity the entire country of Haiti uses in a year.

Services were stretched up to, and in some places beyond breaking point. \n\u201cThis time preparations have never been more thorough. \n\u201cBut we have to recognise we are not where we would want to be as we head into winter. \n\u201cThe NHS is already under severe pressure, and while the additional funding in the recent Budget is welcome, it has come very late to be used to maximum effect. \nCan you or can\u2019t you spread the flu if you\u2019re feeling well? #flumythbuster \u2026 #flufighter https://t.co/9rkaLOz9Ur #StayWellThisWinter pic.twitter.com/cuyP7BiYd7 \n\u2014 NHS England (@NHSEngland) November 9, 2017 \n\u201cWe can not say with certainty how tough this winter will be, but the likelihood is that services will be sorely tested. \n\u201cWe must hope the considerable efforts to curb the impact of flu are successful.\u201d \nCommenting, Dr Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine \u2013 which represents hospital doctors who look after patients admitted as an emergency who do not need surgery \u2013 said: \u201cWhile staff on the frontline will, as always, pull out all the stops to provide safe care, the fact remains the NHS is 1,400 beds short of what it needs this winter. \n\u201cThe fear is that we have not faced an infection crisis over winter for several years and if the Australasian experience is repeated here the system will be swamped as never before. \n\u201cThere is a real sense of foreboding that this may be the winter that finally breaks the backbone of the service.\u201d \nPregnant?

strain the NHS is under even before winter pressures have kicked in. \n\u201cA lack of beds, staff shortages and the funding squeeze are all issues the Government should have addressed years ago. \n\u201cEven with the extra money announced in the Budget, it still falls well short of what the NHS needs. \n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly difficult for the NHS to plan for a crisis when it is already running at capacity and staff are stretched all year round.\u201d \nLabour\u2019s shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: \u201cThis serious warning from NHS Providers illustrates just how appalling this winter could be for patients. \n\u201cSerious questions remain around unsafe bed occupancy levels and the additional pressures a major flu outbreak would present on already overstretched services. \n\u201cDespite the Government announcing extra winter funding in the Budget, it beggars belief that this money has still not been allocated to struggling Trusts. \nThe flu can

mothers \u2018could be prevented with better care\u2019 Two thirds of women who died had pre-existing physical or mental health problems (Andrew Matthews/PA) 0 comments \nUp to two in five deaths among mothers who die in pregnancy or shortly afterwards could be prevented with better care, a new report suggests. \nA detailed examination of 124 maternal deaths found 41% may have been prevented if they had received gold standard care. \nThe findings prompted researchers to warn all pregnant women not to stop taking medication without seeking expert medical advice. \nThe latest Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths and Morbidity report states that between 2013 and 2015, for every 100,000 women who gave birth, 8.8 women died during pregnancy or six weeks afterwards. \nGood health before and during pregnancy is vital \u2013 learn more in #PHEHealthMatters https://t.co/l5FSyOZEX4 pic.twitter.com/f3zBdJQowi \nTwo thirds of women who died had pre-existing physical or mental health problems. \nOverall, out of the 124 cases assessed, experts deemed that 35% received good care. \nIn 51 cases (41%), improvements to care which may have made a difference to outcome, the authors found. \nSeven of nine deaths from epilepsy may have been prevented if women had seen improvements in their care, researchers from the University of Oxford found. \nA number of women who died from epilepsy had stopped their medication early in pregnancy. In some instances this was because either they or their treating doctors were not aware that this could leave them and their unborn babies at increased risk from the effects of seizures, the authors said. \nThey also called for improvements for care among women with mental health problems. \nThese pregnancy and baby apps will help you monitor health and development, record milestones and routines: https://t.co/u3bui9CDKk pic.twitter.com/Zh8UMfZ7Sx \n\u2014 NHS Choices (@NHSChoices) March 28, 2017 \nProfessor Marian Knight, who led the research, said: \u201cI cannot over-emphasise to women with known health conditions the importance of seeking specialist advice before they stop or change their medicines in early pregnancy. \n\u201cGPs may not always have the expertise to give this advice and it is best to discuss with someone who has experience of managing your specific condition, such as your epilepsy specialist, psychiatrist or physician trained in pregnancy medicine. \n\u201cIf you are planning a pregnancy, it is important to get this advice before you get pregnant. \n\u201cHigh quality care can clearly prevent complications in pregnancy. In order to continue to reduce the number of women dying in and after pregnancy, we now need to ensure all women can access this high quality care with the appropriate teams of specialists before, during and after pregnancy.\u201d \nAn NHS England spokeswoman said: \u201cDue to significant progress in care, the maternal death rate has fallen by nearly half over the last two decades. \n\u201cThe NHS is committed to providing safer and more personalised care to new and expectant mums which includes expanding access to specialist care for 30,000 more women each year by 2021, ensuring they get the individual care and support needed.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrew matthews/pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marian knight", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nhs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of oxford", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:42.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "67e7810b42456eb65b91d2538231edea538810e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKeo6Qv4AGs5h7QLhva952oxDilEDLkcOAkqNDI3rjXLa4iJ0TTQU2O_aBWmIwM3Pgqd5_G3GMR1I-", "site_full": "www.freelancer.ca", "site": "freelancer.ca", "site_section": "https://www.freelancer.ca/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Freelancer - New Projects", "title": "Animate a logo by antoniusm", "title_full": "Animate a logo by antoniusm", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.f-cdn.com/assets/img/facebook/default-04d56222.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "67e7810b42456eb65b91d2538231edea538810e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKeo6Qv4AGs5h7QLhva952oxDilEDLkcOAkqNDI3rjXLa4iJ0TTQU2O_aBWmIwM3Pgqd5_G3GMR1I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "Animate a logo by antoniusm", "text": "3D Animation Animate a logo \nI need help to animate my startup's logo.

(PA Graphics) \nSpeaking to the Press Association, Captain Jerry Kyd described the commissioning ceremony, being held at the ship\u2019s home base Portsmouth on Thursday, as a \u201cmajor milestone\u201d. \n\u201cBuilding aircraft carriers is not for the fainthearted. There are very few countries who can do this around the world,\u201d he said. \n\u201cSo we should look at our British industry, our designers, all the skills, all the production companies around the country, the shipyards from Devon through to Fife, to the Royal Navy, who have come together to make this happen. A member of the crew adjusts her hat (Andrew Matthews/PA) \n\u201cWe should be really proud as a country. This has been a national endeavour. It has just been fantastic \u2013 it is really a culmination of all our hard work.\u201d \nSet to be the nation\u2019s future flagship, the aircraft carrier can be pressed into action for various tasks such as high intensity war fighting or providing humanitarian aid and disaster relief. \nShe will also serve as a floating military base for the F-35B stealth fighter jets that will launch from the deck of the vessel to undertake missions. Preparations ahead of the commissioning ceremony in Portsmouth (Andrew Matthews/PA) \nCpt Kyd said hosting the Queen and having the monarch step on board for the commissioning ceremony was a \u201ccomplete honour\u201d, adding that she would no doubt be \u201cjustly proud\u201d of the sailors. \n\u201cI think this is the culmination of a number of years of real excitement,\u201d he said when quizzed about the significance of the ceremony in the ship\u2019s life so far. The first sailing from Rosyth was only nine months ago, we have come a long way. \n\u201cThe first entry into Portsmouth was in the summer and here we are today accepting the ship into Her Majesty\u2019s fleet formally. So, it is right at the top, it is the latest milestone, many more to come, but hugely exciting and a very proud day.\u201d \nPressed on what was next for the aircraft carrier after commissioning, Cpt Kyd said it was \u201call about operationalising the ship\u201d, getting her ready to \u201cgo out on the world stage\u201d. (PA Graphics) \n\u201cNext year is all about integrating the aircraft properly, helicopters at the beginning of the year and then we go to the United States to embark the F-35B, the new jet,\u201d he said. \n\u201cAfter that it is more training and we will prepare to go out on our first operational tour in a few years, so it is quite a racy programme. \n\u201cPutting together an aircraft carrier and all its facets and all its bits and pieces is quite a complicated business (but) one we are looking forward to. This (the commissioning) is a major milestone now, it is all systems go really.\u201d \nDuring the ceremony the commissioning warrant will be read and the Blue Ensign, which has been flying from the ship until it is formally handed over to the Royal Navy, will be replaced with the White Ensign. \nThe Queen will also review the first row of the royal guard and will say a few words as Lady sponsor.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "elizabeth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew matthews/pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerry kyd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fife", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white ensign", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gareth fuller/pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gavin williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cpt kyd", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "blue ensign", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "press association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pa graphics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal navy", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosyth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "devon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portsmouth", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:42.047+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "408a2f9cf3594bb5b1031f18c3cdded5fda4ef57", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacBkgFzINQj.DNWB94sRT.YWseATdjFPhkFlrsJgYT5qeAghIzQ166RM5COcFFj2db", "site_full": "www.nairaland.com", "site": "nairaland.com", "site_section": "http://www.nairaland.com/jobs", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Jobs/Vacancies -

Ireland & Netherlands are both small countries with big neighbours & we share common values, a globalist approach & a commitment to the EU. pic.twitter.com/sBk6g9DdTf \n\u2014 Leo Varadkar (@campaignforleo) December 6, 2017 \nAnd after a phone call with Mrs May on Wednesday, Mr Varadkar said the PM was hoping to return with a new formal written offer \u201ctonight and tomorrow\u201d, but warned if there was no agreement talks would be picked up in the New Year. \nDowning Street said Mrs May told Mr Varadkar she was \u201cworking hard to find a specific solution to the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland\u201d and was committed to \u201cmoving together to achieve a positive result on this\u201d. \nThe PM also spoke with DUP leader Arlene Foster, whose rejection of plans for \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d between Northern Ireland and the Republic led to the collapse of a proposed deal on Monday. Arlene Foster (Michael Cooper/PA) \nBut it is understood Mrs Foster has no immediate plans to fly to London for talks with Mrs May and any such move would depend on progress in negotiations between the DUP and the Government in London. \nConfederation of British Industry (CBI) president Paul Drechsler underlined businesses\u2019 \u201cimmediate\u201d need for a transition deal, telling the City of London Corporation: \u201cOr 60% of firms with contingency plans will have put these into effect by Easter. That means jobs leaving the UK \u2013 in most cases irreversibly.\u201d \nMeanwhile, senior ministers came under attack over their positions on Brexit as Chancellor Philip Hammond revealed the Cabinet had not yet discussed details of the UK\u2019s preferred long-term relationship with the EU. \nMr Hammond also received a slapdown from Downing Street after suggesting it was \u201cinconceivable\u201d the UK would not pay a financial settlement to the EU, regardless of whether it obtains a trade deal. (PA Graphics) \nThe Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman swiftly said the payment \u2013 estimated at up to \u00a350 billion \u2013 was \u201cdependent on us forging (a) deep and special future relationship with the EU\u201d.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leo varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark rutte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hammond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mr varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arlene foster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael cooper/pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul drechsler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrs may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philip hammond", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "confederation of british industry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "city of london corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cabinet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pa graphics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern irish democratic unionist party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dublin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:43.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "07769c30f04ec33b3505c15e66c042f34dc8eb94", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYyoODA_sG6MMGxFh26nSAvE8c7L_LJrEdqtJQ2zE9xjvoUim_FlW8YuqyhETCvFVsJu3ftrGr7HzfuUA2a_67MUMMkKrJn_VGcPoLXpQm2.M8NVMOsd536kVrqfINbzeZnZXSjZ6Bedd_6qFJqsajVw--", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.co.za", "site": "tripadvisor.co.za", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/ShowForum-g186591-i88-Ireland.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Ireland Forum, Travel Discussion for Ireland - TripAdvisor", "title": "Greenmount House or Pax House? - Dingle", "title_full": "Greenmount House or Pax House? - Dingle Message Board - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-06T01:43:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10000, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "766f6bd2ad9debc5d123c9e3e11fe77902e4ced6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYyoODA_sG6MMGxFh26nSAvE8c7L_LJrEdqtJQ2zE9xjvoUim_FlW8YuqyhETCvFVsJu3ftrGr7HzfuUA2a_67MUMMkKrJn_VGcPoLXpQm2.M8NVMOsd536kVrqfINbzeZnZXSjZ6BeddsFm_v0AlecACHVF9TivwW", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "fuchsia2014", "published": "2017-12-06T02:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Would you like to be able to walk into town for a meal or a drink?

what works for everyone! It's taken me a while to recognize that people are just born w/ their personalities. You like to receive attention (be smothered, be w/ him everyday) but that might not work for him. It doesn't mean that he's not interested in you just that he requires some alone time or needs his personal space to 'recharge his battery' so to speak. He may have introvert tendencies. The thing is you have to accept who he is because if you try to force the change he might end up walking away all together. So, yes, hold back on the emotional response to his leaving especially if in all other ways he's a good boyfriend who is loving, thoughtful and a good friend to you. Your needs are important too though so you may have to have a calm chat about you'd like to see moving forward with your relationship. Both of you need to have a turn getting your need met. But, if he is an introvert you have to accept him for that - he was born that way and he won't be changing and that is okay you just have to know what you're dealing with and know that when he says he needs his space or his \"me\" time it is not a reflection of his lack of caring about you.
