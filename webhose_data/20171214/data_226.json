Oyo-NW is a high-impact exploration well being drilled with the Pacific Bora , a sixth-generation drilling rig, on the Company\u2019s offshore Nigeria Block 120 . The well is expected to take approx. 60 days to drill and log. \n\u2018We are extremely pleased to have commenced drilling of the Oyo North West Prospect,\u2019 said Femi Ayoade, Chief Executive Officer. \u2018Our team has worked hard to mature our extensive portfolio of prospects and we look forward to positive results from this campaign. A discovery in the Miocene formation would be a significant step forward in the evolution of our company.\u2019 \nThe Oyo-NW is one of Erin Energy\u2019s multiple drill-ready Miocene prospects and will target mean resources of 1.1 billion barrels . The Company\u2019s offshore Blocks 120 and 121 are located near many of the region\u2019s \u2018super-fields\u2019 in the prolific-producing Niger Delta. Miocene and Pliocene sandstone reservoirs are proven across the blocks and within the region, providing the reservoir with numerous large-fields and discoveries. Detailed mapping of Erin Energy\u2019s prospect portfolio is based on interpretation of modern 3-D seismic data the Company has acquired on the blocks. \nErin Energy also stated that upon a successful discovery, given the close proximity to its current floating production and offloading facilities located on the producing Oyo Field, the Company would plan to eventually complete the well as a producer with production tie-back to the Oyo Field facilities.

Under this mandate, we intend to implement share buybacks of up to \u20ac50 million in the period from November 2, 2017 up until December 31, 2017, and a further up to \u20ac50 million in the period from January 1, 2018 up to and including February 19, 2018.\nShare repurchases are made within the limits of relevant laws and regulations, in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and Wolters Kluwer's Articles of Association.

Scientists stumble upon ground breaking discoveries and study widely accepted theories everyday to learn new things about our planet\u2019s past, present and future.\nNow, a study has shown that a large moon-sized planetary body collided with Earth and then penetrated all the way to its core right after the moon\u2019s formation more than 3.8 billion years ago.\nThe significance of this collision, scientists say, stems from the fact this led to the formation of precious metals such as gold and platinum on our planet.\n\nThe team of researchers from Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, Colorado, and University of Maryland studied the collision in great detail to determine its effects on the Earth\u2019s evolution.\nThe team looked to estimate the total amount of matter delivered to Earth via this planetary rock and also study the period during which this collision occurred.\nIt was found that the amount of matter delivered may have been two to five times greater than previously thought.\n\n\"These results have far-reaching implications for Moon-forming theories and beyond,\" said Simone Marchi of Southwest Research Institute in a press release by NASA, which also released an awesome simulation that showed the time lapse of the collision and how it changed the Earth.\n\n\"Interestingly, our findings elucidate the role of large collisions in delivering precious metals like gold and platinum found here on Earth,\" Marchi added in the release .\n\nvia GIPHY \nAbout 3.8 billion years ago, the number of rocks colliding with Earth and other planets was very high. These collisions have been established as the primary factor that set the chain of actions in motion for the formation of teh solar syatem. A recent report published by IBTimes said these type of collisions were responsible for water on Earth, and they stemmed from Jupiter!\nIt is widely established that the early Earth experienced a long period of space impacts that diminished only about 3.8 billion years ago. These impacts peaked right after the moon's formation before it started diminishing. This period, called \"late accretion,\" had a lot of these bodies, known as planetesimals, colliding with the Earth.\nAccording to the release, the collisions during this period embedded extensive amounts of metal and rock-forming minerals into the Earth's crust.\n\nThe study estimated that 0.5 percent of Earth's present matter was added during this stage of planetary evolution in the form of noble metals and metals in general.\n\nA study of mantle samples showed certain trace of elements such as platinum, iridium and gold. These metals usually bond chemically with metallic iron found in the core. But, their numbers were much higher in the mantle which pointed to an external source.\nThe team used NASA data and equipment to help simulate the collision that brought about our planet's bling. The high-resolution impact simulation shows parts of a large planetesimal's core that penetrated all the way down below the Earth\u2019s crust. It went so deep that it merged with our planet\u2019s core. Another possibility is that this planetesimal bounced back into space and escaped entering the planet entirely.\nThe study was published in the journal Nature Geoscience and the team used NASA Exobiology grant and NASA\u2019s Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute, or SSERVI to make the simulation.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "simone marchi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marchi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "solar system exploration research virtual institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southwest research institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nature geoscience", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of maryland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibtimes", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jupiter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boulder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:02.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "48fffe41d87412d2d5601ed753db9ad5888b224e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB54N.xO2X_.aHZHjE6bbAHMx41G7ruEVMcQ001VrXGd4cgXIlVFbvXTpTmxmJ04plIE5BIbeFw2RJlsI2fs3mm7EzwPZBfvnOoh5YIArVmiho3w9dApxXB1", "site_full": "forums.stevehoffman.tv", "site": "stevehoffman.tv", "site_section": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/forums/music-corner.2/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Music Corner | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "title": "The Moody Blues - Days Of Future Passed - 50th Anniversary Boxset | Page 14", "title_full": "The Moody Blues - Days Of Future Passed - 50th Anniversary Boxset | Page 14 | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "published": "2017-12-02T17:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.013, "main_image": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/data/avatars/m/28/28939.jpg?1379401815", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19660, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "62ca3e4fa287ad4e6590627fda782f77b3177f13", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB54N.xO2X_.aHZHjE6bbAHMx41G7ruEVMcQ001VrXGd4cgXIlVFbvXTpTmxmJ04plIE5BIbeFw2RJlsI2fs3mm7EzwPZBfvnOoh5YIArVmihoAHoUz14gV3gH97x61i2Rc-", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "roman.p", "published": "2017-12-03T01:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Craig Williams said: \u2191 The bridge on I Dreamed Last Night is ruined by the orchestration.

This calls for professionalism because humans are naturally social beings. It is therefore important that you seek corporate professional career coaching to know how to carry out yourself when in the office.\n\nThe discussions you have with your associates, and the discussions you have with every other person in your life are probably going to be altogether different. The subtle elements of a major night out that you talk about with your mates are for the most part not fitting to examine with colleagues on a Monday morning. The discourses with your accomplice about your own life are likewise for the most part not suitable to raise at work.\n\nTry not to wear thongs and a shirt with exhausted pants. Try not to wear long shorts with shoes. When you are however made a request to wear a shirt and pants, don't come to work wearing a polo shirt and pants. When you hold fast to the standard of dress that your boss or customer expects, you'll not exclusively be dealt with all the more professionally, your colleagues and administrators will see that you're considering your activity important.\n\nIn case you're a man working in any industry, there are a code of conduct on the way things should be done. You should look clean and always maintain proper hygiene. Some people just go to work without considering how they look, little did they know that image is everything in the business environment.\n\nRemember that passionate development isn't tied in with carrying on and acting proficient. It's additionally about controlling your outrage and your own sentiments when something is business related, in light of the fact that you would prefer not to get the two confounded. You may have a conflict with a colleague, yet that doesn't imply that you can get furious or more terrible yet, physically hurt them in light of the fact that they pushed you out of their way.\n\nThen again, in the event that you generally arrive a couple of minutes early, or on time to gatherings, other individuals will consider this to be being proficient, and appeared to treat the other meeting participants with deference. Your manager or customer is probably going to anticipate that you will work inside these hours, or hours like this. This is so you can play out the required work for the day around your collaborators, which might be influenced by the work you do, and be associated with talks about your work.\n\nTry not to dress in anything less expert than their desires it not just looks amateurish, it won't be valued by your supervisor. This covers a wide range of garments - coats, shoes, shirt, and jeans that you wear. Ensure the shoes you wear are for the event. Try not to wear sprinters or thongs to work - you're not going for a run or to the shoreline.\n\nThey might sit tight for you to complete something or for data from you before they can take a shot at something.

The Proof of Concept will run for a six-week period with a focus on learning and understanding what Police need from a notes application. The findings will inform future decisions for a digital notebook capability in an operational environment.\n\u201cIn an increasingly digital environment, Police mobility services are critical to the efficient and effective delivery of Police operational activities. The ability to capture and share notes digitally will extend the current functionality, as it will facilitate an electronic and centralized database of notebook entries to continue to support staff being \u2018more street than station\u2019,\u201d says Superintendent Cochrane.\nSceneDoc\u2019s mission is to redefine the role of mobile technology in public safety. \n\u201cWe are thrilled to be working with NZ Police on this initiative.  NZ Police is regarded as one of the earliest adopters of mobile devices at enterprise scale, integrating mobile hardware and software as part of core police operations.  It\u2019s a real honour to have the opportunity to collaborate with such pioneers,\u201d says company CEO, Alex Kottoor .\nSceneDoc was recently awarded the coveted \u201cMotorola Solutions Award for Public Safety Technology,\u201d named as a leading innovator of public safety solutions that helps build safer cities and thriving communities.\nAbout SceneDoc\nSceneDoc is public safety\u2019s trusted data collection platform. By modernizing with the SceneDoc Platform, agencies operate with higher levels of clarity and control, with fewer moving parts, capturing data and reporting at the point of need. SceneDoc Collect , the platform's flagship product provides public safety professionals with a 'mobile first' solution for field-based reporting saving every officer an hour per shift. The platform's newest product delivers a 'mobile first' solution for eCitations , saving agencies 50% of administrative work, resulting in more time in the community so officers can do what they do best. Agencies can share information and collaborate in near real-time, from any internet-connected device, making potentially lifesaving intelligence only a tap away.

I have to admit it\u2019s been a bit of a struggle this year, but I made it and that\u2019s what matters, whew! \ud83d\ude42 Today I have some more quick and easy packaging ideas all made using the retiring Quilted Christmas DSP . I\u2019ve really loved this paper pack and want to use it as much as possible before it\u2019s gone, but these projects could be made with any DSP and would look just as sweet as my samples today. \nI have three packaging ideas to share with you today, all perfect to make in bulk with minimal supplies needed. There\u2019s a box-bag, a topper for the Clear Tiny Treat Boxes and a cracker made using the Envelope Punch Board . I haven\u2019t embellished them too much as I really wanted the DSP patterns to be the star. Each one of them has the same silver ribbon and sequin trim though, which ties them together even more and would make them perfect to gift as a set. \nWe\u2019ll start with the quickest & easiest first, our Clear Tiny Treat Boxes are 2\u2033 x 2\u2033 x 2\u2033, food safe and perfect for all sorts of little gifts that are too pretty to hide away. I\u2019ve put some fat 1/16 of quilting fabric in this one that not only tie in with the theme of the DSP, but add to the decoration with their sweet festive patterns. \nThe topper needs a piece of DSP 4-1/8\u2033 square, scored on all sides at 1\u2033. Trim and adhere the tabs and pop it on top of your box. This topper is loose and I\u2019ve used some 1/8\u2033 Metallic Ribbon to keep it in place with a little Silver Sequin Trim tied into the bow for some extra sparkle. \nA sentiment and stars from Wood Words were die cut with the Stitched Shapes Framelits and layered on a glimmer paper scalloped circle. I popped this up with dimensionals on the top of my box and that is one quick and easy gift ready to go \ud83d\ude42 \nThe second project is a box-bag, the base measures 1-3/4\u2033 x 1\u2033 x 4\u2033 high \u2013 it flares out at the top due the type of closure. This bag requires a piece of DSP 6\u2033 x 6\u2033 Score @ 1 & 5\u2033 Turn 90\u00b0 Score to the 1st score line ONLY @ 1-3/4\u2033, 2-3/4\u2033, 4-1/2\u2033 \u2013 these will form the base tabs On this same side Score @ 5-1/2\u2033 all the way down \u2013 this will form the side tab Cut up the base tabs and remove the top and bottom rectangles of the side tab Fold and burnish the 1\u2033& 5\u2033 score lines turning the score line without the base tabs to the front, adhere this flap down Use a bone folder to encourage the paper to curve and adhere the side tab and base tabs together Gently pinch the top closed and it will form this shape with a box base and rounded, flared sides I finished my box-bag off with a bow of the same ribbon and sequin trim clipped on with a mini peg from my stash (non Stampin\u2019 Up!) I decided not to add any other embellishments \u2013 sometimes less is more \ud83d\ude42 \nThe final project is a little cracker that I\u2019ve made quite a few times now and always looks sweet. There are lots of different sizes of these, but this one is my favourite as it uses a 6\u2033 x 6\u2033 piece of DSP without any waste and has a lovely five-sided shape which is a little unusual. \nThis project uses a piece of DSP 6\u2033 x 6\u2033 Score @ 1-1/8\u2033, 2-1/4\u2033, 3-3/8\u2033, 4-1/2\u2033 & 5-5/8\u2033 (horizontal score lines) Rotate 90\u00b0, score @ 1\u2033, 1-1/2\u2033, 2\u2033, 4\u2033 4-1/2\u2033 & 5\u2033 Punch @ 1-1/2\u2033 score line using the Envelope Punch Board , folding the DSP along the horizontal score lines as you punch Rotate 180\u00b0 and repeat I finished this off using the same trims as the other two projects and now have a sweet little matching set, full of all sorts of sewing goodies ready to gift. \nI hope you liked this final project and have enjoyed the series this year. I really enjoyed making everything to share with you all \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019ll be taking a little break over the next few weeks to spend time with my family and start planning for the exciting Occasions Catalogue and Sale-a-Bration starting in January. \nI\u2019ll be sending out catalogues to all my customers who have shopped with me during the past year next week, if you would like a FREE copy, please let me know here and I\u2019ll pop one in the post for you asap as well (available to Australian residents only). \n  December\u2019s Host Code: 3YY2YMTE  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "dsp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wood words", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sale-a-bration", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:04.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "35717b7cdad929595e9cde9ac4feb391120f547f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdD4hdrj5IJ06VdGVypSoUFE492IAKc90plh9hsJLai3zGKyOqwMrsDTHCE19tQPQw-", "site_full": "campbellmom.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://campbellmom.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The Accidental Blogger", "title": "December", "title_full": "December", "published": "2017-12-07T03:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2198d032e184371830c8e481908aba7a5a34d6c1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdD4hdrj5IJ06VdGVypSoUFE492IAKc90plh9hsJLai3zGKyOqwMrsDS2zQ5_yQxc9ppP5HlLMJuA--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "clsiewert", "published": "2017-12-07T08:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I love the kind of excitement that involves an easy chair and a fuzzy pet on the lap :) Glad you found a moment to recover bounce in your bungee.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:04.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "48fffe41d87412d2d5601ed753db9ad5888b224e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB54N.xO2X_.aHZHjE6bbAHMx41G7ruEVMcQ001VrXGd4cgXIlVFbvXTpTmxmJ04plIE5BIbeFw2RJlsI2fs3mm7EzwPZBfvnOoh5YIArVmiho3w9dApxXB1", "site_full": "forums.stevehoffman.tv", "site": "stevehoffman.tv", "site_section": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/forums/music-corner.2/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Music Corner | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "title": "The Moody Blues - Days Of Future Passed - 50th Anniversary Boxset | Page 14", "title_full": "The Moody Blues - Days Of Future Passed - 50th Anniversary Boxset | Page 14 | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "published": "2017-12-02T17:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.013, "main_image": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/data/avatars/m/28/28939.jpg?1379401815", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19660, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "db3e722d4a74a3fa37ba376ad4671b506545ae6d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB54N.xO2X_.aHZHjE6bbAHMx41G7ruEVMcQ001VrXGd4cgXIlVFbvXTpTmxmJ04plIE5BIbeFw2RJlsI2fs3mm7EzwPZBfvnOoh5YIArVmihoAHoUz14gV3BMXBByhKJLA-", "ord_in_thread": 21, "author": "prognastycator", "published": "2017-12-03T16:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Sorry for putting out that incorrect information...I should have verified first.
