Dec 7, 2017 4:03 AM 0 \n\nFor gold investors, the major thorn in our side continues to be the USDJPY so we need to discuss it again. Over the past weekend at TFMR, we had a discussion about how so many well-intentioned people could have been so wrong about \"the metals\" over the past five years. It included this sentence: \"What we failed to predict was the successful, collective manipulation of nearly all \"markets\" by the CBs, their primary dealers and their willing/sycophant media through HFT.\" \nThat one sentence could be the subject of a full post or podcast but, for now, let's just focus upon the market manipulation through HFT. As you know by now, the USDJPY is just about the single most important general input for HFT buy/sell decisions. Whether it's S&P futures, bond futures or Comex Gold, the direction of the USDJPY generally impacts all of these \"markets\" more than anything else. The chart below plots the inverse of USDJPY (JPYUSD) with gold futures. Note clear correlation that began in 2008. \n\n\nIn observing the central bank market manipulation...when we see the same pattern again and again...and this pattern is followed by the desired equity or bond market reaction...then you know something is up. How many times have we captured screenshots of the BoJ, Fed, SNB or whomever buying the USDJPY in size at just the right moment to create and paint a double bottom on the chart? From there, how many times have we watched a near perfect and uninterrupted, 45-degree angle recovery ensue? Here are just a couple of egregious examples that I just chose at random from my desktop folder that holds about 40 charts. (I've only been keeping them since late summer.) \n\nWell, since we just used the term \"egregious\", let's apply it again to the charts below. Recall that things were sailing along surprisingly well last Monday. Over the previous week, the USDJPY had failed to hold support near 113 and again near 112 and it had fallen to near and just below the very-important 111 level. Then, as we chronicled that day, a sudden spike occurred on NO NEWS and not even any rumors. Just a spike from out of the blue that drove the pair immediately back above 111. \n\nAnd what followed over the next five days? Well, outside of the sudden plunge on the now disproven stories from Brian Ross at ABC News, the USDJPY has followed the same glide path all the way back to 113. Also, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE where USDJPY reopened Sunday afternoon...RIGHT ON the glidepath. Remove the reaction to Friday's unexpected headlines and it's a near-perfect, 45-degree angle for nearly FIVE FULL DAYS. \n(And in case you're wondering which tail wags which dog, note the turn in USDJPY last Monday clearly preceded the turn in the S&P.) How is this even possible? It's not...well, at least not in the traditional and \"free market\" sense...the pre-2008 and pre-2012 sense. All of these things used to move somewhat independently as human, carbon-based traders made rational investment decisions based upon a number of inputs. However, in 2017, where 90% of all trading is now done through HFT....well, the results are pretty clear. The Central Banks and their Primary Dealer trading desks manipulate the key inputs and HFT does the rest. This is why yours truly and so many other \"experts and mavens\" have been confounded for the past five years. It's not nefarious intent and it's not because gold bugs are cruel, heartless charlatans who are intent upon stealing as many dollars as possible from the easily-duped. Instead, it is a failure to anticipate the levels to which The Central Banks would successfully go to keep their system alive. Understanding this is why you consistently hear me cite the refrain of PHYSICAL DEMAND. It is only through a renewed crisis of confidence that this system can be broken...at least as it pertains to the precious metals. Physical demand will bust The Bullion Banks by breaking their just-in-time and unallocated delivery system. Physical demand will force price to be discovered through the exchange of physical metal, not the alchemized digital garbage that permeates the system today. We'll leave you today with stories from each end of The Bank monster. The first, and one that we've been following closely since last March, is the continued run-up to renewed war on The Korean Peninsula. WHILE NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND IS CHEERING THIS ON, it is important to be prepared for all of the unknown unknowns that would come with such a catastrophe, one of them being financial calamity that could again shatter confidence in the current system. http://theweek.com/articles/740264/why-north-korea... And the other story deals with gold alchemy and the continued shunting of physical demand into sham/scam paper investments. It seems the World Gold Council is hungry to increase their fees. They are apparently planning to offer a whole new \"gold\" ETF, perhaps designed to compete with the IAU. Ask yourself, from where will this fund get the 200-300 metric tonnes of gold needed to fund its \"inventory\"? Once again, The Banks will simply perform the alchemy of leveraging current unallocated stockpiles into more and more digital \"gold\". http://www.etf.com/sections/daily-etf-watch/new-ph... Again, true physical demand is the only antidote to the poison created by the Central Bankers and the Bullion Banks. Sadly, 2018 promises another surge in war, debt, negative interest rates and de-dollarization. Will these events finally prompt enough physical demand to break The Banks?

This study reports bifurcatriol (1), a new linear diterpene featuring two stereogenic centers isolated from the Irish brown alga Bifurcariabifurcata. The gross structure of this new natural product was elucidated based on its spectroscopic data (IR, 1D and 2D-NMR, HRMS). Its absolute configuration was identified by experimental and computational vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy, combined with the calculation of (13)C-NMR chemical shielding constants. Bifurcatriol (1) was tested for in vitro antiprotozoal activity towards a small panel of parasites (Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, T. cruzi, and Leishmania donovani) and cytotoxicity against mammalian primary cells.

TRX bands can easily be stashed in a suitcase and are proven to activate more muscles than performing exercises without them. Robert Houser / Finding the perfect gift for a fitness fanatic can be a difficult proposition. Whether it\u2019s running, cycling, yoga or tennis, athletes take their craft seriously \u2014 and often have seriously specific preferences for everything from gear to accessories. So we saved you the anguish of blindly wandering around a sporting goods store by rounding up a slew of incredible, covetable and (most importantly!) highly-rated fitness gifts. From smart water bottles to the best fitness watch, these are our 14 favorite items, guaranteed to get your gym-goer into high-gear (or get a newbie started on the right foot). Ionic product render Fitbit FITBIT IONIC SMART WATCH Price: $299.95 An impressive new fitness offering from the popular wearables company, the Fitbit Ionic SmartWatch offers a slew of activity-tracking goodies \u2014 including step-, heart rate-, sleep-, calorie-, and distance-tracking \u2014 as well as music playlist storage and sync, Fitbit Wallet for payments, Starbucks and Pandora apps, fitness coaching, GPS and email and text message notifications. The watch is also water resistant up to 50 meters, and its built-in sensors automatically start and pause activity tracking, so the fitness enthusiast on your list can get right to their workout. FLIPBELT Price: $28.99 For running aficionados, it can be difficult to find a run-belt that\u2019s both practical and comfortable: big enough for the essentials but not so bulky it will interfere with workouts. Available in a variety of colors, the Flipbelt fits the bill, featuring a lightweight zipper pocket that goes all the way around the waist, and a slim, snug fit. With four belt openings, the pocket is large enough to hold even the biggest iPhones and Android phones without moving or jiggling and is also useful for those requiring something to hold non-workout essentials like insulin pumps, lip balm or an ID.

For a quantitative conclusion whether a delay is just an incident or happens on a regular basis, we have to believe in the figures published in the annual reports of public transport companies. However, even if some data is available online, it is quite hard to independently examine these numbers without information technologies. This paper presents an architecture for extracting Web data from a local transport operator through automated Web observations. By exploiting an already existing Web infrastructure, we are not only able to collect vast amounts of transportation data but may also visualise all transportation units (bus or trams) interactively. Moreover, collecting Web data enables us to make suggestions in order to reassess the performance figures of the annual report in terms of accuracy and precision. Monitoring key values help identifying the state of the transportation system.\n\nfrom #AlexandrosSfakianakis via Alexandros G.Sfakianakis on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2AC8O9r\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexandros g.sfakianakis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:47.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e2832dbacb7a746cfb1def8df2457b67b348cc94", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.CtWGBCQ5SYfyGpKoy2hG20uUgkSJ5nXQr7x4voLsx5tJnXFsBsjdOdzuEcLf0BSwv6pT8FhVYP5XMWeRR_Ut3", "site_full": "www.mumsnet.com", "site": "mumsnet.com", "site_section": "http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/weather", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Weather | Mumsnet Discussion ", "title": "Snow watch 2017/18", "title_full": "Snow watch 2017/18 | Mumsnet Discussion", "published": "2017-12-02T15:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "/images/logo/mn-logo-square.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6762, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3ec53fe86ac87250711fa17841201c6e9c844566", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.CtWGBCQ5SYfyGpKoy2hG20uUgkSJ5nXQr7x4voLsx5tJnXFsBsjdOdzuEcLf0BSwv6pT8FhVYP3e.etCmXZdeYXxWEJay6_o-", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "Delatron", "published": "2017-12-07T17:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Well it looks like most the weather channels are in agreement there will be snow from tomorrow in some areas.

News Co/Lab is funded by the Facebook Journalism Project and the News Integrity Initiative at City University of New York\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism. McClatchy will serve as the project\u2019s first news media partner. \n\u201cWith so much focus on credibility, trust and news literacy, we\u2019ve been talking a great deal within the company about how to strengthen our practices,\u201d said McClatchy CEO Craig Forman. \u201cThis project gives us a chance to work on these issues with research and help from experts at ASU and funding from Facebook.\u201d Craig Forman \nThe lab\u2019s first project will involve working with the Kansas City Star newsroom to increase transparency and engagement with its community. \n\u201cWe chose the Kansas City Star as the lead newsroom because it has been at the forefront of a lot of journalistic innovation,\u201d Forman said. \u201cIt\u2019s also one of the largest cities we work in and we wanted to place this project in the Midwest, especially when there is so much attention focused the East Coast.\u201d \nTwo additional McClatchy newsrooms\u2014the Modesto (Calif.) Bee and Macon (Ga.) Telegraph \u2014were also selected to collaborate with the News Co/Lab. \n\u201cWe like these three newsrooms for the mix of staff size and geography and that they represent a cross-section of America. Macon is the location of our joint Knight project, the Center for Collaborative Journalism, and Modesto is a strong medium-size newsroom with particularly strong community engagement,\u201d Forman said. \u201cThese newsrooms also enable us to combine News Co/Lab efforts with some other projects we are undertaking.\u201d \nAccording to Dan Gillmor, director and co-founder of News Co/Lab, details of what exactly the first project will entail remain \u201cin the works.\u201d Although the lab also plans to work with other people and organizations, the decision to have McClatchy as its launch partner was a relatively easy one to make, Gillmor said. Dan Gillmor \n\u201cMcClatchy is really dedicated to quality journalism despite the financial situation that they and everyone else has dealt with. They know how to collaborate with people and are willing to try new things,\u201d Gillmor said. \u201cIt felt like a great fit.\u201d \nGillmor and Eric Newton, lab co-founder and the school\u2019s innovation chief, will pay a visit to the Star newsroom before the end of the year to meet with the staff and begin discussions on how they can effectively collaborate. \n\u201cI\u2019m not walking in there to tell them what to do. That\u2019s how a fair number of journalism experiments over the years have failed,\u201d Gillmor said. \u201cI want to meet anybody who has ideas and feels that they can play a role in moving this forward.

Another low to the west of Ireland will fill into an open wave, along the cold front of the main system. This cold front will surge E and ESE across all of Ireland and the UK overnight and during Thursday morning. Strong low-level convergence along this cold front is likely to lead to strong low-level lifting, forming one or more narrow bands of heavy rainfall.\nStrong wind shear and veer along the cold front may lead to the development of small-scale circulations along it, and brings the risk of a few brief tornadoes. A complicating factor is the shallow wave, which could disrupt the line close to its track (approx. western Ireland to mid-Wales to Suffolk), perhaps leading to a relative minimum in risk very close to it. Conversely, to the south of its path, there may be a higher risk. There are some similarities between this set-up and others which have produced multiple tornadoes. The TORNADO WATCH area is deemed to be where conditions appear somewhat more favourable for several tornadoes - for example, hi-res models showing pronounced wind veer over the front, as well as a well-marked line (or lines) of precipitation, as well as a narrow line of weak instability immediately ahead of the front.\nBehind this front, and not part of this outlook, very strong winds are expected across central and northern Scotland. However, these are already dealt with via national severe weather warnings from the UKMO.\nForecaster: RPK. \u201c", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.torro.org.uk/forecast.php"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:47.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e2832dbacb7a746cfb1def8df2457b67b348cc94", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.CtWGBCQ5SYfyGpKoy2hG20uUgkSJ5nXQr7x4voLsx5tJnXFsBsjdOdzuEcLf0BSwv6pT8FhVYP5XMWeRR_Ut3", "site_full": "www.mumsnet.com", "site": "mumsnet.com", "site_section": "http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/weather", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Weather | Mumsnet Discussion ", "title": "Snow watch 2017/18", "title_full": "Snow watch 2017/18 | Mumsnet Discussion", "published": "2017-12-02T15:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "/images/logo/mn-logo-square.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6762, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "920eec026e6aa6b4c5bd462c242050c1fabf517e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.CtWGBCQ5SYfyGpKoy2hG20uUgkSJ5nXQr7x4voLsx5tJnXFsBsjdOdzuEcLf0BSwv6pT8FhVYP3e.etCmXZdeUximtl_QWBU-", "ord_in_thread": 10, "author": "GloriaSmud", "published": "2017-12-07T17:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Might be a good move doing that FingerofFudge.

The discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model, one of the most comprehensive physically based 3D models simulating Earth/atmosphere radiation interactions, was used in combination with satellite data (e.g., Landsat\u20108 observations) to better parameterize the radiative budget components of cities, such as Basel in Switzerland. After presenting DART and its recent RT modeling functions, we present a methodological concept for estimating urban fluxes using any satellite image data.\n\nfrom #AlexandrosSfakianakis via Alexandros G.Sfakianakis on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2ABuGBQ\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexandros g.sfakianakis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dart", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "basel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:49.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "86ab23fdba461c1f45641a93dd9a19a70d2835eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm1KZKbiUJJEO9Z0gQMxgtu9", "site_full": "www.ooyuz.com", "site": "ooyuz.com", "site_section": "http://www.ooyuz.com/newsanalysis?term=sam darnold", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "sam%20darnold News Results and Analysis |OOYUZ", "title": "Could a bear break into that cooler?

Team Billand was out at Makua Cliffs and while taking pictures of the waves Barbara spotted what she thought was a fish, but it was not! A small seal foraging doing 7 minute dives. To get a better view they moved to the cliff and the critter moved along the coastline about 150 feet out. The seal had red tags, not readable and not able to get a picture. Small unidentified unknown then disappeared. Team Billand spent much of the day searching so many beached not finding any seals, UNTIL they were out at Kahe. They came across one critter Ka'ale RH32 ID'd by his tag. He is looking fine no new dings. Team Billand's saw a seal foraging alone offshore at Campbells. Adult seal doing 10 minute dives alone, large cookie scare on left side of body and ding on head. Barbara was able to positively ID R028 Pohaku. I bet it has to feel good to ID a seal while their out there in the water. Posse pal Vicki was out today and was coming up empty until she came across RJ16 Kahulu resting solo all nice and dry. Gayle checked the keiki pool this morning for Right Spot but she wasn't there. The regular surfers told her she was down by Makai Pier end. Gayle found her and Right Spot spent the day snoozing away. Gayle found 6 critters on Rabbit Island today and as Gayle said the really cool part is that they were all together on the left end of the island.

there are around 2,000 US troops in Syria, corroborating reports that it anteriorly disputed about the authentic troop levels in the Arab country. \nPentagon spokesman Army Colonel Rob Manning promulgated the incipient number on Wednesday, claiming that it was declining. \nWashington was going to take a \u201cconditions-based\u201d approach to abstracting its forces from Syria, Manning  expressed. \nAlbeit the number does not designate that the US has been sending adscititious troops, it still corroborates earlier regime data that contradicted the Pentagon\u2019s official count. \nWhile the Pentagon insisted a month ago that it had only sent 503 troops in Syria, a quarterly report by the Bulwark Manpower Data Center (DMDC) put the number at around 1,720, more than three times higher. \nThe same report, issued in September, showed that there were 8,992 American troops in Iraq, virtually 3,500 more than the Pentagon\u2019s official tally of 5,262. \nIn replication, the Pentagon disputed the numbers offered by DMDC, the US Bulwark Department\u2019s personnel agency which accumulates data on American troops accommodating in individual states and overseas countries. \nBack then, Manning queried the credibility of DMDC\u2019s numbers, downplaying them as initial estimates for given locations that additionally factored in short-term deployments and troop rotations in other countries. \n\u201cThe DMDC numbers are not the official deployment count, the numbers that we provided -- the approximately 500 in Syria and approximately 5,000 in Iraq is the official deployment count,\u201d verbalized Manning. \n\u201cThere are several other things that go into those numbers, it is a snapshot in time and have to additionally consider that number is quarterly ... our official deployment count has not transmuted,\" the official integrated. \nThe US has claimed that it would gradually abstract its troops from Syria to stabilize areas liberated from militant control while bolstering local groups controlling those areas. \nSyria, however, inculpates the US of plotting to partition the country by availing terrorist groups regain power and form their own regimes. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "manning", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob manning",
