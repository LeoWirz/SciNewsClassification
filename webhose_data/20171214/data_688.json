Pretty soon, if the likes of Lyft gets its way.\n\nThe ridesharing company that once stuck furry pink mustaches to the front of its cars is already working hard on its driverless vehicle program, and has just launched a pilot scheme to test out the technology.\n\nIn June, Lyft partnered with nuTonomy, a technology company specializing in driverless car systems, to test autonomous vehicles. And now it\u2019s putting them on the road in Boston\u2019s Seaport district.\n\n\u201cSelect passengers\u201d using the Lyft app are being offered the chance to hop inside one of nuTonomy\u2019s modified Renault Zoe electric cars for a short ride around the Seaport area \u2014 if they want to go further afield they\u2019ll have to transfer to a human-driven car. A nuTonomy engineer will also come along for the driverless ride and be ready to take the controls in the unlikely event of anything going wrong.\n\nNuTonomy says the trial has two primary goals: First, it wants to give members of the public the chance to try out the technology for themselves instead of simply hearing or reading about it the whole time. Once they\u2019ve experienced a ride in a self-driving car, it wants to use feedback from the passengers to help improve the technology \u201cso that we can deliver an autonomous transportation experience that is extremely safe, efficient, and comfortable,\u201d the company said in a release.\n\nWith rival ridesharing service Uber also developing the autonomous technology, Lyft is continuing to invest heavily in its own efforts. In the last year in particular, it\u2019s been inking a lot of partnership deals with relevant firms. Besides nuTonomy, it\u2019s also hooked up with the likes of Alphabet-backed Waymo, Ford, and GM. Lyft also recently received a permit to test self-driving cars on the streets of California.\n\nConfirming beyond any doubt that its interest in self-driving vehicles is not, as one of its own executives put it, \u201ca side project [but] core to our business,\u201d Lyft opened a research center in Silicon Valley, California, just last summer.\n\nThe company\u2019s president, John Zimmer, said last year that breakthroughs in autonomous vehicle technology will mean that \u201cby 2025, owning a car will go the way of the DVD,\u201d and that even earlier, in 2021, the majority of Lyft rides will be in self-driving cars.\n\nEditors\u2019 Recommendations \nUber wants riders to consider more carefully how they rate drivers \nForget cars: this Ferris wheel waterslide is German engineering at its finest \nUber is going after millennials with its new credit card \nHow does Uber work? Here\u2019s how the app lets you ride, drive, or both \nBosch acquires smart bike startup Cobi to deliver a better ebike screen \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLyft riders can now take a driverless-car trip in Boston ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cobi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nutonomy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john zimmer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bosch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lyft", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "renault zoe electric", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ford", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waymo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seaport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lyft", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:42.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3f25235c5c97ac5966fbad29da2cbdaf06720d65", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhPNCND6z2mzMJN7LVs75tWaxmuLTQnP0DU9yWn_tojhBQVVpdyKtn0.eGPVvJExz872JB1prgPvCC16aXyaixMhFzItE7.hbjmWrICZPKG5nbWqWx5gLyMGQ9mlVLHWWkF6fJrf37kmd3mP8Oxl4jcvQIQYZYmAvy4aIPIeGiNoa6N3hfvehc.UBLA1nbhfKn1ITB40Dmyd97htc2xXUL0aQ3fe_2FQRNr", "site_full": "www.military-technologies.net", "site": "military-technologies.net", "site_section": "http://www.military-technologies.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["table_tennis_ping_pong", "financial_news", "finance", "sports"], "section_title": "MilTech", "title": "Vacuum Coating China Market 2017-2022 Detailed Analysis and Forecast with Vendors Applied Materials, Buhler, Oerlikon, Von Ardenne, Shincron, ULVAC, KDF, Denton Vacuum", "title_full": "Vacuum Coating China Market 2017-2022 Detailed Analysis and Forecast with Vendors Applied Materials, Buhler, Oerlikon, Von Ardenne, Shincron, ULVAC, KDF, Denton Vacuum", "published": "2017-12-07T10:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "PL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3f25235c5c97ac5966fbad29da2cbdaf06720d65", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhPNCND6z2mzMJN7LVs75tWaxmuLTQnP0DU9yWn_tojhBQVVpdyKtn0.eGPVvJExz872JB1prgPvCC16aXyaixMhFzItE7.hbjmWrICZPKG5nbWqWx5gLyMGQ9mlVLHWWkF6fJrf37kmd3mP8Oxl4jcvQIQYZYmAvy4aIPIeGiNoa6N3hfvehc.UBLA1nbhfKn1ITB40Dmyd97htc2xXUL0aQ3fe_2FQRNr", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Craig Francis", "published": "2017-12-07T10:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "Vacuum Coating China Market 2017-2022 Detailed Analysis and Forecast with Vendors Applied Materials, Buhler, Oerlikon, Von Ardenne, Shincron, ULVAC, KDF, Denton Vacuum", "text": "Get Customization in the Report, Enquire Now @ https://www.htfmarketreport.com/enquiry-before-buy/830462-china-vacuum-coating-market-by-manufacturers-regions There are 18 Chapters to deeply display the China Vacuum Coating market. \nChapter 1, to describe Vacuum Coating Introduction, product type and application, market overview, market analysis by Region (province), market opportunities, market risk, market driving force;

Following the introduction of trucks for long-haulage and construction, the focus is now on urban and additional low-carbon transport solutions. \n\u201cWith today\u2019s release, Scania comprehensively sets the stage for the necessary shift towards sustainable transport, offering tailored low-carbon trucks for all transport applications,\u201d says Christian Levin, Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing. \nThe new fuel-efficient future-oriented trucks all feature the widely acclaimed styling and product characteristics of the new truck generation. Among these are enhanced driveability as well as improved visibility, increased safety, ergonomics and comfort. With the new generation trucks, Scania is taking major steps in providing customer-adapted trucks for even better total operating economy. \nScania extends its urban range \nWith the introduction of the lighter trucks powered by the new 7-litre engine, Scania offers urban transporters a new level of transport efficiency with fuel savings of up to 10 percent. With its more compact dimensions, the new P-series cab can feature a lower engine tunnel, which opens up a more spacious cab interior. Drivers will enjoy the best driving conditions in the industry in vehicles that excel in handling, steering and driveability \u2013 all of which are essential in challenging urban traffic. \nLow entry for higher efficiency \nThe L-series is Scania\u2019s newly developed cab series for urban transport, such as distribution, refuse collection and maintenance. Drivers will benefit from vastly improved direct vision of the surroundings. Drivers will also be at the same height as other road users, with the added advantage of improved working conditions when repeatedly entering and exiting the cab. The Scania L-series features a kneeling mode and lower boarding steps on both sides of the cab. Drivers can also take advantage of the space in front of the engine tunnel to exit on the passenger side, thereby avoiding oncoming traffic. \nKeeping an eye on safety \nIn addition to the better view over surrounding traffic, Scania introduces the City Safe Window. Drivers will thereby have better opportunities to detect nearby pedestrians and cyclists. The window on the passenger side door is available for all P- and L-series cabs, those most common in urban transport, as well as for the CrewCab. \nScania CrewCab \u2013 protecting those that protect \nSince Scania\u2019s new CrewCab will mainly be used by firefighters, it has been specifically tailored for emergency assignments, keeping both ergonomics and safety in mind. For extra safety, there is an option for up to four roll over side-curtain airbags. The CrewCab accommodates up to eight passengers with a high level of safety and comfort, which includes a separate climate system with its own heating for the crew area. \nBreakthrough for gas-fuelled long-haulage operations \nScania already offers the broadest range of trucks for renewable fuels, including ethanol, biodiesel, HVO as well as hybrid technology. \nWith Scania\u2019s introduction of a six-cylinder 13-litre gas engine specifically designed for regional and long-haulage operations, climate-conscious hauliers now have a strong alternative to conventional fossil fuels. For a 40-tonne truck-and-trailer combination with tanks for liquefied gas, the range has been extended to 1,100 kilometres. In parallel, Scania also releases a 9-litre gas engine for the new truck generation. \nIncreased uptime with flexible plans \nScania Maintenance with Flexible Plans is now also made available for the gas engine range. Significantly greater maintenance precision can be achieved on the basis of the vehicle\u2019s actual usage pattern as continuously monitored through connectivity. The solution ensures that every single truck gets exactly the right maintenance at exactly the right time, thereby reducing time in the workshop and increasing uptime. \n\u201cWith the new generation trucks, Scania is taking major steps in improved safety, driver comfort and fuel economy. The released models have been universally praised and awarded for their innovative features and overall performance and we are certain that the new urban range will be equally successful,\u201d says Levin. \nMore information available on www.scania.com/group/en/section/pressroom/presskit/ . \nFor further information, please contact: \nHenrik Eng, Product Director, Urban, Scania Trucks \nPhone: + 46 70 658 98 29, email: \n\u00d6rjan \u00c5slund, Head of Product Affairs, Scania Trucks \nPhone: +46 70 289 83 78; email: \nScania is a world leading provider of transport solutions.

I love when it\u2019s finished and then I get to relax. The plan is to do more of that this month and to really take in the seaon and savor it all. \nToday, I\u2019m joining another blog hop with our hostess, Marty at A Stroll Thru Life for her annual Christmas party in blogland and there will be lots more inspiration out there to see as well, so I hope you\u2019ll stop by and visit these ladies all at the bottom of this post. \nIf you\u2019re new here and stopping by from Life & Home at 2012 , welcome! I\u2019m so happy to meet you. \nI\u2019m going to be sharing our kitchen eating area and the mantel which is next door in our family room. I love having these two spaces open to each other, it feels so homey to have it all together. \nIf you\u2019re new here, let me tell you a bit about me. I\u2019m a long time home/DIY/Lifestyle blogger about to hit 11 years in February, so I\u2019ve been on the internet for a long time. I\u2019ve been through many changes during that time and this year, I married the love of my life, Mark, and we bought a house together which we are working on putting our own stamp on to make it a unique home for us. It\u2019s not an old house, 12 years old, but with my husband\u2019s talents in adding trim and details and my passion for beautiful spaces, we are having fun with this house! We are in our 60\u2019s and both enjoy creating a pretty home that reflects our tastes and we have a lot more to do around here. You can find all our projects so far under the DIY/How to tab on the blog. \nI have to open the door again to welcome everyone in, so please come in and join me for the tour. \nI shared the foyer table last week and now I get to watch those paperwhites come alive with blooms. \nI love this part, when every day they change and open up even more with those delicate white blossoms. \nI also shared our pretty and colorful tree in the living room right inside the front door, so take a look at that if you missed it. \nWe\u2019ll head down the hallway to the family room and kitchen. \nI didn\u2019t do a lot of decorating in the family room, but a mantel begs to be decorated for Christmas, so I added some holiday cheer to this area. \nI used my beautiful O Come Let Us Adore Him sign from Scripted Simplicity that I\u2019ve had for a couple of years and it\u2019s the perfect sentiment for the fireplace this season. \nAll of this I\u2019ve had for awhile, except for the new little lime green faux cedar trees. I found those online this year and you can see them in my Shop if you check it out. I love little things like this for Christmas and they will transition into other seasons as well. \nThe middle are just fresh greens I picked up and clipped myself. I got the cedar branches at the home store since I don\u2019t have any of these growing in my yard, but I do have a magnolia tree in our backyard in the woods, so I cut a few branches and leaves from it this year. Magnolia leaves are so Southern and a great accent at Christmas. I piled a few gold glass Christmas ornaments in a brass tray and called it done. Sometimes simple is best! \nI love things under glass this time of year and they seem to take on more importance just sitting under that glass dome. Simple gold glass ornaments. I picked up that vintage garland at an antique store once and wish I could find more of it. The other garland I\u2019ve had for a few years too. \nMore silver and white ornaments are piled under this dome and sitting on a wood slice. I\u2019ve had these urns forever too and they are real work horses for me. I added a black and white ribbon to add some pizazz and love the pop it gives. \nPeeking into the kitchen sitting area from the family room, you can see all my green and white things I\u2019ve been decorating for about as long as I\u2019ve been blogging, I think. I\u2019ve been putting this little tree in my kitchen forever and it still makes me happy and feels so festive. \nYou can see the addition of a new lamp in here and that\u2019s Mark\u2019s lamp, in case you had any doubts. We are still getting things out to use and he loves this lamp, so this was a good spot to use it in. It\u2019s not toally my taste, but I think it looks nice here too. See those other cute things in the windows? Yep, those are Mark\u2019s too and I\u2019ve got a story to share about that. \nAnother look at the antique French buffet I\u2019ve had for about 20 years. It\u2019s from about 1880 and a very neat piece. I love the shape of it and have never seen another one like it. Talk about character! \nIt\u2019s great for extra storage and to put things on top of for special occasions and perfect for Christmas decorating. I\u2019ve got 2 rustic shelves that I\u2019m adding up here soon too which will be fun to play with. I bought that platter and cake plate when I was still in Birmingham and still love them too. My friend, Andrea, gave me that cute Christmas towel. \nAnother Mark addition, I couldn\u2019t resist adding this cute snowman cookie jar to the mix too. More cookies please! Guess I need to make some cookies, don\u2019t I? \nThe sign is from the very talented Tara at Between You and Me . I love this one too! This sentiment is such a part of Christmas to me. \nThe tree is full of all these cute ornaments that I\u2019ve mostly had for a long while. This cute tag is also from Scripted Simplicity. It\u2019s a happy little tree! \nI think I picked up this Santa at a yardsale years ago and he fits right in. \nLove the green and red for Christmas! \nSo back to those Santas. Of course they are Mark\u2019s and there is a story to tell. It seems that he really fell for these vintage Santas and there\u2019s a reason for it. \nThe day after he was born in August, 64 years ago, his dad and big sister were on their way to the hospital to see Mark and his mom, when right in front of them a box fell off a truck. The truck kept going and didn\u2019t stop, so Mark\u2019s dad stopped and picked up the box. He had no idea where to return it, so when they opened the box, there was one of those plastic Santas that light up. The kind you place in the yard and light up at night. \nHeres\u2019s that vintage Santa now. Mark doesn\u2019t light him up anymore, because the bulb gets too hot and it was making burn marks on Santa, so he\u2019s now displayed in Mark\u2019s man cave closet on his lawyer shelves, out of the way of harm. I told you he\u2019s a sentimental guy and I wasn\u2019t kidding! \nIn fact, there\u2019s more to this story\u2026 \nAt least twice, he rescued Santa from the trash pile. When he was still in high school, he came home one day to find Santa out in the trash pile for the trash pickup. His mother had thrown him to the curb. Mark rescued Santa that time and then another time later on and finally took possession of Santa and he\u2019s been with him ever since. Santa is 64 years old, just like Mark. Ha! \nHow about that story, isn\u2019t that the cutest? You might say Santa and Mark are r ally connected. \nSo, Mark is pretty sentimental about these plastic Santas that were such a part of his childhood, so he\u2019s collected a few more that he bought off Ebay. \nThey look so cute lit up at night and I\u2019m so enjoying them as part of our kitchen Christmas decor this year. It was my idea to hang them in the window. We have taken down these blinds in preparation for getting bamboo shades installed very soon, so it was perfect for showing off the Santas. I wanted to hide the cords as much as I could, so I tacked up this pretty Christmas table runner in my colors to help disguise them and it looks like a little valance. \nLastly, I added this pretty cranberry wreath to the back door from Tree Classics as well. It\u2019s a nice addition and very festive. \nNext on the home tour stop is Jennifer with Decorating Delirium , hope you enjoy her beautiful home tour as well! \nPlease stop by and visit as many of these blogs as you can! I know you\u2019ll enjoy all the inspiration that they will be sharing this Christmas season and it\u2019s like visiting a whole Christmas tour of homes in your pajamas, so how fun is that?

This has resulted in Ghana importing most of its refined petroleum. \nAddressing the 3rd Aliu Mahama Memorial Lecture on Wednesday, 6 December 2017, Mr Ofori-Atta said the facility is coming on stream next year while emphasising the strategic role TOR can play in efforts to expand Ghana\u2019s petrochemical sector. \n\u201cI\u2019m happy to say that things are changing and latest by the first-quarter of 2018, we expect Tema Oil Refinery to run continuously again. The strategic goal is to engage local and international partners to significantly expand this refining and storage capacity\u2026 \n\u201cTOR has a strategic role in our petrochemical industry as it can provide a platform for the development of other related industries. Leveraging Ghana\u2019s resources requires a focus strategy that targets the benefits of specific fuels to drive growth. \nGases are often misidentified as a fuel simply for power generation [but] this government will facilitate the setting up of a multi-billion dollar gas feedstock industrial estate in the Nzema area producing methanol, ammonia, urea and natural gas liquids which hopefully will feed the oil and gas industry both in Ghana and Cote d\u2019Ivoire.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ofori-atta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ken ofori-atta", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "3rd aliu mahama memorial lecture", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tema oil refinery", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "nzema", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ghana", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:43.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a6e54e4234b4b737584c6685a2aff16ed7b36c5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSbSRB836yWLDRTUHYmFJfMKxkQ6adyIvC1vjXd1Lm5jM4pgo7AumBrJZx3TnCwk4TNtsuQoAafRcd9p0_pUTjcRGsxld3Kiz3h5AKRexwZt7oOh5HH9xkFzXFWCkZsRJs-", "site_full": "www.ghanamma.com", "site": "ghanamma.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/ghanammacom", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Ghanamma.com", "title": "Frank Nuttal did not leave any training program behind \u2013 Wellington", "title_full": "Frank Nuttal did not leave any training program behind \u2013 Wellington", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.ghanamma.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/33794525.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a6e54e4234b4b737584c6685a2aff16ed7b36c5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSbSRB836yWLDRTUHYmFJfMKxkQ6adyIvC1vjXd1Lm5jM4pgo7AumBrJZx3TnCwk4TNtsuQoAafRcd9p0_pUTjcRGsxld3Kiz3h5AKRexwZt7oOh5HH9xkFzXFWCkZsRJs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ghanamma", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Frank Nuttal did not leave any training program behind \u2013 Wellington", "text": "Frank Nuttal did not leave any training program behind \u2013 Wellington December 7, 2017 Sports News of Thursday, 7 December 2017 Source: GHANAsoccernet.com \n2017-12-07 Hearts commenced their pre-season training on Monday without their head coach Hearts of Oak deputy coach Henry Wellington has disclosed that he was not given any training program for the forthcoming season by Frank Nuttal before the Scottish coach left Ghana for holidays after the end of last season. \nThe Phobians commenced their pre-season training on Monday without their Scottish head trainer who is expected to arrive in the country this weekend. \nThe training was supervised assistant coach Henry Wellington but according to the spokesman of the club, Kwame Opare Addo, head coach, Frank Nuttall prepared the upcoming season\u2019s training program for his technical staff before leaving for holidays in the aftermath of last season. \nBut according to Wellington, the Scottish coach left the shores of the country without leaving a report or training program as declared by the club\u2019s scribe. \n\u201cThe coach (Frank Nuttall) never left a report or training program.

\nGuinness Ghana Breweries Limited has launched a new alcoholic beverage onto the Ashanti market known as \u201cOdehye3 Beer\u201d. \nThe unveiling of Odehye3 Beer is in line with GGBL\u2019s commitment to satisfy the demands of its numerous consumers. \nOdehye3 Beer which comes in 625ml and 300ml bottles is a beverage which celebrates the true rich Ashanti heritage and royalty; thus about 70 per cent of the raw materials used being sourced locally. \nSpeaking to Ultimate Business at the launch of the product on Farmers\u2019 Day, Marketing and Innovations Director at GGBL, Melanie Ramsey said the new product was very different from any other on the market. \n\u201cThis is a very unique beer that we\u2019ve created solely for the Ashanti people so we used local ingredients, brewed it at the local brewery, packaged locally and all of the packed designs have been designed specifically for Ashanti and the taste developed specifically for this region\u201d. \n\u201cBecause the Ashanti people are known as descendants of royalty, the name Odehye3 seems like an actual fit for a beer for this region\u201d, Melanie Ramsey added. \nAlso Corporate Relations Director at GGBL, Gabriel Opoku Asare added that his outfit sourcing about 70 per cent of local raw materials for Odehye3 Beer is to create sustainable livelihoods for Ghanaian farmers. \n\u201cWe have a big agenda to build thriving communities and by sourcing locally, we know the farmer knows that there is a ready buyer for whatever they produce. \nIt is also clearly aligned to the government\u2019s \u201cPlanting for Food and Jobs\u201d agenda and we are committed to it\u201d. \n\u201cGuinness Ghana started from the place of 12 per cent in 2012, currently we are at 48 per cent and we want to move our local inputs to 70 per cent by 2020,\u201d he said. \n\u201cWe currently source sorghum, maize and cassava and in addition we\u2019ve got 70 per cent sorghum mixed with malt\u201d, Mr. Opoku Asare

\u2018Tamale Sakawa King\u2019 as he is fingered in another scandal December 7, 2017 General News of Thursday, 7 December 2017 Source: mynewsgh.com \n2017-12-07 Maxwell Peter was arrested in connection with $10 million gold scam last week The woes of Maxwell Peter who was arrested last weekend for his alleged involvement in a $10 million gold scam with 18 others is far from over. \nImpeccable details emerging from the Northern Regional Police Command reveals that he has been fingered in yet another scandal and could be facing double prosecutions both in Tamale and Accra for his roles. \nAccording to a police source, another expatriate has lodged a complaint that the suspect used various means to defraud him hundreds of thousands of dollars with the promise of transacting business with him and has since January 2016 failed to honour his part of the bargain. \nMaxwell Peter who is a known cyber fraudster within the Tamale Metropolis is noted for using luxurious fleet of cars and was arrested at his home in Tamale by a combined team of security personnel form the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO) and Bureau of National Investigations (BNI) last weekend, handcuffed and taken to Accra. \nDescribed as the \u2018Sakawa King\u2019 of Tamale, Maxwell Peter show of wealth and extravagant lifestyle is not new to residents of the town as he is reported to have built and lived in one of the much talked about houses in the area. \nIt has been established that his arrest follows more than a year of investigations by EOCO in partnership with the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) of the United States of America. \nAccording to facts available, Maxwell and his gang of 19 reportedly used dubious means of defrauding a US-based company of 10 million dollars under the guise of supplying it with gold bars but failed. \nThe suspects between 2007 and 2016 presented themselves as gold dealers and succeeded in getting the US-based company to release a whopping $10Million to supply it with gold. \nTo ensure that their partners believed them, they created a bogus email usually containing either an attachment or a link to a malicious website which was linked to the said real estate company and infected the company\u2019s entire computer network and harvested information including company files, credentials and gave the accused persons access to sensitive information which aided them to dupe the company. \nThe criminal network are facing 19 counts of defrauding by false pretences, conspiracy to defraud and unlawful access to computer programme or electronic record, contrary to Section 130(1) of the Electronic Transaction Act 2008 (Act772). \nThey are; Maxwell Peter, Babatunde Martins, Bernard Emurhowhoariogho Okorhi, Dana Brady, James Dean, Javier Luis and Ramos Alonso. \nThose on the run include; Sumaila Hardy, Victor Daniel Fortune Okorhi, Dennis Noah, Olufoajimi Abegunde, Ayodeji Olumde Ojo. \nMaxwell Peter and Babatunde Martins were arraigned before an Accra District Court on Tuesday but refused bail by the trial judge indicating this could impede investigations.. \nMeanwhile, police retrieved documents covering various transactions from Maxwell Peter he had with his victims, which amounted to $60,000 and \u20ac8,500. \nHe confessed having had several business contracts with the complainants and also confirmed the payments, supposed to have been used for gold purchases.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name":

The lawsuit was filed by Skiermont Derby LLP who is representing Swarmify in this matter. \nSAN FRANCISCO (PRWEB) December 07, 2017 \nSwarmify, Inc. has filed a lawsuit against Cloudflare, Inc. alleging misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of contract, and six other claims with the United States District Court in the Northern District of California (CASE NO. 3:17-cv-06957). The lawsuit was filed by Skiermont Derby LLP who is representing Swarmify in this matter. \nIn 2013, Swarmify was founded to solve the persistent problems of video buffering and streaming failures. Court documents allege a new streaming product, Cloudflare Stream, contains trade secrets, intellectual property, and proprietary techniques disclosed under NDA to Cloudflare during the course of acquisition and partnership discussions in 2016 and 2017. \nCEO and Co-Founder of Swarmify, Nathan Barnett, says his team developed the video acceleration solution to offer audiences an 80 percent reduction in buffering and instant load speed. He says their unique approach and intellectual property for video delivery makes Swarmify the most effective product for streaming the highest quality video on the market. \n\u201cEveryone at Swarmify has an incredibly high regard for the team and proprietary solutions that Cloudflare has brought to bear on web security,\u201d Barnett said. \u201cIt is important that we ensure our innovations and intellectual property for video acceleration receive that same respect in return. When someone infringes on our IP, we have a responsibility to our customers, investors, and employees to protect the fruits of their time, energy, and resources.\u201d \nSwarmify has accelerated more than 500 million streams in the past two years. The solution was recently utilized to ensure news of fast-moving wildfires in the State of California was delivered seamlessly to residents and stakeholders across the globe. \nFollowing the launch of Cloudflare\u2019s streaming solution on Sept. 27 of this year, Swarmify retained Skiermont Derby LLP, a boutique firm representing plaintiffs in high stakes intellectual property disputes. The court filing alleges that Cloudflare disclosed proprietary techniques on the Cloudflare blog as well as implementing these techniques in the Cloudflare Stream product. The lawsuit also requests a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent continued use of Swarmify Technology and Confidential Information by Cloudflare. \n\"It takes a tremendous amount of time and money to develop something like this,\u201d Barnett said. \u201cIt is important that in the course of another company\u2019s growth and success, that it doesn\u2019t come at the expense of the rights of the next generation technology companies. I know our teams share many similar values and beliefs about the importance of the Internet to enabling innovation. My hope is that we will be able to find common ground on this issue as well so that we can all move forward with the important work both of our companies are doing.\u201d \nAbout Swarmify, Inc.: Swarmify is based in Florida, and was founded to solve the complicated issue of making streaming video fail-proof. Their goal is simple: provide world class video streaming on par with the likes of Netflix and Amazon in a way that is effortless and affordable, so that any person or company using video to tell a story, share a message, or explain an idea can do so.

Electron is an effort to bridge this gap. With it, you can construct a desktop application with popular Web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This article introduces the basic features and the potential of the Electron framework. There are three major types of software applications that are built \u2014 desktop, Web and mobile. The programming platforms used to construct each of these types of apps are different. Though certain languages such as Java play a key role in each of these application types, there are specialised languages for each category. To name a few, PHP is for server-side scripting, CSS for adding style to Web pages, and XML is for data representation. Similarly, there are frameworks specific to each of these categories. These make the application-building process easier and more efficient for developers. Besides all these options, there are also a few frameworks that developers can use to build both desktop and mobile applications. This article introduces you to one such popular framework named Electron. The three major characteristics of the Electron framework are listed below: It uses popular Web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript for building desktop applications. It is open source. It supports cross-platform application development. It is compatible with Microsoft Windows (Windows 7 and above), Apple Mac and Linux. The applications built using Electron execute on all these operating systems. Building apps using the Electron framework is fairly simple. Primarily, Electron was built for the Atom editor (Atom is a popular text editor/IDE \u2014 https://atom.io/ ). The efficiency of Electron is proven by the many leading companies such as Facebook and Microsoft that use it. A sample list of products built using Electron is available in the official home page ( https://electron.atom.io/ ) . Figure 1: Electron \u2013 major characteristics Installing Electron Electron can be installed easily by using the npm install command: npm install electron --save-dev --save-exact Obviously, you need to have Node.js installed on your computer. Quick starting Electron The quickest way to get started with Electron is to get the \u2018Quick start\u2019 app into action. For that you have to carry out the following steps: # Clone the Quick Start repository using Git $ git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start # Navigate to the folder electron-quick-start $ cd electron-quick-start # Install the dependencies and run $ npm install && npm start Another easier approach to get familiar with Electron is to check out the Electron-Api-Demos from GitHub. The steps to build this demo app are the same as those mentioned for the \u2018Quick start\u2019 app. $ git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-api-demos $ cd electron-api-demos $ npm install $ npm start This app can be used to get a basic introduction to what can be done with Electron. You can play around with the source code to get a better understanding of the features of Electron (a screenshot from the official GitHub page of the source is shown in Figure 3). Figure 2: Electron \u2013 popular apps from the home page The application structure As stated earlier, Electron allows us to build desktop applications with Web technologies. Primarily, Electron facilitates the building of desktop applications with JavaScript as the core language. It provides a runtime with rich native operating system APIs. The basic structure of the simple Electron app consists of three files inside your application\u2019s folder: Package.json Main.js Index.html The structure of the package.json is the same as Node\u2019s modules. The script specified in the \u2018main\u2019 field is the application\u2019s startup script, which would run the main process. A sample package.json file is shown below: { \u201cname\u201d : \u201cyour-app\u201d, \u201cversion\u201d : \u201c0.1.0\u201d, \u201cmain\u201d : \u201cmain.js\u201d } If the main field is left blank in the package.json file, then Electron tries to load a .js file named index.js. There are two major types of processes in an Electron app, as listed below. Main process: This is responsible for running the package.json\u2019s main script. This main process can display a GUI by building Web pages. Renderer process: Electron uses Chromium for rendering Web pages. The multi-process architecture of Chromium is also used. These individual GUI (Web) pages also run their own process, which is called the renderer process. Figure 3: Electron API demos There is a major difference between the normal Web pages that run inside a browser and the Electron app\u2019s Web pages. The normal Web pages are executed in a sand-boxed environment and hence they are denied access to the native system resources. However, Electron Web pages can be used to access the lower level resources of the system with the help of operating system interactions. The main.js file (which is indicated in the package.json file) needs to build windows and handle events. A sample main.js file is shown below: const {app, BrowserWindow} = require(\u2018electron\u2019) const path = require(\u2018path\u2019) const url = require(\u2018url\u2019) // Keep a global reference of the window object, if you don\u2019t, the window will be closed automatically when the JavaScript object is garbage collected. let win function createWindow () { // Create the browser window. win = new BrowserWindow({width: 800, height: 600}) // and load the index.html of the app. win.loadURL(url.format({ pathname: path.join(__dirname, \u2018index.html\u2019), protocol: \u2018file:\u2019, slashes: true })) // Open the DevTools. win.webContents.openDevTools() // Emitted when the window is closed. win.on(\u2018closed\u2019, () => { win = null }) } // This method will be called when Electron has finished initialization and is ready to create browser windows. Some APIs can only be used after this event occurs. app.on(\u2018ready\u2019, createWindow) // Quit when all windows are closed. app.on(\u2018window-all-closed\u2019, () => { // On macOS it is common for applications and their menu bar to stay active until the user quits explicitly with Cmd + Q if (process.platform !== \u2018darwin\u2019) { app.quit() } }) app.on(\u2018activate\u2019, () => { // On macOS it\u2019s common to re-create a window in the app when the // dock icon is clicked and there are no other windows open. if (win === null) { createWindow() } }) The index.html would consist of the source code of the Web page.

(AP Photo/Chris Carlson) prev next comments VENTURA, Calif. \u2014 The Latest on Southern California wildfires (all times local):\n10:30 p.m.\nA surge from the biggest of the wildfires burning in Southern California has forced several thousand more people to evacuate in a community of artists and resorts.\nVentura County sheriff's Sgt. Eric Buschow says flames have been creeping closer and slowly surrounding the town of Ojai (OH'hi), and on Tuesday night increasing winds brought them close enough to expand evacuation orders there.\nFlames, now about 4 miles away, were visible from the city's downtown for the first time on Tuesday night, and ash was raining down.\nParts of Ojai were already under evacuation orders, and the entire valley surrounding it had been under a voluntary evacuation advisory since the fire broke out on Monday.\nThe new evacuations meant most of the town of about 7,000 people was under mandatory orders.\nNearly 30,000 people are under evacuation orders for the fire.\n___\n7:50 p.m.\nThe largest and most destructive wildfire in Southern California has grown to 140 square miles and fire officials say the worst may be yet to come.\nThe 90,000-acre fire burning in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles has swept through ridges and canyons to the sea and Santa Ana winds that drove it are expected to return with a vengeance overnight.\nState fire director Ken Pimlott says winds that eased in the afternoon could return with gusts up to 80 mph Thursday that would make it impossible to fight the fire.\nDozens of homes have burned since the blaze erupted Monday. Nearly 1,800 firefighters and a fleet of aircraft are fighting the flames but the blaze is only 5 percent contained and an estimated 12,000 buildings are in danger.\n___\n6:20 p.m.\nA wildfire in a wealthy western area of Los Angeles has reached the estate and winery owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch.\nRoxanne Langer at Moraga Vineyards in Bel Air says a temperature-controlled wine storage shed burned after the fire erupted before dawn Wednesday but it's unclear how much wine was lost.\nShe says firefighters stepped in to douse the flames with the aid of helicopters and that other storage sheds, the winery itself and the estate's unoccupied house are not damaged.\nThe winery has been evacuated.\nMurdoch bought the property for about $30 million in 2013.\nLanger says it appears the 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines suffered only slight damage and the grapes already had been harvested.\nIn a Facebook statement, Murdoch says some neighbors suffered heavy losses and his thoughts and prayers are with them.\n___\n3:45 p.m.\nFirefighters have stopped the spread of a wildfire that has destroyed homes near the world-famous Getty museum in Los Angeles.\nDeputy Fire Chief Charles Butler says firefighters and aircraft stopped the growth of the 475-acre (192-hectare) blaze in the Bel Air neighborhood.\nThere are currently few visible flames and crews are concentrating on the southwest corner of the fire.\nButler says four homes have been destroyed and 11 damaged since the blaze erupted before dawn Wednesday in an area that includes many hilltop mansions.\nAbout 700 homes, an apartment building and a school have been ordered evacuated.\nNortheast winds driving the flames eased by afternoon but are expected to return in full force Wednesday night. Firefighters are struggling to ring the blaze before that happens.\n___\n3:15 p.m.\nCalifornia's top firefighter says the state is in for the worst Santa Ana wind conditions it's ever seen.\nKen Pimlott, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, says the wind wildfire threat to Southern California for Thursday is purple. The has color has never been used before, means there is extreme danger and that fires that erupt will burn uncontrollably.\nBelow that is red, meaning high danger of fires that burn rapidly and intensely and are difficult to control.\nPimlott says the winds could hit 80 mph (129 kph) and make it impossible to fight Southern California wildfires that have destroyed at least 200 homes and buildings.\nFive wind-driven flames continue to threaten homes in Ventura and Los Angeles. Some 200,000 people are under evacuation orders.\n___\n1:25 p.m.\nThe University of California, Los Angeles, has canceled classes for the rest of the day due to difficult traffic problems stemming from a wildfire.\nThe university's website says many students, faculty and staff have been unable to reach the campus Wednesday, so classes from noon onward are canceled.\nThe athletics department says a night men's basketball game and all other team workouts and practices are canceled.\nThe fire erupted before dawn in the Sepulveda Pass, just up Interstate 405 from UCLA. The fire has destroyed some homes as it spread into the Bel Air area.\n___\n10 a.m.\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti says at least four and possibly six homes have been destroyed by a wildfire in the city's Bel Air area.\nThe fire erupted before dawn Wednesday in Sepulveda Pass, a major commuter route between the west side of Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley to the north.\nThe fire burned up hillsides on the east side of the pass into expensive neighborhoods that are now under evacuation orders.\nThe mayor says the fire is now 150 acres with zero containment.\nSome 500 firefighters are battling the fire along with water-dropping helicopters and airplanes laying down streams of fire retardant.\nThe dangerous Santa Ana winds that have fanned fires across Southern California this week have diminished over the new LA fire but conditions are very dry, with just 9 percent relative humidity.\n___\n9:15 a.m.\nPresident Donald Trump says his thoughts and prayers \"are with everyone\" in the path of California's latest wildfires.\nTrump in a tweet is also encouraging everyone \"to heed the advice and orders of local and state officials\" and thanking first responders for their \"incredible work!\"\nWind-driven fires have raced through California communities for the second time in two months, leaving hundreds of homes feared lost and uprooting tens of thousands of people.\nThe most damaging fire is in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles, where more than 100 square miles (259 sq. kilometers) and numerous homes have burned.\nDeadly fires tore through Northern California earlier this year.\n___\n8:03 a.m.\nThe biggest and most destructive of several wildfires burning in Southern California has scorched more than 101 square miles.\nState fire authorities say the fire burning in Ventura County about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles is also considered a threat to 12,000 structures Wednesday.\nDozens of homes have burned since the fire erupted Monday amid fierce Santa Ana winds.\nA new fire burning among ridges and canyons on the west side of Los Angeles has also burned several homes while snarling morning commuter traffic.\n___\n7:35 a.m.\nTwo homes are burning in a wildfire that has erupted in an exclusive ridge-top neighborhood in Los Angeles, the latest to hit fire-plagued Southern California.\nThe fire broke out before dawn Wednesday on the east side of Interstate 405 in the Sepulveda Pass and raced up steep slopes into neighborhoods at the top.\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department has deployed hundreds of firefighters and called in helicopters and airplanes.\nEvacuations have been ordered and a wider area has been told to be ready for orders to leave.\nIt's the same region of Los Angeles where hundreds of homes burned in the famous 1961 Bel Air Fire.\n___\n6:52 a.m.\nMandatory evacuations have been ordered in an exclusive ridge-top neighborhood in Los Angeles as a dangerous new wildfire burns in Southern California.\nThe fire erupted before dawn Wednesday on the east side of Sepulveda Pass, which carries heavily traveled Interstate 405 through the Santa Monica Mountains on the city's western side.\nHelicopters are making water drops and more than 200 firefighters are battling flames close to homes.\nIn addition to the mandatory evacuations, Los Angeles Fire Department spokeswoman Margaret Stewart says a wider area on the east side of the pass has been advised to get ready in case of evacuation orders.\n___\n5:35 a.m.\nA brush fire has erupted on the west side of Los Angeles along Interstate 405 in Sepulveda Pass.\nFire Department spokesman Margaret Stewart says the fire was reported at 4:52 a.m. Wednesday and is burning uphill, driven by topography rather than winds.\nStewart says 47 firefighters are on the scene, setting up protection for homes at the top of the steep slopes. Two firefighting helicopters have been assigned.\nSepulveda Pass carries heavily traveled Interstate 405 through the Santa Monica Mountains between the western neighborhoods of Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley to the north.\n___\n12:40 a.m.\nThe same vicious winds that made three Southern California wildfires so destructive are also making the firefight itself more difficult.\nThe water-dropping planes and helicopters essential to fighting massive fires have been mostly grounded because it's too dangerous to fly in the strong gusts.\nCommanders hoped to have them back in the air on Wednesday morning, but all indications are the winds will be whipping then too.\nThe blazes brought evacuation orders for nearly 200,000 people, destroyed nearly 200 homes and have remained mostly out control.\nThe largest and most destructive of the blazes, an 85-square-mile wildfire in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles, had nearly reached the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday night after starting 30 miles inland a day earlier.\n___\nThe 5:35 a.m. entry has been corrected to say west side.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

Al Franken, D-Minn., speaks to the media on Capitol Hill in Washington. Franken is denying an accusation by a former Democratic congressional aide that he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) prev next His once-promising political career in shambles, Minnesota Sen. Al Franken appeared on the verge of resigning after fellow Democrats led by female senators abandoned him Wednesday over the mounting allegations of sexual misconduct that are roiling Capitol Hill.\nA majority of the Senate's Democrats called on the two-term lawmaker to get out after another woman emerged Wednesday saying he forcibly tried to kiss her in 2006. That brought to at least seven the number of women accusing him of sexual impropriety.\nFranken, the former comedian who made his name on \"Saturday Night Live,\" scheduled an announcement for Thursday. No topic was specified, but Democratic senators said they expected their liberal colleague to resign.\n\"Enough is enough,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. \"We need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is OK, none of it is acceptable, and we, as elected leaders, should absolutely be held to a higher standard.\"\nGillibrand was the first to call for Franken's resignation on Wednesday, but a torrent of Democrats quickly followed.\n\"I'm shocked and appalled by Sen. Franken's behavior,\" said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state. \"It's clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time. It's time for him to step aside.\"\nThough the writing appeared to be on the wall, Franken's departure was not certain. A tweet posted Wednesday evening on Franken's Twitter account said: \"Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate.\"\nLate in the day, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York added his voice.\n\"I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately,\" Schumer said.\nSchumer called Franken immediately after the latest allegation \u2014 and before the torrent of demands for Franken's resignation from Democrats \u2014 and told him he needed to resign, said a Democrat familiar with the events. Schumer met later in his apartment with Franken and Franken's wife, Franni, and repeated that message, and he did the same in additional talks with the senator throughout the day, said the Democrat, who spoke to on condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez weighed in, too, asking Franken to resign and saying, \"Sexual misconduct, harassment and assault have no place in the Democratic Party, the United States Congress, the White House or anywhere.\"\nThe resignation demands came in rapid succession even though Franken on Wednesday vehemently denied the new accusation that came from a former Democratic congressional aide, who said he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006.\nThe woman, who was not identified, told Politico that Franken pursued her after her boss had left and she was collecting her belongings. She said that she ducked to avoid his lips and that Franken told her: \"It's my right as an entertainer.\"\nFranken, in a statement, said the idea he would claim such conduct as a right was \"preposterous.\"\nBut it was soon clear that his position had become untenable, and his office later issued a statement saying, \"Senator Franken will be making an announcement tomorrow. More details to come.\"\nFellow Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who spoke to Franken, wrote on Twitter, \"I am confident he will make the right decision.\"\nCapitol Hill has long had a culture that has erred on the side of protecting lawmakers. Franken, who is generally liked and respected by his colleagues, was initially afforded deference as he battled the initial allegations against him. But as the number of accusations grew, women in the Senate, who faced pressure from the public and the media for protecting Franken, grew increasingly frustrated.\nThe pressure only mounted Tuesday, when Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., resigned after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct.\nSen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who spoke to Franken, said, \"He's devastated. He's ashamed and he's sorry and everything that he's been saying and it's hard, but I told him, Al, at the end of the day, this was wrong and so I'm sorry, but this is what we're going to have to do.\"\nOne irony: While Franken apparently is departing, Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore could be arriving, if he prevails in a Dec. 12 special election. Multiple women have accused the 70-year-old Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were teens and he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s. If Moore is elected, it could create a political nightmare for Republicans, who have promised an ethics probe.\nPerez, the DNC chair, was quick to point out the difference, saying in a statement, \"Instead of standing up for women and confronting the problems of misconduct within their own ranks, the Republican Party has chosen to pursue power and push their radical far-right agenda at any cost.\"\nA national conversation about sexual harassment has intensified this fall after the heavily publicized case of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of many acts of sexual misconduct, including rape, by actresses and other women. Just on Wednesday, Time magazine named as its person of the year the \"silence breakers\" \u2014 women who have come forward on sexual harassment.\nPunishment has been swift for leaders in entertainment, media and sports while members of Congress have tried to survive the onslaught of allegations.\nFranken already faced a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into previous claims by several other women that he groped them or sought to forcibly kiss them.\nThe allegations began in mid-November when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan.\nOther allegations followed, including a woman who says Franken put his hand on her buttocks as they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Two women told the Huffington Post that Franken squeezed their buttocks at political events during his first campaign for the Senate in 2008. A fourth woman, an Army veteran, alleged Franken cupped her breast during a photo on a USO tour in 2003.\nFranken has apologized for his behavior but has also disputed some of the allegations.\nFranken was first elected to the Senate in 2008, defeating Republican Norm Coleman in a bitter recount that took seven months. Franken won that race despite attacks over bawdy humor and writings dating back to his days on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" including a proposed skit joking about rape.\nFranken said then that he regretted such writings, and once in the Senate, he cultivated a serious and policy-oriented image. Throughout his eight years in office, he fashioned a reputation as a populist Democrat and fueled speculation that he might run for president in 2020.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Juliet Linderman

Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak put his party on a war footing Thursday as polls loom, vowing to \"fight till the end\" despite a massive financial scandal that has rocked his government. \nThe leader told the annual assembly of his United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) \u2014 which has ruled Muslim-majority Malaysia for six decades at the head of a coalition \u2014 that the country was facing a \"crucial election\". \n\"In this battle we fight till the end, in this election we will emerge victorious\", he told thousands of cheering delegates wearing the red colours of his party in Kuala Lumpur. \nElections must be called by August at the latest. Najib did not hint at a date in his speech but speculation is swirling that they will be take place in early 2018. File image of Malaysian PM Najib Rajak. Getty Images \nNajib's chances of winning a third term have been dented by explosive graft allegations. Billions were looted from the 1MDB sovereign wealth fund that he founded in complex overseas deals which are being investigated in several countries. \nBoth Najib, who made no mention of the scandal during Thursday's speech, and the fund deny any wrongdoing. \nThe US Justice Department has led the charge in tackling the alleged pillaging, launching lawsuits through which it is seeking to recover $1.7 billion in assets thought to have been purchased with looted money, from artwork to high-end real estate. \nThis week US Attorney General Jeff Sessions told a conference in Washington that the 1MDB scandal was \"kleptocracy at its worst\". \nElection race upended \nThe election race has also been upended by the emergence of elderly former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, who led Malaysia for 22 years, as a key figure in the main opposition alliance. Mahathir, 92, has come out of retirement to try to oust the government over the 1MDB scandal, teaming up with his former nemesis, jailed opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim. \nIn his speech at the UMNO gathering, the most closely watched event in Malaysia's political calendar, Najib, 64, accused Mahathir of having \"crossed the line\". \"He has the audacity to unite with his political enemies,\" he said. \nHe also warned that if the opposition won the election then Muslim Malays, about 60 percent of the country's 32 million people, \"will become homeless and despised in their own country\". \nHe sought to rally Muslims over US president Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, saying that \"the voice of Muslims in Malaysia will reverberate across the world\" in opposition to the move. \nUMNO has long championed the Malay cause in a country that is home to substantial ethnic and religious minorities, and has enshrined policies that favour them. \nMost observers believe that Najib and the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition will edge another victory in the elections, as the opposition remains weak with leading light Anwar still in jail following a 2015 sodomy conviction his supporters say was politically-motivated. \nNajib has overcome the worst of the 1MDB crisis, which peaked in 2015, purging critics from government and cracking down on dissent. \n\"BN, and especially UMNO, is set to win big,\" said Oh Ei Sun, from Malaysian think-tank the Pacific Research Center. \"The opposition is definitely not shaping up for a real fight.\" \nPublished Date: Dec 07, 2017 03:02 pm | Updated Date: Dec 07, 2017 03:02 pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "najib razak", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jeff sessions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ei sun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahathir mohamad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahathir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "najib rajak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "najib", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anwar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anwar ibrahim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "united malays national organisation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images  najib", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barisan nasional", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific research center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umno", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuala lumpur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:45.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "83a403f04aecde78b6c1b0ba78964ca376554086", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqb2fOxsoDj4KOC6wnpYD0i.byphXXZVVGeHxbysnOi29WyzTABqi0hNaqsdy5QLSzZ91rB1yPlx3HynPyUTW3sMcCJLDtRTyi2nACsPTy34g--", "site_full": "bostonherald.com", "site": "bostonherald.com", "site_section": "http://bostonherald.com/news", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "News | Boston Herald", "title": "Three eye Senate president\u2019s seat", "title_full": "Three eye Senate president\u2019s seat | Boston Herald", "published": "2017-12-07T13:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.208, "main_image": "http://www.bostonherald.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/media/2017/03/20/032017potar15.jpg?itok=P5NHIsob", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8876, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 2, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "83a403f04aecde78b6c1b0ba78964ca376554086", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqb2fOxsoDj4KOC6wnpYD0i.byphXXZVVGeHxbysnOi29WyzTABqi0hNaqsdy5QLSzZ91rB1yPlx3HynPyUTW3sMcCJLDtRTyi2nACsPTy34g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Matt Stout", "published": "2017-12-07T13:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Three eye Senate president\u2019s seat", "text": "Three eye Senate president\u2019s seat Matt Stout Thursday, December 07, 2017 Credit: Angela Rowlings IN THE RUNNING: State senators expressing a desire to run for Senate president include Linda Dorcena Forry, above, Karen Spilka and Eileen Donoghue. Staff photo by Angela Rowlings. comments At least three state senators say they\u2019ll seek the Senate presidency, if the post opens, in a rare display of public interest as the chamber reels amid an internal probe into ex- president Stanley C. Rosenberg and sexual misconduct allegations against his husband.\nState Sen. Karen Spilka, the Senate budget chief; state Sen. Linda Dorcena Forry, a Dorchester Democrat; and state Sen. Eileen Donoghue, a Lowell Democrat, say they\u2019ll join any race for the top post, pushing what is often a behind-the-scenes battle into the public realm.\nActing Senate President Harriette Chandler, who was voted in Monday to lead the body after Rosenberg took a leave of absence, said she intends to step down from the post at the conclusion of an ethics inquiry into the former leader.\nBut Rosenberg faces \u201cno guarantee\u201d of reclaiming the post even if cleared, Chandler told the Herald this week, and senators have acknowledged some of their colleagues have been quietly politicking to gauge support for a potential run at the presidency.\nThose murmurs grew louder yesterday.\n\u201cIt is with a great sense of responsibility for the important work of the Senate, and with the utmost respect for the good work of my colleagues, that I have decided that I will seek the Senate presidency should the vacancy arise,\u201d Spilka, an Ashland Democrat, said in a statement to the Herald.\nDorcena Forry said in her own statement she will seek the post.\n\u201cIf there is a vacancy for Senate president, I do intend to pursue that opportunity,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, right now, my focus is squarely on supporting acting President Chandler in all ways. We have urgent business to conduct for our constituents and the people of the Commonwealth.\u201d\nDonoghue said she also will seek the office in the event of an opening.\n\u201cThere is a vital need to ensure integrity and a strong future for the Senate,\u201d she said. \u201cI appreciate the encouragement I have already received from my fellow senators and have decided to run for Senate president if there is a vacancy.\u201d\nState Sen. Sal DiDomenico, an Everett Democrat and close ally of Rosenberg, has also reached out to colleagues. He stepped down from the Ethics Committee this week in the wake of a Herald report about his interest.\nAsked whether he intends to run for the seat, DiDomenico told the Herald he\u2019s waiting to see how the probe plays out.\n\u201cAt that point we\u2019ll see what\u2019s in front of us,\u201d he said.\nThe outside probe will hone in on whether Rosenberg, 68, violated any Senate rules in the wake of allegations published by the Boston Globe that his husband, Bryon Hefner, 30, sexually assaulted or harassed four men while boasting of his influence within the Senate.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matt stout", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "angela rowlings", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sal didomenico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bryon hefner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linda dorcena forry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eileen donoghue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanley c. rosenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spilka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harriette chandler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorcena forry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "didomenico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donoghue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karen spilka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chandler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "three eye senate", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston globe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethics committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashland", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "dorchester", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:45.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6885f9e6e7907d0c08a5e1d4e29e0d2519972926", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRmNKuSSMJvw75VVy.PPZC0DSqNpqxqn1EqP3HwgofXsJalILFUFaL0", "site_full": "www.ozbargain.com.au", "site": "ozbargain.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.ozbargain.com.au/forum/559", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Toys &amp;

Let\u2019s try and build a simple Web application using this PaaS offering from Microsoft Azure. The global industry is increasingly leaning towards Platform as a Service (PaaS), which has advanced considerably over time. Today, PaaS uses several programming languages such as .NET, Java, PHP, Python and Ruby. Microsoft Azure and its services Microsoft Azure is one of the most dominant cloud services providers in the market. Microsoft Toolsets provides an easy way to deploy applications that are built on a platform like Java and .NET. Microsoft Azure comes with some core concepts that are important to understand. Its services are available in 36 regions around the world, with plans announced for four additional regions. Details regarding these regions are available at https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/regions/ . To view products or services available, based on the region, you can go to https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/regions/services/ . \u2018Resource Groups\u2019 in Microsoft Azure is a logical container. It can be used to group different resources such as Microsoft Azure App Services, SQL databases, and storage accounts available in Microsoft Azure. An App Service Plan (ASP) comprises the instance size and instance count on which the application is hosted, as well as its features. There are different capabilities and limits within ASPs. It is important to understand that ASPs can be shared by multiple applications and deployment slots are usually on the same ASP; however, we can change the ASP for the slots too. If you want to understand how pricing works in Microsoft Azure, you should explore Azure Calculator at https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/calculator/ . Figure 1: Microsoft Azure dashboard Figure 2: App Service Plan in Microsoft Azure Figure 3: Azure Web App in Microsoft Azure Microsoft Azure App Services App Services is one of the most popular offerings from Microsoft Azure. Web Apps are a PaaS offering that have computing resources and runtime environments managed by Microsoft Azure. For Azure App Services, five pricing tiers are available \u2013 free, shared, basic, standard and premium. Free: Try this to implement a proof-of-concept. Shared: This is for basic Web applications or static websites. Basic: This is for development/test environments. Standard: This is for Web and mobile applications in the production environment. Premium: This is for enterprise scale and integration. App Services can be easily used in DevOps practices too. Visual Studio Team Services can be used for continuous integration and delivery, or continuous deployment using different tasks and ways in different environments, with approved scenarios. To check how these services work, go to https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/try/app-service/. Select Web App . Click on Continue and follow the rest of the steps indicated. If you have a valid Microsoft Azure subscription, you can go to https://portal.azure.com/ . To get some quick hands-on experience on creating an application, follow the steps given below. Figure 4: Azure Web App overview in Microsoft Azure Figure 5: Azure App Service in the browser Figure 6: Application settings of the Azure App Service (Azure Web apps) in the Microsoft Azure dashboard Log in with valid credentials and you will get the Azure dashboard. First, let\u2019s create an App Service Plan (ASP) so that we can host Azure App Services on it. Click on ASP in the left sidebar, and then click on + Add. Give the name of the ASP, then the name of the New Resource Group , the operating system, the location where ASP must be hosted, and the most important part \u2014 the pricing tier. Next, click on Create. Once we have ASP ready, click on App Services in the left sidebar and then on +Add. Select Web App. Click on Create . Give the App Name , and select the Resource Group that we have created while creating the ASP. Click on Create . Wait for some time, and once the Azure Web App is ready, you can access it from the Azure dashboard. Verify the Resource Group , the status of the Web App (its location and URL), the App Service Plan, FTP details and monitoring related details. Visit the URL in the browser. Figure 7: Configure the Java application in Application Settings of Azure App Services Figure 8: Java based Azure Web App Figure 9: Properties of Azure App Services Go to the Azure Web App just created and click on Application Settings. When we create an Azure Web app, by default, it is a .NET app. Let\u2019s look at how to change it to a Java application. Select the Java version as Java 8. Select the Java Minor version and Web Container too. To keep a 64-bit platform for the application, we need to change the pricing plan to Standard . Put the Always On switch on, and click on Save . Visit the URL of the Azure Web App and verify the change in the Java application. Go to Properties , check the status, the virtual IP address, the outbound IP address, and FTP related details. For checking logs, and to know more about the structure, go to the Kudu editor using the URL https://osfytestapp.scm.azurewebsites.net. Add SCM in the original URL. Verify the Web Apps directory. There are two types of scaling \u2013 vertical and horizontal. When scaling up, we can perform vertical scaling. Actually, this is a scaling up of the App Service Plan. In the Basic pricing tier, horizontal scaling is not supported, but it is supported in the Standard pricing tier. Figure 10: Kudu editor of Azure App Services in Microsoft Azure Figure 11: Scaling up the App Service Plan Figure 12: Scaling out the App Service Plan Figure 13: Log configuration of Azure Services in Microsoft Azure Logging is an important aspect in case of troubleshooting and, by default, logging is not enabled. All log files can be accessed from the Azure portal as well as the Kudu editor. In this article, we have created a Web application using Microsoft Azure App Services, which is a PaaS offering from Microsoft. The road ahead can be continuous integration and delivery using Visual Studio Team Services to implement DevOps practices.

(PRWEB) December 07, 2017 \nRigaku Corporation is pleased to announce that Rigaku Analytical Devices , a leading provider of innovative handheld Raman spectrometers, has announced a library update in its Progeny ResQ software giving users the ability to identify more opioids, including various fentanyl compounds. \nDesigned with customer needs in mind, the Progeny\u2122 ResQ 1064nm handheld Raman analyzer provides the industry\u2019s most comprehensive tool for chemical, CBRNe, and narcotics identification in a fast and simple handheld form. With this update, the Progeny ResQ library now includes 800+ narcotic compounds (32 specific to fentanyl and other opioids), explosives and chemical warfare agents and additionally has a master library of 12,000+ common excipients, cutting agents and psychotropic drugs. The user also has the added capability to easily add emerging threats and other substances to the library. \nRecognized as utilizing a Class A analytical technique by the Scientific Working Group for the Analysis of Seized Drugs (SWGDRUG), the Progeny ResQ analyzer is an acceptable instrument for presumptive testing for the detection and identification of narcotics. Because Progeny ResQ uses the next generation 1064nm laser excitation, fluorescence interference issues caused by colored or impure substances are virtually eliminated while providing results in seconds. \n\u201cWe place innovation at the core of everything we do, and this updated Progeny ResQ library will provide our customers with the tool and means to help make them successful in protecting our communities,\u201d said Bree Allen, President at Rigaku Analytical Devices. \nBeginning today, all Progeny ResQ analyzers leaving the production facility in Wilmington, MA will include this updated library, and as with all software and library updates, will be provided to existing customers at no additional charge. To find out more about the capabilities of the MIL-STD 810G certified Progeny ResQ analyzer with 24/7 reachback support, please visit http://www.Rigaku.com/ResQ \nAbout Rigaku Analytical Devices (RAD) \nRAD was formed as the global handheld and portable spectroscopic analyzer business unit of Rigaku Corporation in 2011. RAD\u2019s portfolio of handheld and portable spectroscopic analyzers are used for a variety of applications, empowering our customers to achieve rapid lab-quality results any time, any place.

X-ray, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and nuclear imaging are major types of teleradiology services provided in Western Europe. The X-ray teleradiology segment held the largest share of the market in 2014 and is likely to maintain its leadership position during forecast period from 2014 to 2023. \nRequest to View Sample Report @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=9212 \nIncreasing number of procedures, high awareness as it is a vintage technique, and low cost as compared to other modalities are the key drivers of the X-ray teleradiology segment. However, computed tomography teleradiology is considered the most lucrative segment of the teleradiology market in Western Europe. Ability of computed tomography to provide 3-D images of body parts such as brain, lungs, abdomen and heart; accuracy in diagnosis, and consistent development in the technology are likely to make it the most lucrative segment of the teleradiology market in Western Europe during the forecast period from 2015 to 2023. \nHowever, complex and in-depth images of computed tomography are difficult to interpret, and hence need an expert radiologist. Therefore, demand for teleradiology is anticipated to increase rapidly during the forecast period. Ultrasound teleradiology accounted for the second largest share of the teleradiology market in 2014, as it is a first-line modality in the diagnosis of several abdominal disorders and during pregnancy. Additionally, low cost and absence of ionizing radiation makes it a more preferred modality to ultrasound. However, complexity of 3-D and 4-D images need experienced radiologists. This further increases the scope of teleradiology. Major countries in Western Europe such as the U.K., Germany, and France are facing the problem of lack of expert radiologists. \nThis increases demand for teleradiology for emergency cases or for second opinion. Additionally, people prefer to opt for second opinion from expert radiologists. However, lack of advanced image transfer technology in rural areas, complex cross-border regulations, high initial investment, and lingual differences that lead to confusion could restrict the growth of the teleradiology market in Western Europe during the forecast period 2015 to 2023. The nuclear imaging segment has witnessed sluggish growth as compared to other modalities due to requirement of sophisticated technology and adverse effects of radiation and radioactive substances. However, widespread use of positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanners for cancer detection and increasing use of multimodality imaging could propel the nuclear imaging market in Western Europe during the forecast period. \nThe magnetic resonance imaging segment has witnessed moderate growth owing to high precision in diagnosis, rising awareness in economically backward areas, and increasing brain related disorder and injuries. Major factors restraining the magnetic resonance imaging segment are large investment and long waiting list due to unavailability of sophisticated magnetic resonance imaging instruments. \nRead Report Overview @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/western-europe-teleradiology-market.html \nThe teleradiology market in Western Europe is fragmented. Agfa-Gevaert N.V., Cybernet Medical Corporation, ONRAD, Inc., Sectra AB, Telemedicine Clinic, and Global Diagnostics Ltd. are the major companies operating in the teleradiology market in Western Europe.

But Ramachandran rejected his plea and said there will be only one candidate: Rahul Gandhi. He claims Ramachandran didn't even provide him with any valid reason for the rejection. \nThe party held its presidential polls on 4 December. Accompanied by Manmohan Singh and other party veterans, Rahul presented himself before returning officer Ramachandran. \nIn all, 89 nominations were filed, and every one of them proposed Rahul Gandhi's name as the next party president, paving the way for the 47-year-old's undisputed elevation. \nHowever, Ali isn't the first voice within Congress to question the process of elections. Maharashtra Congress leader Shehzad Poonawalla had earlier called the entire process as \"rigged\", and asked Gandhi to resign from his post as vice-president first. File image of Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi. PTI \nHe also indicated his desire to contest for the top post if the elections were to be conducted in a \"genuine\" manner, and wrote a letter to Gandhi in this regard. \nHe said this is not a election but a \"coronation\" of Shehzada . \"I cannot contest a rigged election. If the system is genuine, only then will I contest,\" he said. \nHe also called on the party to have a one family-one ticket rule. \nFollowing his statement, Congress questioned Poonawalla's locus standi, saying he wasn't even a primary member of the party or its representative.
