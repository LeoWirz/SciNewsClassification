Kilpack", "text": "       All That Makes Life Bright: The Life and Love of Harriet Beecher Stowe by Josi S. Kilpack   \nWhen Harriet Beecher marries Calvin Stowe on January 6, 1836, she is sure her future will be filled romance, eventually a family, and continued opportunities to develop as a writer. Her husband Calvin is completely supportive and said she must be a literary woman. Harriet\u2019s sister, Catharine, worries she will lose her identity in marriage, but she is determined to preserve her independent spirit. Deeply religious, she strongly believes God has called her to fulfill the roles of wife and writer and will help her accomplish everything she was born to do. Two months after her wedding Harriet discovers she is pregnant just as Calvin prepares to leave for a European business trip. Alone, Harriet is overwhelmed\u2014being a wife has been harder than she thought and being an expectant mother feels like living another woman\u2019s life. Knowing that part of Calvin still cherishes the memory of his first wife, Harriet begins to question her place in her husband\u2019s heart and yearns for his return; his letters are no substitute for having him home. When Calvin returns, however, nothing seems to have turned out as planned. Struggling to balance the demands of motherhood with her passion for writing and her desire to be a part of the social change in Ohio, Harriet works to build a life with her beloved Calvin despite differing temperaments and expectations. Can their love endure, especially after \u201cI do\u201d? Can she recapture the first blush of new love and find the true beauty in her marriage?   * \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 * \nPraise for All That Makes Life Bright \n\"Passionate--and entertaining.\" Publisher's Weekly, Sept 2017\n\"Kilpack writes with great insight and superb sensitivity.\" Booklist, Starred Review Sept 2017\n\"All That Makes Life Bright is about making marriage work in the face of challenges like a desire for personal freedom.

What would Eliza think of Hattie carrying Calvin\u2019s child? A child Eliza had wanted so much and never had. Hattie usually told herself Eliza would be happy that she and Calvin found comfort together, but there were days when Hattie\u2019s awareness that Calvin still held affection for Eliza rose like a specter. Prayer, studying the Bible, and remembering the assurance she\u2019d felt of God\u2019s approval would usually silence her guilt, but today the fears roiled inside her like the churning wheels of an undertaker\u2019s carriage.\n\nHad Eliza lived, Hattie would be teaching, writing\u2014unmarried and unpregnant. Had Eliza lived, Calvin would only be the husband of Hattie\u2019s friend, and he would enjoy dinner on the table every night, and pressed pants and clean shirts in the closet every morning. Perhaps Eliza would have given him a child by now. When headaches laid him low, Eliza would tend to him without a thought for herself.\n\nWould Calvin be happier if Eliza had been the only Mrs. Calvin Stowe? Would Hattie? Was Catharine right? Had Hattie entered a phase that would lead to the demise of being her own person? Anxiety wrapped around her until she found herself sobbing at the splintery kitchen table.   \n\nEliza. Eliza.

Kilpack   \nJosi S. Kilpack hated to read until her mother handed her a copy of The Witch of Blackbird Pond when she was 13. From that day forward, she read everything she could get her hands on and credits her writing \u201ceducation\u201d to the many novels she has \u201cstudied\u201d since then. She began writing her first novel in 1998 and has written twenty-five novels, one cookbook, and been part of multiple collaborations since then. She is a four-time Whitney Award winner and Best of State winner in Fiction. Josi currently lives in Willard, Utah, with her husband and children. When Kensington Press picked up her first national women's fiction novel, As Wide as the Sky, Josi was in need of a pen name to differentiate between her other genres. For years, Josi has been called Jessica Pack by people who hear her name but don't know her, it made her new pen name easy to choose. As Wide as the Sky will be released in paperback sometime in 2018. \n\n* \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 * \u2013 *   \nAlso by Josi S.

Look what they did. Did they trade talent? And we keep talking about free agents I'm starting to think know one in this organization knows what they're doing like doesn't know shlit. I used to think Ryan west did but maybe he's a glorified yes man hire Sam presti. We are not going to bring any free agents this roster looks horrible nobody compliments anybody kupchack drafted Ingram and you would think magic would draft a compliment jayson Tatum but he drafted the face of the lakers.\nHey lonzo if you're gonna come in and say the team needs a leader then walk the walk play like you want to ball. Don't play timid and all the ESPN bull that's why they are commentators are basketball exec magic went for it and I'm assuming people like Luke were like we shouldn't draft him and magic pushed for the 2nd workout and said were drafting him but really were is the draft preparation were royally flucked if he busts. all I hear from lavar is this is the best guy in the draft we as laker fans how did we get duped we got Steve Alford when Reggie miller got picked in the same draft.\nBig baller big baller liagelo looks like a better shooter then lonzo really magic this was the plan feel up the roster full of the ball brothers.

Optimized some calculations (consolidated constants) Cleaned up the MM script to be calculated rather than hard-coded Tested to work with DeepFreeze Added Logo screen Added CTT support Added hiding of part in the tech tree if they aren't available (based on the level selected in the settings) Hides parts in the editor if they aren't available 3.4.0.1\nAdded the PartModules into the release build to avoid unnecessary warning/errors in the log file Updated the part configs for the tanks to share the textures, reduces memory usage and loading time Replaced textures for the slurry and sludge tanks Added OrganicSlurry and Sludge to LS display, only displayed if LS mode allows Fixed bug where Slurry and Sludge tanks were launching full Add Slurry rate and Sludge rate (rate/day of processing)\n3.4.0.2\nFixed techRequired for the small radial tank, it was misplaced 3.4.0.3\nRenamed Basic to Classic life support Added some tooltips to the settings page Rewrite the status page Added color coding matching toolbar button Changed gui skin to KSP's skin Changed display of slurry and sludge rate to days to process 3.4.0.4\nUpdated status page to have columns dynamically sized Added process rate to status display Added Auto Warp Cancellation lead time to settings Updated texture for radial tank 3.4.0.5\nAdded resizable status window Added option in Settings to show/hide OrganicSlurry & Sludge in the part resource panel 3.4.0.6\nUpdated right-click display of LS values Changed Caution to 1-3 days for pod, 0.5-1 for EVA Changed Warning! to 0-1 day for pod, 0-0.5 for EVA Added Danger! status for LS = 0 Removed PartUpdate class, replaced with MM script Optimization pass Replaced about half the \"foreach\" statements with the \"for (int i < ...)\" Removed Slurry capacity from command pods Added Vessel Info screen for the editor Updated Slurry and Sludge texture for IFITank\nInterstellar Flight Inc. Life Support\nIFI Life Support is designed to provide an enjoyable life support experience without making it complicated. There is one main resource called LifeSupport, and, in the advanced modes, there are two more, OrganicSlurry and Sludge. The only resource you really need to deal with in all modes is the LifeSupport resource, the other resources are there for the mechanics, and, while you can store them in tanks and move them around, there isn\u2019t a lot to do with them.\nThe mod is designed so that you can switch between the different modes of operation at any time without causing problems. So, you can start off at the Classic mode, and over time change it to Enhanced, Advanced and Extreme. If you feel that the higher modes are too difficult, you can easily change it back to a lower mode. Any existing ships will continue to operate in the mode they were designed in; ie: If you have a ship/colony which is using the Enhanced mode and has greenhouses, and then switch back to Classic, the greenhouses will continue to work, etc.\nRequirements\nIFI-LS requires the following mods:\nCommunity Category Kit Community Resource Pack ModuleManager These mods are included in the zip file for convenience.\nPlease note that there is a directory called Squad, this MUST be merged with the Squad folder since it contains icons for the Tech Tree.\nIFI Life Support has 4 modes of operation:\nClassic\nOnly the LifeSupport resource is available. Each unit of Life-Support should provide 1 Kerbin Day (6 hours) of Life support for 1 Kerbal when in space, see below for details on the operation info Enhanced\nThis introduces the OrganicSlurry resource and greenhouses. When a Kerbal uses LifeSupport, the output is OrganicSlurry, produced at a 1:1 ratio; in other words, if a Kerbal uses 1 unit of LifeSupport, a unit of OrganicSlurry will be produced. Greenhouses are able to convert most of the OrganicSlurry back into LifeSupport, at a 90% efficiency. Tanks are also provided which can store Organic Slurry. Advanced\nThis introduces the Sludge resource, and the MicroBiome and AlgaeHouse. The 10% of the LifeSupport resource which the greenhouses are unable to recycle create Sludge. The MicroBiome and AlgaeHouse are able to take that Sludge and convert it back into LifeSupport. The efficiency is 100%, although slow. As usual, tanks are provided which can store the Sludge. Extreme\nThis mode doesn\u2019t introduce any new resources, but there are some new parts: the Circular Intake, the Cryogenic Air Separator and the BioReactor. The functionality is described, but the resources they deal with are totally hidden:\nThe Circular Intake pulls in outside atmosphere and filters out everything except Oxygen, and then feeds that into the Cryogenic Air Separator. The Cryogenic Air Separator takes that Oxygen and converts it into compressed O2, and then feeds that into the BioReactor The BioReactor takes in the compressed O2, Sludge and Ore (stock Ore), and produces more LifeSupport as output than was taken in as Sludge. All of the active parts also need EC to operate.\nExperiments and Parts\nAll crewed parts automatically have enough life support for 3 days with a full crew. If you don\u2019t put a full crew on, the life support will last longer.\nThe Greenhouses, MicroBiome, AlgaeHouse and BioReactor all need some experiments to be run before they will work. The experiment needs to be run in the biome where the parts are working.\nThe greenhouses need to have the experiment: BSS-1 (Biological Systems Study-1) to be run The AlgaeHouse and BioReactor need the experiment BSS-G (Biological Systems Study-Goo) The BioReactor needs the Biosphere Containment Study experiment run Operation Info\nThere are three way of seeing the status of the life support systems:\nToolbar Button Status Display window shown by clicking the toolbar button Right-click menu on parts Toolbar Button\nThe toolbar will change color depending on the status of the worst off craft\nGreen - All craft have sufficient LifeSupport Yellow - At least one craft has less than three days of life support available Red - At least one crat has less than 1 day of life support remaining Status Display Window\nThe Status Display window shows the current status of all vessels with crew on-board, depending on the mode the Life Support mod is currently in:\nClassic - Shows the name of the vessel, where it is, how much crew is there and how many days of LifeSupport remains Improved - Added the ability to show how much OrganicSlurry the rate at which the vessel is able to process it, and how much time will take to process it. The window is expandable by clicking the double-arrow button at the lower-right of the screen. Enhanced - Added Sludge to the window Extreme - No changes beyond the Enhanced\nRight-Click Menu\nThe right-click menu shows the t he current status of status of the life support for the part. Currently there are several Status LS system can be in (note that the CAUTION, Warning! and Danger! have not yet been updated to the following):\nPod Standby - No demand for LS and no resources consumed. Life Support tag for days / hours of LS remaining is hidden. Active - Demand for LS and resources consumed. Life Support tag for days / hours of LS remaining will read how long LS will last for whole vessel. Visor - Kerbal on EVA breathing outside air decreased Resource consumption. Life Support tag for days / hours of LS remaining will read how much LS remains once active again (fixing). Intake Air - Pod using air intakes to provide O2 to crew - decreased Resource consumption. Life Support tag for days / hours of LS remaining will read how much LS remains once active again. CAUTION - Less than 3 days pod or 1/2 to 1 hour EVA of LS remaining. Life Support tag for days / hours of LS remaining will read how long LS will last for whole vessel. Warning! - Less than 1 days pod or 1/2 hour EVA of LS Danger! - LS at 0, remaining Kerbals will start dying if immediate action not taken. Life Support tag for days / hours of LS remaining will read 0. There is a setting to prevent Kerbals from dying. Each unit of Life-Support should provide 1 Kerbin Day (6 hours) of Life support for 1 Kerbal. In Career and Science game modes this goes up and down based on Tech tree.\nTech Tree\nAll parts are included in a new branch of the stock tech tree. This branch appears at the bottom of the screen when you are displaying the tech tree.\nThe Community Tech Tree is also supported\nSettings\nThe settings page uses the stock settings page, to get to it, hit Escape, select Settings, click the Difficulty Options button, and then click the IFI Life Support button in the left column.\nThere are two columns on the settings page. The first column selects the mode which you want the mod to operate in, one of Basic, Improved, Advanced or Extreme.\nThe second column has the various adjustable values for the mod. At the top of the column you will see four toggles: Easy, Normal, Moderate and Hard. Selecting one of these will set all the values below to the defaults for that difficulty level. These levels are automatically set when you create a new game based on the game difficulty, these are here to make it easy to switch the mod between the different levels.\nBelow the toggles are sliders for the various multipliers.\nLS rate per day Breathable Atmo pressure (min allowed) Min. Intake Air Atmo Pressure Breathable Homeworld Atmo adj, reduces the LS usage when on the homeworld Breathable Atmo adj, reduces the LS usage when on a planet with Oxygen Low EC Adj, when not enough EC, LS usage is increased Mod uses the time as set in settings menu so it will track 6 or 24 hour days depending on setting in main menu. Days remaining on RT click menu are accurate based on this setting. Only change in mod is that if not using kerbin time each Kerbal requires 4 units of LS per day.\nEdited 5 hours ago by linuxgurugamer", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/sL86tO-gf9z4_TzIiFF6Q0A/image?w=624&h=489&rev=2&ac=1", "https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/IFI-Life-Support/releases/tag/3.4.0.6", "https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/IFI-Life-Support"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:36.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6be4a96fbc1f67ebc7aa1d13cff52c3a33152746", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog63_RxOXa1nosG2y.4JTtxtLsOmX5Ec5.bvLJqV2lW8EIgOm204ozYB7dyEwpBuPJQDNx5uHPaUgHAR5NFQq_HcqNMeyJc8z31C4OyUMB0RJgTCXkNkA6y5rVd_v57RuIR_.HesA1wTFn", "site_full": "community.vodafone.co.nz", "site": "vodafone.co.nz", "site_section": "http://community.vodafone.co.nz/t5/4G-and-the-Network/bd-p/4G", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "4G and the Network - Vodafone New Zealand Community", "title": "November 2017 upgrades completed - mobile network 215147", "title_full": "November 2017 upgrades completed - mobile network - Vodafone New Zealand Community - 215147", "published": "2017-11-13T00:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NZ", "spam_score": 0.014, "main_image": "http://vodafonenz.i.lithium.com/html/assets/touch-icon-iphone-retina.png?8FF10F3C52D2A30A90B53E0E8EA62C3C", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 38622, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "83caee48336a020fa0b809f330e3d4ed14f05c66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog63_RxOXa1nosG2y.4JTtxtLsOmX5Ec5.bvLJqV2lW8EIgOm204ozYB7dyEwpBuPJQDNx5uHPaUgHAR5NFQq_HcqNMeyJc8z31C4OyUMB0RJgTCXkNkA6y5rVd_v57RuIRzsrKh7uNq3AcZr2Kwm3sEM-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "MikeHales", "published": "2017-11-14T13:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Any word yet on when the Hutt Valley can receive some TLC in terms of LTE 700MHz?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:36.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0edba34e985abdc8fbfde39bc7efec7487603b16", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSN40BfT_2buDa3gzwK3_.SgR_79VyOgpMBFwlyXHjNMWeqMxU7qUGjd6qBrLDmY.g9e5ffWWaarUc49jWzrKKevUBtAqcfU2QPjHVIC41tse20PqeyG96Y4dXismW7Y5dvPNDt4AVhak4wq_VlVzLD", "site_full": "forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com", "site": "kerbalspaceprogram.com", "site_section": "https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/forum/34-add-on-releases/", "site_categories": ["video_and_computer_games", "science", "adult", "space_astronomy", "hobbies_and_interests", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Add-on Releases - Kerbal Space Program Forums", "title": "[1.3.1] Interstellar Flight Inc.

It\u2019s also the oldest ape fossil in southern Africa, dating back 3.67 million years. The remains \u2013 discovered 20 years ago at the Sterkfontein Caves near Johannesburg \u2013 have now gone on display for the first time. Professor Ron Clarke from the Evolutionary Studies Institute at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg initially found four small footbones in 1994. Its discovery is expected to help understand the appearance, full skeletal anatomy, limb lengths and locomotor abilities of one of the species of our early ancestral relatives. This is one of the most remarkable fossil discoveries made in the history of human origins research and it is a privilege to unveil a finding of this importance today,\u201d Clarke said. In 1997 the scientist found more bones in a cupboard at the medical school of the University of the Witwatersrand. The rest of Little Foot was found embedded in the calcified ancient cave in 1997 and the excavation, cleaning, reconstruction, casting and analysis took 20 years. The discovery comes as a new Planet Of The Apes film hit the big screen. War For The Planet Of The Apes sees humans go head-to-head with the chimps and their allies. Much of the recovery work was done deep inside the cave system, working away at concrete-like rock called breccia, using air scribes to avoid breaking the fragile and priceless fossil remains. \"The process required extremely careful excavation in the dark environment of the cave. \"Once the upward-facing surfaces of the skeleton\u2019s bones were exposed, the breccia in which the undersides were still embedded had to be carefully undercut and removed in blocks for further cleaning in the lab,\" said Clarke. The Sterkfontein cave system became famous in the 1930s with the discovery of an adult Australopithecus africanus. The team says that Little Foot is from a second species, Australopithecus prometheus, which was named back in 1948 from fragmentary fossils. The find reinforces the belief that South Africa was a major cradle of human evolution, featuring diverse hominid ancestors. For years, information has trickled out on the significance of the find, but this is the first time the fossil skeleton will be unveiled in the vault of the University of the Witwatersrand Evolutionary Studies Institute. The results of the decades of studies will soon be released in a series of more than 25 scientific papers, the scientists involved say.

There is total chaos, disorder and turmoil everywhere, as clearly a new global architecture is about emerging from all these crises. For Africa there are three different opinions on what its future is supposed to be according to the current world powers. There are those who are of the belief that Africa should be nuclear free, not industrialized and backward. There are those who belief that Africa should be helped to develop as the other continents of the world. The third opinion is that Africa should be a buffet where every emerging and established power can come and grab whatever they want from it. Regardless of how anyone can look at it, these three views on Africa was expressed by a highly regarded policy maker at an international conference in a developed country last year. It is left for the African leaders to determine what the future is for the Africans. But, personally, with the illegal migrations across hazardous terrains by African youth which has now put them into modern day slavery; with HIV/AIDS and other diseases devastating a lot of the continent\u2019s population; with the poor indices of basic human development of majority of the continent\u2019s population, there is a lot to be done if Africa is to be relevant in the 21st century. Then you look at the Middle East which has always been a centre of conflict since the end of the Second World War. The initial crisis was defined as Arab versus Israelis but these are cousins having descended from once ancestor, Abraham. Every Jew has Arab blood and every Arab is related to the Jews by blood so I really do not understand the fight. Then it became a so-called Shia/Sunni fight with the Saudis leading the Sunni while Iran is said to be leading the Shia. But there is no reference to Sunni or Shia in the Quran or the Hadith. There is only Islam and if both these so called sects are adherents of this same religion, I do not understand this fight which has led the UN recently to describe Yemen as the worst humanitarian crisis in the world today. There must be something else and not religion that is motivating the current conflicts in the Arab Middle East. This conflict can never be religious or ethnic because they are all Arab and Muslim. It is indeed political. In the richest country in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, a young man, Mohammed Bn Salman, was appointed Crown Prince by his father King Salman of Saudi Arabia. He is the brain behind the Saudi fight in Yemen, the poorest Arab country, as well as the political crisis in Lebanon, one of the most liberal Arab countries. The Prince is not done yet as he has ordered the arrest of many top clerics, businessmen and princes of Saudi Arabia. It reminds me of what happened some years back in our neighbouring country, Niger republic where a former leader there was ordering the arrest of many people instilling fear into everyone there. Unknown to them, he was already mad as he was later diagnosed with brain tumour! Then you take a look at the Korean Peninsula where another young man, Kim Jong Un of North Korea is having a field day with an old man Donald Trump of the US. Kim has rushed to acquire nuclear weapon which he sees as his only insurance against being disgraced by the world powers. He saw what happened to Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Muammar Gaddafi in Libya. The US was the leading nation in the world until Trump was elected president. Trump wants to isolate America from the rest of the world but he wants the world to back America against North Korea which is a contradiction. If there was no immigration Trump would not have been an American citizen his grandfather having migrated from Germany to the US. America is a country of immigrants built by immigrants. But you can trust the American institutions will take care of him. In Europe there is crisis with Brexit in UK and some separatist tendencies in other European countries such as Spain. From there you go down to Asia where the two major Asian powers \u2013 India and China \u2013 are grappling with pollution menace. China has seen a phenomenal rise in economic prosperity but at the expense of its own environmental safety and even the environment of other parts of the world that it is dealing with. India is also a rising power and the largest democracy in the world but its admirable management of diversity is being threatened of recent with the rise of micro nationalism under Prime Minister Modi. Indians have contributed to global development and many third world countries look up to India as a model but it has to continue with its well-known and cherished respect for pluralism inherited from its ancient culture and traditions. But Delhi, one of the greenest cities is threatened by pollution which has to be addressed quickly. In Latin America there is brewing crisis. An oil rich nation, Venezuela, is embroiled in socio-economic and political crisis that is threatening the very foundation of the country. It is an example of the paradox of many resource-rich nations \u2013 rich nation with poor people. Brazil and Argentina are all going through trying times politically. Cuba is undergoing a transition period that may see the end of the Castro brothers\u2019 hold on power there. It is a pregnancy whose outcome no one can say now. What comes out of all these clearly is the fact that the world is undergoing a period of great turmoil which is like the pain leading to the birth of a new global order. The cure for disorder is order; the cure for injustice is justice; the cure for lack of peace is peace; and the cry of the oppressed is always heard by nature. What is about to come out of all these may not be clearly discernible to analysts and policy makers right now, but an outline is emerging. Thus, from all the indicators available to us, we are heading towards a three-tier global architecture with North America, Europe and Japan at the top; Brazil, Russia, China, India in the middle; and the rest of the world at the bottom of the pyramid. It is still roughly the current global power configuration but it may soon be institutionalized. And history is always on the side of the oppressed.

Picture: Owen Richards \nNorwich City Council has expressed an interest to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) to become the home of Channel 4 when it relocates from its London headquarters. \nThe government hopes the move will see the channel boost regional growth, with a report suggesting it could create almost 7,500 jobs and bring almost \u00a3600m in economic benefits. \nIn May, council leader Alan Waters and Graham Creelman, chairman of Norwich Cultural Board, wrote to the government, urging them to \u201cbe bold\u201d and choose Norwich over larger cities which could risk \u201cswapping London for a \u2018little London\u2019\u201d. \nIn it, they said the east has \u201cmassive potential\u201d and Norwich has \u201cone of the strongest creative offerings in the country\u201d. Channel 4 headquarters in currently in Horseferry Road, London (Picture: PA) \nIn its response, the DCMS said, with an election then on the way, no decision had been made and proceedings would be put on hold for the election - but the council has said it is still keen to pursue the bid. \nMr Waters said: \u201cWe are still very keen to welcome Channel 4 to Norwich and look forward to hearing more about the bidding process when the government decides how that would happen.\u201d \nIn November, Richard Bacon, MP for South Norfolk, told Karen Bradley, secretary of state for DCMS, that Norwich University of the Arts (NUA) was an excellent example of why Norwich should be chosen - though, at the time, she would not be drawn on the channel\u2019s future. \nProfessor Richard Sawdon Smith, dean of arts and media at NUA, agreed that the fine city could be a fine spot for the channel. South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon is backing the bid. Picture: Sonya Duncan \nHe said Norwich had a \u201cproud history\u201d as a centre of broadcasting talent and expertise which spanned back to the 1950s - and that the university\u2019s courses were \u201cproducing the future talent\u201d the channel would need. \n\u201cNo doubt Britain\u2019s biggest cities will be top of Channel 4\u2019s list of options outside London,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as a left-field candidate, Norwich could make a surprisingly strong case.\u201d \nDavid Richardson, vice-chancellor at the University of East Anglia (UEA) agreed, and said: \u201cWe would very much welcome any prospective move to Norwich for Channel 4. UEA is rightly very proud of all its creative and talented graduates, including journalists, writers, actors, comedians and directors.\u201d \nHe said the university\u2019s roll call included actor Matt Smith, BBC special correspondent Razia Iqbal, author David Grossman and television, film and theatre producer Sir Colin Callender, among others.

Photo: Steve Adams \n\u201cThere is a flourishing creative sector in Norwich and, as we all know, it\u2019s a fantastic place to live and work,\u201d he said. \nClive Lewis, MP for Norwich South, said it showed the council was taking a forward-facing approach. \nHe said: \u201cNorwich should be welcoming the fact that the council are going for it. Even if we don\u2019t get, it puts Norwich on the map and it shows the huge growth in our creative industries. \n\u201cThe fact that we are confident enough to go for it speaks volumes, and shows we are open for business.\u201d \nHe said the city was a \u201cbrilliant location and a beautiful place\u201d, and that anything that would help keep talented graduates in Norwich should be welcomed. \nFellow MP Chloe Smith, for Norwich North, agreed and said: \u201cI would welcome high-quality jobs such as Channel 4 coming to Norwich. The digital, creative and tech sector generally is very important to us. \n\u201cI\u2019ll be meeting local leaders from this sector on Friday to discuss big issues ahead, including Brexit, and we would all want to back Norwich as an attractive, thriving city with excellent prospects.\u201d \nA spokesperson for the DCMS said they hoped to agree a way forward with the channel to \u201ctruly reflect and represent the full diversity of the UK\u201d. \n\u2022Why Channel 4 could move \nIn April, the government launched a consultation asking how the channel could better contribute to regional growth. \nA report published in October estimated that moving the broadcaster out of its \u00a3100m London headquarters could create almost 7,500 jobs and deliver almost \u00a3600m in economic benefits. \nNews of the relocation sparked several local authorities to express an interest in hosting the channel, including Sheffield, Birmingham and Manchester. \nThe channel, which is state-owned but funded by advertising income, has argued that relocation could damage its operations, with many of the independent television firms and advertisers it works with based in the capital. \nFormer chief executive David Abraham evem warned the move could \u201cdestroy\u201d the channel, but national press has reported that the government is considering taking action in the new year to push through the plans. \n\u2022Norwich\u2019s TV links \nNorwich has a strong history of television links. \nThe city was home to Mustard TV and is the current home of both ITV Anglia and BBC Look East. \nBC the bear became a well-known addition to ITV in the 1980s, as a creature who helped presenters, including Helen McDermott, on the children\u2019s slot Birthday Club. \nGame show Sale of the Century, broadcast in the 1970s, was also well-known for its famous opening line: \u201cAnd now from Norwich, it\u2019s the quiz of the week.\u201d \nMeanwhile, Survival Anglia - which produced wildlife programmes including Flight of the Geese - was also based in Norwich until it relocated to Bristol in 2001. \nBut it is perhaps Alan Partridge, portrayed by Steve Coogan, who has brought the most attention to Norwich in recent years, as a host on the fictional Radio Norwich. \nThe city, and wider Norfolk, are the backdrop to his various series - with talk of the pedestrianisation of Norwich among the most well-known moments.

The Charlotte Observer via AP Diedra Laird North Carolina county's ransomware recovery will take days By JONATHAN DREW Associated Press Order Reprint of this Story December 07, 2017 04:06 AM \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common \u2014 and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dena diorio", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jonathan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irwin carmichael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keith gregg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ross rustici", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anjanette flowers grube", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "newsrooms mecklenburg county", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "government center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cybereason", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mecklenburg county sheriff's office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap diedra laird north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap diedra laird mecklenburg county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte observer", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mecklenburg county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukraine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.c.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:38.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ff77d33da2754a994d10ba671ff1774952c9594c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSFJYSGeCRgENBJKgpnuluWeqi2g9mw7IAvxRnNp7d4IpQV8fQ6tc8MKfoc0f8hy6UmfsETk57MKA--", "site_full": "forums.realgm.com", "site": "realgm.com", "site_section": "https://forums.realgm.com/boards/viewforum.php?f=19", "site_categories": ["pro_ice_hockey", "pro_basketball", "football", "sports", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Los Angeles Lakers - RealGM", "title": "The Venting Thread", "title_full": "The Venting Thread - RealGM", "published": "2017-12-05T14:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10264, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0e706beb69a1a824731159c1bcd85fad5c812ab5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSFJYSGeCRgENBJKgpnuluWeqi2g9mw7IAvxRnNp7d4IpQV8fQ6tc8MKfoc0f8hy6UfEFCGeXxswmkFue4vFD0J", "ord_in_thread": 10, "author": "Laker_Kid", "published": "2017-12-05T23:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "just friggin start Kuzma already. why does it have to be so difficult???

Almost half of firms expect climate change to impact on their value chain within next five years \u2014 but only a quarter are preparing for it, according to DNV GL survey. \nNearly half of companies expect to feel the negative impacts of climate change in the next five years, but only a quarter are taking action to mitigate or avoid these impacts, an international survey of business leaders suggests. \nA poll of 1,200 business executives across Europe, Asia and the Americas carried out by risk assurance giant DNV GL found nearly all respondents mentioned at least one climate-related hazard they predict will have an impact on their business. \nIn the survey results, the biggest concerns raised were temperature increases and heatwaves, which were highlighted by 55 percent of respondents; storms, identified as a risk by 44 percent; and floods, a concern for 38 percent. \nLevels of concern varied by geography, but around the world, a significant percentage of business leaders are both aware of and concerned by escalating climate risks. It follows warnings last month from insurers that recent extreme weather disasters around the world are likely to make 2017 the most expensive year on record, exposing a $1.7 trillion gap in insurance cover globally. \nThe poll found many companies are expecting climate impacts to hit their value chain within only a few years. Some 25 percent of respondents said they were already experiencing impacts, while 46 percent foresee impacts over the next five years, and 60 percent expect their business to be hit by climate change within the next decade. \nAre businesses underestimating how disruptive the impacts could be and how urgent it is to face this issue? \nYet the survey also found only a quarter of companies are currently working to adapt and build resilience to climate change within their operations and supply chain, while a third have no plans to implement any measures within the next three years. \nLuca Crisciotti, CEO of DNV GL Business Assurance, said the survey reveals a \"lack of proactivity\" among the business community. \"Are businesses underestimating how disruptive the impacts could be and how urgent it is to face this issue?\" he asked. \nLarger companies appear to be further ahead with climate resilience and adaptation measures, with as many as 40 percent in the poll reporting that actions already have been taken at their businesses. \nOf those businesses indicating they were already taking resilience and adaptation measures, around half said they believed these actions would give them a competitive advantage. \nBut Crisciotti said the results suggest some confusion among respondents between climate adaptation and resilience measures and mitigation measures, which typically focus on emissions reduction efforts. \"On the one hand, the frontrunners show there is an opportunity to adapt and build resilience while gaining a competitive advantage,\" he said. \"On the other hand, the report clearly highlights that we need to increase awareness and understanding of the importance of adapting and building resilience to climate change. We advise companies to start by assessing the risks and defining a strategic approach to tackle them.\" This story first appeared on:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "luca crisciotti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crisciotti", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dnv gl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dnv gl business assurance", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "americas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:39.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0b1554e8a84e65ac0db8dcb581938e9e7dbb3af9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspa09cPOGnxA4.N6d10rPDETXWyJMqqCflRdFSkTYf6x53nvxjHmXKTxcdZq_5vbRrzNhmHcVMhHH1IqD03Bv_pE9CICyC9TsfrzsOuMpqP6eEB.ZX7t8j91fT8g3xPFGOs", "site_full": "www.expedia.com.br", "site": "expedia.com.br", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com.br/Manhattan-Hoteis.d129440.Guia-de-Hoteis", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hot\u00e9is em Manhattan: Pague em parcelas em at\u00e9 12x sem IOF | Expedia.com.br", "title": "DoubleTree Suites by Hilton New York City - Times Square:", "title_full": "DoubleTree Suites by Hilton New York City - Times Square: Pre\u00e7os, promo\u00e7\u00f5es e coment\u00e1rios | Expedia.com.br", "published": "2017-11-18T08:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46532, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "58d29de7a5c3d70692a7a3eaa5cdeab75e9372ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspa09cPOGnxA4.N6d10rPDETXWyJMqqCflRdFSkTYf6x53nvxjHmXKTxcdZq_5vbRrzNhmHcVMhHH1IqD03Bv_pE9CICyC9TsfrzsOuMpqP6eEB.ZX7t8j91XHL6sdDNd1OKlwEgtJzCmeyOmQlgXCSFPSL_QCYUBp64MBexGMM9IY-", "ord_in_thread": 13, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-02T04:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "If you like the busyness of times square it is a great location.

Alex Brandon AP Photo Announcement coming from Sen. Franken amid fresh accusations By ANDREW TAYLOR Associated Press December 07, 2017 09:42 AM UPDATED 2 MINUTES AGO WASHINGTON \nMinnesota Democrat Al Franken, facing fresh allegations of sexual misconduct and vanishing support from fellow Democrats, appears on the brink of resigning from the Senate. \nFranken's office said he will make an announcement at 11:45 a.m. Thursday in a speech on the Senate floor. His office tweeted Wednesday evening that he had not made \"a final decision\" on resigning. \nBut a majority of the Senate's Democrats called on the two-term lawmaker to quit after a woman emerged Wednesday morning saying he forcibly tried to kiss her in 2006. Hours later, another woman said Franken inappropriately squeezed \"a handful of flesh\" on her waist while posing for a photo with her in 2009. That brought the number of women alleging misconduct by Franken to at least eight. \nFranken, the former comedian who made his name on \"Saturday Night Live,\" faces a chorus of calls to step aside, and Democratic senators said they expected their liberal colleague to resign. \n\"Enough is enough,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. \"We need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is OK, none of it is acceptable, and we, as elected leaders, should absolutely be held to a higher standard.\" \nGillibrand was the first to call for Franken's resignation on Wednesday, but a torrent of Democrats quickly followed. \n\"I'm shocked and appalled by Sen. Franken's behavior,\" said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state. \"It's clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time. It's time for him to step aside.\" \nThough the writing appeared to be on the wall, Franken's departure was not certain. A tweet posted Wednesday evening on Franken's Twitter account said: \"Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate.\" \nLate in the day, Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York added his voice. \n\"I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately,\" Schumer said. \nThe resignation demands came in rapid succession even though Franken on Wednesday vehemently denied the new accusation that came from a former Democratic congressional aide, who said he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006. \nThe woman, who was not identified, told Politico that Franken pursued her after her boss had left and she was collecting her belongings. She said that she ducked to avoid his lips and that Franken told her: \"It's my right as an entertainer.\" \nFranken, in a statement, said the idea he would claim such conduct as a right was \"preposterous.\" \nBut it was clear his position had become untenable. \nFellow Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who spoke to Franken, wrote on Twitter, \"I am confident he will make the right decision.\" \nThe pressure only mounted Tuesday, when Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., resigned after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. Rep Ruben Kihuen, D-Nev., faces pressure to resign as well over allegations reported by Buzzfeed that he repeatedly propositioned a former campaign worker. \nWhile Franken apparently is departing, Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore could be arriving, if he prevails in a Dec. 12 special election. Multiple women have accused the 70-year-old Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were teens and he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s. If Moore is elected, it could create a political nightmare for Republicans, who have promised an ethics probe. \nA national conversation about sexual harassment has intensified this fall after the heavily publicized case of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of many acts of sexual misconduct, including rape, by actresses and other women. Just on Wednesday, Time magazine named as its person of the year the \"silence breakers\" \u2014 women who have come forward on sexual harassment. \nPunishment has been swift for leaders in entertainment, media and sports while members of Congress have tried to survive the onslaught of allegations. \nFranken already faced a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into previous claims by several other women that he groped them or sought to forcibly kiss them. \nThe allegations began in mid-November when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan. \nOther allegations followed, including a woman who says Franken put his hand on her buttocks as they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Two women told the Huffington Post that Franken squeezed their buttocks at political events during his first campaign for the Senate in 2008. A fourth woman, an Army veteran, alleged Franken cupped her breast during a photo on a USO tour in 2003. \nFranken has apologized for his behavior but has also disputed some of the allegations.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "al franken", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "franken", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kirsten gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leeann tweeden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john conyers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "politico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew taylor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruben kihuen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy klobuchar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buzzfeed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patty murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuck schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey weinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex brandon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schumer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate ethics committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota state fair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huffington post", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "d-minn.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-nev.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-mich.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington  minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:40.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "23b70ba6e52e114b8b4c76e41b0becf45bad605d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTT_S6x0widpmkY8apq3v3Ws5AvVxX2nlaVOmfkoKC0hApjXegmsyFzjXFmvJJKF9HeEuyvftHhRFjVj_84ovAB1EfWknnFVx8-", "site_full": "www.macrumors.com", "site": "macrumors.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.macrumors.com/MacRumors-All", "site_categories": ["mac_support", "tech"], "section_title": "MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories", "title": "Apple Shares Top Movies, TV Shows, Music, Podcasts and Books of 2017", "title_full": "Apple Shares Top Movies, TV Shows, Music, Podcasts and Books of 2017", "published": "2017-12-07T11:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2017/12/appletopcontentitunes-800x519.jpg?retina", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1213, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 40, "comments": 0, "shares": 40}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "23b70ba6e52e114b8b4c76e41b0becf45bad605d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTT_S6x0widpmkY8apq3v3Ws5AvVxX2nlaVOmfkoKC0hApjXegmsyFzjXFmvJJKF9HeEuyvftHhRFjVj_84ovAB1EfWknnFVx8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Juli Clover", "published": "2017-12-07T11:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "Apple Shares Top Movies, TV Shows, Music, Podcasts and Books of 2017", "text": "Apple Shares Top Movies, TV Shows, Music, Podcasts and Books of 2017   1:16 AM PST by Juli Clover Apple today published its annual lists featuring the most popular media content in the iTunes Store and iBooks Store in 2017, highlighting the best music, movies, TV shows, podcasts, and books. \"The Shape of You\" by Ed Sheeran was the top song of the year, while the top album was Drake's \"More Life.\" Other hit albums included Kendrick Lamar's \"DAMN,\" Taylor Swift's \"Reputation,\" Ed Sheeran's \"Divide,\" and \"Starboy\" from The Weeknd.
