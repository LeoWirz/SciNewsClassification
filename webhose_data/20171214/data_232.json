The Republican-led House passed a bill to make it easier for gun owners to legally carry concealed weapons across state lines. J. Scott Applewhite / AP \nThe House approved a bill on Wednesday that would ease legal restrictions for carrying concealed firearms across state lines \u2013 a move pushed by the National Rifle Association that comes just weeks after mass shootings in Las Vegas and Texas. \nOn a mostly party-line vote, the measure easily passed, 231-198, although 14 Republicans voted no. Six Democrats voted for the so-called reciprocity measure, which would allow a gun owner with the proper permit in any state to carry a concealed firearm to another state where it is also legal. \nThe bill now goes to the Senate, where it is likely to encounter a much tougher battle. \nIn the House version, GOP lawmakers added a measure aimed at strengthening tracking in the national background-check database of legal and mental health records that might prevent some gun purchases. Just last month it was revealed that Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman who killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., legally purchase firearms used in the attack despite a record of domestic assault in the Air Force that should have disqualified him. \nHowever, as The New York Times reports: \"... the background check measure was not enough to win over most Democrats, nor did it persuade law enforcement officials in some of the largest cities, including New York, who say the legislation would force locales with strict gun laws to bow to places with few or no gun restrictions.\" \nThe bill angered many Democrats who argued that following mass shootings that have killed 80 people, the times called for stricter, not looser gun measures. \nConnecticut Democrat Rep. Elizabeth Esty \u2014 who represents Newtown, Conn., where 20 first-graders and six teachers and staff were killed in a 2012 mass shooting \u2013 said the bill would undermine states' rights, \"hamstring law enforcement and allow dangerous criminals to walk around with hidden guns anywhere and at any time. It's unspeakable that this is Congress' response to the worst gun tragedies in American history,\" according to The Associated Press. \nThe NRA's executive director, Chris Cox, is quoted in the Times as saying Thursday's vote is a \"watershed\" for Second Amendment rights and that the bill would ensure \"all law-abiding citizens in our great country can protect themselves in the manner they see fit without accidentally running afoul of the law.\" \nIn the Senate, supporters would likely need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster by Democrats.

My main concern are the reviews themselves. I need them in English. Yes, I could use Google Translate and it may be good enough to determine what the applicant wants to do especially if the application is fairly general. But the review is a different animal in my opinion for a couple of reasons. And the review is what the supplier really needs because that's what he or she may give to a potential customer. An application in English proves to me that the person can communicate in the language of the supplier. And if he can write in english, why didn't he write an English application? I don't want to end up with a non-English review. What if the RoadTest has a problem and needs to communicate with me? I don't feel I need to find a means to translate. As an a side, we did some German articles and we hired a translator. This has never been spelled out before and that's why I created the discussion and have articulated the policy.

The IOC, however, plans to invite individual Russians to compete under the Olympic flag.

That itself was in response to the U.S.-led boycott of the Moscow Olympics four years earlier. \nPutin also said Russia still did not accept accusations that it ran a state-backed doping system around the Sochi Olympics. He called the IOC ruling \"politically motivated\" and unfair \"collective punishment.\" \nPRO FOOTBALL \nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Roger Goodell has signed a five-year contract extension to remain commissioner of the NFL through 2024. \nA memo from the NFL's compensation committee to team owners and obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press confirms that Goodell and committee chairman Arthur Blank, owner of the Atlanta Falcons, have signed the extension. \nThat extension has been a source of controversy because Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones objected to the process. \nAll 32 owners approved in May the compensation committee's power to negotiate and sign a deal with Goodell, who replaced Paul Tagliabue in 2006. \nSince then, the league's total revenues have more than doubled to $14 billion. \nA person familiar with the contract told The Associated Press it is worth almost $200 million, with a base of $40 million. But the deal is incentive-laden, the person added, speaking on condition of anonymity because the contract numbers are not made public. \nHall of Fame quarterback Warren Moon has been accused of sexual harassment by an assistant for his sports marketing firm, according to a lawsuit filed in California. \nThe civil lawsuit was filed Monday in Orange County Superior Court. According to court documents, Wendy Haskell alleges Moon made \"unwanted and unsolicited\" sexual advances as part of her role as his assistant working for Sports 1 Marketing. Moon is the co-founder and president of the company. \nThe Washington Post first reported on the lawsuit Wednesday. The 61-year-old Moon has been working as a radio commentator for the Seattle Seahawks. The team announced later Wednesday that \"We have accepted Warren Moon's request for a leave of absence as the club's radio analyst.\" \nMoon played parts of 17 seasons in the NFL with Houston, Minnesota, Seattle and Kansas City. He threw for 49,325 yards and 291 touchdowns in the regular season and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2006. The former University of Washington star led Edmonton to five Canadian Football League titles before playing in the NFL. \nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier has been transferred from a Cincinnati hospital to Pittsburgh to continue treatment for a spinal injury suffered during Monday night's game against the Bengals. \nThe Steelers say Shazier will continue to undergo tests before offering an update on his status. \nShazier left Paul Brown Stadium on a stretcher less than four minutes into his team's 23-20 victory over Cincinnati following a tackle that left the 25-year-old writhing on the turf, his legs motionless. He underwent extensive testing at University of Cincinnati Medical Center under the care of neurosurgeons David Okonwko and Joseph Cheng. \nRICHMOND, Va. (AP) \u2014 A former University of Virginia and pro football player has been sentenced to 40 years for running a $10 million fraud scheme that victimized more than 50 investors. \nFederal prosecutors say in a news release that 37-year-old Merrill Robertson Jr. of Chesterfield was sentenced Wednesday. He was convicted in August on 15 offenses, including mail and wire fraud and money laundering. \nProsecutors say Robertson and a co-conspirator operated Cavalier Union Investments in Richmond. Authorities say Robertson targeted former coaches, donors, alumni and employees of schools he had attended. \nAccording to the documents, Robertson sold promissory notes that he claimed would pay an annual return of up to 20 percent. \nInstead, prosecutors charged, Robertson used the invested money for cars, vacations and a luxury suite at a football stadium. \nPRO BASKETBALL \nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Hornets coach Steve Clifford will be away from the team for an undetermined period of time to deal with a \"health issue.\" \nThe team made the announcement Wednesday in a release. \nThe 56-year-old Clifford missed Monday night's game against Orlando because he was not feeling well. Associate head coach Stephen Silas filled in for Clifford against the Magic. \nClifford has battled heart problems in the past, but a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press the issue was not a heart-related. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the team has not released details of Clifford's health issue. \nThe team said there is no timetable for Clifford's return and that officials would have no further comment. \nBASEBALL \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Giants general manager Bobby Evans confirmed on San Francisco's flagship radio station KNBR that the club has reached the parameters of a potential trade for Miami slugger Giancarlo Stanton. \nEvans said Giants executives gathered with the NL MVP and his representatives in \"a good meeting\" last week. \n\"The specifics of the deal are not something that we feel comfortable discussing, but ultimately our hope is that if he does choose to come here, we'll be able to fold him in with a winning club,\" Evans said Wednesday. \"In terms of our deal it just has a number of contingencies, one of course that's paramount is relative to his full no trade and that's a decision that really comes from him. But our terms with the Marlins are clear.\" \nMarlins CEO Derek Jeter said Tuesday that Miami has not decided whether to trade Stanton, still owed $295 million over the final decade of his record $325 million, 13-year contract. When asked specifically about absorbing the majority of that contract, Evans didn't address it. \nStanton is due to make $25 million in 2018 after he led the majors with 59 home runs and 132 RBIs this season.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vladimir", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "paul brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph cheng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shazier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bobby evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goodell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul tagliabue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen silas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merrill robertson jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clifford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david okonwko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giancarlo stanton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arthur blank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren moon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan shazier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger goodell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wendy haskell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robertson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve clifford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derek jeter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerry jones", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "orange county superior court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cavalier union investments", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle seahawks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canadian football league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of cincinnati medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "knbr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hall of fame", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta falcons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steelers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international olympic committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas cowboys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ioc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nl mvp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bengals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marlins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richmond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "va.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cincinnati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pittsburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pittsburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kansas city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pyeongchang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sochi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orlando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edmonton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "soviet union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chesterfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richmond", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:36.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ab5b181500d6e481bd9b979bcd6ed05fb145e34f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.UbdL5a0JkE9OL_WsD4vNoeSiFsPN552GENjzN5ipx4jKx0fQ_B5d.BtR8zn_Rp5WjAIkbUYrSUDT3m_Ik5dc_YviiSKFyk37UA53rCN7ZG7CW3R5yihl4", "site_full": "www.ladejinaijablog.com", "site": "ladejinaijablog.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "AFRICA: A CONTINENT IN THE THROES OF AN EMERGENT REVOLUTION IV. -

Human history is replete with men and women who dared the impossible, and conquering their fears made our planet better. Human history is replete with men and women who dared the impossible, and conquering their fears made our planet better. Africa is a continent in dire need of DREAMERS, nay MADMEN/MADWOMEN. This generation must interrogate the present crop of leaders who rather than work for a united, independent and prosperous Africa, are engaged in mediocre tendencies in governance, constantly and consistently kowtowing to Western and Foreign interests for validation. \nDreams come true, and dreamers revolutionize the planet. We live the dreams of departed greats, we live our dreams, and dreams run the universe, so nothing is more real than dreams. I was seven years old when the dream of a prosperous Nigeria under my watch bludgeoned through my 'infant' mind, several years after, our nation wanders in search of the Dreamer to whom national redemption and prosperity is religion. \nAfrica wanders in search of PAN-AFRICANISTS who will look inwards and appropriate for greatness the amazing munificence and riches bequeathed our continent by the Almighty. Unlike the Preacher from Atlanta, Georgia Martin Luther King Jr, this dream will come through in my lifetime. This dream is my REALITY. \nAs some insist that 2019 will place before us an inevitable choice between the rock and the hard place, nay between PMB and ATIKU, I have a dream that before us is a peaceful ballot based ORDINARY PEOPLES revolution, and this dream is rooted in the fact that the Almighty who brought our boisterous planet out of nothing is not asleep.

They're selling well.\n\"The 'Up and Moving' is for joints and for pain,\" he explains. \"The 'Calm and Quiet' is for real anxious dogs, to take away that anxiety.\"\nPeople anxious to relieve suffering in their pets are increasingly turning to oils and powders that contain CBDs, a non-psychoactive component of marijuana. But there's little data on whether they work, or if they have harmful side effects.\nThat's because Washington has been standing in the way of clinical trials, veterinarians and researchers say. Now, a push is underway to have barriers removed, so both pets and people can benefit.\nThose barriers have had more than just a chilling effect.\nPhoto: David Zalubowski, AP Image 1 of / 11 Caption\nClose\nImage 1 of 11 In this Monday, Oct. 30, 2017, photo, Luke Byerly tends to his 14-year-old beagle, Robbie, during a break at Byerly's job as a technician at a veterinary clinic in east Denver.

Colorado State University is pushing ahead.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned companies that sell marijuana products online and via pet shops and animal hospitals that they're violating laws by offering \"unapproved new animal drugs.\" The FDA threatened legal action.\nBut, seeing potential benefits of CBDs, the American Veterinary Medical Association's policy-making body said last summer it wants the DEA to declassify marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug \"to facilitate research opportunities for veterinary and human medical uses.\" It asked the board of the national veterinarians' organization to investigate working with other stakeholders toward that goal. The board is awaiting a recommendation from two group councils.\n\"The concern our membership has is worry about people extrapolating their own dosages, looking to medicate their pets outside the realm of the medical professional,\" Board Chairman Michael Whitehair said in a telephone interview. \"This is an important reason for us to continue the research.\"\nUtah Sen. Orrin Hatch, a conservative Republican, became an unlikely champion of this push when he introduced a bill in September that would open the path for more clinical research. While Hatch said he opposes recreational marijuana use, he wants marijuana-based drugs, regulated by the FDA, produced for people with disorders.\n\"We lack the science to support use of medical marijuana products like CBD oils, not because researchers are unwilling to do the work, but because of bureaucratic red tape and over-regulation,\" Hatch said.\nDawn Boothe, of Auburn University's College of Veterinary Medicine, is waiting for federal approval to begin a study of marijuana's effects on dogs with epilepsy. The classification of marijuana products containing CBD as a Schedule 1 drug, the same category as heroin and LSD, creates a \"major, major, major, terrible roadblock\" for researchers, Boothe said in a phone interview.\nResearchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine were studying CBDs' effects on dogs with osteoarthritis and pruritis, or itchiness, until the DEA released its policy statement.\n\"The ambiguity in this process has really brought us to a screeching halt,\" said Michael DiGregorio, director of the university's clinical trials center. \"It is research that needs to be done, because there are a lot of CBD products out there.\"\nWhen it clarified that marijuana CBD extracts are Schedule 1 drugs, the DEA said it was assigning a code number to those substances to better track them and to comply with international drug control treaties.\nDiGregorio complained that researchers seeking federal approval to study CBD products are told to provide certain data, but that data isn't normally available until the study is done.\n\"If you don't have the data, you can't get the registration to do the work,\" he said.\nOn a recent morning, Maas took a break from seeing four-legged patients in the Bend Veterinary Clinic. A stethoscope dangling from his neck over green scrubs, Maas said his clients have reported CBDs help relieve pain, arthritis, anxiety, loss of appetite, epilepsy and inflammation in their pets.\n\"Unfortunately there's not a lot of research out there, especially on animals, on CBD compounds,\" Maas said. \"The research is really necessary to help us understand how to actually use these compounds on our pets.\"\nVeterinarian Janet Ladyga of the Blue Sky Veterinary Clinic, also in Bend, said she doesn't recommend marijuana products because of the unknowns.\n\"We don't have a lot of evidence right now, so we don't know the toxicity or the safety profile ... and we don't have any good evidence to show either if it's safe or efficacious,\" she said.\nThe study at Colorado State University aims to provide some data. The roughly two dozen dogs in the arthritis study and the 30 in the epilepsy tests are given either CBD oil or a placebo. For the arthritis study, activity monitors are attached to the animals' collars, to determine if they're more mobile when they're taking CBD.\nPrincipal investigator Stephanie McGrath said she hopes the results will be a stepping stone for longer and more diverse studies, and that they provide useful information for human medicine.\n\"Every medication we're taking has been given to a dog first,\" the University of Pennsylvania's DiGregorio noted.\nMeanwhile, Boothe said she had everything ready to start her study in January, and was waiting for a green light from federal officials.\n\"I don't know what's taking so long,\" she said.\n___\nFollow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "luke byerly", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dawn boothe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew selsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelsie condon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janet ladyga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "byerly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robbie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael whitehair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael digregorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcgrath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephanie mcgrath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orrin hatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digregorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david zalubowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boothe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "american veterinary medical association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blue sky veterinary clinic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auburn university's college of veterinary medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of pennsylvania school of veterinary medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drug enforcement administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap image", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado state university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fort collins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:37.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9ad7f8faf0f4b78a44f65d9c3ab326c9c9b27ae6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfI5VQz788xFZLx22j.aFMz9x1Z_guDUEimgKBBLhwkHFZd2oGANI4ADhoSUUYodXqGWBjhYJxavvjiiQW6IxHVxdcrVKz5mZM_ZQQfrTXyaiojEv1O2fCqXLEIyFXRhlizZ1xWc_FwFfRKL.ZJ9G_QjADGMIIEDFaDyHDJCdN46ccFBlNgavmmrt7Kcb6qXFU6qNgzvUAjnY66ZddODbESc-", "site_full": "www.finanznachrichten.de", "site": "finanznachrichten.de", "site_section": "http://www.finanznachrichten.de/rss-branche-mischkonzerne-34", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "FinanzNachrichten.de: Nachrichten zu Mischkonzerne", "title": "Wolters Kluwer N.V.: Wolters Kluwer N.V.: Share Buyback Transaction Details November 30 -

But Chikte, who replaced Suraj Karkera in the 47th minute, made a brilliant save. While India, ranked 6th, will now play the semis, Belgium, having won all of their three group matches, will play for ranking positions.\nIt was a much-improved show from Indians. They converted penalty corners, defended well and did not waste too many chances. They struck right after halftime as Gurjant Singh made it 1-0. India doubled their lead four minutes later from a penalty corner. Rupinder Pal Singh dragged the ball behind him and into the path of Harmanpreet, who scored with ease.\nBelgium hit back as Loick Luypaert converted a penalty corner to reduce the lead. Soon Luypaert struck another PC home to equalise. Even before the Belgians could heave a sigh of relief, India nosed ahead. Rupinder converted from a penalty corner. With seven minutes to go, Amaury Keusters equalised for Belgium, ranked world No. 3. Towards the very end, they did win a number of PCs but were unable to convert any of them as the match went into shootout.

The Getty Center lies shrouded in smoke as seen from Casiano Road in the Bel Air district of Los Angeles after the Skirball wildfire swept through, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017. \nBy AMANDA LEE MYERS and ANDREW DALTONAssociated Press \nVENTURA, Calif. (AP) - Southern California has felt yellow wind, orange wind, and red wind. But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

A shopper clicking SEARCH while leaving the keyword box blank, then filtering the blank SEARCH for Vintage items only, will be treated on the first two (most relevant) pages to an increasing number of items that aren't Vintage.  Not even close.  Only on mendacious Etsy can an item be both Vintage (at least 20 years old) and made to order for each customer upon purchase!  That's right:  an item not even made yet can be \"vintage\" on Etsy.  I'm considering naming this the Josh Silverman Time Paradox because it's not actually a \"time\" paradox at all, but simply a matter of promoting items whose listings include deceptive selling techniques over items honestly listed. \n\nLet's have a look at some of the items ranked by Etsy's relevance algorithm as the Vintage items listed on the site most interesting to shoppers.\n\nVintage Music Art Poster - Oasis Whats the Story is offered in 3 different sizes.  The seller --  VintageMusicPosters -- describes the reproduction and printing details in the item's details. \n\n\n\nSince the seller's items are pretending to be \"vintage\", it's unknown who actually prints the posters.  Not vintage, and probably not handmade (designed and/or crafted) by the seller, either.  An inexpensive repro, deceptively listed.  A Josh Silverman Special! \n\nNothing screams Etsyverse \"vintage\" like this item:   Brand New Nintendo GBA Power Adapter \n\n\nThe seller  GamePalace has been reviewed by Marketplace Integrity on Etsy, and officially approved to sell products as \"vintage\" that aren't.  Visit the shop for more misrepresented items. \n\nThis  Custom Black Tronboy Backlit Original Gameboy for Retro Gaming in the dark is mendaciously listed as a \"vintage handmade item from the 1980s\" but the item's description says a purchase is a \"pre-order\" for a \"made to order\" item, \"please allow 6-8 weeks for assembly\".  Which on Etsy apparently means that, in 6-8 weeks, the Gameboy will be aged about 30 years? \n\n\nThis is another seller --  8BitAestheticsCom -- who has been vetted by Marketplace Integrity to sell brand new, custom, made to order items as \"vintage from the 1980s\".   \n\nThis brand new copy of a vintage  Sequoia National Park US Dept of Interior poster is pretending to be a \"vintage handmade item from the 1930s\".  Which means the seller who designed (no!) and/or made the item is over 100 years old.  Over 950 units in stock, offered in 5 different sizes, and it's a \"signed and stamped limited edition print\".  Yes, that's right:  on Etsy a brand new copy of some long dead person's art can be listed as an 80 year old signed limited edition!  Max mendacity points to the seller,  EncorePrintSociety \n\n\n\n\nAnother seller approved by Etsy's Marketplace Integrity Team to list new items as 40 year old (in this case \"vintage\" jewelry) is  FreshyFig   Her  Beluga Whale Necklace is made with a vintage goldtone or silvertone locket embellished with a whale; sold without a chain or with buyer's choice of 5 lengths in 2 metal finishes.  Listed as a \"vintage item from the 1970s\" although nothing about it is unaltered authentic vintage. \n\n\n\nYou can see in the primary photo from the listing (above) where the seller prepared the locket before adding the whale -- the surface is two different colors.   \n\nThis imported reseller product is pretending to be \"vintage handmade\":   Recycled Tin Metal CHEVY Bow Tie Sign   Over 40 units in stock. \n\n\n\n\nThe seller  xlr8imports has a shop full of new reseller products pretending to be \"vintage\".   He sells the same Chevy sign, priced on Etsy at $22, for just $14.99 on  eBay where he claims it is \"pre-owned\" so that he can maintain the deception of it being \"vintage\" for his Etsy shop.  A mendacious seller on all venues. \n\nDSGAntiques resells dozens of \"fauxtiques\" in his Etsy shop; some are manufactured as copies of original vintage items.  In the real world, outside the mendacious Etsyverse, antiques malls and co-ops that allow this type of merchandise for sale require that dealers tag them as NEW to avoid the reputation of trying to cheat shoppers looking for the real deal.   Unfortunately for sellers and buyers of authentic vintage items, Etsy welcomes sellers who pass off brand new fakes as authentically old, so CAVEAT EMPTOR (let the buyer beware). \nThe super-relevant item from DSGAntiques was this  Butchers Cow Ceramic Statue   A dozen of the same item have already been sold -- which pretty much establishes you can buy them wholesale by the case lot. \n\n\nPriced at a whopping $69.95 by DSGAntiques, you can find the same piece -- sold as New -- on honest  eBay for just $37.35.  I'm sure the 12 dumb bunnies who purchased one of these cows on Etsy are overwhelmingly grateful for the opportunity to overpay. \n\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "josh silverman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "etsy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "etsy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chevy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh silverman time paradox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marketplace integrity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "custom black tronboy backlit original gameboy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "etsy's marketplace integrity team", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ebay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sequoia national park us dept of interior", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:37.055+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4f750bd7141455942ebbaafe8c1412a4598b1427", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_zD09bhOnE8ryINY4XpIt_2bc5dWsLBlvT7RGv8RS1L32qBcup8EeP0MOhWipVWRXln46WYYi9CWKC69GjUOVgkpeamuk2O8UnT.hH2T6stqeqgBmdtVtw", "site_full": "www.mepc.org", "site": "mepc.org", "site_section": "http://www.mepc.org/category/topics/social-and-humanitarian-concerns", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Social and Humanitarian Concerns | Middle East Policy Council", "title": "Negotiating Crisis: International Aid and Refugee Policy in Jordan | Middle East Policy Council", "title_full": "Negotiating Crisis: International Aid and Refugee Policy in Jordan | Middle East Policy Council", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.096, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4f750bd7141455942ebbaafe8c1412a4598b1427", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_zD09bhOnE8ryINY4XpIt_2bc5dWsLBlvT7RGv8RS1L32qBcup8EeP0MOhWipVWRXln46WYYi9CWKC69GjUOVgkpeamuk2O8UnT.hH2T6stqeqgBmdtVtw", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mepc", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Negotiating Crisis: International Aid and Refugee Policy in Jordan | Middle East Policy Council", "text": "Skip to main content Top Menu Donate ENewsletter Subscribe to the Journal Follow Us: Search Search Toggle navigation Middle East Policy Council Main navigation Journal Current Issue Middle East Policy Archives Topics Regions Articles & Commentary Articles Commentary Speeches Hill Forums Recent Forums All Forums Media Experts Contact an Expert TeachMideast About Mission History Our Leadership Contact Newsletter Support Advertise in Middle East Policy Careers Top Menu Donate ENewsletter Subscribe to the Journal Follow Us: Negotiating Crisis: International Aid and Refugee Policy in Jordan Restricted Restricted Victoria Kelberer Ms. Kelberer is a Fulbright Specialist in Belgium and recently completed a research consultancy with the Jordan INGO Forum on the Jordan Compact.

From the first contact at booking and even after we left, communication and attentiveness have been superb! I lost a earring during my trip and Linzi went through the trouble of micro scanning the room for it and even posted this on a guest forum..amazing! We stayed here for 2 nights as we were attending a wedding at another venue and unfortunately we we did not spend much time at the guesthouse itself. However every minute we did spend was wonderful! You notice that much care is given to details, be it the decoration of the rooms, the garden, the breakfast table or even the serving of port waiting for you in your room. (which we have to come back for :-) ) Thank you so much for your hospitality and the best scrambled eggs in years!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 4.5, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:38.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e3f269f7cbae62adfff004ed641c9c638fed7125", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtbLXzObJGQpo_trTYZsgrS", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/lgbt/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/lgbt/ - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, &amp;
