The county secured a contractor to clean up the site, which is full of abandoned property and dilapidated structures, when the property owner failed to do so. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to report the cleanup is much more extensive than we imagined,\u201d Tudor said. \nKevin Evans, owner of the Route 589 property, was advised by county officials this summer that the uncontrolled grass and weeds and dilapidated structures on the site needed to be cleaned up. The commissioners agreed in September to give Evans a 60-day extension to abate the nuisance. \nWhen Evans failed to address the issue, the county hired a contractor to do so. \n\u201cThe more we clean up the more we find,\u201d Tudor said this week. \nHe asked the commissioners Tuesday to waive bidding requirements for the cleanup so that if it does exceed $10,000 the contractor currently working on the site can finish the job. Tudor said eight dumpsters of refuse had already been removed from the site. He expects the project to cost $20,000 to $30,000. \n\u201cIt\u2019s been a nightmare to clean up,\u201d Tudor said, adding that much of the refuse was plastic that fell apart and eventually had to be picked up by hand. \nSeveral of the commissioners said they\u2019d visited the site when the cleanup started. \n\u201cI was shocked at the amount of debris that was covered, hidden,\u201d Commissioner Bud Church said. \nCommissioner Chip Bertino said he\u2019d already gotten calls from area residents who were grateful to see the mess addressed. \nTudor said the cost of the overall cleanup would depend on the weight of the debris hauled away. While it\u2019s not unusual for the county to address nuisance issues when owners fail to do so, Tudor said this case was complicated due to the unknown extent of the debris. \nWhen the work is complete, Evans will be billed for the cost.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tudor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bud church", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ed tudor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chip bertino", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "worcester county department of development review", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "garden center", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:49.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b5d71b6e7fa9b599a85a60710e37760fcbb13ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_5eor1lwd49eQvEjPrqB6DTXOqmwAVsm6W7_OGLIxxJ2tNfbxMhLQVcgXPAse4fN4-", "site_full": "www.e90post.com", "site": "e90post.com", "site_section": "http://www.e90post.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=4", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "Off-Topic Discussions Board - E90Post - BMW 3-Series (E90 E92) Forum", "title": "9mm target pistol recommendations.", "title_full": "9mm target pistol recommendations.", "published": "2017-12-06T11:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "http://www.bimmerpost.com/bpfb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26808, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3e20814e781a21a1d63c988888157d3abfc4ca00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_5eor1lwd49eQvEjPrqB6DTXOqmwAVsm6W7_OGLIxxJ2tNfbxMhLQVNTTxQEBcoPa66mrfp86m5pOatAs0rNLw", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "theriz", "published": "2017-12-06T12:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I suggest a G17 or G19.

The other posters are correct the CZ is in an entirely different league than a Glock.\nThe bigger question is what's your eventual goal with getting a target pistol?\nDo you want to be more proficient with your current Glock or other striker-fired pistols? If so, get a Glock 17 or if you think you might want to step into gun games get at Glock 34. (My entry into competitive shooting was getting a 34 to make me more proficient with my 19 that I carried).\nIf you want to just improve your gun handling skills in general, and step up to the amazeballs experience that is a steel framed pistol, then CZ 75/Shadow all the way. It's also not a bad idea to get used to having a hammer fired pistol with an external safety anyways, and the double-action first pull is good training for trigger discipline overall.\nThe CZ 75/Shadow is also great for dry-fire (which you should do regardless of what gun you get) because you can simulate a full pull of the trigger over and over again without having to reset the slide (as you would with a striker fired gun like a Glock or an M&P).\nDo you have a range nearby that will let you try them both? You can scour internet reviews for years and still wind up with the wrong gun for you so I always push people to get hands on time if they can.\nIf you decide you do want a CZ, I'm fortunate enough to be in the same city as one of the largest volume private CZ dealers in the country, and I can get you a code for 10% off if you choose to go that route.\nHTH", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:49.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b5d71b6e7fa9b599a85a60710e37760fcbb13ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_5eor1lwd49eQvEjPrqB6DTXOqmwAVsm6W7_OGLIxxJ2tNfbxMhLQVcgXPAse4fN4-", "site_full": "www.e90post.com", "site": "e90post.com", "site_section": "http://www.e90post.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=4", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "Off-Topic Discussions Board - E90Post - BMW 3-Series (E90 E92) Forum", "title": "9mm target pistol recommendations.", "title_full": "9mm target pistol recommendations.", "published": "2017-12-06T11:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "http://www.bimmerpost.com/bpfb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26808, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0855d719d02a2d2a4a3029ffb714d2afee99ed2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_5eor1lwd49eQvEjPrqB6DTXOqmwAVsm6W7_OGLIxxJ2tNfbxMhLQVNTTxQEBcoPbR56_Zg3gtetXN7yI2WZcb", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "ajfb004", "published": "2017-12-06T12:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Glock 19 or Smith & Wesson M&P 2.0\nI carry a 19 on duty now and with some minor polishing of the trigger it\u2019s great", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:49.031+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b5d71b6e7fa9b599a85a60710e37760fcbb13ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_5eor1lwd49eQvEjPrqB6DTXOqmwAVsm6W7_OGLIxxJ2tNfbxMhLQVcgXPAse4fN4-", "site_full": "www.e90post.com", "site": "e90post.com", "site_section": "http://www.e90post.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=4", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "Off-Topic Discussions Board - E90Post - BMW 3-Series (E90 E92) Forum", "title": "9mm target pistol recommendations.", "title_full": "9mm target pistol recommendations.", "published": "2017-12-06T11:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "http://www.bimmerpost.com/bpfb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26808, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5ed834345c446fe3fe834982972612e1b280ae74", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_5eor1lwd49eQvEjPrqB6DTXOqmwAVsm6W7_OGLIxxJ2tNfbxMhLQVNTTxQEBcoPa66mrfp86m5lrjsCseYxfp", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "gordon@", "published": "2017-12-06T15:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Infinity SVI custom.

There are also tons of options if you're the type to customize. I dont think it will satiate your appetitte as well as some other selections could if you were looking for more of a show piece or something that \"feels substantial\" while in the hand, but judging by your post, that isn't the priority.\nIm lucky enough to have had the opportunity to put ~7000 rounds downrange through my work gun (G19 Gen 3) in the past 2 years, usually 500 or so rounds at a time (per day); it has been a pleasure to shoot. I usually give it a sub-3-minute cleaning every thousand rounds or so. The only malfunctions i ever had was stove piping, and that was limited to a particular lot of ammo (mass produced, lowest bidder military ball ammo at that).

I couldn't honestly want for any more from it for the $400 or so I paid for my Gen 4.\nYou cant really go wrong, as they are easily resellable on the second hand market incase its not to your liking.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:49.041+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ffb826c0fe485dd14f004887c41f09ac874f28b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKwsVX83iHME_02n3Qs439xXdsiYLYDQcgppaAMhFtjXFp2SeKD2W4G1qjjetQaZlvg3KIhpV8uHrpgqB3VdJcxOaKSKS.qw.jP5E_foYoTeYulp03qcnRHUTds9SCuhJqa82joX4YxPKGO_lnsy6dW6CQtAjrvb89C5o0sVmu6RLw8FodXi6F", "site_full": "www.ebay.co.uk", "site": "ebay.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.ebay.co.uk/b/Magnetic-Therapy-Devices/11777/bn_2314541", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Magnetic Therapy Devices | eBay", "title": "Ladies-Bio-Therapy-Healing-arthritis-Pain-Relief", "title_full": "Reviews: Ladies-Bio-Magnetic-Therapy-Healing-Bracelet-arthritis-Pain-Relief | eBay", "published": "2017-05-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.034, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dd162df0c348b7625ae6f94829b224e923df039b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKwsVX83iHME_02n3Qs439xXdsiYLYDQcgppaAMhFtjXFp2SeKD2W4G1qjjetQaZlvg3KIhpV8uHrpgqB3VdJcxOaKSKS.qw.jP5E_foYoTeYulp03qcnRHUTds9SCuhJqa82joX4YxPKGO_lnsy6dW6CQtAjrvb89C5o0sVmu6fQo4i.ReLY_mE09IyKy6_1W7qBR5vY9zBp.bNYs0LxA", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "t.swale-2008", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "bio magnetic bracelet", "text": "nice looking product.wife pleased with it anyway", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 5.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:49.046+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b5d71b6e7fa9b599a85a60710e37760fcbb13ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_5eor1lwd49eQvEjPrqB6DTXOqmwAVsm6W7_OGLIxxJ2tNfbxMhLQVcgXPAse4fN4-", "site_full": "www.e90post.com", "site": "e90post.com", "site_section": "http://www.e90post.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=4", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "Off-Topic Discussions Board - E90Post - BMW 3-Series (E90 E92) Forum", "title": "9mm target pistol recommendations.", "title_full": "9mm target pistol recommendations.", "published": "2017-12-06T11:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "http://www.bimmerpost.com/bpfb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26808, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a43a6d9dc6cba28c367038c347220fd23bd21b44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_5eor1lwd49eQvEjPrqB6DTXOqmwAVsm6W7_OGLIxxJ2tNfbxMhLQVNTTxQEBcoPakM9YQzHQCuMZnQZkPLF7b", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "1MOREMOD", "published": "2017-12-07T08:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Have a cz75 and it is a nice shooter.

These accusations were made by former legislative staffers and reporters who cover news at the Capitol, and were corroborated by their friends and colleagues, including another Democratic lawmaker. \nThe lengthy article is worth reading in its entirety, but the most salacious accusations include a former legislative intern who says she was standing outside an Austin nightclub when Miles waved a large roll of hundreds of dollars at her, and said, \u201cB****, you want to f*** with me tonight?\u201d to proposition her, and another time when Miles attended another legislator\u2019s party at the Capitol and behaved in such an alarming way \u2014 including repeatedly brandishing a handgun he had in his pocket \u2014 that they shut the party down to get away from him. \nBoth Miles and Uresti are the subjects of multiple accusations that they groped and forcibly kissed women and frequently made crude and demeaning comments to female staffers, reporters, political consultants, and other young women whose work is related to the Capitol. Uresti in particular is described as having a penchant for young female staffers. Messer reports that both men deny the accusations. \nAs has been common in many of these stories, the accusers spoke to Messer under the condition she not use their names \u2014 including the man she identifies as \u201cChris,\u201d another Democratic state legislator. \u201cSeveral of the people interviewed for this story asked not to be named, as they still work in politics or journalism and fear either physical or professional retribution for coming forward,\u201d says the disclaimer at the end of her article. \nThink about that: years removed from the events, presumably more professionally established and no longer nervous rookies, at a time when victims of harassment are being believed and supported like never before, and they are still afraid. Even a male legislator who merely witnessed the harassment is nervous and fearing for his safety about coming forward. \nSadly, this reluctance to be named is understandable when you look at how powerful politicians strike out against those who do come forward. \nLook at what\u2019s happening in Florida, this time with a Republican, as State Sen. Jack Latvala (who until he was recently removed, wielded an immense amount of power as the senate budget chair) faces accusations of sexual harassment from multiple women. My colleague Brian Burgess at The Capitolist has a detailed story describing efforts by Latvala and his allies to humiliate and punish one of his accusers, outing her to the media despite reassurances from Senate investigators that her name would be kept confidential. \nThe Texas Legislature\u2019s process for reporting harassment seems to offer even less protections than Florida\u2019s. The Texas Tribune did an excellent job in a report last month covering the woeful lack of procedures for reporting harassment, much less ability to actually pursue any meaningful enforcement: \nAs sexual misconduct accusations pile up against men in power across the country, interviews with more than two dozen current and former lawmakers and legislative aides indicate sexual harassment not only is pervasive at the Texas Capitol but also regularly goes unchecked. Most of those interviewed described how men at the Capitol \u2014 some of them lawmakers \u2014 engaged in a wide range of harassment, including degrading comments and gestures, groping and unwanted sexual advances. \nYet not a single formal complaint of sexual harassment has been filed in either the House or Senate since 2011, according to a review of public records and interviews with officials responsible for fielding complaints. Even though sexual harassment policies have been in place for two decades, few employees interviewed by the Tribune even knew they could file a formal complaint. \nHouse Administration Chairman Charlie Geren (R-Fort Worth) refused to answer questions from Tribune reporters about sexual harassment complaints because he claimed he had never received one. Trending A Victory for Gun Rights as the House Passes the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act Brandon Morse \n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about because we don\u2019t have any,\u201d Geren said. \u201cI don\u2019t deal in ifs. When there\u2019s one I\u2019ll handle it. And that\u2019s it.\u201d \nGeren later admitted that there had been \u201ca few\u201d complaints, but they had not been in writing because the women wanted to remain anonymous. He insisted that he had properly investigated these complaints and \u201cresolved\u201d them. \nAfter recent reports by the Tribune and Daily Beast , the Texas House did pass a revised sexual harassment policy , but it still lacks enforcement teeth against actual legislators, and the Texas Senate has not held any hearings to consider revising the policies in their chamber. \nMeanwhile, the women who must continue to walk the halls of the Texas Capitol have resorted to a unique self-help remedy: an anonymous spreadsheet listing male legislators, staffers, lobbyists, consultants, and other politicos who have sexually harassed or assaulted them. \nThe list, titled \u201cBurn Book of Bad Men,\u201d was first publicly reported last month , again by Messer. \n\u201cRebecca\u201d (not her real name), the former legislative staffer who started the Burn Book, told Messer that while they were not seeking retribution against the men on the list, they did want women to be able to warn each other and hoped that if men heard about the existence of the list, it might discourage them from misbehaving. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t have any intention of sharing the list widely,\u201d Rebecca said. \u201cIt just started as a tool for people who are connected to the Texas political sphere to just kind of share with their friends. \n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeking retribution,\u201d she added, before noting: \u201cIt\u2019s a signal for men to understand that we\u2019re keeping tabs on this stuff and we\u2019re talking about it. It doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum and these aren\u2019t isolated incidents. We\u2019re putting them on notice that you\u2019re not going to be able to get away with this stuff without it being shared. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a power thing,\u201d she continued. \u201cTalking about our stories together is a way to take back some of that power.\u201d \nI have personally spoken to multiple other Texas women who have independently confirmed the existence of the Burn Book, although I have not seen it myself. What they described in off the record conversations ranges from the annoying (legislators who claim to be champions of women\u2019s rights but constantly make sexist comments) to horrifying (sexual assaults and date rape drugs). \nNot only do these women have no faith that the Texas Legislature would take any punitive action against their harassers, some of what they described reaches the level of criminal conduct. How much of this reluctance to report is a lack of faith that the criminal justice system would adequately punish these predators, and how much is due to the fear of professional consequences, for being labeled \u201cdifficult,\u201d cannot be determined. \nThe bottom line is that despite social media hashtags and TIME Magazine covers celebrating women coming forward, here we have a group of intelligent professional women who have given up all hope that the system will protect them, and the best they believe they can do right now is warn each other \u201cit\u2019s not safe to be alone with the men on this list.\u201d \nWhat a depressing thought. \nI honestly don\u2019t blame the women; just look at the story of Latvala\u2019s accuser I mentioned above, or how Lauren Greene, who watched her political career disintegrate after she sued Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) for sexual harassment. Greene ended up leaving D.C. and has been unable to find a full time job, taking on temp work and babysitting, plus some financial support from her parents. \nThe tide has slowly been starting to turn regarding sexual harassers and abusers finally facing real consequences \u2014 Harvey Weinstein kicked out of his production company, Kevin Spacey fired and his roles recast, Sen. Al Franken expected to resign this week \u2014 but what hasn\u2019t happened is any real action to protect the women making the accusations. \nA woman who rejects her boss when he propositions her for sex isn\u2019t \u201cdifficult.\u201d A young reporter isn\u2019t a \u201ctroublemaker\u201d if she objects when a legislator gropes and forcibly kisses her. Staffers aren\u2019t \u201cwhining\u201d when they get annoyed that a lobbyist constantly makes sexist, degrading comments. An actress isn\u2019t \u201cuntalented\u201d because she refuses a massage from Harvey Weinstein. \nYou want to support women? Join in TIME\u2019s celebration of the \u201cSilence Breakers\u201d? Fight against the culture that allows such harassment and abuse to fester unchallenged for decades? \n\u2026Then make a real effort to hire and promote the women making these accusations. \nBecause until we stop punishing the victims, the predators will continue to attack. \nFollow Sarah Rumpf on Twitter: @rumpfshaker .

The investment firm submitted the first one soon after Mr Ager-Hanssen claimed Johnston Press was \u201c totally mismanaged\u201d.\nLed by chief executive Ashley Highfield, Johnston Press said yesterday it continues to make good progress with its strategic initiatives.\nWhile trading conditions remain very challenging, the board remains confident full year trading will be in line with its expectations, noted the group.\nIt said the i\u2019s success was based on a clear and successful strategy, which involved \u201cinvesting in improved content \u2026 increased brand awareness, distribution, and advertiser solutions, while delivering efficiencies\u201d.\nA significant investment in the editorial team has brought the head count up to sixty-six.\nThe Saturday offering has been attracting 12,000 additional readers weekly since being relaunched in September.\n\u201cSince acquisition, the Monday to Friday cover price has risen from 40p to 60p, with iweekend now at 80p .... Circulation has remained steady at 266,000,\u201d said the group.\nJohnston Press noted the benefit of contract renegotiation and reductions to inherited costs.\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation averaged \u00a31m monthly from September to November. The i achieved \u00a35.2m EBITDA for the year ended 27 September 2015.\nCirculation was 269,000 in February 2016.

Bride's father gifts plants to guests at wedding Zee News' Pranav Polekar reports that a bride's father - Ramesh Chouhan - gifted potted plants to guests at his daughter's wedding. He also put up posters - spreading awareness about environmental degradation - at the venue. By Zee Media Bureau   12:18 PM IST Comments | Representational image \nNew Delhi: The practice of dowry has long been looked down upon - and rightly so. But what if gifts are given willingly and with the noble intention of spreading awareness about the environment? That is exactly the idea Ramesh Chauhan had when he was planning his daughter's wedding. \nA resident of Ratnagiri's Khed in Maharashtra, Ramesh gifted a potted plant to each guest at the wedding of his daughter - asking them to plant them in soil and help contribute to saving the environment. \"A lot of harm is being done to the environment and (therefore), I decided to gift every guest at the wedding with a potted plant. Each of these plants have the potential to become fruit-bearing trees and it is my small effort to stop environmental degradation in whatever little way possible,\" he said, adding that the plants include mango, sapodilla (chikoo), jackfruit and cashew. \nApart from gifting the plants, Ramesh also put up posters at the wedding venue which urged people to act against environmental degradation. \nState environment minister Ramdas Kadam, who attended the wedding, was visibly impressed with the initiative and said he hoped more such events were organised. \"I feel proud to have come to this wedding. Perhaps this is the first wedding ever in whole of Maharashtra where the massage of planting trees has been spread,\" he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ramdas kadam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramesh chouhan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramesh chauhan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ratnagiri", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "zee media bureau", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maharashtra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khed", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:52.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c4b4b84140d34865d8f43e46169872df6976ca14", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRwNzvz08GNk4jQA62vhytDEhfPdRi36hoV9.jNHEDdxLF5narRXbFBNO42VnAWOTHNTwltWwY5nM1N5BaOIxZ3b10XislYkLRZNtZnxo9meQ--", "site_full": "carpebloom.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://carpebloom.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "APHRODITE HAD LOVE HANDLES by NINA ESTLIN \u2013 carpe bloom", "title": "APHRODITE HAD LOVE HANDLES by NINA ESTLIN", "title_full": "APHRODITE HAD LOVE HANDLES by NINA ESTLIN", "published": "2017-12-07T11:10:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c4b4b84140d34865d8f43e46169872df6976ca14", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRwNzvz08GNk4jQA62vhytDEhfPdRi36hoV9.jNHEDdxLF5narRXbFBNO42VnAWOTHNTwltWwY5nM1N5BaOIxZ3b10XislYkLRZNtZnxo9meQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "carpebloom", "published": "2017-12-07T11:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "APHRODITE HAD LOVE HANDLES by NINA ESTLIN", "text": "{ten things they don\u2019t teach you at thirteen}\ni. \nYou are a matryoshka doll ; a girl full of girls, all of which are you.

(He\u2019ll be waiting for you on the front lawn. You\u2019ll recognise him by the \u2018stache.) \nii. \nYou are allowed to unstack \u2013 more so, you are bound to. If you don\u2019t, how will the dolls in the middle be able to breathe? \nI know, the one at the core is fetally tiny. There is no shame in this. The best things are soft in the middle: think Tootsie Pops and planet earth and the ever-lopsided chocolate cakes your sister used to bake you when your mum was away. \n(She didn\u2019t bake when your dad went out of town. There was not enough flour in the world to do so. Instead, there were mum\u2019s microwave meals or potatoes the size of hand grenades, salty and soggy with tears. It doesn\u2019t matter. You weren\u2019t hungry to begin with.) \n \niii. \nGirls are never hungry, for they\u2019re not made of bones or blood or fat or flesh \u2013 if you were to gash open their bellies, nothing but pastels and pearls would roll out. \nIf girls do eat, they nibble salad minus croutons or jacketed ice cream cones minus ice cream cones. Gnawing on ice cubes, coloured straws or grocery lists is fine as well. \n(Stuff your every orifice with bread when they try to tell you this. You are a steam locomotive, made of machinery . You\u2019ve got places to go and waggons to tow. You won\u2019t see Old Bess lurking dietary milkshakes, will you? You are the Invicta. You are Catch Me Who Can. You are the Lancaster Witch. You are the Fairy Queen. The Fairy Queen had two cylinders and weighed twenty-six long tons. This didn\u2019t make her any less of a fairy nor any less of a queen.) \n\niv. \nYour body may not speak the same language as your sister\u2019s yet \u2013 a language of blotchy cleavages and pimple-popping \u2013 but I beg you to be patient with it. Take your time . You have so much time, dear, my god, you won\u2019t believe how much time you have. \nBut instead you watch your favourite grenade-girl from afar and take hasty notes. Laugh real loud at everything everyone says. Let your skirt ride up your legs. Touch boys\u2019 upper arms and always act a little less intelligent than you actually are. \nYou fail at copying her movements just like you fail at copying beauty tutorials in which already big-breasted ladies try to teach you how to sprinkle eye-shadow in between your nearly non-existent boobs. \nDistress. Distress. You wait for boobs the way one would wait for the train. \nWhen they finally arrive, you spend hours standing on your tippy-toes, squinting into the mirror. \nOh, let me answer this one for you: yes, your right tit is bigger than the other. \nThis is okay. You are okay. I know it may be hard to believe, but your asymmetrical brassiere won\u2019t make the sky come down in shards. \n\nv. \nYou might fall in love with the girl who\u2019s always roller-skating down the street , holding a popsicle that\u2019s dripping down her wrist. Her veins will be the most vulnerable kind of lilac and you will tell yourself you met a girl made of wet watercolour paint. You will forget to ask her for her name at first, so you will baptise her something saccharine sweet, like Rose or Bluebell or Clementine. \nYou might fall in love with the boy you caught playing the harmonica in the park. When he laughs at you, all of the pennies you ever lost will find their way back to your pockets. Use them to buy him raspberry ice cream and tell him stories about your baby brother. \nYou might fall in love with both of them. \nYou might fall in love with neither. \nAll of the above are wonderful things, as long as you also remember to fall in love with old cartoons and the sounds of spring and the peachy fuzz below your belly button and the way your fingers wrinkle when you stay in the bathtub for too long. (The world is such a pretty place, and you are such a pretty part of it.) \n\nvi. \nTake the goddamn compliment. \n\nvii. \nYou remember the time that bluebrowngreygreen-eyed stranger grabbed your butt at a party? (You remember. Of course you do. Sometimes those broad, bony fingers still pry open your skull and all of a sudden it feels as if you\u2019re sitting down on his hands.) \nHe had no right to do so. He had not a single right to do so and you knew, but your sister seemed to find it funny, so you just snorted silly bubbles into your beer and let your secret admirer buy you a drink. \nYou hold the cup like a sceptre until you manage to make your way to the toilet \u2013 excuse me, the ladies\u2019 room, because boys piss but girls tinkle \u2013 where you pour your free drink down the drain. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d the girl next to the hand-dryer frowns.

Other girls\u2019 bodies are no junkyards for you to roam. Don\u2019t you dare slip someone else\u2019s too-broad nose into your purse or braid yourself a shawl out of fizzy hair. \nThere are over three billion girls on earth. \nWouldn\u2019t the world be wonderful if we were all at least a little kind to each other? \n\nx. \nYou will be alright.

IANS   11:16 AM IST Comments | Representational image \nBrasilia: Threatened by hydroelectric projects, pollution and fishing, Amazon pink river dolphins were now being tracked and monitored via satellite, an initiative in the Brazilian region to increase knowledge about a species on which little data exists. \nConsidered to be the \"Ambassadors of the Amazon River\", the freshwater dolphins were included by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in the category of animals about which there is \"insufficient data\", reports Efe news \nNow, a group of governmental and civil organisations, headed by the World Wildlife Fund, have started to monitor the dolphin populations in the Amazon region's rivers in Brazil, Colombia and Bolivia, a project that can help fill the gap in knowledge about the aquatic mammals. \nA select group of 11 dolphins are observed each day by researchers with the aim of registering their travel and activity routes, gathering information about their genetic profile and verifying, among other things, the extent of their contamination with mercury. \nFollowing their activities is possible thanks to the installation of small devices on the dolphins that send real time information about the animals' location several times per day. \n\"It's a pioneer system in Amazonia. It had been done by radio, but this is the first time that it's being done by satellite and thus we're managing to follow the animals in real time,\" Marcelo Oliveira, a conservation expert with WWF Brazil's Amazonia Project, told Efe on Wednesday. \nA total of five dolphins were being followed in Brazil's Tapajos River basin; one in the area between Colombia and Peru and five others in the vicinity of the Madeira River, in Bolivia and Brazil. \nIn addition to mercury contamination, researchers want to analyze the impact of hydroelectric project construction on the dolphins' behaviour. \nIn the Tapajos River basin alone there are 40 hydroelectric projects in the planning stages, the WWF says, and one began operating in October which, researchers say, could affect the animals' habitat and food sources. \nPink dolphins are also under pressure because of local fishing. Dolphin flesh is fatty and attracts \"piracatinga\", a type of commercially exploited catfish, and thus Amazon fishermen often kill the dolphins to use as bait. \nThe WWF estimates that there are between 20,000 and 50,000 dolphins in the Amazon region, although there are huge \"unexplored\" zones in the area and the figure is considered to be untrustworthy.

Loose Ends 2??.\nThere's no cohesion, no logic whatsoever. Free Jimi from Janie's greedy greasy hands.\nMannish Boy\nYawn. Likely an alternate composite to the one on Blues, which wasn't great in the first pace.\nLover Man - Just two weeks before their triumphant New Year's concerts at the Fillmore East in NYC [yielding both 1970's Band Of Gypsys and 2016's sequel Machine Gun], Hendrix gathered with Cox and Miles to cut this dynamic rendition of what had become a favorite concert staple.\nSemi-yawn. Uncirculated and nice to have a Gypsys studio version, but unlikely to better the Fillmore live version.\nStepping Stone - A totally unique take on this Hendrix favorite, with Jimi showcasing both blues and country styled licks atop a relentless, galloping beat.\nHm, might be interesting. Uncirculated, looks like.\n$20 Fine -Stephen Stills joined Jimi, Mitch Mitchell and Buddy Miles Express keyboardist Duane Hitchings at this September 1969 session. With Stephen handling lead vocals and organ, Jimi added multiple guitar parts to this rollicking Stills original.\nThis sounds really cool! Stills is awesome in his own right.\nPower Of Soul - This 1970 studio session came three weeks after the Band Of Gypsys concerts at the Fillmore East. While a live version remains one of the highpoints of Band Of Gypsys, Jimi never released a studio version during his lifetime. For this album, we present the mix that Hendrix and Kramer prepared of the complete song at Electric Lady on August 22, 1970.\nAlready released. Er, this was on the b-side of the EH Somewhere 45.\nJungle - The influence of Curtis Mayfield can be heard here as Jimi expands on the \"Villanova Junction Blues\" theme he made famous by its inclusion in the 1970 Woodstock documentary.\nAlready released. Ugh, this was on Dagger's Morning Symphone Ideas. Unenlightening.\nThings I Used To Do - Jimi is joined for this rendition of Guitar Slim's blues classic by Johnny Winter. Jimi's trademark guitar work and Winter's deft slide playing weaves in and around the foundation set by bassist Billy Cox and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young drummer Dallas Taylor.\nAlready released semi-complete on Lifelines and the full take circullating 20+ years. Johnny rocks, but hard to get excited after hearing the thing for so many years.\nGeorgia Blues - Jimi reunited with some old friends from his pre-Experience days. Lonnie Youngblood, with whom Hendrix played in R&B groups like Curtis Knight & The Squires, voiced this superb twelve bar blues neatly underpinned by Hendrix's sublime rhythm and lead guitar work.\nAlready released on Martin Scorsese Presents\nSweet Angel - With Axis: Bold As Love only just released, Jimi immediately turned his focus to recording what would become Electric Ladyland. This gorgeous, instrumental reading of \"Angel,\", features Jimi on guitar, bass and vibraphone joined by Mitch Mitchell.\nThis sounds like a treat, vibraphone?\nWoodstock - Stephen Stills came to this session fresh from having visited Joni Mitchell, who had a new song that Stills was excited to try and record. Long before CSNY's version, Stephen, Jimi and Buddy Miles recorded this amazing rendition.\nCirculated. All collectors have heard it. Not amazing at all, but nice. Jimi on bass, no guitar.\nSend My Love To Linda - A superb new Hendrix original composition recorded with Cox and Miles in the aftermath of their successful Band Of Gypsys performances at the Fillmore East.\nCirculated. All collectors have heard it, unless they have dug up a different take with vocal.\nCherokee Mist - Together with drummer Mitch Mitchell, Jimi created this moody, evocative original complete with his playing of a sitar to complement his traditional electric guitar.\nAll collectors have heard it since 35+ years. Cool recording that deserves a release though.\nHear My Train A-Comin - (No info listed yet for this song on Amazon)\nHm. Click to expand... I suggest you don't buy it.\nHendrix was one of my very first concert experiences, I was immediately hooked and I'll continue to buy pretty much anything that comes out of the vault until there's nothing left even if it duplicates some weird boot I already own.\nI freaking LOVE this stuff!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:54.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7341760b22499e86dbbb662c5d59e3d82472c15f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB7aVAQaWNrqL2D5XJz_NRY3tCyFmWJNVeykG6dyr4j6mjcesNYw2y2C71HvHvsoPEMckueKDMAcK9sDS2So2mUPqTZYrWDBAVfjF7EJOmijPGqKDo2N4J3Y", "site_full": "forums.stevehoffman.tv", "site": "stevehoffman.tv", "site_section": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/forums/music-corner.2/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Music Corner | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "title": "Jimi Hendrix Both Sides of the Sky - new album coming March 9, 2018 | Page 4", "title_full": "Jimi Hendrix Both Sides of the Sky - new album coming March 9, 2018 | Page 4 | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "published": "2017-12-05T19:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 17, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/data/avatars/m/1/1356.jpg?1505953477", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19660, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9dc53224ac198c7f701c587b8bf27f8e61bfec6b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB7aVAQaWNrqL2D5XJz_NRY3tCyFmWJNVeykG6dyr4j6mjcesNYw2y2C71HvHvsoPEMckueKDMAcK9sDS2So2mUPqTZYrWDBAVfjF7EJOmijPA3xdVM.kOvTIPPLANobKR4-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "bubba-ho-tep", "published": "2017-12-05T20:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "PacificOceanBlue said: \u2191 If that is the cover, it is terrible.

AUTHORS \nI\u2019m a big fan of Peter Swanson , particularly his novel A Kind Worth Killing. I also utterly love Gillian Flynn \u2019s stories and how she weaves crimes, sociopaths and psychopaths in and out of a story with such apparent ease. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of interviewing Tom Rob Smith , author of The Farm and the Child 44 trilogy, a couple of times before for magazines I\u2019ve freelanced at. I\u2019m such a fan of his work and found him inspirational.\n\n\n... FILMS/MOVIES \nMy all time favourite film is the Quentin Tarantino penned, Tony Scott directed, True Romance . I don\u2019t know which film I\u2019ve seen more times, that, Casino or Stand By Me. Other firm favourites include The Mosquito Coast , Terminator 2 , Heathers , My Own Private Idaho and Donnie Darko .\n\n\n... TV DRAMAS \nWhere to begin? The Americans set the bar for this for much of the last decade, but with dramas like Doctor Foster , Sherlock , Peaky Blinders and Line Of Duty , us Brits are fighting back. I\u2019ll opt for some classics like Lost , Mad Men , The Sopranos , and more modern classics that will stand the test of time, including Game Of Thrones , The Bridge and The Walking Dead .\n\n\n... FICTIONAL KILLERS \nIn his more recent books and adaptations, Hannibal Lecter became too much of a caricature, but in both Silence Of The Lambs and Hannibal Rising, Anthony Hopkins was mesmerising. Tony Soprano was also a charismatic killer and Patrick Bateman from American Psycho is one of the all time greatest unreliable narrators, along with Gone Girl\u2019s Amy Dunne.  \n\n... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES  \nDoes Batman count? I\u2019m not really a fan of superheroes but Christopher Nolan\u2019s three Batman movies were just incredible to watch. And I know James Bond is technically a spy, but he has to rely on detective work to get his villains, surely? Miss Marple, Poirot and Sherlock aside, I\u2019m going to choose John Rebus from Ian Rankin\u2019s novels.\n\n\n... MURDER WEAPONS \nMy weapon of choice to write about is a knife. A bullet is boring, strangulation is one-dimensional. But you can be so creative with a knife and a body. In real life, I\u2019m actually a little scared of blades.\n     \n... DEATH SCENES \n(Possible spoiler alert!)  A Kind Worth Killing.\n\nBumping off one of the main characters half the way through a book was so brave. And almost all of the deaths in American Psycho paved the way for acceptable gore.  \n... BLOGS/WEBSITES \nMy most visited are social media pages like Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . For news, I\u2019ll go to The Guardian and then Mail Online . Digital Spy will give me my television news fix while I\u2019ll spend a fortune surfing Amazon instead of writing!\n\n\n... WRITING TIPS \nRead everything you write out loud afterwards. Reading in your head will sound nothing like it does when you say those words aloud.\n\n\n... WRITING SNACKS \nMy partner has to hide the chocolate when I\u2019m working at home or I\u2019ll just eat my way through every cube of it in the house. I\u2019m like a child; I have no self-control when sweet things are in my grasp. Actually it\u2019s anything with sugar in it. I once wiped through a tube of chocolate cake decorations I found in the cupboard just because they were there.      \n\nAbout JOHN MARRS \nJohn Marrs is a freelance journalist based in London, England, who has spent the last 20 years interviewing celebrities from the world of television, film and music for national newspapers and magazines. He has written for publications including The Guardian\u2019s Guide and Guardian Online; OK! Magazine; Total Film; Empire; Q; GT; The Independent; Star; Reveal; Company; Daily Star and News of the World\u2019s Sunday Magazine. His debut novel, The Wronged Sons, was released in 2013 and in May 2015, he released his second book, Welcome To Wherever You Are. In May 2017 came his third book, The One. It was chosen as the book of the month for BBC Radio 2\u2019s Book Club. The Wronged Sons was re-edited and re-released in July 2017 under a new title, When You Disappeared. And his fourth book, The Good Samaritan, was released in December 2017. \nFind John Marrs on his Facebook  page  and on Twitter -  @johnmarrs1 \n\nAbout THE GOOD SAMARITAN \n\nPublisher's description She\u2019s a friendly voice on the phone. But can you trust her? The people who call End of the Line need hope. They need reassurance that life is worth living. But some are unlucky enough to get through to Laura. Laura doesn\u2019t want them to hope. She wants them to die. Laura hasn\u2019t had it easy: she\u2019s survived sickness and a difficult marriage only to find herself heading for forty, unsettled and angry. She doesn\u2019t love talking to people worse off than she is. She   craves   it. But now someone\u2019s on to her\u2014Ryan, whose world falls apart when his pregnant wife ends her life, hand in hand with a stranger. Who was this man, and why did they choose to die together? The sinister truth is within Ryan\u2019s grasp, but he has no idea of the desperate lengths Laura will go to\u2026 Because the best thing about being a Good Samaritan is that you can get away with murder. \nThe Good Samaritan was published by Thomas & Mercer on 1 december 2017. \n\nLook out for more  BEST OF CRIME  features coming soon. \n\nClick  here  to read more  BEST OF CRIME  features. \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john marrs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john marrs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john marrs  john marrs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher nolan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james bond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gillian flynn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy dunne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john rebus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ian rankin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony soprano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donnie darko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "batman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter swanson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony hopkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick bateman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sherlock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hannibal lecter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony scott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom rob smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quentin tarantino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poirot", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bbc radio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas & mercer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daily star", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the mosquito coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american psycho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ok! magazine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idaho", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:54.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d9c28cec897f7a6d27dc8d955944c40dfb4d0662", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.X9wEz8JAlfO4kuwrFTOrYCyhsxe05Fnr969HpacS4.s5KkJUqGJDvpKzO3lauigW.PfVEdu.bfvw--", "site_full": "keeperofstories.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://keeperofstories.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "KeeperofStories", "title": "Full of LIFE.", "title_full": "Full of LIFE.", "published": "2017-12-07T10:10:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d9c28cec897f7a6d27dc8d955944c40dfb4d0662", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.X9wEz8JAlfO4kuwrFTOrYCyhsxe05Fnr969HpacS4.s5KkJUqGJDvpKzO3lauigW.PfVEdu.bfvw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dawn Wolf (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "Full of LIFE.", "text": "\n\nnaked Black woman, Bria Angelique in purple light. \n\n\n\nNative woman's introspective beauty of form and face.

We finished precisely 7 games below .500. We finished 19th. You're pretending Willis is serviceable when the statistics suggest he is responsible for the difference between a mid-table .500 finish (nothing to write home about, maybe not even playoffs -- although seeds 4-6 were precisely .500 last season -- but not embarrassing) and what instead happened, 19th.\nI believe I already threw out some stats showing how significant the drop off was this season when Willis came in. You can no longer blame the team this year. Deric had a 1.19 GAA this season, Willis 1.75. Deric made 69.7% saves, Willis 54.8%. In a season where the team overall (mostly Deric) won 3 more than it lost, Willis lost one more than he won (playing nearly a quarter of the starts. The team in front of him is not suddenly worse. The keeper is.\nNor did he save the team he was on before, DC, from being a joke. The argument goes that he was saddled with a crap team. Well, logical implication of that is he doesn't lift the team one bit from where it is, while a player like Deric can somehow manage a low GAA and even record behind the same team. Is the excuse that as a backup he gets to suck? Then let's throw out performance pretensions and just say we expect nothing.\nAmong keepers with fewer than 20 and more than 1 starts, the GAA rank is:\nGuzan ATL 0.71\nIrwin TOR 0.83\nMacMath COL 1.33\nKann ATL 1.39\nReynish ATL 1.50\nAttinella POR 1.54\nSeitz DAL 1.60\nMcCarthy PHI 1.63\nDykstra SKC 1.67\nWillis HOU 1.75\nKnighton NER 1.83\nKempin LAG 1.86\nRowe LAG 1.92\nSanchez CHI 2.00\nJohansen NYC 2.00\nDiop LAG 2.07\nClark DCU 2.20\nTarbell SJE 2.27\nCrepeau MTL 2.67\nWorra DCU 2.80\nMiller SEA 3.00\nVan Oekel RSL 3.67\nAlvbage MIN 5.00\nDykstra is ahead of Willis in GAA and save %, you act like Dykstra killed them and leave out the part where Willis ships 6 goals in 3 playoff games and loses more than he wins on a 4 seed that as a team won 3 more than it lost. You seem to be pulling back from the obvious implications rather than applying your \"better than Dykstra\" wishes to the free agent market as you should. If Dykstra is insufficient then Willis, statistically worse than him, should also be. We should then be looking to move up the \"subs\" table and not stand pat.\nBluntly, to me, it's just the usual \"devil we know\" rhetoric that for years was thrown behind Bruin. I think he's pretty sh*tty and more to the point, at a game below .500 in a playoff year, you could not even expect him to take a decent team on his back and limp back to the postseason. After making the Dykstra comment why wouldn't you apply that standard to us and say if I sign this guy backup and he plays, we're screwed, I should sign someone else just to take the chance that there is a chance of a positive outcome if the starter is hurt, and not basically a Tom Savage trudge to the inevitable. To me you're basically advocating a heavy bet the starter never sees the field because you accepted poor backup performance.

When will the first weddings happen? \nThe bill will require royal assent from Governor-General Peter Cosgrove, in what is considered a formality. \nSame-sex couples will then be allowed to register to marry.

(December 7)\nMedia: Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray \u2014 and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer.\nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year?\nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat \u2014 overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment.\nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms \u2014 known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" \u2014 with standard two-dimensional digital mammography.\nPhoto: AP Image 1 of / 1   1 In this Nov. 21, 2017 photo provided by the Montefiore Health System, Dr. Tova Koenigsberg at The Montefiore Einstein Center for Cancer Care in New York shows an example of a traditional mammogram scan.

U.S. ... more Photo: AP Are 3-D mammograms really better? US puts scans to the test 1  /  1 Back to Gallery The 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers.\n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most.\nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices.\n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\"\nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM?\nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.)\nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40.\nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, though it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram.\nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening.\nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS?\nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles \u2014 not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet the standard of care in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer.\nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts.\nHOW TO DECIDE?\nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer.\nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image.\nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death \u2014 but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening \u2014 that overdiagnosis problem.\nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost.\nTHE NEW STUDY\nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year.\nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening.\n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens.\n___\nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.
