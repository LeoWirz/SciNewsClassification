The Deputy commissioner added that two cases of robberies have been registered against the gang. The CCTV footage is from one of the places where they broke into a house. \nA screengrab showing the faces of the members have been made public and the police have urged the people to provide any information about the gang. \nOneIndia News", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vishwa prasad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cyberabad", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cctv", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "oneindia news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kukatpally housing board", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hyderabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maharashtra", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:35.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a35e4f8cd471632a67a186a7de980c3be2b6e11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Qb6m4ieU933VNDrmxMoS4bE791oP_nRT7Qlw_KGB9RJwgS8jr19BXtYme5XTHMIyUCXn23hRc53SXVU9LtOGOc84QO.twb6Fx0ChYEA27LRP2WsxmG.CZr8aI.j6zCPzSL47MI_u1I3rPVWg_oSVY6x0SU_zfC1X4Mc19TCEcYg--", "site_full": "www.deccanchronicle.com", "site": "deccanchronicle.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Watch: Video of Bengal cop dancing goes viral, officer suspended", "title_full": "Watch: Video of Bengal cop dancing goes viral, officer suspended", "published": "2017-12-07T14:44:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.768, "main_image": "https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images.deccanchronicle.com/dc-Cover-qg6oq7ul8kvtur9k6tbhlsfc91-20171207144029.Medi.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4381, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 6, "comments": 0, "shares": 6}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3a35e4f8cd471632a67a186a7de980c3be2b6e11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Qb6m4ieU933VNDrmxMoS4bE791oP_nRT7Qlw_KGB9RJwgS8jr19BXtYme5XTHMIyUCXn23hRc53SXVU9LtOGOc84QO.twb6Fx0ChYEA27LRP2WsxmG.CZr8aI.j6zCPzSL47MI_u1I3rPVWg_oSVY6x0SU_zfC1X4Mc19TCEcYg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T14:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "Watch: Video of Bengal cop dancing goes viral, officer suspended", "text": "Mondal was celebrating his transfer to the Chittaranjan police station.

And a Bengal sub-inspector has been suspended from duty after a video of him dancing to a Bollywood song went viral on the internet. While it proved enough fodder for smiles online, it seems his seniors were not too happy with his antics.\nThe officer, Krishna Sadhan Mondal, who worked at the Hirapur police station, Asansol, West Bengal, was on duty when the video was shot.\nIt turns out that Mondal was celebrating his transfer to the Chittaranjan police station and can be seen swaying to music in front of two women who are sitting in the police station.\nAfter the video went viral, a departmental inquiry against the sub-inspector was initiated.

I tried building the kernel outside of Yocto and was able to eventually get it working.\nI made and installed two SDK's, one with debug options enable in the local.conf mentioned above and one without. After running the environment-setup script for the debug SDK I echo'd my CFLAGS variable. It had a -O (which goes to a -O1) in it so I appended a -O0. I copied over my .config and ran make. This didn't work, the kernel object was still being compiled with -O2.\nEventually I added the following line to the Makefile in the directory with the kernel module.\nCFLAGS_imx_rpmsg_tty.o := -O0 After adding that, the module compiled with -O0 and the debugging experience was fixed. Interestingly it also worked when I used the environment-setup script for the regular SDK.\nAt this point I guess I still have a few questions:\nIs this an appropriate way to modify a Makefile and was it the right Makefile to modify? Could I make a similar change in Yocto so that we could trigger a system wide debug build? This process involved quite a few manual steps that wouldn't be ideal for a development cycle. And still the original question, is there a way to set the optimization level of a kernel module with Yocto variables or settings?\nThank you,\nJames", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www2.keil.com/docs/default-source/default-document-library/gs_ds-mdk_5_27_r1.pdf?sfvrsn=2"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:35.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "23a5a2350375d29b7ca56256e24b338059c5a2a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsKwQ8dgA6TtKLhimg0c0wM4A2edPhYZ8jLg--", "site_full": "community.nxp.com", "site": "nxp.com", "site_section": "https://community.nxp.com/content?start=60", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Browse - Content | NXP Community", "title": "Change Yocto Project Kernel Compile Optimizatio...", "title_full": "Change Yocto Project Kernel Compile Optimizatio... | NXP Community", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 15430, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "859778a5a3429f4f62e0e4cd8d9a98745c013313", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsKwQ8dgA6TtKLhimg0c0wM4A43tOWMdOM_Hj16ewCsVT5", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Yuri Muhin", "published": "2017-12-07T05:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hello,\n Please try to build k ernel without Yocto:\nHow to build U-Boot, Kernel and Linux application(s) without Yocto\nHave a great day,\nYuri\nNote: If this post answers your question, please click the Correct Answer button.

Vijay Rupani \nEarlier known as Rajkot-II, the seat is considered as 'safe' for the saffron party which has been representing it since 1985. \nThe constituency goes to polls on December 9 in the first phase of the high-stakes Gujarat elections. \nVajubhai Vala, incumbent Governor of Karnataka, had won the seat seven times for the BJP - from 1985 to 2012. In 1985, he had defeated Harshadba Chudasama. \nVala vacated the seat for Narendra Modi in 2002 after the latter was then nominated as the chief minister. Later, when Modi moved to Maninagar constituency, Vala continued his undefeated run till 2012. \nLater, after Vala was shifted to Karnataka, Vijay Rupani won the bypoll from the seat in 2014. \nThough Rajkot-West is a stronghold of the RSS, the Congress has mounted a strong challenge by bringing in Rajyaguru, the sitting MLA from Rajkot-East, to rework the caste combination in the party's favour. \nTo retain his seat, Rupani has to surmount the angry Patidars as well as the trading community, which is smarting under the impact of demonetisation and rollout of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). \nOut of 3.15 lakh voters in the constituency, the number of Kadva and Leuva Patidars is the highest at 62,000, followed by Brahmins, Lohana and Jain communities. \nThe Congress is trying to direct the simmering anger among Patidars over lack of reservation in education and government jobs under the BJP rule against Rupani. \nThe quota agitation and Hardik Patel joining hands with Congress may dent the BJP's base among the Patidars, who till now were considered as the bedrock of the BJP's support base in Gujarat. \nCongress nominee Rajyaguru, the richest candidate in Gujarat elections, believes that he has won the \"initial battle\" against Rupani by keeping him busy in the constituency since the poll schedule was announced. \n\"I wanted to keep the chief minister busy in Rajkot-West constituency and morally I have won the initial battle as the chief minister has to visit his constituency more than once in a week,\" Rajyaguru claimed. \nHowever, Rupani has been unfazed and is confidant of his victory. \nHe earlier cited the work done by him for the people of the state as well as his constituency, especially bringing the Narmada river water to Rajkot. \nRupani had said that he was not facing any challenge in Rajkot West as it is a traditional bastion of the BJP. \n\"I will win the seat easily,\" he had told PTI in an interview recently. \nBJP's Saurashtra and Kutch spokesperson Raju Dhruv said that Rupani has always been ready to solve the problems faced by the people of Rajkot or elsewhere in Gujarat. \n\"As the CM, he has done well and because of his tireless efforts, Rajkot could get the Narmada water in less than five years of the project announced by then chief minister Narendra Modiji,\" Dhruv said. \nThe 182-member Gujarat Assembly will go to the polls in two phases on December 9 and 14 and the counting of votes will be taken up on December 18. \nPTI", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dhruv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harshadba chudasama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narendra modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hardik patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vajubhai vala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patidars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajyaguru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narendra modiji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lohana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leuva patidars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vijay rupani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rupani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raju dhruv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gujarat assembly", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "rajkot-west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gujarat assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajkot west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saurashtra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gujarat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karnataka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narmada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajyaguru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kadva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kutch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maninagar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajkot-east", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:36.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1c4af23e2a5e14d9b6651baefdcaac4e49fb0586", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTrW.d8EQuFmA67r06v1CYLcUqgla2LSwuHRLO9PBjttCGIGgOjj0Ur", "site_full": "www.demonoid.pw", "site": "demonoid.pw", "site_section": "https://www.demonoid.pw/rss/0.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Demonoid -

Food For Thought On Running A Restaurant Well. \nDecember 6, 2017 by Staff   Restaurants are becoming an increasingly popular business model. Whilst it may come with a higher risk than other industries, there\u2019s something inspirational and motivational about the idea of running a popular restaurant. And there\u2019s no denying that standing behind the bar in your cozy little establishment as you watch locals (and perhaps a few newcomers) pour in is a very appealing idea. Of course, you\u2019re likely not the first person to have the idea of opening up your restaurant in your local area; you\u2019re probably not the first person to open up a restaurant within a few hundred yards of your block . So many people want that idyllic family-run business. \nDoes that mean you\u2019ve got competition? Well, not if you see yourself as an entrepreneur. You see, many people open a restaurant without preparing themselves for the business-side of owning and running such an establishment. You need to not only love food and dealing with people but also have the intuition necessary to deal with the technical of running a business. At the end of the day, no matter how you dress up your restaurant, that\u2019s what it is: a business. You need to pull in revenue to keep people coming. And if you\u2019re not sure as to whether you\u2019re doing enough to make that happen then here\u2019s some food for thought on running your restaurant well. \nOrganize your finances. \nMaybe you\u2019ve already got a few regulars who come in for meals or the odd evening drink. That\u2019s great; you\u2019ve already got steady sales coming in. And if your restaurant is already in full flow then you\u2019ve most likely sorted out deals with companies who will supply your stock. Understanding this chain of service is crucial to running a business but it doesn\u2019t mean that your restaurant is as organized as it could be. You\u2019re making a profit but are you investing that profit efficiently? You need to make a detailed budget that you update weekly or monthly. Weigh up your profits against a list of necessary expenditures (e.g. paying utility bills keeps the lights on and the water running). When it comes to your \u201cexcess\u201d profits, you need to invest those well. What improvements does your restaurant need? You need to pour your earnings back into your business to help improve it; otherwise, it\u2019ll end up becoming old, neglected, and unappealing to customers. \nAnd think about ways in which you can reduce costs so that your business has more money to spend on the things that matter. Obviously, as mentioned above, some expenditures are necessary. You can\u2019t turn off the lights or the water supply. But you can find ways to reduce your costs without negatively affecting your business. In fact, reducing costs can sometimes improve your business. You could become more eco-friendly; energy-efficient appliances in the kitchen or behind the bar could save you money on your monthly utility bill. You could also insulate the walls and get thicker windows to reduce the amount of energy you need to generate to keep your restaurant warm. \nLead your team to success. \nA strong restaurant requires a strong leader. You might have appointed a manager to help keep things in order during working hours but you still own this establishment. It\u2019s up to you to keep everything in order and lead your team to success. The manager will still look to you for guidance as to the direction in which you\u2019re going to take your business. Make sure you hold regular meetings so that everybody in the workforce knows their role and what is expected of them in terms of customer service and the standard of the product (food) they deliver. This is also important because employees need to see the face of their boss so as to be reminded of the chain of command and that you\u2019re overseeing everything. Remember, it\u2019s a business at the end of the day; that will be reiterated throughout this article. \nYou should read these 15 restaurant management tips to improve the way you work . Positivity, transparency, and stability are all examples of traits you need to possess as the manager\u2019s manager and the boss of all your staff members. It\u2019s vital to be more than simply the owner of the establishment. You need to be a leader for the people who work there because it\u2019s the team working in the kitchen, serving behind the bar, and waiting on tables that determines the success of your restaurant. If you want to keep things running well in your establishment then you need to lead your team well so that they know what they\u2019re supposed to be doing. Still, there\u2019s only so much you can do to help\u2026 \nHire the right people. \nOf course, being a good leader can only take your restaurant so far. In order for your management techniques to work, the people you\u2019re managing need to be motivated and efficient workers. Obviously, working in the food industry can be a struggle at times; it isn\u2019t always pleasant to work long hours and deal with excessive amounts of people (many of whom like to complain even if nothing is wrong). The customer is always right but this is one of the most full-on customer-facing roles on the planet, so you need to be sure that you\u2019ve hired the right people. \nHiring millennial staff can help your restaurant on so many levels. Despite the bad press this entire generation often receives, millennials are much more likely to work harder; they\u2019re young and, given the climate of the current market has severely affected young people, the opportunity to earn money in a stable job role is something they won\u2019t take for granted. Of course, it\u2019s not just about hiring hard workers; it\u2019s about hiring people who give your restaurant the right image. Whilst it\u2019s important to have members of staff with years of experience on their side, your restaurant could appeal to younger people if its workforce was more varied in age. Hiring millennials could help your restaurant target those younger customers. They\u2019ll give your establishment most vibrancy. \nLearn to delegate. \nWhen you start your business, you might be working with only a few others to turn this quaint little establishment into an empire. Of course, as demand grows, your business will need to supply the resources and staff to meet this increase in customers. It\u2019s important to learn to delegate because you won\u2019t be able to do everything on your own . Many people start restaurants if they\u2019re a chef, for example, but you need to remember that you\u2019ll be a boss first and foremost. You can\u2019t oversee your business and be in the kitchen for a 10-hour shift; you\u2019ll be stretching yourself too thin. It\u2019s important to learn when to stop and say \u201cI have to leave this work to my members of staff.\u201d \nIt\u2019s all about evolution. You\u2019re learning how to put your restaurant-based talents to use, whether those involve cooking or providing excellent customer service to diners, but you\u2019re also learning how to become a smart businessperson. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still spend a little time in the kitchen helping to prepare food or a little time behind the bar helping to serve customers during busy hours, but you need to have confidence in your staff so that you can delegate certain responsibilities and find time to check the books or oversee the restaurant as a whole to retain your image as the \u201cleader\u201d figure (we discussed that earlier). \nThink of the customer. \nYou know the customer is always right; that\u2019s \u201cbusiness lesson 101\u201d. Of course, you really need to ask yourself whether your restaurant is providing enough to completely satisfy the customer if you want it to truly run well. A few bad reviews can really ruin a restaurant\u2019s reputation and that\u2019s a heavy blow in this industry; people often Google restaurants before visiting them and they might be put off by a few bad ratings. \nThat\u2019s why you need to do all you can to gear your restaurant\u2019s service towards pleasing the customer. Think about your target market and make sure the menu suits them . For example, a lunchtime menu might serve coffee and baked goods along with light lunch meals whereas the evening menu needs to step up its game and serve more substantial dishes. Obviously, the vibe of your restaurant is important too. Is it upscale dining or casual dining? You need to think about the type of customer you\u2019re attracting and make sure you deliver the exact service they\u2019d expect or better. No restaurant is universal; if you want your restaurant to survive beyond its first year then you need to realize that. \nFind your gap in the market. \nRemember, your restaurant is a business. Have you taken that in after reading this article? Like any other business, you need to stand out from the competition if you want to survive . The best way to do that is to add a twist to your restaurant that makes it appealing to customers in your area because there are likely dozens of other restaurants within walking distance of your own establishment. What will make hungry diners choose your restaurant over the competition? A selling point could be something as simple as a great deal; you could offer 2 meals for the price of 1 when people dine as a couple.

Broadly speaking, we can\ndefine Bioinformatics as a field concerned with the creation/engineering of\ntools (e.g. algorithms, databases) that solve problems based on biological\ndata, while Computational Biology is concerned with the (scientific) study\nof biology using computational techniques with the goal to learn new\nbiology and knowledge about living systems (Russ Altman). Finally,\nComputational Biomedical Engineering is an emerging research field\nconcerned with the development of software and hardware tools to ultimately\nenhance human health.\nBioinformatics, and Computational Biology and Biomedical Engineering are\nfields in which challenges and issues can often be formulated as\noptimization problems subject to multiple conflicting objectives. Such\nmultiobjective optimization problems span from traditional problems, such\nas the optimization of biochemical processes, construction of gene\nregulatory networks, protein structure alignment and prediction, to more\nmodern problems, such as big data analysis of healthcare data, and medical\nimaging and pattern recognition.\nThe main aim of this special session is to bring together both experts and\nnew-comers working on Multiobjective Optimization in Bioinformatics,\nComputational Biology and Biomedical Engineering to discuss new and\nexciting issues in this area.\nWe encourage submission of methodology papers describing new challenges and\noptimization techniques as well as application papers discussing the power\nand applicability of these novel methods to multiobjective problems in\nBioinformatics, Computational Biology and Biomedical Engineering. You are\ninvited to submit papers that are unpublished original work for this special\nsession at IEEE CIBCB 2018. Topics include, but are not limited to,\n\u2022 Multiobjective optimization techniques for problems in\nBioinformatics, Computational Biology and Biomedical Engineering (BCBBE)\n\u2022 Evolutionary algorithms\n\u2022 Swarm Intelligence\n\u2022 Metaheuristics\n\u2022 Fuzzy optimization\n\u2022 Surrogate-based methods\n\u2022 Hybrid optimization algorithms (combinations of\nheuristics and exact methods)\n\u2022 Preference-based methods\n\u2022 Tuning of multiobjective optimization and decision-making\ntechniques for problems in BCBBE\n\u2022 Performance measures\n\u2022 Test and benchmark problems\n\u2022 Visualization techniques\n\u2022 Optimization and visualization software\n\u2022 Applications of multiobjective optimization techniques in BCBBE\n\u2022 Gene expression array analysis\n\u2022 Structure prediction and folding\n\u2022 MicroRNA analysis\n\u2022 Biological network reconstruction\n\u2022 Signal and image processing\n\u2022 Medical imaging and pattern recognition\n\u2022 Biomakers\n\u2022 Further prominent and emerging topics in multiobjective optimization\nin BCBBE\n\u2022 Scaling up from lab-based work to commerical manufacture\n\u2022 Challenging problem features (e.g. many decision\nvariables, dynamic problems, uncertainty, expensive and limited\nevaluations, etc)\n\u2022 Closed-loop applications and challenges\n\u2022 Multiobjective data mining\n\u2022 Predictive fitness landscape design\n\u2022 Many-objective optimization\n\u2022 Side effect machines and other kernal representations for\nsequence analysis\n\u2022 Ecoinformatics\n\u2022 Visual analytics\n\u2022 Data modelling/mining, and Big Data analytics\nSubmission instructions\nWe welcome original contributions describing ongoing projects or completed\nwork.

As of now it is uncertain whether the aviation department has officially initiated a probe into the matter. \nThe situation becomes tense with some of the pilots accusing Civil Aviation of gross negligence about their complaints while the whole situation erupted in the first place due to insufficient attendance or monitoring from the authority on local airline operations. \nTourism Minister in his speech on Wednesday to commemorate Civil Aviation Day had confirmed of implementing international flight and operation standards to avoid pilot fatigue and long working hours. However this was not detailed by him. \nMeanwhile Maldivian Airline had addressed their side of justification stating that the issue was raised by a handful of pilots, that too not through a formally recognized channel of complaint registering. The airline also claimed the changes to working hours were brought and implemented abiding the Civil Aviation regulations. \nThe national airline also claims their newly implemented regulations and conduct would not compromise the safety of its operations. \nThough Civil Aviation refuses to comment and Maldivian claims the situation was raised by few pilots it has come to the attention of several local media the petition filed had more than 10 pilot signatures reflecting their concern. \nInterestingly an audio clip of a heated argument between a pilot and a senior official of Maldivian has made waves across social platforms.
