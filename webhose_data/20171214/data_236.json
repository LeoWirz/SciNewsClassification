It is the securitisation/financialisation of the self, the expansion of the value-form into the self and the self's harmonisation with social forms of value creation. While liberal democracies have expanded the range of permitted identities, the way that these previously ostracised identities have been brought into capitalist social reproduction forces individuals into fetishised identities that obey the laws of capital. The true freedom therefore rests in destroying this shadow identity sector that catalogues and moulds amorphous reality and fluid selves into the mythic 'rational economic agent'.

In this day and age there is much in question, and numerous decisions are displayed to us every day about who to tune in to, and where to put our consideration, time, and trust.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nYou can find a summary of the benefits you get when you consult a spiritual guide Vancouver CA area at http://www.floweroflifesoulreading.com right now. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kathleen fox", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "source energy", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vancouver ca", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:55.106+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9bea0d5fa3592d0a221b7ddc18c45879d3d9e1a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21RUMgvm8XZKhZTTitxesAUyy60on5LnhB4kvxcLcfaA0I6cf5mzfbujw2hdod_BrFeCbAua8y5Ls5XYgWZjjiqs4lwsjsq9IOsVEJfejNZgLcw_pyJOqHtM", "site_full": "assignmenteditor.com", "site": "assignmenteditor.com", "site_section": "http://assignmenteditor.com/pr-newswire-3/?filter=1673", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Assignmenteditor - PR Newswire - Assignment Editor", "title": "Tresiba\u00ae Reduces Hypoglycaemia Regardless of Blood Sugar Level", "title_full": "Tresiba\u00ae Reduces Hypoglycaemia Regardless of Blood Sugar Level", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.011, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9bea0d5fa3592d0a221b7ddc18c45879d3d9e1a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21RUMgvm8XZKhZTTitxesAUyy60on5LnhB4kvxcLcfaA0I6cf5mzfbujw2hdod_BrFeCbAua8y5Ls5XYgWZjjiqs4lwsjsq9IOsVEJfejNZgLcw_pyJOqHtM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "prnewswire.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Tresiba\u00ae Reduces Hypoglycaemia Regardless of Blood Sugar Level", "text": "Tresiba\u00ae Reduces Hypoglycaemia Regardless of Blood Sugar Level ABU DHABI , UAE, December\nPeople with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes treated with Tresiba \u00ae had fewer episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) compared with people on insulin glargine U100 regardless of whether they had achieved blood sugar targets. [1] These new post-hoc analyses from the SWITCH 1 and 2 trials were presented at the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Annual Congress in Abu Dhabi today. [2],[3]\n\"Achieving target blood sugar levels can be a constant challenge for people with diabetes treated with insulin, and this is made even more complex by the risk of hypoglycaemia,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen , executive vice president and chief science officer at Novo Nordisk. \"Tresiba \u00ae has consistently been shown to provide stable blood sugar control while at the same time reducing hypoglycaemia compared with insulin glargine U100; it is very encouraging to see that treatment with Tresiba \u00ae helps people to achieve blood sugar control with fewer episodes of hypoglycaemia regardless of their blood sugar levels in this analysis.\"\nThe findings of these analyses are consistent with the results of the main SWITCH trials which demonstrated significantly lower rates of overall symptomatic hypoglycaemia versus insulin glargine U100 in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. [ 2],[ 3]\nAbout hypoglycaemia\nHypoglycaemia occurs when blood sugar levels are too low and cannot provide the body's organs with the energy they need. Hypoglycaemia can cause a range of symptoms including confusion, trembling, sweating, increased heart rate, difficulty with concentration and/or speech and in severe cases can lead to a seizure or coma. [4]-[6] Severe hypoglycaemia can cause extensive damage to the body and is significantly associated with cardiovascular death. [7] Every month, 46.5% of people with type 2 diabetes and 83.0% of people with type 1 diabetes experience a hypoglycaemic episode. [8]\nAbout the new analys e s\nThe analyses, based on the recent SWITCH trials, separated people into two groups depending on whether they had achieved target blood sugar levels (defined as HbA 1c of 7.0% or less) during the maintenance period of the trial. [1] Target blood sugar levels are those recommended by the joint guidelines of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. [9]\nAbout SWITCH 1 and 2\nSWITCH 1 and SWITCH 2 were two phase 3b , 64-week, double-blind, randomised, treat-to-target, 2-period crossover trials that investigated the hypoglycaemia profile of Tresiba \u00ae compared with insulin glargine U100 in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. The trial design included a titration period in which the doses of study treatments (Tresiba \u00ae or insulin degludec U100) were gradually increased over a 16 week period, followed by a 16 week maintenance period during which a constant dose of study treatment was maintained. [2] ,[ 3] The primary endpoint was the number of severe or blood glucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes observed in participants during the maintenance period. [2] ,[ 3]\nAbout Tresiba \u00ae\nTresiba \u00ae (insulin degludec) is a once-daily basal insulin that provides a duration of action beyond 42 hours with a flat and stable glucose-lowering effect. [10] ,[ 11] It has been shown to provide a lower risk of overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia, and low variability in blood glucose levels versus insulin glargine U100. [11] ,[ 12] Tresiba \u00ae received its first regulatory approval in September 2012 and has since been approved in more than 80 countries globally. It is now commercially available in more than 50 countries.\nAbout Novo Nordisk\nNovo Nordisk is a global healthcare company with more than 90 years of innovation and leadership in diabetes care.

In the modern age with all in the information that seems somewhat silly, but the reality is that Brexit has put pressure on prices just before Christmas and while normally a high interest rate in recent times has been attractive to trades, in this case it was certainly not. One thing that is not clear is if inflation will continue to keep pressure on the UK economy, as most of it was prescribed to falls in the exchange rate in recent times. However, since the exchange rate has recovered and has moved to be more stable. I believe that inflation will likely taper off, unless we see some disastrous Brexit news in the short term. It's also likely that if inflation does persist, an interest rate hike will certainly be on the cards in the near future.\nFor the GBPUSD it has been a simple slide back lower and this marks the third straight day of losses after so much enthusiasm for the Brexit deal - which David has seemingly commented on not being law causing feathers to ruffle in Brussels. If we are to see further falls then my eyes would be on the key support levels at 1.3256 and 1.3220 which will be a key area; namely because of the 200 day moving average charging up the charts but also the bullish trend line which is also in place. This key level would build a strong case for the bulls to fight back if there were many left in the market. In the event that we do tick back upwards off some positive news and renewed optimism in the pound, then 1.3393 and 1.3438 are going to be the first major levels of interest to trades on the rise.\nSome other positive news has been the Tax bill, with murmurings out of the Senate that revisions have been made and could in theory rush through and get on the president's desk by Christmas. This would be a big surprise if it turned up in the coming week, as expectations are that it would take some time. One clear winner of all of this though has been the S&P500 which continues to climb up the charts and is making new ground.\nSo far resistance levels are looking like the usual candidates, with psychological levels at 2675 and 2700 likely to be the pausing points at present. Support can also be found around 2652 and 2631, but the bears are very scarce when it comes to pressure on the S&P500 at present - especially with the tax bill in tow. It's easy to say that equity markets could be overvalued, but at the present time the markets seem keen to keep on pushing.\nMore Info Here\nFXTM www.forextime.com | Facebook: www.facebook.com/FXTMid/ | Twitter : www.twitter.com/FXTMid\n\u2713Traders from 156 countries | \u271313 international awards | \u271316 secure payment methods | \u271325 languages supported \u200b", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/FXTMid", "https://www.forextime.com/images/maa/usdcaddaily_40.png?itok=M-QghHPZ", "http://www.forextime.com/", "http://www.imghost.in/images/2017/12/07/shutterstock_444206605.jpg", "http://www.forextime.com/market-analysis", "http://facebook.com/FXTMid/", "https://www.forextime.com/images/maa/crudedaily_42.png?itok=EY3vSxFD"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:57.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7c80220b11b18fbd12b3a8424010921957c2feb6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kVvxTIQP0LAr9OW0uER2E2BAGoROFo0Z7NaabrDax0hJWYxRsvxyiDU58sCboK4VfJhCGi3e71WYlwzvXuI66D8DSpYUoj.E-", "site_full": "www.diynot.com", "site": "diynot.com", "site_section": "https://www.diynot.com/diy/forums/general-discussion/", "site_categories": ["home_and_garden", "home_repair"], "section_title": "General Discussion | DIYnot Forums", "title": "Reckon this is really her owner ?", "title_full": "Reckon this is really her owner ? | DIYnot Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T02:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.044, "main_image": "https://i.diynot.com/diynot.og.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 37067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "800933e5eb5cb010f53b14d227d743851e55f844", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kVvxTIQP0LAr9OW0uER2E2BAGoROFo0Z7NaabrDax0hJWYxRsvxyiDU58sCboK4VfJhCGi3e71WYlwzvXuI6669eyqeXG1N1Lxoymdrg0RQ--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "wannabeDIY", "published": "2017-12-07T10:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "gasbanni said: \u2191 YOU CAN'T HELP YOU SELF CAN YOU !

Although convoluted, the bbc likes to pretend it is not official saud and qatari policy to fund these groups so as to avoid awkward questions when the west sell them another billions dollars worth of weapons.\nOriginally Posted by tomcat ...maybe not this particular Quote: , but WaPo and NYT commented years ago on Saudi and Qatari citizens (among many others) aiding ISIS...this is not news (unless the courier has just reached your outpost)... Subtle difference my dear... Citizens... but the fact clearly is it is state policy.\nAs I said... you don't see this on BBC and CNN. they are too busy crying about the leaks, and not paying attention to the reams and reams of information within them.

I had conveniently forgotten to put on some makeup, lipstick and high heels. I arrived, walking alone and sat in a corner seat where a few people that knew me wouldn\u2019t notice me. There\u2019s a kind of tired that needs a good night\u2019s sleep, and another that needs so much more. For me, one became the other, starting out as the \u201cone-night kind\u201d until one day it was ever present \u2013 like it once was a heavy jacket but became heavy bones.\nMy eyes grew heavier from the strenuous effects of excessive agitation of my brain\u2013that faculty which, in all its strength, I had not prepared for such a weakness. At once, I was struck with incoherence, an inconsistency to my thoughts, as I bent my knees and leaned my back against that black soft church seat\u2014for I had already decided to give myself away to my pursuer, to exhaustion, to be dead to the world before the rest of me ever hit the cold concrete floor.\nI was not impressed by any of the worship and praise songs. Even the sermon irritated me a bit. I could not understand the reason why God allows so much pain to fall on our shoulders if he loves us. Even though I went to church, I had a stinky attitude towards God. I was totally unimpressed, while everyone seemed to be happy and smiling around me.\n\nI zoomed in deeply at the prayer request section, in the offering envelope as I contemplated; \u2018Do people really get prayed for if they fill in this prayer section. What happens if I fill it in, and Bonga doesn\u2019t get healed? I\u2019m not ready for another disappointment\u2026. Or maybe if I give an offering God would see my desperation and answer my prayer\u2019. I emptied my wallet and wrote my prayer; \u201cMy fianc\u00e9 is in ICU, he was involved in an accident, pray for me.\u201d Two days down the line; I received a call from one of the pastors, asking me to come to a prayer gathering. I thought only one person would pray for me or maybe two\u2026 but I wouldn\u2019t have to be there. As I arrived, I elevated my exhausted eyes to a prayer meeting full of people; \u201cOh Snap!\u201d.\nA week down the line a follow-up enquiry asking if there was any improvement followed. \u201cHow is he?\u201d, the pastor asked. Those words broke floods of emotions that I had blocked from messages, phone calls, WhatsApp messages, Skype messages and Facebook messages from a lot of people that cared about us. It was one question I felt totally unprepared to answer. Maybe if there was an improvement it could\u2019ve been easier to answer\u2026 you know. But when there is absolutely no indication of improvement your heart feels brutally stabbed.\n\u2018How really? How do I answer? Do I say he is still stable and irresponsive, or do I say he is fine\u2026?\u2019, I pondered as the corners of my lips fought to fall down and reveal how I truly felt. \u201cHe is getting better\u201d; I answered; lying, avoiding to be judged for lack of faith\u2026", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bonga", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "skype", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:59.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a9edbd950332234eb90d1d3df77f80a4219f2403", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspa09cPOGnxA4.N6d10rPDETYqBqGft5kBGqZ276mV5mavf9S.cfU9i6EOo25t5vQln9SGUjVp9ctwWE2Ksoyge..kbhT8I0qLD", "site_full": "www.expedia.com.br", "site": "expedia.com.br", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com.br/Manhattan-Hoteis.d129440.Guia-de-Hoteis", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hot\u00e9is em Manhattan: Pague em parcelas em at\u00e9 12x sem IOF | Expedia.com.br", "title": "New York Marriott Marquis:", "title_full": "New York Marriott Marquis: Pre\u00e7os, promo\u00e7\u00f5es e coment\u00e1rios | Expedia.com.br", "published": "2017-11-27T01:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46532, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eaec6069dda8c56afc1b1ac3ca46a5d50917eae0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspa09cPOGnxA4.N6d10rPDETYqBqGft5kBGqZ276mV5mavf9S.cfU9i6EOo25t5vQln9SGUjVp9ctwWE2Ksoyge.ySorfM71GfidQsdQg85LpUqfs01mmBEzp2TJr5Lom1U", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-04T23:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Room was large and comfortable.

There is no public timeline for when it will be built. \nChina's most famous boxer, Zou Shiming, lost his WBO flyweight belt when he was knocked out by Japan's unfancied Sho Kimura in his first defence in July. \nWhen Pacquiao's plans for China were first announced in 2014, he said that he believed the partnership could help thaw frosty ties between the Philippines and China, who were engaged in a territorial maritime dispute in the South China Sea. \nRelations have since improved considerably under current Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. \nAt the time, Pacquiao defended the decision to open a boxing academy in China instead of his own country. \n\"In the Philippines we don't have a problem (producing good boxers),\" said Pacquiao, a hero in his home country and also a senator.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mayweather", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pacquiao", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jeff horn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sho kimura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zou shiming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhou wenxin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manny pacquiao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rodrigo duterte", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wbo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world boxing organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manny pacquiao international boxing academy", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south china sea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:01.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "156f72f6dd62ccce19dc586ef83e5b3a6b1b8617", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRGRX7mJejhsDqC6sIlr5AvZ5M286tYymsjYUhkWyp8Cc3ZeRk5Ch0h7LZs67ymdUyD9CaNqldwAIkUs_0MNaQ.", "site_full": "joemasonspage.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://joemasonspage.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "NORWICH AFTER THE WAR \u2013 joemasonspage", "title": "NORWICH AFTER THE WAR", "title_full": "NORWICH AFTER THE WAR", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "156f72f6dd62ccce19dc586ef83e5b3a6b1b8617", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRGRX7mJejhsDqC6sIlr5AvZ5M286tYymsjYUhkWyp8Cc3ZeRk5Ch0h7LZs67ymdUyD9CaNqldwAIkUs_0MNaQ.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "joemasonspage", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "NORWICH AFTER THE WAR", "text": "THE CITY IN THE 1950\u2019s The Queen, soon to become Queen Mother. Assembly House, 1951. Great Aunt Ruth facing the camera. I have been watching old films of Norwich in the fifties on Youtube and it is very interesting to me. This is the time when my eyes were first opening to the \u2018fine old city\u2019* and its inhabitants. There is even a shot of Aunt Ruth dressed in her civic regalia in a documentary; she is walking out of a service at the cathedral that opened the 1955 Norwich Assizes . That was four years after her period as Lord Mayor. She was smiling most beatifically at no one in particular. I keep hoping to catch a glimpse of my father-in-law Jack Turner; he was a bobby in Norwich at the time. I may have seen him, but with his helmet on it is hard to say. He was PC 49 in the Norwich force.\nDistrict Nurse Aunty Olive was living in Christopher Close and I would often go round to her flat. I remember sitting by her fire while her sons and a college friend told ghost stories, as I gazed into the embers. My father\u2019s shop was right in the city centre, and he would call in for a drink with Jack Hubbard, the publican of the Lamb Inn next door. Uncle Ozzie Osborne\u2019s shop was round the corner in White Lion Street. He sold anything made of rubber: wellies, garden hoses and other under-the-counter items. Uncle Bertie was deputy head at the CNS.\nWhile all this family life was continuing, British Railways steam hauled trains puffed their way into the city\u2019s three railway termini. On the river sea going colliers from Newcastle came up to the generating station and ships laden with timber from Finland plied their trade down on the wharves opposite Riverside Road. River tugs from Yarmouth hauled strings of barges for the gas works on Gas Hill. Varnished wooden motor cruisers threaded their way between this commercial traffic to the Yacht Station above Foundry Bridge.\nFour busy breweries filled the air with the delicious aroma of malt and hops. At the mustard factory the Carrow Works steam hooter summoned the workers at ten-to-eight in the morning; if the wind was in the right direction I could hear this as I lay in bed four miles away. To the west side of the city hordes of shoe workers pedalled their way to the day\u2019s task in the many shoe factories. Two large printing offices which had been in the city since the early nineteenth century were still operating. These were Jarrolds at Whitefriars and Fletchers on Castle Meadow, both now no more, although the former firm remains as the large department store in the city and the latter was bought up by Clays of Bungay.\nA smart salute from a Norwich City policeman, 1950. Norwich had no airport throughout the 1950s; the first aerodrome at Mousehold Heath was opened in 1933, but fell into disuse with the outbreak of war. The current International Airport was still called RAF St Faiths, and was a busy jet fighter base. (It had been a USAAF base during war, when it was built slap bang across the Cromer Road, which had to be diverted along a narrow lane.) Jets were very noisy in the fifties, and the base was right next to a residential area \u2013 it must have been hard to get one\u2019s baby to sleep. Along Fifers Lane were the married quarters of the personnel, the brickwork done in different colours in an attempt to camouflage them! There was also a NAAFI that lasted long after he base closed to supply the airmen from RAF Coltishall who continued to live there. Across the Holt Road from St Faiths airfield was Norwich Speedway, a popular attraction that was redeveloped for housing in the 1960\u2019s and has never been replaced.\nEvery Saturday the smell of the farmyard filled the air. Sheep, pigs and cattle were driven through the streets, and I don\u2019t mean in lorries. They walked up Bracondale and along Ber Street, having arrived from across the county at Trowse station. They filled the pens of the open space below the castle, while the smaller livestock (chickens, geese and rabbits) were sold slightly further away near the cast iron premises of Panks. Kittens and puppies were also available. Miss Wicks did a good trade selling dog biscuits and fish pellets from her centuries-old shop in Golden Ball Street. At the end of the day the cattle were driven back by men with whippy canes for dispatch to their new owners or the slaughterhouse.\nEaster saw the Fair take over the cattle market, although it closed on Good Friday. The steam fairground engines rocked gently back and forth as they lit up the gaudy displays; if you paid a bob to enter her tent you could witness the tattooed lady killing rats with her teeth. (Entertainment was more cruel and basic sixty years ago.) For the summer holiday there was no fortnight in Spain, only a trip to the seaside at Yarmouth or Caister; ice creams trumped sangria.The lowly Third Division Canaries finished the decade with the famous Cup Run; they only lost the semi-final to First Division Luton Town on the replay. The excitement that gripped the City football fans is still remembered today by those of a certain age.\nAlmost all these aspects of the city have changed; only the Yacht Station and the football ground remain in place. Britannia Barracks now contains prisoners, not soldiers. One railway station only remains and the gas works and the power station have long passed into history. The new library has come and gone (gone up in flames in fact) since the 1950s. The Press Office has moved from Redwell Street, Barclays Bank no longer has its impressive local HQ at Bank Plain and the GPO sorting office no longer stands across the street. This now houses Anglia Television, which was not in existence then, and where UEA now has is campus was Earlham golf course. The Norfolk and Norwich Hospital still occupied the site where it had been established in the 18th century, until it moved to its new site in 2001.\nMuch has altered, but the cathedral and the castle still stand guard over the inhabitants, as they have done for nearly a thousand years. The Maids Head hotel has welcomed visitors to Norwich for almost as long. Nevertheless, the rest of the 20th century saw the old city vanish for ever in a way that Hitler\u2019s bombs could never achieve.\n* \u2018A fine old city, truly, is that\u2019 is a quotation from Lavengro, by the 19th century Norfolk born writer George Borrow. \nJOSEPH MASON \nTHE BLOG FOR MEMORIES OF NORWICH \njoemasonspage@gmail.com ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ruth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "queen mother", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bungay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "panks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wicks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack turner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bertie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george borrow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack hubbard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "castle meadow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph mason", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hitler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ozzie osborne", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "assembly house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raf coltishall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "british railways", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "press office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norwich speedway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barclays bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britannia barracks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newcastle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st faiths", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fletchers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "earlham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naafi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anglia television", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "third division canaries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usaaf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caister", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "first division luton town", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carrow works", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "norwich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ber street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trowse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "golden ball street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yacht station", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bracondale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norwich city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lavengro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holt road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norwich assizes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "riverside road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foundry bridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norwich hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white lion street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cromer road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norwich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st faiths", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "redwell street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "whitefriars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "finland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mousehold heath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gas hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yarmouth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norfolk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:01.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b5486b75ff9c151287a3d42942c09ae666423ec4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.JSU83_ddNWdY0EBv56VDjKpeTDO9d.ul56BnTDi7341zpXv4wHG94TQiWI7AIPcYcXNCG5GkiqOsXxV1W1zLSNUpQ1l4qEfRfoOQFiqxe8w--", "site_full": "www.armradio.am", "site": "armradio.am", "site_section": "http://www.armradio.am/en/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Public Radio of Armenia", "title": "$450m Leonardo painting heads to Louvre Abu Dhabi", "title_full": "$450m Leonardo painting heads to Louvre Abu Dhabi", "published": "2017-12-07T09:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AM", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.armradio.am/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Da-Vinci-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b5486b75ff9c151287a3d42942c09ae666423ec4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.JSU83_ddNWdY0EBv56VDjKpeTDO9d.ul56BnTDi7341zpXv4wHG94TQiWI7AIPcYcXNCG5GkiqOsXxV1W1zLSNUpQ1l4qEfRfoOQFiqxe8w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Siranush Ghazanchyan", "published": "2017-12-07T09:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "$450m Leonardo painting heads to Louvre Abu Dhabi", "text": "Siranush Ghazanchyan Off A 500-year-old painting of Christ believed to be the work of Leonardo da Vinci is heading to the Louvre Abu Dhabi, the museum said in a Twitter post. \nThe newly-opened museum made the announcement on Twitter, without specifying whether it had bought the painting at auction this month.

There were courts in his Bushwick neighborhood and courts at the Long Island schoolyards. Friends got together and played pickup games for hours, learning and loving the game through boyhood experiences. There was nothing formal about it: Kids developed their own style, chemistry and nuance without adult supervision. \u201cI didn\u2019t see a coach until I was in eighth grade,\u201d he recalled in an interview this week. Decades later, as president and chief executive of the U.S. Soccer Foundation, Foster-Simeon is applying the lessons of street basketball to soccer. On Wednesday, he joined Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and former U.S. men\u2019s and women\u2019s national team players in announcing plans to build 50 mini-pitches over three years in the city\u2019s underserved neighborhoods. Mini-pitches are outdoor hard surfaces, the size of a tennis court, where small-sided matches foster technical skill and creativity \u2014 not unlike pickup basketball in parks and schools around the country. By making mini-pitches accessible to children who otherwise do not have the opportunity or resources to play regularly, Foster-Simeon said, the number of players is sure to swell. \u201cGrowing up with basketball, no one had to tell us to compete,\u201d he said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to lose; you wanted to stay on the court. \u201cWe think that same soccer culture exists here in this country. It\u2019s just creating the access and opportunity.\u201d The issue of expanding opportunity and developing players comes at a time when the U.S. soccer community, stung by the failure of the men\u2019s national team to qualify this fall for the 2018 World Cup, is seeking ways to reach youths, particularly in minority communities, who have slipped through the cracks. Furthermore, many blame costly club programs for marginalizing hopeful players. \u201cPay-to-play doesn\u2019t work for them,\u201d Foster-Simeon said. \u201cNeither does the idea of, \u2018Let\u2019s get in the minivan and go to the soccer complex for practice.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t work for a large number of children. So creating opportunities in the neighborhood where kids live and creating a safe place for them to play, we think solves a number of problems. By eliminating the cost barrier, kids are getting introduced to the game, having a chance to play and developing a love for it. \u201cSome of those kids will be good \u2014 there\u2019s no question, just by the law of averages.\u201d The effort began with a public-private partnership in New York \u2014 10 mini-pitches opened in October, with 40 more on the way \u2014 and will turn to places such as Philadelphia and Los Angeles in the future. The goal is to build 1,000 nationwide by 2026. The Washington-based U.S. Soccer Foundation \u2014 not to be confused with the sport\u2019s governing body, the Chicago-based U.S. Soccer Federation \u2014 was founded in 1994 with the $50 million surplus from the World Cup hosted by the United States that summer. The nonprofit\u2019s mission is to grow the sport through grants to communities and soccer organizations, but also by establishing sports-based youth initiatives, particularly in neglected areas. The latest mini-pitch project gained support from the Kenneth C. Griffin Charitable Fund, which gifted $3 million. Each pitch costs $60,000 and takes about three weeks to build. The Chicago effort will begin in earnest when the weather breaks in the spring. Wednesday\u2019s ceremony included, among others, former U.S. stars Brian McBride and Kristine Lilly. The project has enlisted the Chicago Park District and Major League Soccer\u2019s Chicago Fire. \u201cThese new soccer pitches will give young people across Chicago state-of-the-art places to play and learn one of the world\u2019s most exciting and popular games,\u201d Emanuel said in a written statement. \u201cThis partnership provides a great opportunity for our youth to stay active and gain teamwork and leadership skills that will serve them on and off the field throughout their lives.\u201d Germany identified the benefits of mini-pitches after it hosted the 2006 World Cup, building more than 1,000 around the country. In recent years, MLS teams have been involved in mini-pitch openings. The U.S. foundation\u2019s Soccer for Success, an after-school program, uses the outdoor spaces to further introduce the game to children. And in their free time, those same kids just might return for pickup soccer. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t underestimate the value of getting kids playing soccer in that kind of format,\u201d Foster-Simeon said of playground facilities. \u201cThe tight spaces on the mini-pitch, their skill development will naturally develop. It has to \u2014 or you lose the ball.\u201d 18945412 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steven goff", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brian mcbride", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ed foster-simeon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foster-simeon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rahm emanuel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristine lilly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emanuel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "u.s. soccer federation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago park district and major league soccer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. soccer foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenneth c. griffin charitable fund", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north babylo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bushwick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "long island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:02.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e3ec95b0cc7a424418f34b236ab0579aec75933b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TeOIOX705zTA6KK0plrDZLS_bvwqCp5MmzUDvLeUHgBMNsEX1WQx6b3Qn4Vg3PKCxvmNm7LxF1_A--", "site_full": "aliyakhair.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://aliyakhair.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "/selku\u02d0\u03b8/", "title": "Reflection of 2017", "title_full": "Reflection of 2017", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e3ec95b0cc7a424418f34b236ab0579aec75933b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TeOIOX705zTA6KK0plrDZLS_bvwqCp5MmzUDvLeUHgBMNsEX1WQx6b3Qn4Vg3PKCxvmNm7LxF1_A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aliya K (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "Reflection of 2017", "text": "Salam and hi. \nSuddenly, it's December. 2018 is just in a few days! \nThis year, a lot had happened. I went through so many ups and downs this year. 2017 is the year I turned 24. Throughout this year, although maaaany things had happened, I had mixed feelings on each event. I could say that this year is the year I hit rock bottom, but also the year that means a lot to me, a year that I am blessed a lot. \nBy the end of last year, I had decided to get married on July this year. So, throughout the earlier part of the year, I had always have mixed feelings. It was my last phase of being a single lady. In everything I do, I always had a mindset of \"I better enjoy this now, as it may be difficult to do this when I get married\". and without me realizing, I thought about it too much that it burdened me. \n\nIn everything I do, I would think about what would happen after I got married. Or if I really am getting married. Now I know why people said the engagement phase is a test. Because it was quite a tough one. Some days I would be positive, but on many days, I had many negative thoughts. Especially after consuming failed marriage stories on twitter, facebook, IIUM confession, etc. \nThen I also arrived to a phase where I am adulting. I need to really be independent, was what I thought. Nobody told be to be reliable or dependable, but I just felt that I had to. Especially when it comes to financial issue because college and marriage requires a lot of money, and I didn't want to burden both my parents and my then fianc\u00e9. However, when I feel that I have failed being reliable, I would be so disappointed of myself. \nThe thoughts of being a disappointment, not being ready to get married, not being able to achieve what I wanted, brought me to depression. I could not focus on my study. My procrastination level had increased. On some days, I would only sit in my room and cry. I was too afraid of the future. \nwent to Balai Cerap alone to clear my mind \nOn March, I met a counselor. I met him every week for a month. I sought for advice on how to overcome all of this. I followed the advice, and life began to be bright again. On the fourth week, I feel like I can finally focus on my study. So we decided to set that fourth appointment as the last. \nHowever, things happened again and on May, I hit the final rock bottom. I could not focus on my study, I was too sensitive with people around me and it was very hard for me to accomplish my tasks. And I had tonnes of tasks to do! (especially because it was the end of the semester, so gotta wrap up for everything. assignment, research, organization, etc) \nLong story short, I dropped one course because I couldn't do the assignments, failed two courses because I wasn't able to focus, but I got an A+ in one course. Haha. So in my CGPA, only points for 2 courses was being calculated. One failure and one A+. My GPA was super bad, and my CGPA was just at the border. My supervisor said that if I was just 0.1 less, I would be exempted from my study. \nOh, plus, this happens just two to one months before my marriage, so can you imagine the pressure? \nand another plus, I only shared this with two or three people. I was too embarrased to tell most of my friends and family members about this. I did a lot throughout the years, so others may thought that I was living my life well. but in actuality, I was doing a lot just to distract my mind from the negative thoughts. \nWent to Starbucks alone, also to clear my mind, although this time I don't have much money left XD\nHad a little sweet time here because the Caramel Latte is good, and the barista spelled my name correctly! \nAt the end of the semester, I met my supervisor a lot for consultation. Not only academics, but also personal one. Alhamdulillah, she gave me sooo many positive vibes. I felt like I could breathe again. So I started the semester break with a new energy and put everything that happened in that semester behind. I started to focus on my marriage, and spending time with my family. \nAlhamdulillah, Allah ease sooo many things for my family and I just a month before my marriage. It felt a lot better. Allah ease things for us (my husband and I) also, so it was really a great sunshine, after the rain. I could be myself again. I was at the tip of happiness. \nI got married to my husband on July 22, 2017. Then, had a reception on his side of the family on July 29. A week after, we had a honeymoon / company family trip at Tioman Island. Alhamdulillah, I was soo happy. Happier that now I have a husband and I can just share anything with him, anytime. \nSometimes, the past rock bottom would haunt me and I would suddenly cry again. But it wouldn't last long because my husband would comfort me. \n\n\nI started the semester again, and this felt better than the previous one. Yes, the phase of rising again is quite challenging because I'm fighting against myself every time, but now I feel stronger because Allah has shown me that I have soo many blessings around me. In the past, I felt like I'm a burden to everyone including my parents, siblings friends and husband. Now, I realized that they loved me a lot; they, especially my parents and husband, would do anything just to make me happy. \nI still have tasks to accomplish; tasks that I left behind last semester. and I know I still have to do them. I cannot just abandon them. But I don't know if I will be able to do them or not.. I hope I will, somehow, be able to do them, and do all my assignments and work, and do well in this semester. \nOh Allah, please lend me lots of strengths to finish all my work! \n\nIt feels good to write again, and it feels best that I could write what I had been holding in my mind. I hope by writing this, the negative thoughts would be thrown away, to give more space to the positive thoughts. \nI initially wanted to write a post on 2017 summary, but suddenly it became a 2017 reflection. lol. I guess I had to do this first, before appreciating the blessings I have this year. So that the positive memories remain. I need to give credits to many people too, for making my life colourful. \n\n\nThat's all. Wassalam.
