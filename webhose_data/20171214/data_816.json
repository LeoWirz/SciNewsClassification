This transition zone has different definitions. We want to highlight different landmarks of the rectosigmoid junction (RSJ), to help the clinicians to adopt a consensual definition.\nMethod We reviewed anatomical, endoscopic, physiological and surgical points of view concerning the rectosigmoid junction (RSJ).\nResults The rectosigmoid junction has a different definition depending on who is studying it. Nevertheless, it is a high pressure location, a place connecting different muscles organizations, neurological systems or vascular anastomosis. The clear pathophysiology of the RSJ is not yet determined with certainty, but its resection is essential for the therapeutic care of patients and also for the improvement of surgical skills. From a surgical point of view, anatomical landmarks has to be chosen: easily reproducible and identifiable. The disappearance of taenia coli (belonging to the colon) and the peritoneal reflection (recto-genital pouch), located below the upper rectum, seem the most reliable. The level of rectal section must, in any case, be below the promontory.\nConclusion There is not a single definition, but rather several definitions of the RSJ. Each one of them reflects one appearance of this region: embryological and anatomical evolution or clinical entity. From a surgical point of view, the criterion which seems to be the most reliable is the disappearance of taenia coli and the peritoneal reflection (recto-genital pouch).\n\n\nfrom #ORL-AlexandrosSfakianakis via ola Kala on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2kt6r2H", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "ola kala", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:38.050+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db5ee107f5a2a50dab70952bad090698d5d70804", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KmpmsyknoVauEgLVdh3BC.emfxB3ymfezvz1Q2Lvgwp4uS7ar9X6WDJ53vCFZbzfKiFppDAlGAcTRG8Kq5RhyithAmmOW5T88os613SyyZDZ1ZUyPzVAa_MZY7mlsbPnT1YT6ctYJiYUIGqN1JtTN", "site_full": "www.cbsnews.com", "site": "cbsnews.com", "site_section": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbsnewscom-blogs-page/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CBSNews.com Blogs Page - CBS News", "title": "Donald Trump Jr. would not tell investigators about conversations with father, lawmaker says", "title_full": "Donald Trump Jr. would not tell investigators about conversations with father, lawmaker says - CBS News", "published": "2017-12-07T07:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 99, "participants_count": 34, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2017/05/19/5e4a6964-7adc-4938-878c-72da11cad1c8/ap-17137348512985.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 584, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7ee0f1794474ec4336eff027a6186757c92538c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KmpmsyknoVauEgLVdh3BC.emfxB3ymfezvz1Q2Lvgwp4uS7ar9X6WDJ53vCFZbzfKiFppDAlGAcTRG8Kq5RhyithAmmOW5T88os613SyyZDZ1ZUyPzVAa_MZY7mlsbPnT1YT6ctYJiYvq69kWqbaRHVrUKThmlbA-", "ord_in_thread": 63, "author": "Pink Phloyd", "published": "2017-12-07T10:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "He just said Trump isn't under investigation.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:38.054+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db5ee107f5a2a50dab70952bad090698d5d70804", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KmpmsyknoVauEgLVdh3BC.emfxB3ymfezvz1Q2Lvgwp4uS7ar9X6WDJ53vCFZbzfKiFppDAlGAcTRG8Kq5RhyithAmmOW5T88os613SyyZDZ1ZUyPzVAa_MZY7mlsbPnT1YT6ctYJiYUIGqN1JtTN", "site_full": "www.cbsnews.com", "site": "cbsnews.com", "site_section": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbsnewscom-blogs-page/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CBSNews.com Blogs Page - CBS News", "title": "Donald Trump Jr. would not tell investigators about conversations with father, lawmaker says", "title_full": "Donald Trump Jr. would not tell investigators about conversations with father, lawmaker says - CBS News", "published": "2017-12-07T07:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 99, "participants_count": 34, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2017/05/19/5e4a6964-7adc-4938-878c-72da11cad1c8/ap-17137348512985.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 584, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ae12f3a804095905584f69e9f67e2826af747644", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KmpmsyknoVauEgLVdh3BC.emfxB3ymfezvz1Q2Lvgwp4uS7ar9X6WDJ53vCFZbzfKiFppDAlGAcTRG8Kq5RhyithAmmOW5T88os613SyyZDZ1ZUyPzVAa_MZY7mlsbPnT1YT6ctYJiYvq69kWqbaRJFxP5F.Gf1c-", "ord_in_thread": 64, "author": "sane_commenter", "published": "2017-12-07T10:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "My point exactly.

There\u2019s been something of an obsession in this year\u2019s new releases from big name authors with thinly-disguised polemical ranting over minority liberal concerns, presumably as a reaction to Trump, which has led to me abandoning more books than usual. But I\u2019ve still had some excellent reads \u2013 a mix of old and new\u2026 HONOURABLE MENTIONS The White Guard by Mikhail Bulgakov \nIt is 1918, and Kiev in the Ukraine is at the swirling centre of the forces unleashed by war and revolution. The three Turbin siblings live in the house of their recently deceased mother in the city. They are White Russians, still loyal to the Russian Tsar, hoping against hope that he may have escaped the Bolsheviks and be living still. But there are other factions too \u2013 the German Army have installed a puppet leader, the Hetman Skoropadsky, and the Ukranian peasantry are on the march in a nationalist movement, under their leader Petlyura. This is the story of a few short days when the fate of the city seems up for grabs, and the lives of the Turbins, like so many in those turbulent times, are under constant threat. \nThis is a book about confusion and betrayal, shifting allegiances, chaos and fear. Bulgakov takes a panoramic approach, following one character and then panning off to another. This gives it an episodic feel and adds to the sense of events moving too quickly for the people involved ever to fully grasp. A truly brilliant book that, while concentrating on one small city, gives a brutal and terrifyingly believable picture of the horrors unleashed in the wake of bloody revolution. \nThe snow would just melt, the green Ukranian grass would grow again and weave its carpet over the earth\u2026 The gorgeous sunrises would come again\u2026 The air would shimmer with heat above the fields and no more traces of blood would remain. Blood is cheap on those red fields and no one would redeem it. \nNo one. * * * * * * * * * Selection Day by Aravind Adiga \nTwo brothers are being groomed by their father to become the greatest cricketers in India. Their mother having disappeared when they were little (run away? dead? The boys aren\u2019t sure), the brothers have been brought up by their tyrannical father Mohan, who is determined they will succeed in the sport as a way to raise the family out of the slums. So when the chance of sponsorship comes along, Mohan grabs it, even though it\u2019s at best an unethical deal which sells his sons into a kind of bondage and, at worst, borders on the illegal. \nThis is a story of sibling rivalry, tied in with a wider picture of corruption in society shown through the corruption in cricket. Adiga depicts the poverty and class divisions in contemporary Mumbai quite clearly but he also shows the other side \u2013 the vibrancy, the struggle for social mobility, the advances of recent years. The book tackles some tough subjects, but there\u2019s also humour in there, and happily there\u2019s no whiff of the polemical. And as always Adiga\u2019s writing is pure pleasure to read. \n\u201cPeople thought I had a future as a writer, Manju. I wanted to write a great novel about Mumbai,\u201d the principal said, playing with her glasses. \u201cBut then\u2026then I began, and I could not write it. The only thing I could write about, in fact, was that I couldn\u2019t write about the city. \n\u201cThe sun, which I can\u2019t describe like Homer, rises over Mumbai, which I can\u2019t describe like Salman Rushdie, creating new moral dilemmas for all of us, which I won\u2019t be able to describe like Amitav Ghosh.\u201d * * * * * * * * * The Gowk Storm by Nancy Brysson Morrison \nThis is the tale of three sisters, daughters of the minister in a parish in the Highlands of Scotland. Our narrator is the youngest of the three, Lisbet, who over the course of the couple of years of the book\u2019s story grows from a girl only half comprehending her elder sisters\u2019 early forays into the world of romantic love, into a young woman on whom the two older girls come to depend for support. The book was published in 1933 and it reads as if the story is set somewhere in the decade or two before that, at a time when young girls had more freedom than Austen\u2019s heroines, for example, but were still confined by lack of opportunity and girded round by social restrictions, breaches of which would inevitably lead to scandal and ruin. \nThe quality of the writing and characterisation; the beautiful descriptions of the wild landscape and weather of the Highlands; the delicately nuanced portrayal of the position of women within this small, rather isolated society; the story that manages tragedy without melodrama and hope without implausibility \u2013 all of these mean it richly merits its status as a Scottish classic, and deserves a much wider readership than it has. \nThe carriage moved forward. We turned the bend in the road where we used to stand to see if any one were coming. I heard the immeasurable murmur of the loch, like a far-away wave that never breaks upon the shore, and the cry of a curlew. All the world\u2019s sorrow, all the world\u2019s pain, and none of its regret, lay throbbing in that cry. * * * * * * * * * The Tsar of Love and Techno by Anthony Marra \nLeningrad, 1937; Kirovsk, 2013; Grozny, Chechnya, 2003. These are the three locations in which this collection of stories take place, over the period of the last century. The stories are so beautifully interlinked that the eventual effect is to create something that really must be considered a novel. The central linking stories are those of the ballerina Galina and her first love, Kolya, who later becomes a soldier in the war in Chechnya; and of an invented painting by the Chechen artist, Zakharov, altered repeatedly by the people into whose hands it falls over the decades, till it becomes a kind of metaphor, partly for the way history can be altered to suit the agenda of the historian, and partly of the different perceptions people can have of the same events. \nSome of the stories are tragic, some more uplifting, but none are monotone \u2013 each has moments of heartbreak and, not joy perhaps, but fellowship and humour, humanity breaking through in even the most inhumane circumstances. The characterisation is superb throughout \u2013 so many characters and all very different, but each ringing entirely true; no real heroes or villains, just people trying to get through their lives as best they can. A stunning book, that could have so easily won\u2026 \nThe portrait artist must acknowledge human complexity with each brushstroke. The eyes, nose and mouth that compose a sitter\u2019s face, just like the suffering and joy that compose his soul, are similar to those of ten million others yet still singular to him. This acknowledgment is where art begins. It may also be where mercy begins. If criminals drew the faces of their victims before perpetrating their crimes and judges drew the faces of the guilty before sentencing them, then there would be no faces for executioners to draw.",

According to the 2015 Colorado Court of Appeals opinion, \"Craig and Mullins promptly left Masterpiece without discussing with Phillips any details of their wedding cake. The following day, Craig\u2019s mother, Deborah Munn, called Phillips, who advised her that Masterpiece did not make wedding cakes for same-sex weddings because of his religious beliefs and because Colorado did not recognize same-sex marriages.\" The bakery was issued a cease and desist order. The bakery claimed that the commission who issued it, didn't have the legal right to. The court decided in favor of the commission. \"The record reflects that Masterpiece refused to make wedding cakes for several other same-sex couples.

Back to Article news \"Dear Pulse, My name is Idy, a 30-year-old man living and working in Lagos. I moved into a new flat two months ago in preparation for my wedding which has been slated for early next year. But since I moved in, my neighbour's wife has not given me peace as she has tried every trick in the book to get me to sleep with her. This woman who should be in her late 30s, lives with her husband and three children in the flat opposite mine. Her husband travels often and that gives her the freedom to come into my apartment all the time on flimsy excuses. When I moved in, she and her husband were very nice to me and did everything to help me settle in. The man is a very nice guy and invited me to eat with the family once in a while. ALSO READ : \"Morning Teaser: 'My wife was caught red-handed having sex with our neighbour'\" When I told him I was getting married next year, he was very happy and gave me tips on how to live with a wife. Once in a while, he would invite me out for drinks at a nearby joint. Whenever he travelled, the wife would spend most of her time in my apartment during weekends especially when my fiancee did not come. She would help me cook and clean the place. All the while, I thought she was just being nice and I reciprocated by buying things for her kids who call me uncle and took them to the eatery or movies once in a while. When I introduced my fiancee, Emem , to her, I noticed that she was not very happy and though she pretended to be happy for me that I was getting married, I noticed that she was withdrawn for the duration Emem stayed. She stepped up her game when she started to talk about sex and how much she misses it especially when her husband travels for weeks. She would talk about the different sex styles she loves and how her husband is so old school and only wants the missionary style. I was never comfortable when she began talking about sex but I thought she was just playing out fantasies in her head till the day she told me she wondered what I would be like in bed and how she couldn't wait to find out. I told her she would never find out as I had no intention of cheating on my fiancee and especially not with a married woman. She took offence with that and asked if she was not good looking or sexy enough and I had to calm her down. Her next plan was to come to my flat at night dressed in see-through nightgowns all in her bid to tempt me. It got to a head one night when she came into my sitting room and before I knew what she was doing, she had stripped naked and told me she was so horny and begged me to have sex with her even if it was just that night. I had only my boxer shorts on and it took all my self-discipline to hold back from having sex with her that night and when I managed to get her out of my room, I vowed to avoid her as much as I can in the future. ALSO READ : \"Morning Teaser: 'I caught my wife in my bed with our landlord'\" She is not relenting and even when her husband is around, this woman keeps harassing me sexually. I do not want to take advantage of her especially as her husband is such a nice man and the children take me like a family member. I don't also want to report her to her husband so as not to destroy her home. What should I do? Idy.\" Dear readers, we can now see that women can also harass men sexually as Idy has narrated on Morning Teaser today.

So if you goal is to lose a few kilos, here are the key things you need to know to get the results you are looking for.\nHOW MANY CALORIES DO YOU NEED?.\nThe average number of calories we need (remember it basically changes each and every day), is impacted by our age, genetics, muscles mass, activity levels, current weight, hormones, menstrual cycle and of course gender.\nThere is not one exact number we can pluck out and stick too, and basically calorie requirements change daily.\nMost importantly, increasingly sedentary lifestyles mean that as we are less active than ever before, often public health guidelines on recommended calorie intakes grossly over-estimate what the average person is burning each day.\nAs a rough guide, a small female doing less than an hour of exercise each day will require just 1400 to 1600 calories each day, while an average male will need just 1800 to 2200 calories per day.\nBased on this for sustainable weight loss, women will generally respond well to any dietary regimen based on 1200 to 1400 calories and a male 1600 to 1800 calories per day.\nWhile this may sound a lot of calories, the truth is once you keep a strict log of the calories you consume, you will see how easy it is to eat more than this on an average day.\nLow carb intakes over time can compromise metabolism.\nPicture: Jay TownSource:News Corp Australia.\nYOUR MACROS.\nThe other key variables that impact fat metabolism is the relative proportions of carbs, proteins and fats in the diet.\nWhile low carb diets (less than 20 per cent total calories coming from carbs) will result in quick weight loss initially, low carb intakes over time compromise metabolism as muscle mass is used as an alternate fuel source.\nActive individuals will need 45 to 50 per cent of total energy from carbohydrates to support fat loss, while less active individuals may need as little 30 to 35 per cent total carbohydrates to lose body fat.\nIf you have been restricting your calorie intake and still not seeing weight loss results, it is worth checking your macros \u2014 you may find that your percentage of total carbohydrate intake is too low for the amount of activity you are doing.\nOr you may find that your fat intake is too high.\nFat intakes over 30 per cent of total calorie intake are unlikely to result in fat loss.\nIf you train late afternoon, add in a 200 to 300 calorie snack an hour or two before you train.\nSource:Supplied .\nWHAT ABOUT THE EXERCISE?.\nCalorie restriction is an important aspect of weight loss, but if you are training regularly, you need to factor this into your baseline calorie intake.\nFor every hour of intense physical activity that you are doing you will need an extra 200 to 300 calories on top of your baseline intake.\nThese calories are best consumed around the time of your training.\nFor example, if you train first thing in the morning, add an extra 200 calories to your breakfast meal, while if you train late afternoon,.\nadd in a 200 to 300 calorie snack an hour or two before you train, or a small snack beforehand and an extra 100 to 200 calories with dinner.\nUnfortunately, light walking each day, or light low intensity sessions of less than 30 minutes duration will not result in you needing significantly more calories each day.\nYOUR MEAL TIMING.\nNo matter how restricted your calories are, if you eat too few calories during the first half of the day and more at night, your weight loss results will be compromised.\nAs such, aim to eat your largest meals at breakfast and lunch before making sure you have at least 10 hours without food overnight and a relatively small dinner.\nCHECK YOUR HUNGER.\nExtreme hunger is a sign you need more calories when you are trying to limit calories to lose weight.\nThe best time to introduce an extra 100 to 200 calories to your intake is around the times you are hungry.\nFor example, if you are hungry late morning add extra to your breakfast, or if you are hungry after lunch, add some extra food to your lunch.\nHunger is one of the best indicators of the times you need to eat a little more to keep losing weight as metabolic rate increases.\nFor more infomation >> How many calories you should eat to lose weight - Duration: 7:58. \nThe Best Tip For Being Present - Duration: 3:28. what's up guys it's Matt from Macro Lean and in this video I want to talk about\n\"Living in the present\" formulating a mindset, cultivating a mindset that has\nyou rooted in the present moment. If you've been reading about self\ndevelopment or bettering yourself recently or over the past few years or\nany time in your life? You should know by now that living in the present is where\nyou want to be. NOT in the past or not in the future! If you're angry? If you're\ndepressed? You're living in the past! If you're anxious and you're worried you're\nliving in the future, and you want to bring your attention your focus, your\nconsciousness to the present moment. You want to bring your consciousness to\nthe present moment because that's what's going on right now. We have this fallacy\nthat if \"I could just get to the future, if I could just get there it will be\nokay... If I can just hold on enough to get to the future it will be okay\" No it won't!\nIf now is not good? The future is not going to be good so we need to live in\nthe present moment. I know I keep saying it.. But how do we do that? we become\nokay, we accept we're gonna die. I don't care about dying! I don't to die any day\nsoon. But I don't care about dying. why??? because it's going to happen! It's\nultimately going to happen. Death is as natural as birth! But we have this\nweird thing about death in our society, in our culture. but that's fine it is\nwhat it is. I don't care about dying because it's going to happen. What I do\ncare about is not living the short span, the short timeframe that I have on\nplanet Earth to my maximum potential. To my\nphysical capabilities, to my mental capability. So when I think about death,\nwhen I think about my impermanence. This is a Buddhist teaching I\nlearned from doing meditation retreats when I was living in Southeast Asia.\nEverything is impermanent, everything will come to an end and when you think\nabout that and when you can let that resonate in your head. oh my god\neverything is going to come to an end. Then you're going to drag yourself back\ninto the present moment. You're going to enjoy life, you're going to go out there\nand make the best of everything. Of good days, of bad days, of high times, of low\ntimes. You're going to make the best of the present moment, you must\nmake the best the present moment. because guess what? The present moment is all\nyou've got. The past is gone. It's part of history channel, the future of course we\ncan do things to steer our our path, our journey in a certain way. But we can't\npredict how the future is going to turn out, the present moment is where your\nhappiness lies . so I think to help you with that, think about dying! Not in a\nmorbid way. But think about your life as being impermanent, and be okay with it!\nI'm gonna die! So basically I tell myself I'm fine with dying that's normal. I'm\ncompletely okay with that but what I'm not okay with is not living my life right\nnow. To my full potential! My eighty, ninety years however long I\nlive. Not living that to my full potential. And if I don't do things that\nscare me, get out of my comfort zone! Go to the gym, push myself to talk to\nstrangers, do things that make me feel uncomfortable. If I don't do those things..\nI'm not living life to the full potential, my full potential.\nI'm not taking risks! so contemplate your impermanence, contemplate that it will\nall come to an end, and then by knowing that will come to end. By being okay with\ndeath. Bring yourself back to the present moment and make the most of right now.\nFor more infomation >> The Best Tip For Being Present - Duration: 3:28. \nPachi Senagapappu Pachadi | Roasted Bengal Gram Chutney - Duration: 1:33.

From the move 2 finger spaces outward.\nThis point!\nWe treat both left and right.\nHere is how you do it to yourself.\nYou rotate while keeping your thumb on this point.\n(^^) (^^) (^^)\nTry doing this for about 2 minutes.\nThis affects the optic nerve and makes the neck move smoother.\nThis shows that the eyes are very important!\nEys's move = Neck and back\nSee you next time!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kochi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay townsource", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kochi shiatsu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "news corp australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kochi method", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buddhist", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southeast asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:39.051+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db5ee107f5a2a50dab70952bad090698d5d70804", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KmpmsyknoVauEgLVdh3BC.emfxB3ymfezvz1Q2Lvgwp4uS7ar9X6WDJ53vCFZbzfKiFppDAlGAcTRG8Kq5RhyithAmmOW5T88os613SyyZDZ1ZUyPzVAa_MZY7mlsbPnT1YT6ctYJiYUIGqN1JtTN", "site_full": "www.cbsnews.com", "site": "cbsnews.com", "site_section": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbsnewscom-blogs-page/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CBSNews.com Blogs Page -

Executive Summary \nProfessor Martin led a working group comprising stakeholders including representatives from; Further and Higher Education, NHS Scotland employers, professional bodies, trade unions, student support, the independent sector and government, as well as nursing and midwifery students themselves to ensure immediate input to discussions from those actually experiencing the current system. The group worked through a broad range of complex issues in order to identify, not just barriers to participation, but also current good practice and opportunities for potential synergies. \nThis Final Report of the Commission sets out key observations and recommendations around maximising the opportunities available for participation in education and careers for all those who would aspire to

\nAnother collection of vintage short stories from the great partnership of the British Library and Martin Edwards, this one is different in that these are all translated. Many are from European countries but there are some that range further afield \u2013 Russia, India, Mexico, Japan. As always the book begins with a highly informative and entertaining foreword from Edwards who always manages to get the tricky balance between not enough and too much information just about perfect. Each story also has its own little introduction, where Edwards gives some information about the author and in this collection also about the translation. Some of the stories were translated earlier and have appeared in magazines or other collections, but some have been translated specifically for this collection and are appearing in English for the first time. \nThere are fifteen stories in all, and as always the quality is variable. There are \u201cimpossible\u201d crimes, Holmes pastiches with a foreign slant, little stories that are just a bit of fun, dark stories that linger in the mind, stories that verge on gothic horror. For me, the collection got off to a pretty poor start \u2013 I wasn\u2019t impressed by the first two or three and began to think I\u2019d made a mistake with this one. But as it goes on, the stories get better and better, and some of the later stories are very good indeed. One of them in particular rates as one of the best crime short stories I\u2019ve ever read. In the end, I rated 6 of the stories as 5 stars and another 5 as 4 stars, and there were only two that I thought were complete duds that didn\u2019t really deserve inclusion on the basis of their quality, although I could see why Edwards had picked them \u2013 one for the author\u2019s name (Chekhov), and the other because it plays on a classic of the genre. So despite the iffy start, this ended up being one of my favourites of these collections overall. \nHere are a few of the stories that stood out for me:- \nThe Spider by Koga Saburo translated by Ho-Ling Wong. Japanese. Part crime/part horror and definitely not one for arachnophobes! A scientist built a tower where he keeps vast numbers of spiders for study. But one day a visitor to the tower comes to a sticky end. Our narrator is looking into events after the later death of the scientist himself. This is almost Poe-ish in style in that we learn what happened mostly from the diaries of the scientist \u2013 a tale told by a man driven mad. Those spiders have haunted me for weeks now! \nThe Venom of the Tarantula by Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay translated by Sreejata Guha. Indian. Very much a Holmes pastiche and excellently done. The detective Byomkesh Bakshi and his Watson, Ajit, apparently appeared in many stories and I\u2019d happily read more of them. In this one, an old man is driving his long-suffering family crazy \u2013 he takes a drug that makes him impossible to deal with and they don\u2019t know how he\u2019s getting hold of it. The solution is very Holmesian even if it\u2019s a little obvious, and the story is highly entertaining. Poster from the 2015 film based on the stories \nThe Kennel by Maurice Level translated by Alys Eyre Macklin. French. There is a crime here, a fairly horrific one too, but mostly this is a great little gothic horror story. A man suspects his wife of having an affair, especially when he finds another man in her room. She claims it\u2019s all very innocent but things are about to take a very nasty turn. It has a darkly twisted ending that made me gasp aloud (and then laugh). The author apparently wrote for the Grand Guignol and this story is of that type \u2013 melodramatic, gruesome and lots of fun! \nThe Cold Night\u2019s Clearing by Keikichi Osaka translated by Ho-Ling Wong. Japanese again \u2013 there\u2019s something about the Japanese approach to crime fiction that always draws me in, and this is the story I referred to above as being one of the best crime shorts I\u2019ve ever read. It\u2019s also by far the darkest story in the book. A teacher is called out in the middle of the night to his friend\u2019s house, where he finds his friend\u2019s wife and cousin dead, Christmas toys and sweets strewn around the floor, and the couple\u2019s young son missing. Beautifully written and translated, the author uses the winter snow, the dark night and the frozen countryside to create a great atmosphere of uncanny dread, and there\u2019s an excellent puzzle to be solved too. I was blown away by this story \u2013 a little piece of dark perfection. \nSo some great stories in there that well outweigh the less good ones, and make this for me one of the best of these collections\u2026 so far!

Nigeria is my target and I will remain focused to move the country forward,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nHe said his administration would continue to accord priority attention to education so as to empower the youth, to enable them contribute their quota toward the development of the country . \n\n\u201cIf you educate people, you empower them. So we have to make sacrifice to prepare the youth for the future,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nHe expressed happiness over the wonderful reception accorded him and his entourage by the people of the state on their arrival in the state capital.\n\n\u201cI am overwhelmed by the massive turnout of people who left what they were doing to welcome me. This should be a clear message to the opposition.\n\n\u201cThe support has been consistent, so I don\u2019t have words to express my appreciation to the people of Kano state.\u201d\n\nThe President congratulated Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje for working very hard to improve the living standard of the people of the state through execution of projects that had direct bearing on them.\n\nHe described Ganduje as a good politician who worked closely with all politicians, particularly representatives of the state, at the state and National Assemblies.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Ganduje said his administration had been able to execute a number of developmental projects, in addition to initiating various empowerment programmes for the women and youths.\n\nHe said as part of effort to address unemployment, the state government had awarded contract worth over N2 billion for the construction of a skills acquisition training centre, assuring that the centre would soon be completed and put to use.\n\n\u201cWe have a number of projects that are ongoing and we hope you will visit the state in near future in order to commission such projects,\u201d Ganduje said.

I really like the idea of Bruttenholm working at Bletchley Park and being recruited into covert stuff, but the \"everyone stands around and explains the plot\" parts are so frustrating on top of what is basically voice over narration. it's so much expositing, I feel like Roberson needs to learn to rely more on visual storytelling.\nMitten started off this issue a bit weak in the way he drew Rasputin, something just seemed sloppy about it. The end monster sequence was fantastic though, really the highlight of the issue for me.

minutes ago Qatar flexes financial muscle with 12 billion euros of French deals Hadeel Al Sayegh 3 Min Read DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar will buy fighter jets and armoured vehicles as part of 12 billion euros (\u00a310.5 billion) worth of commercial contracts it agreed with France on Thursday, bolstering its military capability and its international ties as it faces a boycott by other Arab states. French fighter jet Rafale made by Dassault performs during the Breitling Airshow in Sion, Switzerland September 15, 2017. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse The latest contracts underscored how Doha can use the wealth it has accumulated as the world\u2019s biggest exporter of liquified natural gas to defy some of the largest and wealthiest Arab countries. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and trade relations with the emirate almost six months ago. They accuse the Qataris of backing terrorism, which Qatar denies. \u201cOur position on this blockade was very clear. Qatar\u2019s position was very clear - to resolve this problem, if we saw problems between us and our neighbours - we should be at a table and speak honestly,\u201d Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said at a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron, who has tried to play a mediation role between the sides, was in Doha to discuss how to combat the financing of terrorism at a time when the Middle East is locked in a regional power struggle between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi\u2018ite Iran. \u201cRestoring stability to the Gulf is a priority for us because we have a lot of friends here,\u201d Macron said. \u201cOur wish is that we find a quick resolution to today\u2019s situation.\u201d Paris has strong commercial and political ties with Qatar. It has promoted deeper business interests in the country and encouraged Qatari investment in France, where the Gulf state already has assets of about $10 billion. Macron said some 12 billion euros ($14.13 billion) worth of deals were agreed on Thursday. They included Qatar\u2019s taking up an option from 2015 to buy 12 more Dassault Aviation-made Rafale fighters, and saying it could purchase a further 36. It has already bought 24 planes for about 6 billion euros, including missiles. It also committed to buying 490 armoured vehicles from defence firm Nexter. Doha has repeatedly called for dialogue with its neighbours, although it has strengthened its military as relations with them have deteriorated. It has secured this year alone military equipment deals with the United States, Russia and Britain. \u201cIn total, it amounts to nearly 12 billion euros which was signed today and which underlines the closeness of our economic cooperation,\u201d Macron said. Among other deals signed, SuezA will dredge and clean Qatar\u2019s lagoon and a rail consortium of RATP and SNCF will build and operate a metro system in the Qatari capital. Qatar Airways also placed a new order for Airbus A321neo civilian aircraft to replace an earlier A320neo order. The new deal for larger planes is worth an extra $930 million at current list prices for Airbus and involves a switch of engine supplier to a French-American venture co-owned by Safran< and General Electric.

It\u2019s telling when theological disputes arise among the Mammon theocracy. These factions all remain fully committed to the animism and worship of money and the totalitarian determination to reduce all human-to-human and human-to-nature relations to purely money relations. Yet they squabble like Nicaean Christians over what kind of money should rule. The essence of Mammon is those things I just mentioned, not greed which is just one part of it. Contrary to Gordon Gekko, greed is more a tool than a theological fundamental of Mammon. Greed is part of human nature. Mammon, like its capitalist mode, maximizes all the worst elements of human nature: Greed, hate, fear, sadism, power-lust, contempt, disregard, apathy. In these ways it uses humans as a particular kind of puppet. Meanwhile Mammon suppresses all the best elements of humanity. Yeats\u2019s poem, incoherent if applied to individuals and mere politics (by definition \u201cthe best\u201d are active toward the good, while by definition those who \u201clack all conviction\u201d are sheep), becomes true if applied to the way Mammon mobilizes the worst in human nature and crushes the best. Thus Mammon and capitalism work to maximize greed and suppress generosity. This goes heavily against the human grain, since the evidence of history, anthropology, sociology, and everyday life even today strongly suggests that generosity is naturally a far stronger human element than greed. It has to be. Humans are social primates, naturally evolved to cooperate. Only recently in history, and especially under the extreme ahistorical circumstance of fossil-fuel modernity, has it been possible for the greedy, sociopathic impulses to accumulate wealth and power. It started with agriculture, which was the original sin enabling the accumulation and manipulation of surplus wealth and power. But accumulation naturally indicates an ecological bottleneck. Accumulation equals waste. It is pollution. Those who manipulate such wastes are merely using poison as a weapon. The modern agrochemical onslaught is the latest, worst, most literal use of poison to destroy the Earth in order to hoard power. Propagate the necessary new ideas.

(amat) engineers have been charged with attempting to steal chip designs from the semiconductor equipment company to sell to a Chinese startup. \nThe four U.S. chip engineers\u2014Liang Chen, Donald Olgado, Wei-Yung Hsu, and Robert Ewald\u2014are accused of downloading data from Applied\u2019s internal database, which included more than 16,000 drawings. In a statement on Wednesday, U.S. prosecutors said the men\u2019s plan was then to find funding for a startup based between the U.S. and China to compete with their former employer, reported Bloomberg . \nThe stolen intellectual property outlined the processes for manufacturing a high volume of chips that are used to light and electrify flat-screen TVs and smartphones. \n\u201cApplied Materials vigorously safeguards its intellectual property from theft or unlawful use,\u201d company spokesman Ricky Gradwohl said in a statement, as reported by Bloomberg. \u201cWe support the legal action in this criminal case to ensure that anyone who obtained our trade secrets illegally is brought to justice. We cannot comment further on pending legal actions.\u201d \nThe move fuels fears that China is resorting to illegal tactics it break its dependence on chip imports, threatening U.S. chipmakers and putting America\u2019s national security at risk, according to Bloomberg . In fact, in its last few days in power, the Obama administration issued a warning about China\u2019s push to develop domestic semiconductor technology. \n\u201cThe Chinese government, motivated by economic and national-security goals, has publicly asserted its desire to build a semiconductor industry that is far more advanced than today and less reliant on the rest of the world,\u201d the White House report says. \u201cIts strategy relies in particular on large-scale government spending, including $150 billion in public and state-influenced non-government funds over ten years. We concluded that, while not all Chinese tactics and developments are problematic, many of them could be.\u201d \nWhile China is the largest consumer of semiconductors as an end market, but little of that demand is met by domestic companies, and attempts by China-related entities to acquire U.S. chip companies have been blocked by regulators, according to Bloomberg . Therefore, the world\u2019s most populous country is now investing billions into its own local industry.
