Circle of Blue published this long, aggravating article of the efforts of activists, water managers and (far too many consultants) to \"find a compromise\" on the price of water that will cover system costs without \"burdening the poor.\" Let me solve this \"puzzle.\" First, there's no point in making water cheap to help poor people. Cheap water will not make them rich. If you want to help poor people, then give them money. Second, water utilities are neither charities nor social innovators. Their job is to deliver safe and adequate quantities of water at prices that cover their costs of operations, maintenance and expansion. Utilities that are underfunded (like those in India that lose money on every cubic meter delivered) cannot provide good service.* Utilities that are asked to take care of poor people (like those in England where the government is too stingy to help poor people [pdf]) lose track of their primary mission (good service) as they struggle to identify who is \"poor\".** Third, any politician who claims that water needs to be cheap to help poor people is a lying, lazy incompetent. It's the politician's job to tax the rich to help the poor, but US politicians work for the rich . Sad. Bottom line: Water utilities need money to operate and deliver safe, adequate water to customers who should pay for it. If those customers are too poor, then the government should give them money, not undermine utility finances with counterproductive \"affordable water\" mandates.*FYI, I pay about \u20ac50 ($60) per month for water, sewer and water security (protecting Amsterdam, and thus my house, from flooding). I provide this figure NOT to show how it's less than my TV bill (I don't have a TV) or mobile phone bill (that's \u20ac25/month), but to show how world-class service can be quite cheap. Why is that? Dutch professionals are pro-active and their utilities compete to provide the best value for money, so they avoid many mistakes common in under-funded locations. ** According to Donoso (2017) , the government of Chile pays for some share of the cost of water in poorer households, i.e.: Affordability criteria are met by the provision of subsidies directly to the most vulnerable house- holds. Households are classified based on an annual survey ( Encuesta Casen ) which estimates household per capita income. In order to qualify for the subsidy, households must not have payment arrears with the service provider. The central government transfers the block subsidy to the municipalities; the latter uses this to pay a share of each of the eligible household\u2019s water bill. The subsidy considers a payment share from 15 to 85% of the water bill, with the poorest families getting the highest share, and covers water consumption up to 15 m3. The WSS providers bill the benefiting households for the consumption cost not covered by the subsidy, but indicate the full consumption cost, and then charge the municipality for the subsidies granted. The advantage of this subsidy scheme is that it does not distort price signals.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donoso", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "circle of blue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "encuesta casen", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amsterdam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:27.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a6fc7e73814e0ba883fca4611c063983c8ae07f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9pZjbkz0yttu0HCHKIvYECDTrZKKvhJ4MHuS20rj9vlb2M324Ekg9JIMHe9cAbQ0-", "site_full": "mybroadband.co.za", "site": "mybroadband.co.za", "site_section": "https://mybroadband.co.za/vb/forumdisplay.php/131-News-and-Current-Affairs", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "News and Current Affairs", "title": "Attorney nabbed after R2.5 m allegedly stolen from paralysed man", "title_full": "Attorney nabbed after R2.5 m allegedly stolen from paralysed man", "published": "2017-12-07T09:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://mybroadband.co.za/vb/images/misc/facebook_share.jpg?v=1.1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5974, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aecda2e94bbe7141c326f9b0d89bfce206ef08b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9pZjbkz0yttu0HCHKIvYECDTrZKKvhJ4MHuS20rj9vlb2M324Ekg9mmJZb2XIPzbIhvbKhRi2Fx_0u3jjbnHt", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Hemi300c", "published": "2017-12-07T09:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Fking [email protected] , nail him with the worst possible sentence.

Additionally, the low supply current decreases the external circuitry required to turn the amplifier on and off. \nAn input bias current of 7 pA and low flicker noise at 3.9 \u00b5Vp-p enables operation with high-impedance sensors, delivering more accurate measurements in precision systems.

Connect via: FTSE dropped hard into support and held, but\u2026 Has numerous points of resistance and poor trend structure Brexit talks and potential Pound volatility further muddy the waters \nStart sharpening your skills today with one of the DailyFX Trading Guides \nA week ago, when we were discussing the FTSE it was noted that the volatile price action around resistance gave shorts the upper-hand . But this would likely only be the case for a little while as big support arrived not far below in the 7315/290 vicinity, of which the zone was only breached by a couple of points before turning around this week. It was thoroughly tested twice, once on Friday and again yesterday. Solid support, but\u2026 \nOverall, the trend since the high a month-ago remains postured bearishly with a series of lower-lows and lower-highs in place, however; there is enough solid footing for the market to hold onto that it now leaves shorts with limited \u2018open space\u2019 to operate without running the risk of another bounce. It\u2019s a tricky spot at the moment, but it looks likely there will still be pressure on the footsie for now, and as such, rallies are likely to face sellers. \nResistance arrives from around 7370 up to 7400-ish. This area consists of the bottoms created during the swing-low in November, underside of the recently broken December 2016 trend-line, 200-day MA, and trend-line off the record high. Indeed, a lot of resistance to contend with. Support clocks in right around 7290, and below there the trend-line extending from April beneath the September low, roughly 7255. \nMuddying the waters further are Brexit talks through Friday, when the UK is to give a recommendation to the EU council. Pound volatility is set to impact UK stocks, especially the currency-sensitive FTSE 100 with its largely multi-national make-up (FTSE/GBPUSD 1-mo correlation = -63%). For now, we\u2019ll take a neutral stance and come back when the picture presents a better-looking scenario. \nStruggling with confidence?

He joined a protest Dec. 5, 2017 against a plan to split up the school. \nRob Manning \nStaff and parents from Pioneer Special School protest outside the Portland Public Schools administration building, Dec. 5, 2017. \nRob Manning \nDozens of supporters of the Pioneer Special School program rallied Tuesday night against plans for the school. \nAmong the chants that demonstrators shouted was \u201cEducation is a right, Pioneer will fight, fight, fight!\" \nThe plan presented last week by Superintendent Guadalupe Guerrero would relocate all 123 Pioneer students, children with disabilities, behavior problems and challenging backgrounds. \nThe move is largely to open up Pioneer's home, the Holladay site in Southeast Portland. Moving out Pioneer can make room for the ACCESS Academy, which is itself being displaced by larger plans for neighborhood schools in North and Northeast Portland. \nThe plan for Pioneer's students is still undergoing some revisions, but it generally aims to send Pioneer's younger students to the Applegate Elementary building in North Portland, bumping out a Head Start program there. Older students could go to Marshall High School in Southeast Portland, to individual placements through the Multnomah Education Service District, or to another centralized facility that the district may announce next week. \nAmong the protesters Tuesday night was Ethan Frager, a ninth grader at Pioneer. He said he's gotten the support he needed at a tough time, and he's planning to return to a traditional high school in January. \n\u201cI\u2019ve had like a total turnaround. I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve had that if I hadn\u2019t been going here with the support that they have,\" Frager said. \nBut Frager said he expects his classmates to struggle through a forced transition next fall, under Guerrero's plan. \nThe head of Oregon\u2019s largest school district has now antagonized two very sensitive school communities in a very short time. \nGuerrero said it wasn't his intention to immediately overhaul programs for gifted students and children with special needs when he took over the superintendent's job. But he arrived at a school district with a number of initiatives already underway that he had to carry forward. \nAt the same time, Guerrero faces a broader mission: to transform numerous aspects of Portland Public Schools while rebuilding trust with its parents, teachers and other communities. Transformation and trust are at the heart of the conflicts involving ACCESS Academy and the Pioneer school. \n\nPioneer is home for Anthony Purkapile. He didn't attend the rally. His older sister, Bethany, said it would've been too noisy for her sensitive little brother. And there's another reason. \n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t even know ,\" said Bethany Purkapile. \"We\u2019re so afraid to tell him, because we don\u2019t know what kind of response we\u2019ll get.\u201d \nPurkapile said her parents adopted Anthony as a baby from a mother with alcohol and drug problems. She said her brother didn\u2019t develop like other kids, and didn\u2019t fit at school. \n\u201cIn the education system, Anthony was just left in a corner. He would come home and he would just\u2026 he would beat us. He would put us in the hospital, because he couldn\u2019t understand his anger and his emotions,\" said Bethany Purkapile. \nShe said Anthony's life changed at Pioneer. \"Being at Pioneer, and working with teachers that understand that, and work with him with that, he\u2019s able to sustain life at home,\u201d she said. \nMeanwhile, ACCESS parents have been advocating for a permanent home for years. But they didn't request the Holladay site, parent Mark Keller is quick to point out. \n\u201cA lot of people are up in arms at ACCESS. They feel like what the superintendent has done to Pioneer is similar to what he had proposed at ACCESS initially,\u201d Keller said, referring to Guerrero\u2019s proposal in October to close ACCESS and create a \"pathways\" program across multiple sites. \nACCESS parents argued against that plan, and Guerrero shelved it several days later and apologized. \nGuerrero arrived at a district dealing with lead in school drinking water and no contract with its teachers, all while the district was midway through school boundary changes. \n\u201cIt\u2019s only been eight weeks \u2013 but it sure seems like a lot longer than that,\u201d Guerrero said, with a laugh, in an OPB interview. \nGuerrero acknowledged what he calls \u201cmissteps,\u201d but he said the district needs to change. \n\u201cIt\u2019s in dire need of transformation; and with that, the first stage is always a bit more dramatic because it\u2019s disruptive,\" Guerrero said. \nUnlike Guerrero's reversal on ACCESS, the superintendent has not backed off plans to break up Pioneer. He contends the open floor plan and high ceilings at the Holladay building are not well suited for Pioneer because it's more room than the program needs. Guerrero argues Applegate and the other placements could be an improvement for Pioneer services. \nGuerrero said what started as a search for a home for ACCESS turned into a re-evaluation of special education facilities and services. \n\"It\u2019s not that I was looking to open the special education Pandora\u2019s Box, the second month on the job,\" Guerrero said. Instead, he said he had to ensure that ACCESS had a building that would work for them, and he believes Holladay will. \n\"We have a group of students that\u2019s been displaced, as a result of our excitement of starting two new comprehensive middle schools, and there wasn\u2019t necessarily a solution for what happens with all the students who aren\u2019t going to be in those buildings,\u201d Guerrero said. \nVeteran Pioneer teacher Dallas Dennis contends Pioneer has made innovative use of the Holladay site to serve the unique needs of their challenging students. They have emotional \"blowouts,\" sometimes, he said, and Holladay can give them space. \nAt the Tuesday night rally at the district headquarters, Dennis doubted a plan from a leader so new to Portland. \n\u201cI\u2019m not blaming anyone, but I don\u2019t understand how a person can make a decision only being around for a few months,\u201d Dennis said. \nDennis called it a \"hasty decision,\" and contended top administrators \"rarely\" visit to \"know what goes on at Pioneer.\" \nThe questioning at the rally continued into the school board meeting inside Tuesday night. Guerrero\u2019s challenge is that building trust takes time, but the problems are urgent. \n\u201cIn the absence of an articulated vision and strategic plan, these moves might seem idiosyncratic. People might be thinking, \u2018What\u2019s that new superintendent going to do next?\u2019 Well, stay tuned, right?,\u201d said Guerrero. \nWith some groups, Guerrero has a structure to talk through issues. He\u2019s in contract talks with teachers, and said they\u2019re going well. Teacher leaders agree \u2013 but are eager to see concrete offers to really be convinced. \nTeachers aren\u2019t the only ones reluctant to give Guerrero the benefit of the doubt, given district scandals over environmental hazards and sexual abuse, and the sudden rollout of changes for two of the district\u2019s most challenging populations. \nSome opponents of breaking up Pioneer admit to not being that familiar with Applegate or with other aspects of the plan, and they acknowledge that the Holladay facility has its limitations. \nBut the district's difficulty in handling past overhauls undermines confidence in future changes. Families emphasize what they know and trust: the teachers and other staff that work with the students. \nBethany Purkapile, the older sister of student Anthony, contrasts Pioneer with other government agencies that families confront in trying to get help for children with significant needs. \n\u201cEvery time there\u2019s a door closing in your face \u2014 \u2018Sorry, we can\u2019t help you, there\u2019s nothing more we can do, there\u2019s no other services we can provide.\u2019 And Pioneer opens that door and says, \u2018No, we will take you\u2019,\" said Purkapile. \nSo what difference does a building make? \nFor students who rely on routine and stability, teachers and parents say it can make a big difference.

Arati Baladas wonders about this sometimes. \nBaladas is 20, and she sometimes replays in her mind that moment on April 24, 2013, when she scrambled to find her missing sandal, as the walls and the ceiling around her crumbled. \nShe was working at her sewing machine when she heard a loud bang. She says the building \u201cshivered.\u201d Her supervisor told everyone to run. \nBaladas who often slipped her shoes off at work, searched for her sandal. \u201cJust run!\u201d her supervisor said. She sprinted, and tripped. She doesn\u2019t remember anything else. \nOn that morning, the Rana Plaza garment factory complex became a pile of rubble. \n\u201cI was under a dead body,\u201d Baladas says. \nThe images of the collapsed Rana Plaza show a pile of cement and iron rods tangled with human limbs and fabric. Fabric that was destined to be made into clothing for big-brand stores. Baladas was trapped under all that, her leg stuck under another worker\u2019s body. \nBy the time she woke up to the sound of rescuers, Baladas had been buried for three days. Her mother, who worked at the same factory, died in the collapse. Baladas was taken to the hospital, where they had to amputate her leg. \nThe Rana Plaza collapse was the deadliest accident in garment industry history. The final death toll was over 1,000 and approximately 2,500 people were injured. \nThe building had not been built for thousands of workers operating heavy machinery. Additional floors had been added illegally. The day before the collapse, managers found deep fissures in the structure. \nNow where Rana Plaza used to be, it\u2019s just an empty lot with overgrown bushes and mounds of garbage. \nEvery morning, thousands of workers, mostly women, walk past it on the way to garment factories. \nAdrian Rodriguez is the merchandising manager at the Waymart Factory in Dhaka. At Waymart, workers make clothing for Debenhams and Next, two British retailers. \n\u201cBuyers have become more alert than before,\u201d says Rodriguez. He says that after Rana Plaza, retailers changed the way they did business with factories in Bangladesh. \n\u201cThey will send the compliance team to check the building team,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd to check the building safety, the electrical safety, the structural safety \u2026 How compliant we are, whether we are giving proper facilities to the workers, whether the workers are happy. So, overall, buyers are more pushy now, for safety.\u201d \nAnd he says, Rana Plaza taught the industry two things: First, as much as consumers love a bargain, they don\u2019t want blood on their hands. And second, Bangladeshi factory owners are learning the value of a happy worker. \n\u201cThey have seen that if they\u2019re behaving better with the employees, if they are giving better facilities, they are getting the products out better.\u201d \nOut on the production floor, rows of workers, almost all women, hunch over their tables, their needles ricocheting through denim. This is not a cushy job. The hours are long. The work is repetitive and physically draining. \nIt\u2019s warm and the fans seem to just push hot air around. And the building has been checked by structural engineers. \nThese are all great improvements. And yet, activists say, there\u2019s a long way to go. \n\u201cThese jobs are not [jobs] with respect,\u201d says Kalpona Akter. \u201cThese jobs have no dignity.\u201d \nAkter worked in garment factories as a child. She\u2019s now a union leader, And she understands what a delicate battle this is. Twenty percent of this country\u2019s gross domestic product comes from garment production. \nShe says that European companies like Adidas and H&M have tried to improve work conditions by signing something called the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh . In it, they promise they won\u2019t do business with factories that aren\u2019t up to safety standards. \nRob Wayss is the executive director and acting chief safety inspector for the accord. \n\u201cSince 2013, we've been inspecting about 1,800 factories that produce garments in Bangladesh, identifying safety hazards \u2014 fire, electric and structural safety hazards. And we've been working with the signatory companies and unions and the factory owners and the technical people that the factories have on staff are [hired] to fix all the safety hazards and to monitor that they're being fixed and reporting whether they're being fixed or not.\u201d \nWayss says inspectors identify hazards and also train workers on how to respond in the event of an emergency. \n\u201cWe do these programs at factories where production stops for an hour or so and the workers assemble at different points in the factory, and we [train] safety trainers that deliver about a 40-minute session on essentials and safety essentials and safety in garment factories [on] how to evacuate a building in the event of an emergency or in the event of a fire.\u201d \nThe Bangladesh Accord is a legally binding agreement. \nLabor organizer Kalpona Akter says it\u2019s made a difference. \n\u201cTo give you an example, up to 2013, every year, [on] average, 200 workers would die. [In] 2016 ... it was zero.\u201d \nGetting the big North American brands to be better about safety has been a challenge. \nThey didn\u2019t sign the accord. Instead, they created something called, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety . Unlike the accord, it\u2019s not legally binding, and it\u2019s been criticized for having less teeth. \nNearly 2,000 factories are covered by the alliance and the accord. But there are thousands of factories manufacturing garments that are not part of either agreement. \nUltimately, Akter says, it isn\u2019t just the responsibility of clothing brands. Or even of factory owners. The buck stops with the consumer. \n\u201cStart with the store managers. Ask him, \u2018I want to know more about this worker. Are they paid a living wage? Are they safe?\u2019\u201d \nArati Baladas doesn\u2019t think factories in Bangladesh are any safer now than when the Rana Plaza building collapsed on her. She says she\u2019ll never go back to the factory. And no child of hers will go, either. But in Bangladesh, almost all roads lead to garment work. What else is there? \nSometimes at night, Baladas says a strange itch wakes her up. Phantom limb feelings are common in amputees. She swears she can feel her toes. She reaches down, only to find there is nothing. \nFrom PRI's The World \u00a92017 PRI \u00a9 2017 KUOW News and Information", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "arati baladas", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "baladas", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "akter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kalpona akter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob wayss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adrian rodriguez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rana plaza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rodriguez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "debenhams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wayss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waymart factory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adidas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "h&m", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bangladesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rana plaza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waymart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dhaka", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:28.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd92dd8b45682a67bcdd265ca479e37bc4b2c649", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg91AAFr2hsw6UooF2Gdx9W6GI5e5o6xZRAUuTqoxE7nlg4ZPPdBfxWRTmNByjQakvEuwWZkHj.sI4unz8Sw0muKJldh7piA6xuEPD8AULmi2ea1NHfVhVTM", "site_full": "www.digitalinformationworld.com", "site": "digitalinformationworld.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "Video Promotion: Secrets from Marketers Who\u2019ve Done It Right - #Infographic / Digital Information World", "title_full": "Video Promotion: Secrets from Marketers Who\u2019ve Done It Right - #Infographic / Digital Information World", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.238, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 70847, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dd92dd8b45682a67bcdd265ca479e37bc4b2c649", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg91AAFr2hsw6UooF2Gdx9W6GI5e5o6xZRAUuTqoxE7nlg4ZPPdBfxWRTmNByjQakvEuwWZkHj.sI4unz8Sw0muKJldh7piA6xuEPD8AULmi2ea1NHfVhVTM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Web Desk", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Video Promotion: Secrets from Marketers Who\u2019ve Done It Right - #Infographic / Digital Information World", "text": "Somewhere in the heat of the content marketing revolution, got the more content you produce, the more successful you\u2019ll be.

Here they Skype over dinner with family in Tianjin, China. KUOW PHOTO/MEGAN FARMER \nIt's Monday evening. My mom, my dad, and I are sitting at the dinner table with our eyes trained on the computer screen in front of us. \nI say hello in Chinese: \u201cN\u01d0men h\u01ceo!\u201d \n\" \u0100i!\" my grandma replies. \nI see my mom's three older sisters and my grandma eating brunch in Tianjin, China. We're eating dinner in Redmond, Washington. They tease us for eating Costco dumplings and flaunt their own homemade ones. Listen / 18:11 Patrick Liu on the RadioActive podcast. \"I might be miles away from my parents and if they're sick, maybe I'll think back to this time and take some advice from my mom.\" \nSo many of us live far away from the people we love. It's hard to stay connected, and family illness can make the situation even harder. \nWe only get to see them in person twice a year, so my mom, Guoping Ma, says Skype is the next best thing. \n\"Sitting in front of the screen, it's as if we're just sitting next to each other,\" she says. \"Of course, you can't touch each other, right? But it's so close.\" \nPatrick created this story in KUOW's RadioActive Youth Media Intro to Journalism Workshop for high school students. Find RadioActive on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram and on the RadioActive podcast . \nWe Skype three nights a week: Monday, Wednesday and Friday. \nThrough the computer screen, my third-oldest aunt takes out an oxygen machine and hooks it up to grandma. My mom's eyebrows furrow. \nGrandma has been bedridden for almost seventeen years \u2014 practically since I was born. Every day she struggles with back problems, osteoporosis, a heart condition, and a number of other health problems. \nIt's a dangerous situation, but my mom can't really help. It's her sisters who take care of grandma, and my mom feels guilty. Through these Skype calls, she wants them to know she cares. \n\"If they don't see me show up, they don't see me, there might be some misconceptions or assumptions that I don't care, and that's a very uncomfortable feeling,\" she says. \nMy parents came to the United States to pursue graduate studies in 1993. My mom wrote letters home every week because grandma didn't have a phone. It was tough, but it was a sacrifice that grandma supported. \n\"I am a hundred percent sure she wouldn't be happy if I were to move back, even though she craved to be close, to see her children,\" my mom says. \"But she also sees that as constraining [us].\" \nMy mom felt comfortable leaving her family because everyone was pretty healthy then. At the time, mom thought she would only stay in America for five or six years. But at the end of those six years, my parents both found jobs, and I was born. It became clear we were settling down here. \nMom tried to bring grandma and my second-oldest aunt to the United States, but my aunt was denied a visa. That hope was dashed. \nThen grandma's health took a downturn, and she became bedridden. We couldn't move back, and they couldn't move here, so we had to rely on technology to stay connected. \nThankfully by 2004, we were able to start video calling. The author, Patrick Liu, and his parents in Redmond, Washington Skype with his family in Tianjin China three nights a week. Credit KUOW/MEGAN FARMER \nAt first, we video called mom's family every night, even on weekends. On Friday, we also call dad's family since they also live in Tianjin, China. (Recently we cut back to three days a week.) \nGrandma relies on these Skype calls. She keeps a small calendar on the bed and counts the days by it so she knows when we will call. She loves how it feels like we're face-to-face. She says it's just as good. \nBeing able to stay in contact with grandma as her health declines is so important to mom. Her dad died suddenly when she was sixteen, and she wasn't around. \n\"As my mom's getting older and older, I almost feel that every time I talk to her, that's one less opportunity maybe down the road,\" my mom tells me. \nThe fact that grandma is still alive is thanks to my mom's three sisters, who live together with grandma and have taken care of her for seventeen years. \n\"If not for them, I am one hundred percent [ sure that grandma] would have been long gone,\" she says. \nThat's why this whole situation became much harder last year, when my second-oldest aunt was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She has been in chemotherapy, so my two remaining aunts are now taking care of my grandma and my aunt. For my mom, it's been unbearable to watch them struggle like this. \n\"I don't know how many times I cried,\" she says. \"I knew that [my sister] was in such pain. I just want to make her feel better.\" \nMy mom has taken video calls from her sisters at two or three in the morning when they needed to cry with her. She gives them medical advice and financial support whenever they need it. \"When you are witnessing an emergency situation, you just feel so helpless. Those are the moments you feel that Skype doesn't help at all.\" \n\"There were times when they were all breaking down,\" my dad, Siyuan Liu, tells me. \"But those were important moments for all of them to get through it together.\" \nBut sometimes, for all of my mom's efforts, it's just not enough. Like when, during a Skype call, grandma suddenly feels pain or has a shortness of breath, and my aunts rush to help her. \n\"When you are witnessing an emergency situation, you just feel so helpless,\" my mom says. \"What do you do? There's nothing I can do, right? Those are the moments you feel that Skype doesn't help at all. Only being physically there would be helpful.\" \nThat's why, after I head off to college, my mom wants to visit her mom and her sisters more often. \nThrough all this, my mom knows there's no real solution to grandma's illness. The only question left is when grandma will leave us. But my mom says there's no point in stressing over when people will be gone. \n\"While they're here, do something for them,\" she says. \nBut now, it's almost time for our call to end \u2014 for my family's faces to disappear from the screen. My mom says goodbye. \u201c Z\u00e0iji\u00e0n !\u201d \u201cBye-bye ba ,\u201d my third-oldest aunt says. \nUntil the next call.

Tauseef Mustafa / AFP/Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 12:27 am \nMonths after a tense standoff between China and India along their Himalayan border, Beijing on Thursday expressed anger at an Indian drone that crashed inside its territory. \n\"This action by India violated China's territorial sovereignty. We express strong dissatisfaction and opposition,\" Xinhua cited Zhang Shuili, a senior military official in China's western battle zone command, as saying. \nChina said the drone crashed in \"recent days\" but didn't say where. Zhang said his country would defend its national sovereignty against such intrusions. \nHe said China's border defense forces conducted \"an inspection of the device,\" but didn't elaborate. \nIndia has not responded to the charge. \nAlthough the two countries have made moves toward warmer relations in recent years, they also have a long history of border tensions. In 1962, they fought a brief, but inconclusive border conflict. They have also had ongoing disputes over sovereignty in other border areas, notably Aksai Chin, a Himalayan region that straddles their territorial demarcation in the west. \nThe two countries have also long been at odds over India's hosting of Tibet's government-in-exile and their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, considered by China to be subversive because of his calls for Tibetan independence. \nStarting in June this year, tensions flared again over a disputed region called the Doklam Plateau that borders China, Bhutan and the Indian state of Sikkim. \nAs NPR's Julie McCarthy reported from New Delhi in July , the problems stemmed from China's construction of a road in Doklam Plateau. \"Not far from the plateau lies the narrow passage that connects India's northeast states with the rest of the country \u2014 a strategic link called the Siliguri Corridor but more commonly known as the \"Chicken's Neck. \" Any possibility of China being able to sever that \"neck\" unnerves India. \nAs late as August, India had rushed troops to Doklam Plateau and although an immediate conflict was avoided, heated rhetoric on both sides has soured relations. \nIn September, India's army chief said that his country \"could not afford to be complacent and must be prepared for war,\" according to The Hindustan Times. \nAnd in November, China took umbrage at Indian President Ram Nath Kovind's visit to the remote state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China also claims, Reuters reports.

Scott Barbour / Getty Images Members of Parliament celebrate at Parliament House on Thursday in Canberra, Australia, after the approval of same-sex marriage. Michael Masters / Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 4:50 am \nUpdated at 5:50 a.m. ET \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nMarriage in Australia is now defined as \"the union of two people\" instead of \"union of a man and a woman.\" \nLawmakers had tried and failed some two dozen times in the past to make the change. \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of the 80 percent of registered voters who cast ballots, ensuring that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\" Copyright 2017 NPR.

KUOW Photo/Liz Jones A crowd rallies against the travel ban outside the U.S. District Court of Appeals in Seattle, as a hearing is about to get underway in the case of Hawaii v. Trump. KUOW Photo/Liz Jones \nThe Trump administration told a federal appeals court Wednesday that the president has broad authority to prevent people from any country from traveling to the U.S. \n\u201cThis is precisely what President Carter found with respect to the Iranian hostage crisis and what President Reagan found with respect to a dispute with Cuba,\u201d argued Hashim Mooppan, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the U.S. Justice Department. \nThe case was heard in Seattle before judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. \nIt involves a challenge by the state of Hawaii to the latest version of President Trump\u2019s executive order restricting travel from several majority Muslim countries. \nFormer solicitor general Neal Katyal argued Hawaii's case. \nHe told the judges that the administration has failed to show why people from the eight countries covered in the ban posed a threat. \n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Katyal said. \u201cAnd the national security experts tell you one reason why, which is the individual vetting system is working.\u201d \nMooppan disagreed, noted that the government had conducted a 90-day, multi-agency review, after which Trump determined that certain countries do not provide enough information to sufficiently vet their citizens' backgrounds. \nDuring the hourlong hearing, Judge Ronald Gould posed a hypothetical question to DOJ attorney Mooppan: \n\u201cLet\u2019s say the president sat down with his cabinet and they discussed things and decided the world\u2019s a very dangerous place these days,\u201d Gould said. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s so dangerous that the president decided he\u2019s going to exclude entry from any person from any place in the world if they\u2019re not American citizens.\u201d \nGould asked Mooppan if that decision would be reviewable by the court. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think so, your Honor,\u201d Mooppan replied, noting however that Congress could give courts that authority. \nNeal Katyal forcefully disagreed with Moopan\u2019s interpretation of immigration law. \n\u201cThe idea that the President can ban all immigration from around the world and this court would be powerless to review it, that certainly\u2026is not the constitution of the United States. \nEarlier this week, the U.S. Supreme Court decided to allow the restrictions to take effect pending legal challenges in the 9th and 4th Circuits. The 4th Circuit is scheduled to hear arguments Friday. \nThe same three-judge panel in the 9th Circuit unanimously ruled against Trump's second travel ban. Following Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Judge Gould said they\u2019ll issue a decision on the current ban \u201cas soon as practical,\u201d as the Supreme Court has urged. \nThe story includes reporting from The Associated Press. \u00a9 2017 KUOW News and Information", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "therese macisaac", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mooppan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neal katyal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hashim mooppan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moopan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gould", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reagan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuow photo/liz jones  the trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katyal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronald gould", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. district court", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "9th circuit court of appeals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. district court of appeals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doj", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cuba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:28.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "afccab8a3927943b80fc9aa02cb87d148ca891ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB7zsJhkkaRpHPyf1m93V72sz3NQp8AXf3IrhFs6CnyXmTP0ttV7gElPvVo1LFaVc4Y-", "site_full": "forums.stevehoffman.tv", "site": "stevehoffman.tv", "site_section": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/forums/music-corner.2/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Music Corner | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "title": "Massey Hall favorite concerts", "title_full": "Massey Hall favorite concerts | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "published": "2017-12-05T01:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 23, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/data/avatars/m/69/69246.jpg?1474293188", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19660, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ade5c286e53d006020cd1c974975b6ad1858cdd0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB7zsJhkkaRpHPyf1m93V72sz3NQp8AXf3IrhFs6CnyXmTP0ttV7gElPU73by9.f_bNxg1qXkzhZ5w--", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "Daryl M", "published": "2017-12-05T21:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "The 1/96 Bruce Springsteen concert is arguably the best show I have ever seen.

With French Tea Cakes By Jo Mancuso \u2022 7 hours ago View Slideshow 1 of 2 \nThese Raspberry Almond Tea Cakes are \"easy\" (earning only one-half macaron out of three) and can be filled with frozen berries out of season. As with all \"Modern French Pastry\" recipes, this requires a simple digital scale; you'll crack up when you learn the trick to measuring eggs in grams. \nAlan Weiner View Slideshow 2 of 2 \n\"Modern French Pastry\" by Portlander Cheryl Wakerhauser (also known as Pix) is filled with reimagined dessert classics crafted with bold flavors and textures, from citrusy macarons to the Oregon Get Down tart, which features hazelnut cream and carmelized pears with pear brandy, naturally. \n\"American desserts are two-dimensional and overly sweet,\" like the frosted birthday cake you cut up and share, said Cheryl Wakerhauser, author of the new cookbook \"Modern French Pastry.\" \nNot surprisingly, the French-trained baker prefers French desserts, for their complexity of composition, flavor and texture. A single-serving pastry might have up to five components, including \"a light, airy mousse and a crunchy tart shell. Take a bite and it all comes together in your mouth.\" \nBut \"this book is not about the classics,\" cautioned Wakerhauser, who also answers to the name Pix \u2014 as in Pix Patisserie , her eastside Portland bakery and tapas bar, which also boasts a long Champagne and drinks list. Her cookbook \"is filled with one-of-a-kind desserts you've never seen before,\" she said. Included are Patisserie favorites like Blue Cheese Truffles and the Royale \u2014 \"a simplified mousse in a bowl.\" \nThe book guides home bakers in mastering key techniques and using quality ingredients and proper equipment. \"The trick is that it's all metrics, no cups and spoons,\" she said. \"This is science\" and precision is paramount. If you needed a nudge to buy a simple grams-and-ounces digital kitchen scale, Pix is offering a carrot along with the stick. \nSo isn't French pastry \u2014 well, intimidating? Wakerhauser advises studying the book's reference pages and reading the entire recipe before starting, to avoid surprises. \"I just went into my kitchen with my equipment and wrote down exactly what I did. It will work\" with a little practice, she said. \nOnline you can find a culinary conversion calculator for grams and ounces so you can buy the right amount of almond paste and other ingredients. For further guidance, check modernfrenchpastry.com . \"Don't be shy,\" said Wakerhauser. \"If you have questions, email me on the website. I'm happy to help.\" \nWakerhauser will demo from the book at Kitchen Kaboodle stores Dec. 7 and 8 and Powell's City of Books Dec. 12 (details at the MFP website). \nTips for measuring eggs in metric \n1 large egg equals 50 grams (yolk: 20 grams, white: 30 grams) \nFor the Raspberry Almond Tea Cakes, crack two eggs in a bowl and break them up with a fork, beating lightly until they are pourable. Set a small empty bowl on the digital scale and \"zero it out\"; then carefully pour 70 grams of eggs into it. The additional egg yolk called for should weigh 20 grams. \nRaspberry Almond Tea Cakes \n\"Cute as a button. But tastier. These little almond cakes burst with flavor. That\u2019s why they work so well as petits fours. Serve them at room temperature, but make sure you try one fresh out of the oven. It will melt in your mouth! For this recipe, you will need two 4-centimeter (1-1/2-inch) silicone demisphere molds with 15 cavities per mold.*\" \u2014 Cheryl Wakerhauser \n*Find these at a specialty shop like Sur La Table \nPrep : Less than 10 minutes (plus baking and cooling) | Easy \nAbout 30 (1-1/2- inch) petits fours \nIngredients", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jo mancuso", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alan weiner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "powell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wakerhauser", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cheryl wakerhauser", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portlander cheryl wakerhauser", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "blue cheese truffles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mfp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raspberry almond tea cakes", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "portland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pix patisserie", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:28.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "afccab8a3927943b80fc9aa02cb87d148ca891ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB7zsJhkkaRpHPyf1m93V72sz3NQp8AXf3IrhFs6CnyXmTP0ttV7gElPvVo1LFaVc4Y-", "site_full": "forums.stevehoffman.tv", "site": "stevehoffman.tv", "site_section": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/forums/music-corner.2/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Music Corner | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "title": "Massey Hall favorite concerts", "title_full": "Massey Hall favorite concerts | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "published": "2017-12-05T01:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 23, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/data/avatars/m/69/69246.jpg?1474293188", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19660, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6794e53b33a56de258fbe7f7178eee65e7f87323", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB7zsJhkkaRpHPyf1m93V72sz3NQp8AXf3IrhFs6CnyXmTP0ttV7gElPU73by9.f_bMlJTSCdJ0wRA--", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "streetlegal", "published": "2017-12-05T21:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "qwerty said: \u2191 I have read reports that Dylan's 1980 Massey Hall gospel tour performance was good.

A new report found Seattle has seen an explosion in the number of people experiencing homelessness since 2007. Tom Brandt / Flickr - tinyurl.com/y86h3hza Listening... / \nA six-year-long decline in the number of homeless people in the U.S. reversed in 2017, according to a new report from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The report said that was largely because of rising homeless populations on the West Coast. \nThe findings were based on annual one-night counts of people who are homeless, which occur every year in the last 10 days of January. \nIn the Pacific Northwest, the report shows the homeless crisis is affecting cities and towns disproportionately. \nOver the past decade, Seattle and King County have seen an explosion in the number of people experiencing homelessness. The count in January found more 11,643 people in the Seattle area who are homeless, a 47 percent increase from 2007. \nAlmost half of those people are living unsheltered\u2014in tents, doorways, under freeways, and in vehicles. This year\u2019s count found 5,485 people unsheltered in the Seattle area, an increase of 247 percent from 2007. \n\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect storm,\u201d said Alison Eisinger, executive director of the Seattle King County Coalition on Homelessness. \n\u201cWe have wages nowhere near matching increased housing costs,\u201d she explained. \u201cThere\u2019s been a significant decrease in public benefits that help people stay afloat.\u201d Other factors at play include a lack of mental health services and inadequate supports for people with disabilities. \nAccording to the HUD report, other Northwest cities actually experienced a decrease in overall homelessness. \nEugene, Everett, Spokane, Tacoma, and Vancouver, Washington, all reported fewer people experiencing homelessness than a decade ago. But in almost all of those cities, a greater percentage of the remaining homeless population is living unsheltered, which may be why you see more people living on the streets. \nThe homeless population in Portland has edged up about 7 percent since 2007. But the number of people living unsheltered has remained about the same at around 500. Copyright 2017 Northwest News Network.

speaks after House Republicans held a closed-door strategy session on Capitol Hill in Washington. The Republican-led House passed a bill to make it easier for gun owners to legally carry concealed weapons across state lines. J. Scott Applewhite / AP Originally published on December 6, 2017 11:43 pm \nThe House approved a bill on Wednesday that would ease legal restrictions for carrying concealed firearms across state lines \u2013 a move pushed by the National Rifle Association that comes just weeks after mass shootings in Las Vegas and Texas. \nOn a mostly party-line vote, the measure easily passed, 231-198, although 14 Republicans voted no. Six Democrats voted for the so-called reciprocity measure, which would allow a gun owner with the proper permit in any state to carry a concealed firearm to another state where it is also legal. \nThe bill now goes to the Senate, where it is likely to encounter a much tougher battle. \nIn the House version, GOP lawmakers added a measure aimed at strengthening tracking in the national background-check database of legal and mental health records that might prevent some gun purchases. Just last month it was revealed that Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman who killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., legally purchase firearms used in the attack despite a record of domestic assault in the Air Force that should have disqualified him. \nHowever, as The New York Times reports: \"... the background check measure was not enough to win over most Democrats, nor did it persuade law enforcement officials in some of the largest cities, including New York, who say the legislation would force locales with strict gun laws to bow to places with few or no gun restrictions.\" \nThe bill angered many Democrats who argued that following mass shootings that have killed 80 people, the times called for stricter, not looser gun measures. \nConnecticut Democrat Rep. Elizabeth Esty \u2014 who represents Newtown, Conn., where 20 first-graders and six teachers and staff were killed in a 2012 mass shooting \u2013 said the bill would undermine states' rights, \"hamstring law enforcement and allow dangerous criminals to walk around with hidden guns anywhere and at any time. It's unspeakable that this is Congress' response to the worst gun tragedies in American history,\" according to The Associated Press. \nThe NRA's executive director, Chris Cox, is quoted in the Times as saying Thursday's vote is a \"watershed\" for Second Amendment rights and that the bill would ensure \"all law-abiding citizens in our great country can protect themselves in the manner they see fit without accidentally running afoul of the law.\" \nIn the Senate, supporters would likely need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster by Democrats.

Cleanup on the oil spill and charred rail cars continued into the weekend. \nEmily Schwing \nChris Hooper, right, of White Salmon watches the fire caused by a derailed oil train in Mosier, Oregon, near Hood River in the Columbia River Gorge on Friday, June 3, 2016. \nJohn Sepulvado \nThe Trump administration is rolling back a requirement for trains carrying highly explosive liquids \u2014 like the oil trains that run through the Columbia River Gorge en route to Northwest refineries. \nThe 2015 rule was supposed to make these hazardous trains more safe, following a number of derailments. But that was under President Obama, Now, President Trump's Department of Transportation says railroads with trains carrying highly flammable liquids will not have to update their braking systems. \n\u201cThe costs of this mandate would exceed three-fold the benefits it would produce,\u201d the DOT said in a statement \u2014 that\u2019s according to studies by the National Academy of Sciences\u2019 Transportation Research Board and the U.S. Government Accountability Office . \nObama-era regulations required railroad companies to install electronically controlled pneumatic brakes by 2021. Those new systems were supposed to help prevent fiery crashes, like last year\u2019s derailment in Mosier, Oregon. ECP brakes are supposed to brake faster because they signal instantaneously throughout the train. \nThe current industry-standard air brake technology has been in use for more than a century and had been involved in the deadly Lac Megantic derailment in 2013. \nOregon Sen. Jeff Merkley criticized the decision. \n\u201cOil trains are rolling explosion hazards, and as we\u2019ve seen all too many times\u2014and all too recently in Mosier\u2014it\u2019s not a question of \u2018if\u2019 but \u2018when\u2019 oil train derailments will occur. Degrading oil train safety requirements is a huge step backward and one that puts our land, homes, and lives at risk,\u201d Merkley said in a statement. \nIndustry groups applauded the decision. Chet Thompson, president and CEO of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, called the rollback a \u201crational decision.\u201d \n\u201cWhile we support the use of improved safety technologies, (electronically controlled pneumatic) isn\u2019t an improvement on other technologies currently in use, and would have imposed substantial costs to shippers,\u201d Thompson said in a news release. \nConservation groups in the Northwest said the rollback was frustrating, but unsurprising. Dan Serres is the conservation director with Columbia Riverkeeper. \n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely frustrated that the Trump administration is weakening standards that are not strong enough to begin with,\u201d Serres said. \u201cWe saw that with the Moiser derailment, potentially if there was a better braking system in place, we wouldn\u2019t have seen so many cars come off the tracks.\u201d \nSerres said his group is now more committed to stopping oil terminal construction in the Northwest, if the federal government isn\u2019t \u201cholding the rail industry\u2019s feet to the fire to improve the safety of these shipments.\u201d \nCopyright 2017 EarthFix.

So far, it has brought in $2.2 million. \nThat\u2019s a tiny fraction \u2014 one tenth of 1 percent \u2014 of the $1.5 billion the Portland Bureau of Transportation estimates it would cost to pave the city\u2019s 50 miles of dirt and gravel roads and fix the 200 miles of streets that lack sidewalks and curbs. \nTo stretch the extremely limited funds, Portland\u2019s Bureau of Transportation has proposed partnering with the Bureau of Environmental Services. BES funds improvements to city streets to manage and minimize polluted stormwater runoff. \nThe two agencies would issue $10 million in bonds to get the paving work started, with the bonds paid back over time using the fee dollars and BES funds. \nPBOT had proposed focusing the first $10 million chunk of paving work in three neighborhoods it identified as priorities: Cully and Division-Midway on Portland\u2019s east side and Tryon-Stephens on the west side. \nEach of those neighborhoods has a relatively high concentration of unimproved streets, and had already worked with the city to develop plans that prioritize residential street improvements. They also scored high on an equity measure, which identified blocks in the city with low-income residents, racial and ethnic diversity and higher numbers of renters. \nBut, after reviewing maps that showed proposed work for 2018, Mayor Ted Wheeler expressed concern that the result would be piecemeal road-building projects that wouldn\u2019t be cost-effective for the city. \n\u201cI\u2019m no great construction expert, so I could be totally out to lunch here, but it seems to me there\u2019s efficiencies and economies to doing the whole area, as opposed to picking and choosing little pieces,\u201d Wheeler said. \nPBOT staff responded that there simply wasn\u2019t enough funding to take a more comprehensive approach. \nWheeler suggested that the agency would be better served by concentrating on improving the streets in one neighborhood at a time. \n\u201cWhy not do more in a given area, in one year, and then move on to the next area the subsequent year?\u201d he asked. \n\u201cAny advice, support, direction you can provide, we\u2019d be happy to hear. It\u2019s hard because we don\u2019t have many resources,\u201d said Ann Hill, a program manager with the Bureau of Transportation. \nThe allocation proposal also entirely left out one of Portland\u2019s most notoriously under-paved neighborhoods: Brentwood Darlington. \n\u201cOnce again, we\u2019re left off the map,\u201d said Chelsea Powers, chair of the neighborhood association, urging them to address the gravel roads. \n\u201cOur neighborhood is home to over five miles of them that literally trap our neighborhoods in their homes in poor weather, with potholes the size of a sedan,\u201d Powers said. \nThe Portland Bureau of Transportation has also asked the City Council to consider changing the formula that\u2019s used to calculate the Local Transportation Infrastructure Charge. \nThe charge applies to infill developers or property owners who build new homes on lots with gravel and dirt roads. \nIt\u2019s currently a flat fee of $600 per foot of frontage on a gravel or unimproved street. PBOT said in some situations, particularly large corner lots, the fee has hindered development. The agency has proposed capping the charge and exempting affordable housing developments. \nWith the caps, the maximum charge would range from $30,000 for a small R5 residential lot to $120,000 for a larger RF-zoned residential lot. \nProperty owners testified in support of capping the fee and called on the City Council to create an appeals process for special cases. \n\nThe city\u2019s ombudsman, Margie Sollinger, and Equity Manager Dante James have also raised concerns about the Local Transportation Infrastructure Charge. They sent a joint letter to the commissioners this week, asking them to ensure the fee isn\u2019t a burden for low-income homeowners. \n\u201cAs currently designed, the LTIC program does not have a low-income exception nor is there any financing available to property owners who cannot afford it,\u201d they wrote. \nSollinger and James recounted the example of an elderly cook at a local school district who owns and lives in an aging manufactured home in Southeast Portland, on a lot alongside an unimproved street. \nShe took out a loan to buy a new manufactured home, but when she applied for a permit from the city she was told that installing the new home would require she pay the LTIC an additional $54,000. \nPBOT ultimately reversed its decision and didn\u2019t make her pay the infrastructure charge, but Sollinger and James said other low-income homeowners could face similarly overwhelming charges. \n\u201cSimply stated, a policy that treats everyone equally does not result in equity,\u201d they wrote. \nPortland Transportation Commissioner Dan Saltzman said he will ask PBOT to continue to refine its proposals and will bring the Local Transportation Infrastructure Charge back to the council for consideration in January or February.

Ishiguro also answers questions about being an international writer in translation, saying, \u201cMy idea of an international story isn\u2019t someone who gets on planes a lot; it\u2019s universal because it\u2019s something human that people of all cultures can relate to.\u201d He goes on to discuss experiences from his life that have motivated him to take up specific themes. \nBio: \nKazuo Ishiguro\u2019s seven published books have won him numerous honors and wide renown. His work has been translated into more than 40 languages. Both \"The Remains of the Day\" and \"Never Let Me Go\" have more than 1,000,000 copies in print across platforms, and both were adapted into highly acclaimed films. His most recent novel is \"The Buried Giant.\" (source: Random House) Copyright 2017 Oregon Public Broadcasting. To see more, visit Oregon Public Broadcasting .
