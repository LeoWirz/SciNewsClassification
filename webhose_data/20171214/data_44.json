2018 at IFEMA \u2013 Feria de Madrid, Spain, partner country \u2013 India will exhibit its tourism as one of its leading-edge sectors with some of the highest business possibilities. With 7% economic growth, India presents a key market for worldwide investments and economic relations and is inviting companies to invest, especially those from industries where the country is a leading global power, prominent among them infrastructures, rail transport and tourism. This collaboration provides a close tie by linking India brand to the international tourism trade fair, allowing the new FITUR partner, whose presence has increased more than 30% at the fair, to make the most of the event\u2019s exceptional promotional potential and capitalise on it. In this way, the Asian country, under the slogan of \u2018Incredible India\u2019, will enjoy an important international showcase for promoting the destination. Last year was the 60th Anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between Spain and India. Both countries are now forging ever closer ties through this alliance.

(\u0093ConnecPath\u0094) announced today that education champion Muhammed Chaudhry has joined them as an advisor.\nMilpitas, CA, December 07, 2017 --( PR.com )-- Chaudhry is a leader in changing the way people think about education. As president and CEO of the Silicon Valley Education Foundation (\u201cSVEF\u201d), he revolutionized the way people understand and respond to the critical need of improving schools to create the next generation of innovators and business leaders.\nUnder Mr. Chaudhry\u2019s leadership, SVEF became the go-to education foundation supporting students, teachers, and families throughout Silicon Valley and beyond. The foundation\u2019s signature program, Elevate Math, has partnered with 45 school districts and involved 11,500 students, not only in Silicon Valley, but also in Oakland, Sacramento and Oregon. Mr. Chaudhry and the SVEF foundation remain focused on new and innovative ways for students to learn while closing the achievement gap - especially for under-represented and minority students.\nFor much of his career, Mr. Chaudhry has immersed himself in educational causes, looking to unite the business, technology, and academic communities to advance those causes. After completing his undergraduate degree in business, Mr. Chaudhry worked in the private sector as a brand marketer with the Clorox Company and Dazzle Multimedia. Despite private sector success, Mr. Chaudhry\u2019s passion for philanthropy, and for causes that touched children\u2019s lives, drew him back to the non-profit sector.\nMr. Chaudhry joined SVEF in 2001, and spent the next 16 years placing SVEF on the map by forging successful partnerships with world leading firms including Oracle, Cisco, Google, HP, SAP, Target, and Walmart. Since 2008 Mr. Chaudhry has raised over $100 million for numerous education initiatives.\nUnder Mr. Chaudhry\u2019s leadership, SVEF developed successful math and science support programs, which improved the skills and performance of more than 10,000 students. These programs have become a national model. Notably, Mr. Chaudhry led efforts to create SVEF\u2019s Innovation Learning Hub (\u201ciHub\u201d), designed to align education software developers and classroom teachers to test the best products. In partnership with the San Francisco 49ers, Mr. Chaudhry also helped create the 49ers STEM Leadership Institute - which annually exposes 60 high-performing middle school students to a top-level program in STEM education.\nAbout ConnecPath Inc.\nConnecPath is an ed-tech company revolutionizing how students build education and career pathways. Students have historically had to make important decisions about college and careers independently and with limited information. No longer. ConnecPath\u2019s next-generation collaboration platform brings the power of artificial intelligence to students and educators, putting an end to that uncomfortable journey. With ConnecPath, students find pathways that fit their individual passions and competencies with amazing speed. ConnecPath was founded in September 2017 and is headquartered in Silicon Valley.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "muhammed chaudhry joins connecpath", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "muhammed chaudhry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chaudhry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecpath", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walmart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "svef", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley education foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecpath inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clorox company and dazzle multimedia", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milpitas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sacramento", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oakland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ca", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:09:34.104+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eeefc48c45f0fc3ce34902e5db1d1b1b0d5ecb28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRzlB.3lY..GwbCvKuuYhLJ8KiWEZqEPPqzLGCuo2iC5kkJ2nHfGieOaxzOo91Cw3w-", "site_full": "forums.overclockers.co.uk", "site": "overclockers.co.uk", "site_section": "http://forums.overclockers.co.uk/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Overclockers UK Forums", "title": "Amp for retro gaming...", "title_full": "Amp for retro gaming... | Overclockers UK Forums", "published": "2017-12-05T07:23:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forums.overclockers.co.uk/styles/default/xenforo/avatars/avatar_male_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13599, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5f788d1695ad59ece60b4347f216ad1d57d1c692", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRzlB.3lY..GwbCvKuuYhLJ8KiWEZqEPPqzLGCuo2iC5kkJ2nHfGieO9DuyMkePpRIns5aygqxtRA--", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "chaparral", "published": "2017-12-05T11:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Housey said: \u2191 That's the sort of thing, but is that going to cost me 2K or something as frankly, even with my flash socks, is a lot of money to make a NES sound good Click to expand...

We had a ground level room and whereas the resort is older, our rooms were clean. Had a really nice maid, Christine, who really gave us great service. Her day off, however, no one showed to make up our room even after we requested it. Food was good, though, frequently not hot enough on the buffet, which was concerning and something they should work at. Specialty restaurants were generally good. Tepanyaki chief might have been new as he starting dishing up the meal early, so again, the food was somewhat lukewarm. Mexican restaurant had good guacamole and cerviche. Fish I ordered was a bit fishy tasting but I am pretty picky about seafood. It was nice having an adult pool with swim up bar. I enjoyed Natasha's water aerobics. She found some muscles I was unaware of. The wait staff was generally very friendly and accommodating and enjoyed interacting with them. Check in was very quick, but after I got home, I noticed that a $200 NOT $20 charge was put on my credit card. Pretty sure a typo and now hoping it will be corrected when they do the credit as we did not charge anything while there. The beach was nice though I got a few sand flea bites which typically happens in the Carribean. It was a bit windy during our stay with some intermittent rain but we still enjoyed plenty of sun and warmth.

We had an island view room, which faced the ocean a little which was nice, but it also faced the rundown hotel next door that was being worked on, but what can you do. For the hotel itself, the rooms were nice as well as the lobby. The layout to get to the rooms was a bit odd, you had to walk an entire U shape to get to your room which was a bit of a pain when our room was on the end. The day before we left, they were tearing up the pool bar and pool next to it. It probably would have been good if the hotel staff warned you it would be closed bc nobody knew. For the all-inclusive part, the food was mediocore. We didnt have anything amazing, and most of the time the food was cold which was a dissapointment. Half the food options need a reservation, and after trying the tapas bar (terrible) we decided to just stick to the buffet. We liked the breakfast - great spread and lots of options, as well as to-order omelettes and smoothies. Lunch was decent also, dinner was generally the most dissapointing for us.

There are not a lot of activities going on because it is a small resort.

I only ran into one disgruntled employee, otherwise the staff was friendly and helpful. They were making improvements and renovations because the building is a little run down but not that noticeably. They have extra water activities you can rent at the beach (or are free for The Level), such as kayaks, paddle boards, wake boards and jet skis (additional cost even for Level). They have both land and water basketball and volleyball. The Cilantro restaurant is excellent and the O Grille was good. I would order room service for dinner, included in The Level, over the Marketplace. I didn't eat at the other restaurants. Read the Eco placard for info on new towels and linens for each day.

The tips in this article can provide you with what you need to know, in order to choose a good life insurance policy.\nWhen shopping for life insurance, be sure to know the differences between the two main types: term life and permanent. Term life is a chosen amount of years that your benefactors are eligible to receive your insurance money. If you outlive these years, then the plan is void. Permanent life insurance stays with you until you die, but rates will generally be higher.\nSave money on your policy by cleaning up your bad habits and improving your health. Your policy will be priced based upon your risk class, which is determined by many different health factors. Losing excess weight, quitting smoking and getting your cholesterol in check, will reduce your premiums.\nA person should not wait until they are sick to consider life insurance. Many preexisting conditions can make you ineligible for a life insurance policy. If you are eligible, premiums will likely be higher than they would be for a healthy individual. Taking out a policy while you\u2019re healthy is the best way to protect yourself, and your family.\nHaving a life insurance policy can be a nice way to leave money for the family that you are leaving behind. why not try this out can help out greatly to assist your family\u2019s needs. The right life insurance policy can give an individual a wonderful peace of mind, knowing that his or her family is going to be okay, financially.\nIf you\u2019re naming someone close to you as a beneficiary of your policy, make sure you inform them of it so that they\u2019re ready to act when you pass. This kind of news thrust on people after you\u2019re gone is not good for anyone. Make sure http://www.14news.com/story/36936727/news bring it to their attention while you still can.\nPremiums can vary up to 40 percent between companies. There are websites that offer comparative quotes from a range of companies. You want to use one, though, that includes medical information when figuring quotes for you.\nYour broker should be able to knowledgeably answer these difficult questions. You will want to ask if you can renew the policy, cancel the policy, or any questions concerning premium guarantees. Asking these specific questions will help you find the best policy.\nA lot of people with no dependents believe that they do not need life insurance. Well, someone has to bury you. You have some family or friends somewhere, and you probably do not want to burden them financially on top of grief. Even if it\u2019s a small policy, it\u2019s better than purchasing nothing at all.\nLook at the rating for the life insurance company that you are interested in purchasing from. You may be wasting your money if you do not get a policy from a company with a secure background. You want to find a business with at least an \u201cA\u201d rating.\n\ngo to this website should think about life insurance even if you do not earn any income. For instance, if you are a stay-at-home mom, subscribing to life insurance guarantees you that your family will be able to hire someone to take care of the housekeeping and also look after your children while your husband keeps working.\nTo save money on your life insurance, make adjustments to your policy as your needs grow and change. Good times to reevaluate your policy are after getting married or divorced, after having a child or after gaining care-taking responsibilities for an elderly parent or relative. If you have saved enough for retirement and have no one else to take care of, you can forgo life insurance entirely.\nLook over your life insurance policy each year. Every time you experience a major life event, there is a possibility that something in the plan will need to be changed. For example, if you have a baby, you may need to increase your policy so that your family will have what they need if you should die.\nDo not buy an accidental death policy in addition to your regular policy. This is a sign that you are dealing with a company that puts their needs before yours. Find a company that will pay out any claims regardless of whether the death was accidental or of natural causes.\nIf you are not wanting to turn your life insurance into an investment, then term life insurance might be your best option. Term life insurance does not accumulate any cash value; instead, it is a fixed payout available upon death only, set by a fixed premium price each month. This type of insurance is what you are looking for if you want basic life insurance.\nThe question of when to buy life insurance is frequently asked. Since the purpose of life insurance is to replace your income in the situation that you die, you should purchase insurance when you have dependents. The type and kind of life insurance will depend on your specific situation and how much money you will need to ensure that your dependents are taken care of.\nIt can be trying to listen to so-called experts give you their opinion on life insurance.

Check in process took about 10 minutes, we chose the All inclusive route so we got a bracelet that stated that to the staff members and received a $400 credit booklet. You have to make reservations for the restaurants in Melia (you are given 2 days ahead to book). That reservation desk is open from 9am - 5 pm i believe. Black Angus is not apart of the All Inclusive deals. If you are hungry and it is after 11pm (when room service closes) you can head down to the tapas bar where they will be serving a small, yet delicious menu until 3am. There was always something fun to do in the lobby area at night and during the day (dancing, music, comedy show, games). The hotel did not offer food services on the beach, but they did offer drinks! We used our $150 room upgrade from the $400 credit booklet and used it to get the oceanview room (SO WORTH!). The view was so pretty and you can hear the ocean and music. At night it is not loud or anything! The hotel room was very clean and the staff comes by to make the bed and restock the mini fridge for you during the day (usually while everyone is away at the beach). There is a safe in the room and they also had coffee maker. If you get bored just relaxing you can take the FREE shuttle bus to Baha Mar they have casino and restaurants there.

It is quite intense in these positions, so that\u2019s why I decided to do this.\u201d\nNone of that is untrue but this was felt like a statement selection from the manager.\n\"Can you imagine Gerrard being left out in such a game?\" was a regular reaction as the news filtered through.\nLiverpool were so dominant in a 7-0 win that could have been double that, it's difficult to argue that Henderson instead of Emre Can would not have resulted in just as significant a victory.\nHenderson is Liverpool's captain - but is he really a first choice central midfielder? (Image: Getty) But with Can still debating where his future lies, perhaps Klopp wanted to remind his German compatriot that he is at the heart of big Liverpool games now - and can be in the future.\nHenderson has of course been at the centre of perhaps some of the most heated debates among supporters this season.\nFor some, collapses like the second half at Sevilla have been placed firmly at the door of the team captain. Others see the arrival of Naby Keita at the end of the year - Leipzig didn't make the last 16 by the way - as spelling the end for his life as first choice in a Liverpool team.\nIf so, this selection may be seen by some as \"the beginning of the end\".\nJurgen Klopp celebrates last night's win (Image: Action Images via Reuters) That however remains unlikely and Klopp was keen to play down his omission after the game.\n\"I could have made three or four different line-ups in midfield alone. If Alberto (Moreno) is out for a few games, I don't know, so of course we have Robbo (Andy Robertson) and Millie, that's all good.\n\"But we need the players, all of them, we need freshness.\n\"I can imagine that someone tomorrow will make a story that Jordan Henderson the captain was not involved.\n\"I have to make hard decisions. Tonight it was like this, it was nothing. Hendo will play the next game (Merseyside derby) 100 per cent. He could have started tonight but we had to make a decision and that's what we did.\nNaby Keita is joining Liverpool in the summer (Image: 2017 Getty Images) \"When it works then everything is good and if not you write it the other way around, that'd how life is.\"\nHenderson in his Skipper's Notes in the programme spoke about that battle for places at Anfield.\n\"The competition for places in our team is really strong at the moment and it's going to be vitally important we keep it that way over the coming weeks and months if we're to keep winning,\" he said.\nJordan Henderson isn't one to walk away from a battle, but one thing is for sure, he's got one on his hands.\npoll loading Who will win Sunday's Merseyside Derby? 13000+ VOTES SO FAR Liverpool Everton Draw for me, Jeff!

It also recognises the growing need for the USD 150bn-worth global express delivery industry to be more efficient.\nHow It Works\nLivingPackets uses a concept, which is still very new in the logistics & delivery industry, but is seen by its founders as the most obvious solution in the age of the Sharing Economy and P2P (peer-to-peer) services. It harnesses individual traveller networks and its patented \u201cintelligent\u201d bags (featuring a camera, shock and temperature sensors, real-time tracking, electronic lock and Bluetooth) without compromising a delivery\u2019s safety and security. A sender books a delivery via the LivingPackets mobile app, and deposits the item himself or asks for a pick up. The item is then delivered to a designated point near the international train terminal at Kings Cross St Pancras and is placed in a secure bag by the LivingPackets security operators (called \u201cthe Guardians\u201d). A traveller participating in the LivingPackets network is automatically notified and will pick up the bag on his way to the platform. The process is fully automated and takes just a few hours from the pick-up to delivery.\nA New Model: Profit-Sharing\nAdditionally, the LivingPackets\u2019 profit sharing business model is in itself a novelty in the world of startup fundraising practices: the investors who support the business via crowdfunding receive 50% of the profits. To date, the startup has raised EUR 80k.\n\u201cWe are very happy to be working with LivingPackets, whose innovative delivery model will now allow us to offer a Premium service to all our clients to deliver their belongings to Paris in just a few hours and at a reasonable price,\u201d said Salvatore Bartolone, Head Concierge at St Pancras Renaissance.\n\u201cWe are proud to be a trusted partner of St Pancras Renaissance Hotel, an iconic luxury brand in the European hospitality industry, and we are close to reaching agreements with other top-market industry names. We also see a huge demand for fast, affordable and reliable deliveries from online retailers and luxury brands. With no existing alternative to the established and aging international logistics practices, there is a lot of room for young and disruptive \u2018sharing economy\u2019 players like LivingPackets to step in,\u201d said Marie Le Page, LivingPackets CEO in the UK.\nAbout LivingPackets\nLivingPackets is a European tech startup that is looking to improve and change the world of express deliveries. It offers the fastest, most reliable and most affordable international delivery services to date, using individual traveller\u2019s networks and its unique patented traceable bags. LivingPackets contributes to a greener and fairer world thanks to its unique profit-sharing model, smart technology and its environment- friendly approach.

Website \nRed Billed Queleas are indigenous to most parts of Southern Africa, however they are migratory birds within their range. The main reason for their migrations is for food. In many parts these birds can fly in huge flocks consisting of many thousands of individuals. Because of this and the fact that they can do large scale damage to grain crops they are often seen as a pest and have earned a nickname of \u201cFeathered Locusts\u201d. Sadly in many areas these birds are even poisoned with pesticide to try control their numbers. \nHowever in our urban gardens they are a welcome burst of colour, cute chirps and lively activity. Every afternoon my neighbours put seeds out for the birds and I get to watch around 50 of these Sparrow sized birds playing in their tree. Let\u2019s enjoy these little birdies for as long as they choose to visit our gardens.

The ordinance, which is patterned after a similar law in Richmond, has been strongly supported by Mayor Bryan Conklin and Police Chief Cobie Wells. \nWells, who also serves as the city public safety director, said this ordinance will be another valuable tool in battling drugs. \n\u201cI\u2019m excited about the drug nuisance ordinance,\u201d Wells enthused. \u201cIt\u2019s giving law enforcement and the city a chance to work with the landlords. That ordinance meets the goal of evicting these individuals (drug offenders).\u201d \nThe ordinance itself also clearly states its intention: The sale and use of illegal drugs is a serious problem in the Union City community; the city of Union City desires to stop the sale and use of illegal drugs within the community; and it is thus desirable to eliminate the repeated sale and use of illegal drugs from any given location. \nUnder this section of Union City code, the use of non-owner occupied real property to commit an act constituting an offense under Indiana code shall be deemed a civil nuisance. \nThe ordinance states that no owner of real estate located in the city shall knowingly allow it to be used in such a manner to constitute a civil nuisance. An owner of such real estate is deemed to have knowledge of such activity upon receipt of notice. \nUpon notice of any report or complaint of such suspected activity, the Union City Police Dept. shall conduct such investigation as it deems necessary. At any time prior to or during this investigation, the department shall, when deemed appropriate under the circumstances, send an initial warning letter to the owner and/or occupant to the property that it suspects such activity may be occurring and that an investigation is about to commence or is ongoing. \nThe ordinance also is intended to as sist landlords with evicting these drug offenders. The chief of police shall use reasonable efforts to train, educate and assist real estate owners in evicting, as well as avoiding the placement of tenants in their real estate who are known violators. \nRENTAL PROPERTY STANDARDS \nWells also spoke in support of an ordinance governing rental property standards, which was approved on first reading. \n\u201cI\u2019m ready for an ordinance like this,\u201d the chief elaborated. \u201cI think we need to take a stronger stance on some of the properties out there. We need this. We\u2019re looking forward to this. It will help us, and it will help Union City. To sell Union City and get businesses in here, we have to do this.\u201d \nThat ordinance will be considered on second and final reading at the next city council meeting. \nTRASH REMOVAL RATE INCREASES \nCouncil members also approved the first reading of an ordinance amending trash removal rates from the current $11 per month to $12.50 per month. It was noted that the city has been paying BestWay more than $11 per household, per month for the past two years. \nGRANT APPLICATION UPDATE \nCity manager Monte Poling reported on the progress of some grant applications and projects. \n\u201cWe\u2019re getting the engineering done on some of the Stellar projects,\u201d Poling said. \nSuch projects included the downtown streetscape phase II, the Plum Street sidewalk project and the trail from Columbia Street to Harter Park. \nPRAISE FOR LIGHT DISPLAY \nThe mayor and council members also praised the efforts of council member Chad Spence and others involved with the Christmas light displays at Harter Park. \nThe next Union City, Ind., council meeting will be 6 p.m. Monday in council chambers.
