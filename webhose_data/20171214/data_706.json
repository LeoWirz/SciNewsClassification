The small Raspberry Pi style mini PC is available with 1,2 or 4 GB of DDR 4 RAM and is equipped with a quad-core 64-bit ARM processor USB 3.0 connections and Gigabit Ethernet. The supported by 1GB of RAM version iOS priced at $35, while the 2 GB version is priced at $45 and the 4 GB version is a little more expensive at $70. Both of which support mainline Linux and Android 7.1 Nougat operating systems. Libre Computer explain more about their new mini PC. \nRenegade is our first board to feature DDR4 technology, USB 3.0 capability, and Gigabit Ethernet. This modern and powerful platform shares the same form factor as the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B minus one USB port. It features both mainline Linux and Android 7.1 Nougat Support. Like all of our boards, it is designed completely with open-market components. \nThe Libre Computer Project is a brand rather than a manufacturer. We carefully select manufacturing partners and designs to make sure that the platform as a whole will meet our requirements for open-source support and maintenance. We shy away from proprietary interfaces, vendor lock-in, and \u201csecret saucy\u201d magic because we feel strongly that those things are only redundancies hindering progress. \nWe are expanding our lineup to cover popular solutions in use today. We want to continue to simplify education, accelerate product development, and facilitate the inception of other technologies. Reducing barriers to entry is part of our mission. \nTogether with our partners, it is our goal to provide reliable and long-term supported platforms that you can depend on to create even more innovative products and services. We are open to cooperative ventures with companies willing to offer the same level of care and attention to their products throughout its lifecycle. \nTo make a pledge to be one of the first to own the Renegade mini PC jump over to the official Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign page by following the link below for a full list of all available pledges and specifications.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "julian horsey", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "libre computer renegate", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "libre computer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "libre computer project", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:50.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "de105e3e3d24cdfb1f46e495aeee16cd47b4dbfa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRmNKuSSMJvw75VVy.PPZC0DSqNpqxqn1HrNBaaioTxGkkefBtMWXvZ", "site_full": "www.ozbargain.com.au", "site": "ozbargain.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.ozbargain.com.au/forum/30", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Automotive: Discussion Forum - OzBargain Forums", "title": "Hi guys, who is in the right in this picture?

You're looking at it wrong. There's no moral dilemma at all.\nThe main business of a star is to produce light, right? But very little of that light actually falls upon a world. Most of it just radiates out into the vacuum. If I were a star, I'd really like more of my energy to be harnessed toward useful ends.\nAnd what do they lose? Radiating into the blackness of interstellar space, radiating into the blackness of a solar collection array, who cares? Contact with the other stars? The sight of their planets? Really? You think stars communicate, over billions of miles, and that they can see the pinpricks of their companions through the glare of their own light? No way.\nI'm fine with spiritualism, but it has to have some basis in reality. So think about it from a thermodynamics point of view. The job of stars is to create a temporary breach in the dominance of entropy, to force open a beachhead against the powers of entropy, chaos, and death, so that life can grow and evolve under their protection. That's what they've been doing for billions of years. That's their purpose. If we mortals can increase the efficiency of that process, ensure that more of their energy goes towards the eternal battle for life to exist... why the hell not.\nSo yes. Dam a star. Dam a few. Use their Light to fight back the Prethoryn, to reclaim all the planets and resurrect them with new life. Like I said, spiritualism is all fine and dandy, but we're faced with giving a much-needed tune-up to the clockworks of the Galaxy. Anyone that knows physics knows that entropy will win. That at some point, all the stars will cease to shine and the last living thing will draw its last breath. And then the universe will be plunged into darkness and silence forever. We have an obligation to stave off that fate as much as possible, by using every photon emitted by every star to the best possible end. So get that Dyson sphere up and running as soon as possible .\nStart with type O and A giants with no planets for maximum risk/reward.\n+1", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:50.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e55005418b948ec6577c07252ac5986720a6cf6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZmJZJly5Qy.6L1dUn.cjsEa", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/int/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/int/ - International - 4chan", "title": "What do you think about Spain?", "title_full": "/int/ - What do you think about Spain?

You're looking at it wrong. There's no moral dilemma at all.\nThe main business of a star is to produce light, right? But very little of that light actually falls upon a world. Most of it just radiates out into the vacuum. If I were a star, I'd really like more of my energy to be harnessed toward useful ends.\nAnd what do they lose? Radiating into the blackness of interstellar space, radiating into the blackness of a solar collection array, who cares? Contact with the other stars? The sight of their planets? Really? You think stars communicate, over billions of miles, and that they can see the pinpricks of their companions through the glare of their own light? No way.\nI'm fine with spiritualism, but it has to have some basis in reality. So think about it from a thermodynamics point of view. The job of stars is to create a temporary breach in the dominance of entropy, to force open a beachhead against the powers of entropy, chaos, and death, so that life can grow and evolve under their protection. That's what they've been doing for billions of years. That's their purpose. If we mortals can increase the efficiency of that process, ensure that more of their energy goes towards the eternal battle for life to exist... why the hell not.\nSo yes. Dam a star. Dam a few. Use their Light to fight back the Prethoryn, to reclaim all the planets and resurrect them with new life. Like I said, spiritualism is all fine and dandy, but we're faced with giving a much-needed tune-up to the clockworks of the Galaxy. Anyone that knows physics knows that entropy will win. That at some point, all the stars will cease to shine and the last living thing will draw its last breath. And then the universe will be plunged into darkness and silence forever. We have an obligation to stave off that fate as much as possible, by using every photon emitted by every star to the best possible end.

That could limit Freeport\u2019s sale to a 9.36 percent stake. \nSuch a deal could be \u201ca win-win-win for Freeport, Rio and Indonesia as value leakage for Freeport would be less than expected, Rio would be able to exit a business that is non-core and high risk, and Indonesia would own a majority stake in Grasberg,\u201d Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina said. \n\u201cThis would be an elegant solution to a complex problem, and a positive for Freeport,\u201d he said in a note to clients. \nFreeport\u2019s shares came off earlier lows to end down 1.3 percent, down less than other copper miners as copper had its biggest drop in two years. Rio\u2019s shares were down 2 percent. \n\u201cAccording to the state-owned enterprise ministry, they are willing in principle,\u201d Jonan said, referring to Freeport and Rio. \nA Melbourne-based spokesman for Rio declined to comment. Freeport Indonesia and the head office in Phoenix also declined to comment. Budi Gunadi Sadikin, chief executive of PT Inalum, Indonesia\u2019s state-owned mining holding company tipped to acquire the stakes, declined to comment. \nJonan said the drafting of an agreement had begun and the state-owned enterprise ministry and other government bodies aim to complete the acquisition in 2018, along with new fiscal terms in a special mining permit to replace Freeport\u2019s Grasberg contract. \nHe said the government \u201cwill maintain the valuation that we believe is correct,\u201d referring to a price of between $6 billion and $7 billion for Freeport\u2019s Indonesian unit. \nA review of two decades of annual reports shows Rio\u2019s capital expenditures on Grasberg reached nearly $2 billion, while its net profit adds up to just $1.7 billion. \nRio has previously said it was holding talks with Indonesia on a potential exit from the venture. \nOutside Indonesia, Rio has been expanding its exposure to copper mining amid a favourable outlook for the metal, including spending around $1 billion a year on its Oyu Tolgoi mine in Mongolia.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ignasius jonan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher lafemina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "budi gunadi sadikin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jefferies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "freeport\u2019s grasberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "freeport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "freeport-mcmoran inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mongolia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "freeport indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grasberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phoenix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rio tinto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oyu tolgoi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:07:51.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e55005418b948ec6577c07252ac5986720a6cf6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZmJZJly5Qy.6L1dUn.cjsEa", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/int/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/int/ - International - 4chan", "title": "What do you think about Spain?", "title_full": "/int/ - What do you think about Spain?
