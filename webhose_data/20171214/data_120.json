\nAs the very first neurons come together to form the brain, they need pointers to end up in the right places. Where do these directions come from? \nRockefeller scientists have discovered that they originate from an unlikely source, revealing that the cells directing the very first steps of brain assembly are not other neurons, as scientists have long assumed, but so-called glial cells. Brain formation in worms goes awry when glial cell signaling is disrupted (right). \n\u201cWhile glial cells are abundant in the brain, their functions are much less understood,\u201d says Shai Shaham , Richard E. Salomon Family Professor. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that in the roundworm C. elegans , glial cells play a pivotal role, coaxing neurons onto a specific path so that proper brain assembly can ensue.\u201d \nShaham and his team also found that these worm glial cells are remarkably similar to their vertebrate counterparts. \nTo peek inside the earliest stages of brain development, scientists must observe and analyze embryos, which are notoriously tricky to study. But research associate Georgia Rapti, the lead author of a recent Nature Neuroscience report describing this work, was able to use C. elegans as a model to tease apart how brain assembly begins. \n\u201cWe found that glial cells grow radial processes, or extensions, marking where the first axons must go, and they release multiple signals to guide neurons onto the correct path,\u201d says Rapti. \u201cOur experiments show that when glial cells or their signals are compromised, the worm\u2019s brain is severely disrupted\u2014more than 60 percent of its neuronal extensions fail to enter the brain as they normally would.\u201d \nRapti and Shaham were also able to show that once glial cells have set the stage for brain assembly, a special group of 10 neurons, called pioneer neurons, are the first to follow suit. Pioneer neurons had previously been documented in other species, but their identities, molecular functions, and growth properties were generally unknown. \nThe researchers discovered a molecular signature for pioneer neurons, and showed that these cells can act with glial cells to recruit follower neurons. They were also able to uncover previously hidden molecular pathways that glial cells and pioneer neurons use to attract the next set of neurons into the brain. \nWhile C. elegans may not seem to have a lot in common with humans and other vertebrates, their brain assembly processes resemble ours at the molecular level. For example, Rapti and Shaham note recent reports revealing that the assembly of the mouse spinal cord relies on a signaling molecule called Netrin, which is produced by radial glial cells. The researchers found that Netrin functions similarly in the worm\u2014glial cells produce this molecule, which guides pioneer neurons to form the C. elegans brain. \n\u201cThe glial cells driving brain assembly in the worm look like\u2014and function similarly to\u2014those in the vertebrate spinal cord,\u201d says Shaham. \u201cWe think of glial cells as the Pied Piper for nervous system assembly across animals, and the Piper\u2019s pipe appears to be the same from worms to mammals.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shaham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard e. salomon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rapti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shai shaham", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pied piper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia rapti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "piper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rockefeller", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "rapti", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:47.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1661366de6f3bd39a18d60b8bac33c50e845b86e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB6L7PbZzeqZL0GjBKTb4_cyAZQxj6.lu9nG1.m6IH9bfoZJLtP5TjWi6_4LHf4u0lT30j.ON50r5t8hNOEcWXp5", "site_full": "forums.stevehoffman.tv", "site": "stevehoffman.tv", "site_section": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/forums/music-corner.2/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Music Corner | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "title": "Similar Band Names That Cause Confusion | Page 6", "title_full": "Similar Band Names That Cause Confusion | Page 6 | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "published": "2017-12-03T22:17:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 23, "participants_count": 22, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a5014bb35d9fd591b14b4a2a1dd454e7?s=96&amp;amp;d=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.stevehoffman.tv%2Fstyles%2Fdefault%2Fxenforo%2Favatars%2Favatar_male_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19660, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e1bf91ba45c4b21abec931062dc74d02b167c811", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB6L7PbZzeqZL0GjBKTb4_cyAZQxj6.lu9nG1.m6IH9bfoZJLtP5TjWi6_4LHf4u0lT30j.ON50r5kBsYBtyD._tsU3plsAqETU-", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "seed_drill", "published": "2017-12-04T01:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "e.s. said: \u2191 Wolfmother, Wolf Parade, Wolf People...

A Technician visited and informed that, Tv panel got damaged and he said it will cost around 23k to repair. i am totally disgusted to hear this, how can a led tv panel which is used very less and purchased in less than two years time can get damaged suddenly on one fine day.I strongly believe a defective piece has been sold to me by the dealer.After having reported to the dealer about the matter, On delear's supposed advice I called up the customer care again to escalate the issue and requested them to connect me to VUC department or any Senior and responsible person but I was denied citing a server issue at customer care department . I frustrated to see this kind of casual okk by a brand like Samsung.People spend their hard earned money to purchase assets and companies don't pay proper attention to customer's concerns in time.

Yet these materials, like tooth enamel, can be vulnerable to the growth of plaque, the sticky biofilm that leads to tooth decay. \nIn a new study, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania evaluated a new dental material tethered with an antimicrobial compound that can not only kill bacteria but can also resist biofilm growth. In addition, unlike some drug-infused materials, it is effective with minimal toxicity to the surrounding tissue, as it contains a low dose of the antimicrobial agent that kills only the bacteria that come in contact with it. Biofilms composed of Streptococcus mutans\u2013a common cause of tooth decay\u2013were much easier to remove when grown on a newly developed dental material (right image), which has an antimicrobial agent within it, compared to a control material. \n\u201cDental biomaterials such as these,\u201d said Geelsu Hwang, research assistant professor in Penn\u2019s School of Dental Medicine , \u201cneed to achieve two goals: first, they should kill pathogenic microbes effectively, and, second, they need to withstand severe mechanical stress, as happens when we bite and chew. Many products need large amounts of anti-microbial agents to maximize killing efficacy, which can weaken the mechanical properties and be toxic to tissues, but we showed that this material has outstanding mechanical properties and long-lasting antibiofilm activities without cytotoxicity.\u201d \nHwang collaborated on the study, which was published in the journal ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces , with Penn Dental Medicine professor Hyun (Michel) Koo and Bernard Koltisko and Xiaoming Jin of Dentsply Sirona . \nThe newly developed material is comprised of a resin embedded with the antibacterial agent imidazolium. Unlike some traditional biomaterials, which slowly release a drug, this material is non-leachable, thereby only killing microbes that touch it. \n\u201cThis can reduce the likelihood of antimicrobial resistance,\u201d Hwang said. \nHwang and colleagues put the material through its paces, testing its ability to kill microbes, to prevent growth of biofilms and to withstand mechanical stress. \nTheir results showed it to be effective in killing bacterial cells on contact, severely disrupting the ability of biofilms to grow on its surface. Only negligible amounts of biofilm matrix, the glue that holds clusters of bacteria together, were able to accumulate on the experimental material, in contrast to a control composite material, which showed a steady accumulation of sticky biofilm matrix over time. \nThen, the team assessed how much shear force was required to remove the biofilm on the experimental material. While the smallest force removed almost all the biofilm from the experimental material, even a force four times as strong was incapable of removing the biofilm from the control composite material. \n\u201cThe force equivalent to taking a drink of water could easily remove the biofilm from this material,\u201d Hwang said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michel) koo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geelsu hwang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dentsply sirona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hwang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernard koltisko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xiaoming jin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "acs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penn dental medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "school of dental medicine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "penn", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:49.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1661366de6f3bd39a18d60b8bac33c50e845b86e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB6L7PbZzeqZL0GjBKTb4_cyAZQxj6.lu9nG1.m6IH9bfoZJLtP5TjWi6_4LHf4u0lT30j.ON50r5t8hNOEcWXp5", "site_full": "forums.stevehoffman.tv", "site": "stevehoffman.tv", "site_section": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/forums/music-corner.2/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Music Corner | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "title": "Similar Band Names That Cause Confusion | Page 6", "title_full": "Similar Band Names That Cause Confusion | Page 6 | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "published": "2017-12-03T22:17:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 23, "participants_count": 22, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a5014bb35d9fd591b14b4a2a1dd454e7?s=96&amp;amp;d=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.stevehoffman.tv%2Fstyles%2Fdefault%2Fxenforo%2Favatars%2Favatar_male_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19660, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "09d8d421501f4dbd9149e27fe9250377165af4dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB6L7PbZzeqZL0GjBKTb4_cyAZQxj6.lu9nG1.m6IH9bfoZJLtP5TjWi6_4LHf4u0lT30j.ON50r5kBsYBtyD._tmTRXO0JzCM8-", "ord_in_thread": 19, "author": "Dudley Morris", "published": "2017-12-05T00:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "John Bonham said: \u2191 My father-in-law thought \"Phish\" was short for \"Hootie and the Blowfish\" Click to expand...

December 4 (PSN) \u2013 Gornik Zabrze have been able to extend their lead for top spot in the eighteenth round of the 2017/2018 LOTTO Ekstraklasa season. \nGornik won away on Sunday against Wisla Krakow 3:2 (0:1) in the penultimate match of the latest league round. Goals for Gornik were scored by Igor Angulo from the penalty spot, Rafal Kurzawa and Szymon Zurkowski, while Rafal Boguski and Carlitos responded for the White Star. While it was an exciting and fast paced game that definitely allowed fans to witness something grand, it ultimately left the home supporters on a sour note. With the win, Gornik have now a three point advantage over Legia who sit second in the league table, while Wisla remain in sixth. \n\nJagiellonia Bia\u0142ystok \u2013 Pogo\u0144 Szczecin 1:0 (1:0) Goal: Sheridan 9\u2032 \nYellow carded: Burliga \u2013 Ho\u0142ota, Drygas, Delew Referee: Jaros\u0142aw Przyby\u0142 (Kluczbork) Attendance: 4111 \nJagiellonia: 25.

Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box - although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action. \n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" \nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. \nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" \nTrump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \n\"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on.

Took me 3 hours which involved seeking out references with general google searches of \"Pink Guy\" and \"Vaporwave beach\". I've been wanting to do something with a vaporwave type color palette for a while, the aesthetic really piques my interest. So I did what immediately came to mind, Adastumae and Pink Guy at the beach probably sharing a pack of cigarettes and talking about smashing. Was listening to a Joji + Pink Guy playlist I made and in a story I'm writing Adastumae's going through some hard times with some girlies. I know it's not 100% a \"Pink Guy\" feel but everybody has to be real sometimes.Not really looking for critique as this was my first personal piece in a few months and I feel a little bit of an emotional attachment to this one. Doesn't seem like it but a lot of feels went into this as I'm going through a tough time myself. #TheWeirdWaysWeCope No comments have been added yet.

Sexists to face tougher sentences under plans to make misogyny a hate crime \u2014 RT UK News By 0 106 \nCriminals motivated by sexism could face increased sentences as police prepare to review plans to make misogyny a hate crime. It comes as part of efforts to clampdown on sexual harassment. \nProposals to make misogyny the sixth strand of offences categorized as a hate crime are currently being discussed by senior police officers. If agreed, criminals who are found to have acted out of hatred towards women would be handed longer sentences. Under the reforms, sexist behavior or language would be treated as an aggravating factor to other crimes such as assault and harassment. \nRead more \nA pilot scheme has been running in Nottingham since last year, and is expected to report back to police chiefs, who will then consider whether new regulations should apply across the country. As part of the scheme, police revealed that there was a case of misogyny reported every three days during July and August. \n\u201cYou would take any offence that the person reported and if it reached the evidential standard and had been reported as a hate crime then it would attract an enhanced sentence,\u201d Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton, who leads on hate crime for the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, told the Women and Equalities Committee on Wednesday. \n\u201cSo it\u2019s not about a new crime of hate, it\u2019s about adding another category to the enhanced process that layers on top of an offence when it occurs,\u201d he explained. \nWhile expressing his support for a review of the categories, Hamilton stressed that other bodies, such as the Criminal Prosecution Service (CPS) and the government, had to play their part too. \n\u201cMy slight concern would be that the police move on their own. It\u2019s whether the criminal justice system from its end would respond to it. So that\u2019s a bigger debate than me,\u201d he said. \nHamilton added that he hoped the new legislation would encourage victims to report their abuse. \u201cHopefully that is an indication to victims that it\u2019s more reason to come forward and more reason to believe that the criminal justice system will take them seriously.\u201d \nRead more \nCommittee Chair and Conservative MP Maria Miller said: \u201cThere has been significant and growing concern over the past few years about routine sexism and sexual harassment that women and girls experience in their daily lives. \n\u201cRecent allegations that have emerged across different sectors have amplified this. Last year, the committee published a report which uncovered a disturbing level of sexual harassment and sexual violence against girls in schools. We are now interested in hearing about women\u2019s experiences in other environments.\u201d \n\u201cOnce we have a better picture of the problem, we will consider further work on this in the new year,\u201d Miller added. \n80,393 hate crimes were recorded in 2016-17, up from 62,518 the previous year, which was the highest annual rise since the Home Office began recording in 2011-12. \nThe UK has the highest record of violent sex crimes in the EU \u2013 64,500 of the 215,000 sex crimes recorded in the EU occurred in England and Wales. \nVia RT .

Archaeologists are one step closer to finding out if the pelvic bone discovered earlier this year is really that of St. Nicholas.\nAlthough the relics of St. Nicholas are preserved in a church in Italy, they are missing with some parts. However, it may just be a matter of time before his relics will be sort of complete as a pelvis suspected that to be of the saint that was discovered earlier this year has already been confirmed to belong to the era believed when he existed.\nAccording to reports, a fragment of the pelvic bone to have passed from St Nicholas\u2019s grave in Lycia to a church in Illinois via Italy and France has been confirmed to have dated to the 4th century AD, the time believed when the saint died.

The server exits the kitchen with a tray full of steaming plates and a flood of relief washes over you. But the server ferries the food right past you to another table, and the unpleasant sensation of hunger returns \u2014 at least until you take the first bite of your very own meal. \nWith a new study, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have explained the biological mechanism behind these hunger-driven highs and lows. While the mere sight or smell of food can temporarily turn off neurons responsible for the drive to eat, they showed that the neurons only stay off if the brain receives a signal from the stomach that calories have been ingested. Researchers at Penn identified a connection between the gut and brain that acts to reduce an animal\u2019s drive to eat. Targeting the neurons involved in this \u201chunger alarm system\u201d could provide a strategy to treat obesity. Image credit: Sam Alhadeff / University of Pennsylvania \n\u201cWhen these neurons are firing, they\u2019re basically telling you, \u2018You\u2019d better go get food; you\u2019re starving,\u2019\u201d said J. Nicholas Betley , assistant professor in the Department of Biology in Penn\u2019s School of Arts and Sciences . \u201cThey\u2019re a sensitive alarm system. And what this study conclusively demonstrated is that nutrients are the primary regulators of this alarm system.\u201d \nFurthermore, Betley\u2019s team determined that giving mice a combination of hormones normally released during digestion significantly calmed the activity of these neurons, pointing to a potential therapeutic strategy for reducing overeating and obesity. \nBetley collaborated with postdoctoral researchers and co-first authors Zhenwei Su and Amber L. Alhadeff on the study, which appears this week in the journal Cell Reports . \nThe brain\u2019s hypothalamus, which controls the sensation of hunger, is home to a population of neurons known as agouti-related protein-expressing neurons, or AgRP neurons. In earlier work, Betley and colleagues discovered that these neurons are highly active when an animal is hungry, that their activity is suppressed upon eating and that merely smelling or seeing food can also lead to a rapid decline in their activity. All signs pointed to these neurons functioning as a way for animals to avoid starvation. \n\u201cBeing hungry can feel unpleasant, and these are the neurons that seem to mediate this,\u201d Betley said. \u201cAnimals don\u2019t like this stimulation. In the laboratory, we can turn these neurons on with the flash of a light. Interestingly, we found that animals will scamper to the other side of the room to turn off the light.\u201d \nIn the current study, the researchers wanted to distinguish between the effects of simply seeing or smelling food and actually consuming food on reducing the activity of the AgRP neurons. \nThey worked with mice that had been genetically engineered so that calcium, a marker of neuronal activity, increased the fluorescence of a molecular reporter in their AgRP neurons, allowing neuronal activity to be easily tracked as the animals were awake and moving about. Like the researchers had seen before, when they presented animals with normal chow, AgRP neuron activity rapidly decreased and stayed low during and after eating. \nBut what if the mice were presented with a food they\u2019d never seen before and thus didn\u2019t associate with satiety? When they gave hungry mice a strawberry-flavored, calorie-free gel, a food item with which the animals were unfamiliar, the sight and smell had no effect on AgRP neuron activity levels. Ingesting the calorie-free gel led to a transient decrease in AgRP neuron activity, but this lasted only around 200 seconds. Repeated trials with the calorie-free gel led to a decrease in this transient effect showing that the animal comes to associate the taste and flavor characteristics of this food with a lack of calories. \nBut when those same animals were later given a calorie-containing gel with the same flavor profile, AgRP neuron activity declined after eating and stayed low. And upon a second exposure to the caloric gel, the researchers saw the mice experienced an anticipatory drop in AgRP neuron activity, suggesting that they had learned to associate the flavor and sight of the gel with satiety. \nThe researchers then reversed the experiment with a different group of mice, first giving the animals a calorie-containing gel. Again they saw no anticipatory drop in AgRP neuron activity in the first trial, but there was a sustained reduction in neuron activity after eating. When the researchers then gave these mice the calorie-free gel, they observed the anticipatory drop in AgRP neurons, but this lasted only 200 seconds and was likely due to the animals anticipating the consumption of calories. After 200 seconds, the neurons began firing again after the stomach \u201crealized\u201d it hadn\u2019t acquired any nutrients. \n\u201cIn a single trial, the circuits in the brain\u2019s sensory system learn to associate the visual or olfactory stimulus of the [gel] with calories,\u201d Betley said. \u201cIf they get the caloric kind first and then see the calorie-free kind, they predict the nutrients because the flavor is the same, the taste is similar. It takes 200 seconds for the animal to realize that whatever has hit its gut isn\u2019t doing what it should be doing and the activity of those neurons comes back.\u201d \nTo confirm that it was only the caloric food and not external sensory input that led to the suppression of AgRP neuron activity, the researchers directly infused Ensure into the animals\u2019 stomachs and found sustained and dose-dependent reductions in AgRP neuron activity. The same calorie-dependent effect was seen when they switched the infusion to pure sugars, fats or protein. In other words, the more calories in the stomach of the mice, the stronger the reduction of neuron activity. \nConfident that the nutrients were delivering a signal to the brain, the researchers next wanted to ascertain how they were doing it. They found that giving mice hormones, such as cholecystokinin, peptide tyrosine tyrosine and amylin, which are normally secreted during digestion, led to dramatic and dose-dependent decreases in AgRP neuron activity. And when the team combined low doses of these three peptides, they acted synergistically, leading to a robust decrease in AgRP neuron activity. \nThe combinatorial approach may have relevance to treating obesity in humans, Betley noted. While therapies involving these three hormones given individually are successfully used in humans, the doses required to have an effect often lead to nausea. But the researchers saw no sign of malaise in the mice when they were given the cocktail of three hormones, likely because each hormone is given at low doses. \nBetley\u2019s team hopes to further explore the ways in which these hormones suppress AgRP neuron activity, perhaps looking for a way to trigger their release by mimicking the presence of nutrients in the gut. Not only could the work inform pharmaceutical approaches to treating obesity, but it could lend insight into behavioral strategies that could reduce total food intake. \n\u201cIt would be interesting to see whether consuming smaller meals more frequently might lead to less activity in the neurons and thus less food intake overall,\u201d Betley said. \u201cOr maybe we can develop better combinations of foods or better ways of eating so we can avoid that 9 p.m. binge on Oreo cookies when you\u2019ve had a really great diet all day.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ima", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam alhadeff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. nicholas betley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "betley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amber l. alhadeff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhenwei su", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "department of biology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "school of arts and sciences", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "penn", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:53.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8f3666c007965f32b119b7bc081052fff4f5cc61", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrOxotYJtUGWE6MxD9.wjCobF_eVw2.S_oqeUcERsH7cplFwoUHcnZptRNB8eGiZbKspoLWJJ0TOOGc7nuM0.qJa404lhCol8TT88f8gBb3oQ--", "site_full": "techcellaneous.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://techcellaneous.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "All About Tech", "title": "The Functions In Using Roadway Digital Led Signs", "title_full": "The Functions In Using Roadway Digital Led Signs", "published": "2017-12-07T11:17:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8f3666c007965f32b119b7bc081052fff4f5cc61", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrOxotYJtUGWE6MxD9.wjCobF_eVw2.S_oqeUcERsH7cplFwoUHcnZptRNB8eGiZbKspoLWJJ0TOOGc7nuM0.qJa404lhCol8TT88f8gBb3oQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dimas Kholid (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:17:00.000+02:00", "title": "The Functions In Using Roadway Digital Led Signs", "text": "By Helen Wright \n\nNighttime is always the schedule for many individuals to go on a road trip or stroll around the city since they would need to exhaust their frustrations after five consecutive days of getting bombarded with many tasks at work. Therefore, a goal for many individuals is to seek services that could help them improve their services. And many individuals saw that need from these individuals and grabbed the opportunity in offering them services that will surely befitting for people who are stressed.\n\nThen, the reason that these individuals are actually able to use those provides instantly is due to the fact that there were actually huge screens of signs which suggested this consisting of the rates which came throughout from it. And by means of road digital led signs Canada , it can aid folks identify just what a specific electrical outlet components nearby. Especially for those happening lengthy travels as well as is in should perform a stopover to avoid entering a crash for resting while driving.\n\nThe light isn't overly high on screens, so this wouldn't harm your eyes. The majority of them are monochromatic and are generally utilized in billboards or street indications for instance, food areas, and other solutions which are still accessible even during the night. It's also an additional advertising strategy for all these places as it leaves their location visible for drivers to see.\n\nSeveral people can be found in coming from other far affair metropolitan areas steer throughout the evening in the freeway roadways in Canada. If their households are residing within another place as well as these people are regarding to appreciate their brief vacation in Canada, particularly. It would certainly take all of them hours from steering it until they can lastly meet their location. And oftentimes, they begin traveling in the late afternoon due to the fact that of the heavy traffic visitor traffic that they perform not desire to acquire blowing wound of.\n\nServices who personalize these LED Road screens would be the experts within this subject. Thus, they are skillful on various related methods that they may use since they construct the item. Since they've researched the numerous styles that they may incorporate since they begin customizing the designs for their clientele. Together with their state of the art gear and apparatus, they could guarantee their clients in creating these things possible.\n\nIt is also ensured that their employees are sure to deliver and create efficient designs according to their preferences.

He grew out his hair and his beard and wore the shortened trousers required by the extremists. He forced himself to witness the beheadings and stonings, so he could hear killers call out the names of the condemned and their supposed crimes. \nBy night, anonymously from his darkened room, Mosul Eye told the world what was happening. If caught, he too would be executed. \nBut after more than three years, his double life has grown too heavy to bear. He misses his name. \nHis secrets consume him, sap energy he'd rather use for his doctoral dissertation and for helping Mosul rebuild. In conversations with The Associated Press, he agonized over how to end the anonymity that plagues him. He made his decision. \nMosul Eye is Omar Mohammed, historian, scholar, blogger. He is 31. \nThe revelation of his identity is for his thousands of readers and followers, for all his volunteers in Mosul who have been inspired by a man they have never seen. But above all, it is for the brother who died in the final battle and for his grieving mother. \n\"I can't be anonymous anymore. This is to say that I defeated ISIS. You can see me now, and you can know me now,\" he told The Associated Press. \nMohammed first posted about the Islamic State group under his own Facebook account, in the first few days after its fighters swept into Mosul, but a friend told him he risked being killed. So in those first days he made himself a promise: trust no one, document everything. \nA newly minted teacher with a reputation for secular ideas, he had lost his university job. \nHe found another calling. \n\"My job as a historian requires an unbiased approach which I am going to adhere to and keep my personal opinion to myself,\" he wrote on that first day, June 18, 2014. \nMosul Eye became one of the outside world's main sources of news about the Islamic State fighters, their atrocities and their transformation of the city into a grotesque shadow of itself. \nDuring Friday sermons, Mohammed feigned enthusiasm. He collected propaganda to post online later. He drank tea at the hospital, fishing for information. \nMuch of what he collected went on the blog. Other details he kept in his computer, for fear of giving away his identity. Someday, he promised, he would write history with them. \nThe most sensitive details initially came from two old friends: a doctor and a high school dropout who had joined an Islamic State intelligence unit. \nMohammed's information sometimes included photos of the fighters and commanders, complete with biographies surreptitiously pieced together during the course of his normal life \u2014 that of an out-of-work scholar living at home. \n\"I used the two characters, the two personalities to serve each other,\" he said. He expanded into a Facebook page and a Twitter feed to parcel out information at a time when little news was escaping. \nIntelligence agencies made contact as well and he rebuffed them. \n\"I am not a spy or a journalist,\" he would say. \"I tell them this: If you want the information, it's published and it's public for free. Take it.\" \nIn March 2015, his catalog of horrors got to him. \n\"I was super ready to die,\" Mohammed said. \"I was so tired of worrying about myself, my family, my brothers. I am not alive to worry, but I am alive to live this life. I thought: I am done.\" \nHe cut his hair short, shaved his beard and pulled on a bright red sweater. His closest friend joined him. \nThey drove to the banks of the Tigris blasting forbidden music. They shared a carafe of tea. Heedless of people picnicking nearby, Mohammed lit a cigarette\u2014 banned by IS. Somehow, incredibly, he wasn't caught. \n\"At that moment I felt like I was given a new life.\" \nHe resumed what he had taken to calling his duty. He grew out his hair and beard, put the shortened trousers back on. \nHe tested out different voices, Christian, Muslim. Sometimes he indicated he was gone, other times that he was still in the city. \nFinally, after leaving Mosul a thousand times in his mind, he decided it was time to get out. \n\"I think I deserve life, deserve to be alive.\" \nA smuggler agreed to sneak him out for $1,000. Mohammed left the next day, the contents of his computer transferred overnight to a hard-drive that he packed with him. \nNo one gave him a second look during the two days and some 500 kilometers (300 miles) it took to reach Turkey. \nOnce there, Mosul Eye kept at it: via WhatsApp and Viber, from Facebook messages and long conversations with friends and relatives who had contacts within IS. From hundreds of kilometers away, his life remained consumed by events back home. \nBy mid-2016, deaths were piling up faster than he could record. The Islamic State group was on a hunt for traitors and the airstrikes were taking an increasing toll on everyone. His records grew haphazard, and he turned to Twitter to document the atrocities. In February 2017, he received asylum in Europe. \nOnly after his elder brother Ahmed was killed in a mortar strike and IS was gone from the city did Mohammed reveal his secret to a younger brother \u2014 who greeted the news with a shock of pride and happiness. His sibling spoke on condition of anonymity from his refuge in Iraq because he was fearful for his life. \n\"People in Mosul had lost hope and confidence in politicians, in everything,\" his brother said. Mosul Eye \"managed to show that it's possible to change the situation in the city and bring it back to life.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "viber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mosul eye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "omar mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "isl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mosul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tigris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:54.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7b85095d8c58eaeec9a273f1faef81c2ded87753", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSuXqOfgp7DdyVPasFIgx6qIal8x4RhH8VoKZQQjNUTKvRB9NKsA7HYVhUb22P4QZr.9hqv2hW3Su7fvr6lG4bC49PIC3L9WjeEXggQSwZRh5Z6yhsoMdi3CiqOBfIIpL._ofmKPxXwONSG6DIpN7XS", "site_full": "globenewswire.com", "site": "globenewswire.com", "site_section": "http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/rss/keyword/?kw=AVIATION", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "investors_and_patents"], "section_title": "GlobeNewswire: Latest Articles", "title": "Sino Agro Food, Inc.

Now, instead of copying information and pasting it somewhere else manually, this handy method will automatically identify what app needs to be opened. \nIt was announced on Tuesday that Chrome 63 has been released for Android and it will roll out on Google Play over the next couple weeks. Not only does it provide new features like address bar autocompletion and the usual performance improvements, but it added Smart Text Selection support on Android Oreo . Read more Smart text selection and Autofill [Diving into Android O] In Google's pursuit to make information easier to relay to your friends and family, they've implemented some pretty interesting automation. Normally, getting an address and directing yourself to a place is a multi-step process. First, \u2026 What does Smart Text Selection provide? If there\u2019s an address or phone number on the screen, double-tapping or holding the text will bring up shortcut options. This could be to the Google Maps app for directions or it can make a phone call if you highlight a phone number. Perhaps the best aspect of this feature is that it will automatically highlight the entire segment of text, rather than making the user do it manually. \nEarlier this year, Smart Text Selection was announced at Google I/O 2017 . Machine learning software in the device is able to identify the information you tap on, such as names, email addresses, and more. None of the information goes into the cloud, protecting the user\u2019s privacy and provides faster results. \nThe feature is a shortcut in itself to what the Google Assistant does on Oreo. That requires holding down the Home button and selecting \u201cWhat\u2019s on my screen?\u201d From there, it will separate the information and offer the most useful app for it on your device.

EU chiefs and Tories fear May government could collapse \u2018within weeks\u2019 over Brexit deadlock \u2014 RT UK News By 0 120 \nTheresa May\u2019s government could be close to collapse, with Tory officials warning her leadership could be over within weeks if she fails to bring the Irish border deal under control. The EU is looking to give her breathing room by granting another extension. \nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has extended UK Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s deadline to settle the Irish border issue to next Wednesday \u2013 the eve of an EU leaders\u2019 summit, which takes place next Thursday \u2013 to give her more time to broker a successful deal. \nJuncker had previously suggested that Sunday was the last day that he could meet May to resolve the Irish issue, after allowing her an extra week after May failed to strike a deal on the Irish border by the last deadline, which expired on Monday. \nOne EU official told the Daily Telegraph that Juncker wants to support the British prime minister to enable her to reach an agreement that will satisfy all parties. \u201cMr Juncker wants to support Mrs May to avoid the collapse of her government. He is prepared to meet her at any time, including on days next week in the run up to the European summit.\u201d \nThe source said that the text of the disputed draft withdrawal agreement could be changed because \u201cthere\u2019s always wriggle room.\u201d \nOn Wednesday, May suffered an in-party attack from the backbench in the House of Commons, with a Tory MP offering to take the reins on negotiations if May can\u2019t \u201csort them out\u201d herself. \nUnfortunately for May, the in-fighting didn\u2019t stop there. Tory unity seems to be crumbling away entirely, with 20 conservative MPs penning a letter to May during the week, accusing pro-Brexit colleagues of being \u201chighly irresponsible to seek to dictate terms which could lead to the UK walking away.\u201d \nRead more \nChaos in the party escalated even further when Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond admitted on Wednesday that the Cabinet still had not agreed on a target for the \u201cend state.\u201d \n\u201cThe Cabinet has had general discussions about our Brexit negotiations but we haven\u2019t had a specific mandating of an end state position,\u201d Hammond told MPs. \n\u201cThat is something that will be done first in the sub-committee that has been constituted to deal with this issue and of course logically that will happen once we have confirmation that we have reached sufficient progress and that we are going to begin the phase two negotiations with the EU 27. We are not yet at that stage and it would have been premature to have that discussion until we reach that stage.\u201d \nThe woman at the center of the ill-fated Irish deal, Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster, told Sky News her party had been asking the May-led Government to look at drafts of the proposed agreement with the EU for five weeks prior to Monday\u2019s decision debacle. \nFoster said a version was not sent to her party until late on Monday morning, shortly before the prime minister\u2019s talks with Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels. \n\u201cWe hadn\u2019t seen any text, despite asking for text for nearly five weeks now, we haven\u2019t been in receipt of any text and the text only came through to us late yesterday morning,\u201d Foster said. \u201c And obviously once we saw the text we knew it wasn\u2019t going to be acceptable.\u201d \nRead more \nIf May fails to negotiate a deal that is accepted by all involved, her next opportunity to get trade talks underway will be in March \u2013 but she may not have that long, as the threat of a leadership challenge hangs in the air if her no-deal goes on for much longer. One Conservative MP told the Telegraph: \u201cI would give her a matter of weeks if it carries on like this.\u201d \nDuring the Prime Minister\u2019s Questions on Wednesday, Brexit supporter and MP for Wellingborough Peter Bone wondered if Britain would deliver on its promise to leave. \n\u201cWhen the British people voted to leave the European superstate, they voted to end the free movement of people, they voted to stop sending billions and billions of pounds to the EU each and every year, and they voted to make our laws in our own country judged by our own judges,\u201d Bone said. \n\u201cAre we on course still to deliver that, and if we have a problem, would it help if I came over to Brussels with you to sort them out?\u201d. \nHe also labelled Foster the \u201cnew heroine of Brexit\u201d for refusing to sign up to \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d with the Republic of Ireland. \nVia RT .
