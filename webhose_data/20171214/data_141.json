Gently place pears in wine mixture, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, turning every 5 minutes to ensure even color. Pears should be cooked but still firm. Remove Dutch oven from heat, uncover, and cool with pears upright in pan. Once cool, cover and chill in refrigerator at least 6 hours or overnight. \nGently remove pears from liquid and place on serving platter. Allow the pears to come to room temperature. Meanwhile, pour liquid into a shallow saucepan over medium-high heat and reduce, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes or until liquid is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from heat and let liquid cool to room temperature. Drizzle each pear with 2 tablespoons of syrup and serve. \nThis story was published on December 5, 2017 Lynn Wells is a personal chef with more than 20 years of experience in the food and hospitality industry and a degree in Nutrition Management from UNCG.

Living by saltwater is normal. Rust that does not affect the functionality of the camera would be considered cosmetic damage, and as such would not be covered by a GSP. Rust that does effect the functionality of the camera should be covered by a GSP as long as we determine that the rust was caused while the camera was being used as it is intended to be.\nThe cleaning we provide for DSLR cameras are part of the preventative maintenance we offer on the covered camera once a year.

I know the site says normal wear and tear are covered but what is considered normal? It says dust, heat and humidity on the site, but I live near saltwater and with the heat and humidity there is a good chance of salt and rust for me, would this be considered normal?\nWhat type of cleaning is done?

The Star Chamber was originally established to ensure the fair enforcement of laws against socially and politically prominent people so powerful that ordinary courts would probably hesitate to convict them of their crimes. However, it became synonymous with social and political oppression through the arbitrary use and abuse of the power it wielded.\nIn modern usage, legal or administrative bodies with strict, arbitrary rulings and secretive proceedings are sometimes called, metaphorically or poetically, \"star chambers\". This is a pejorative term and intended to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the proceedings. \"Star Chamber\" can also be used in its original meaning, for instance when a politician uses parliamentary privilege to attack a powerful organisation or person.[a]\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Chamber", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Chamber"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:55.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fa59c4f01dfa58c9f19b4f1eddf996f90082c8ef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKzl.er.ZlFOWxjhD1VQOE5ik6ICkySxVZT_FaLPwpJtFR.oKniqMy9E4ww556Jonk8UWQ0tt4KYFg--", "site_full": "powerstrokearmy.com", "site": "powerstrokearmy.com", "site_section": "http://powerstrokearmy.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=7", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "6.4 Aftermarket - PowerStrokeArmy", "title": "6.4 WHAT INJECTORS/NOZZLES TO GET....", "title_full": "6.4 WHAT INJECTORS/NOZZLES TO GET.... - PowerStrokeArmy", "published": "2017-12-06T17:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fa59c4f01dfa58c9f19b4f1eddf996f90082c8ef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKzl.er.ZlFOWxjhD1VQOE5ik6ICkySxVZT_FaLPwpJtFR.oKniqMy9E4ww556Jonk8UWQ0tt4KYFg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jsexton", "published": "2017-12-06T17:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "6.4 WHAT INJECTORS/NOZZLES TO GET....", "text": "I will have a set of balanced 60% injectors for sale in the next month or so.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:55.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7a55438c794d8c8fbbe4b79133c698e6d66a6ec5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRjqLEK5IXQp9PMZCHADAqILiOTgE1jSgDT1Q.nOBMAAmsGfWeC1RbeWnLC3cHhiloqHV3EKn3shiqtjJ445ElLzDCW7cQvgCr2ew4xD5eqjJ0gmtVhn74Mu7tj2QG_90QJU2iNPx9hA5YyTXpHrqt5", "site_full": "patient.info", "site": "patient.info", "site_section": "https://patient.info/forums/discuss/browse/health-anxiety-disorder-3379", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Anxiety Disorders.

Each time a foreign dignitary has travelled to Jerusalem to meet with Israeli leaders, they have already recognized its status as the de-facto capital of Israel.\u201d\nHe noted that \u201csince King David made Jerusalem the capital of Israel some 3,000 years ago, the city has served as the national capital of only one people group, the Jewish people\u201d.\nWhile the US announcement recognises Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel, it leaves many of the most contested issues open to final status negotiations.\nIn a conference in the European Parliament in Brussels earlier in the day, ECI Legal Counsel Andrew Tucker reminded the audience that \u201cIsrael is a democratic state built on the rule of law which seeks to protect the civil and religious rights of all its citizens, Jews and non-Jews alike.\u201d \u201cThere can be no better guarantee for an open and inclusive Jerusalem where Jews, Christians and Muslims can continue to worship side by side at their respective holy sites than under Israeli sovereignty.\u201d\nWhile welcoming the US recognition, ECI calls for moderation, calm and dialogue among all parties.\nECI calls on all faith leaders to renounce violence and seek paths to peace and co-existence and calls for prayer for the peace of Jerusalem.\n\nThe European Coalition for Israel has consistently campaigned for international recognition of a united Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel. On 5th June 2017 in New York, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem, ECI handed over an open letter entitled \u201cKeep Jerusalem United as the Capital of the State of Israel \u201d to Jerusalem\u2019s Mayor Nir Barkat , which was signed by more than 100 global leaders, among them government ministers and parliamentarians of many nations.

I created a post all about their eco luxury gift sets . Ever since trying their products I\u2019ve been hooked. Their sugar scrubs are my all time favourite body exfoliator! Bloomtown have now released \u2018Beauty Baubles\u2019* just in time for Christmas! \nCan we please just talk about how stunning they are? I cannot wait to hang mine up on my Christmas tree (whenever I finally get it up!) You can purchase an individual bauble or a set of three. Each little bauble is reusable so as long as you store them carefully they can be used year after year and filled with new goodies each Christmas! There\u2019s also two colour scheme options, the gorgeous plum shades I have or a navy set. \n*Warning this post contains spoilers of what\u2019s inside the Beauty Baubles so if you wish to keep it a surprise just head straight to Bloomtown and pick your colour.* \nEach little bauble has one cruelty free beauty treat inside! The products in the plum set I received are \u2018The Hedgerow\u2019 scent. One that I hadn\u2019t actually tried yet! \u2018The Hedgerow\u2019 products are all blackberry and honeysuckle scented. You get a sweet almond and shea butter sugar scrub, a roll on essential oil and a little berry flavour lipbalm. \nIf you have a particular range/ scent you\u2019d like to try you can leave a note at the checkout when placing your order and Bloomtown will be happy to oblige. (\u2018The Meadow\u2019 and \u2018The Woods\u2019 are two of my favourite scents!) \nAs I said above, Bloomtown\u2019s sweet almond and shea sugar scrubs are my all time favourite exfoliators! None I\u2019ve tried since have lived up to the standard. They\u2019re gentle enough that they don\u2019t irritate sensitive skin, something I really struggle with but coarse enough to removed all dead skin and leave skin baby soft. The sugar scrubs have an almost gel like consistency which makes them super easy to use in the shower and they leave the most beautiful natural scent. You will be hooked as soon as you try one! \nBloomtown\u2019s roll on essential oils are a must have for everyone\u2019s handbag! I personally always carry one in \u2018The Meadow\u2019 scent as its infused with Lavendar and really relaxes me. I\u2019m so excited to now have \u2018The Hedgerow\u2019 too, it has a lovely fresh, almost summery scent that will be a great wake up or pick me up in the morning or throughout the day when you\u2019re beginning to get tired. The oils can be rubbed on pulse points like your wrists or around your neck. \nThe final little treat in these baubles is a gorgeous berry lip balm. Who doesn\u2019t need lipbalm at this time of year? I certainly know my lips are getting drier and drier the colder it gets! Bloomtown have worked super hard to make these lipbalms vegan but just as moisturising as their non-vegan counter parts and I think they\u2019ve done an amazing job! I love the slight tint this gives your lips. You also have a avo-mint option if berry flavoured doesn\u2019t appeal to you. \nThese Beauty Baubles are the perfect Christmas gift for those friends and family members who like to support cruelty free brands and a good cause. Bloomtown donate a percentage of their profits to environmental and animal rescue charities. A set of three baubles costs only \u00a323! What do you think of these beauty baubles?

Indiana Attorney Kirby Moss Examines Social Security Disability Essentials Indiana Attorney Kirby Moss Examines Social Security Disability Essentials Posted on by Benzinga Full Feed in Press Releases Leadership   \nFort Wayne attorney Kirby Moss lists the top three tips about applying for Social Security disability in Indiana. FORT WAYNE, Ind. (PRWEB) December 07, 2017 \nApproximately 90% of those who apply for disability in Indiana are denied on their first application. Upon receiving a denial, one must within 60 days apply for a Reconsideration, which is often also denied. Upon receiving the denial of the Request for Reconsideration one must then file a Request for a hearing. \n\u201cThis is where most claims that get approved are approved. The key points to remember are the 60-day deadlines of each step,\u201d said attorney Kirby Moss . \u201cOnce the hearing is requested in Indiana it takes anywhere from 12-14 months to get a date for the hearing. The Social Security Administration must let you know the hearing date at least 75 days in advance. Your evidence, i.e. medical records and any medical opinions, needs to be submitted to the Social Security Administration no later than five business days before the hearing.\u201d \nTo further educate Indiana citizens about applying for Social Security disability , Moss lists the following three tips: \nNo. 1: Determine eligibility. One can apply for one of two types of disability, both of which are administered by the Social Security Administration : Disability Insurance Benefits (DIB) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). \n\u201cThe difference between the two is that the DIB is insurance and you have to have paid into the system long enough to qualify,\u201d said Moss. \u201cSSI is a safety net for those who have not paid into the system sufficiently. The standards to qualify are the same for each; i.e., a Medically Determinable Impairment that is severe enough to prevent one from engaging in Substantial Gainful Activity (work defined by income requirements).\u201d \nNo. 2: Get a doctor\u2019s note. One will need their doctor to submit a written confirmation of their impairment. \u201cIt is important to have a long-established relationship with your doctor as that can aid in your obtaining the information necessary to be successful in your claim,\u201d stressed Moss. \u201cHaving your doctor confirm your condition will provide necessary medical evidence of your condition as well as showing that you have taken steps to responsibly obtain treatment.\u201d \nNo. 3: Retain an experienced attorney. Getting an attorney early on is the best way to enhance one\u2019s chances of getting approved. \u201cAn attorney can help you gather the evidence necessary to support your claim and make sure it gets to the right place in a timely fashion,\u201d concluded Moss. \u201cThere are certain rules that need to be complied with to get your evidence on the record and ensure that it is considered. A benefit of having an attorney is that most attorneys that handle Social Security disability have access to view the electronic file in real time.\u201d \nAbout Kirby Moss, Kirby Moss LawAttorney Kirby Moss focuses on bankruptcy , estate planning, elder law, Social Security disability, personal injury litigation and other civil litigation.

LOS ANGELES (PRWEB) December 07, 2017 \nSexual harassment allegations have been flooding the news lately, from those made against Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey to Hollywood movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, to the most recent, Matt Lauer, award-winning journalist. Unfortunately, sexual harassment is common and has been a problem well before the recent nationwide dialogue on the issue surfaced after countless women have come forward. \n\u201cSexual harassment is a form of gender discrimination. It is unwelcomed sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal (i.e. sexual jokes), physical (i.e. battery), visual (i.e. graphic sexual photos) or written conduct (i.e. text messages) of a sexual nature,\u201d said renowned civil and workers\u2019 rights attorney Toni Jaramilla , who was recently interviewed by CBC Player about sexual harassment in the film industry.\u201cSexual harassment is often about power, especially in \u2018quid pro quo\u2019 harassment, where an employee is expected to provide sexual favors in exchange for job benefit or avoidance of job detriment.\u201d \nIn order to further educate California employees on sexual harassment, Jaramilla, who was also featured in Law360 discussing how lawyers are challenging Weinstein-style contracts, lists the following three tips: \nNo. 1: Report the conduct in writing to management. \u201cIf you are being sexually harassed, report the conduct to HR or anyone in management in writing. Although employers are obligated to promptly investigate all reports, including verbal reports, it is best to document your report in writing so that there is a written record which shows the date and nature of your report. Once your report is made, the employer\u2019s obligation to conduct a prompt, unbiased investigation is triggered,\u201d stressed Jaramilla. \nIf the harassment rises to the level of criminal conduct like sexual assault or rape, report it to law enforcement. \u201cRemember that the laws protect you from being retaliated against for reporting sexual harassment in the workplace,\u201d added Jramilla. \u201cThus, if you are demoted or terminated after reporting sexual harassment, you may have an additional claim for retaliation.\u201d \nNo. 2: Preserve the evidence. Keep track of dates of incidents, individuals involved and possible witnesses. Save emails, text messages or phone messages that evidence sexual advances or other inappropriate conduct. \u201cYou will need this when an investigation is conducted and in the likely event that the harasser denies the allegations,\u201d noted Jaramilla. \nNo. 3: Protect your emotional and mental health. Being sexually harassed is humiliating and frightening. \u201cThe residual embarrassment and psychological and emotional trauma can be debilitating for the victim,\u201d concluded Jaramilla. \u201cSeek mental health treatment or confide in a trusted friend or family member for emotional support.\u201d \nAbout Toni Jaramilla, A Professional Law CorporationToni Jaramilla is committed to achieving the best possible results for employees who have experienced problems in the workplace.

This means that I\u2019m specially trained, qualified and experienced in aiding the rehabilitation of people struggling with problem gambling, and working with people who are affected by others\u2019 problem gambling protect themselves and rebuild their lives. I spend 30% of the hours of my day job working with these people. \nI\u2019m going to make a very bold statement: micro-transactions with a \u2018chance\u2019 element are gambling . They are what is called an \u2018embedded gambling element\u2019 in a game. They may be a \u2018softer\u2019 form of gambling than sitting at a poker machine, but they are gambling. They normalise gambling to children ( which has been shown to lead to problem gambling ). They groom future problem gamblers, and they exploit people who have neurochemical imbalances (ie, depression). There is a very, very strong link between gambling and mental illness. People who gamble in games are more likely to susceptible to current and future gambling problems. \nI\u2019m going to focus on lootboxes in Overwatch, because it\u2019s the game I know the most about. I also know a lot about how poker machines are psychologically designed to be highly addictive, specifically exploiting known psychological triggers to reel people in and keep them spending. \nPoker machines \u2018tease\u2019 you with near wins which provide you with the same adrenaline and dopamine release as an actual win. \nOverwatch lootboxes do the same - you know that feel of seeing a purple/gold coin flipping in the air??? OMG! Is it going to be THAT THING YOU REALLY!!!!-oh. \nBright colours, exciting lights, the visceral feel of pushing the button/spinning the wheel is important to addiction. Blizzard has does the same with lootboxes - by vibrating your controller. By shaking the camera. By having the lootbox rATTLE AND EXPLODE!!!! with your reward. The sounds and specially engineered to build excitement and tensions and remind you of wealth. The \u2018coin\u2019 system of the lootbox reminds you of wealth. This is all super deliberate - it\u2019s not a mistake. Using subconscious cues like exploding money boxes!!! the sound of money, the shape of money - that\u2019s likening the process to a lottery. \nWhile it\u2019s quite unlikely someone could actually spend ENORMOUS amounts of money chasing that \u2018jackpot\u2019 (the skin they really want for their character, for example), it is possible. HOWEVER, it\u2019s much more likely that the person will have this sort of reward system normalised , will find the element of chance \u2018exciting\u2019 (because, dude, we\u2019re psychologically engineered to be more interested in \u2018chance\u2019 events than certain/impossible events), and seek out and enjoy other similar passtimes. Like actual gambling with real money. \nEvery time you gamble, you change the structure of your brain . I\u2019m not exaggerating. Every time you take a chance on that lootbox, you flood your brain with adrenaline and dopamine. The presence of those two neurochemicals changes the density of the receptors of them minutely. After a few boxes, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll become addicted. However, if you keep doing it, your receptors change density so that you need more adrenaline and more dopamine to get the same excitement and pleasure from the hit. \nWorse, this rush of adrenaline and dopamine is much, much more addictive to people with mental illness (or a susceptibility to mental illness), as the presence of these chemicals is a very unhealthy (but unfortunately effective, at least in the extremely short term) way of medicating mental illness. Unfortunately, because of the escalating changes in receptor density, it eventually makes mental illness much worse in the long run. There is a strong link between gambling and suicide. \nCompare your first lootbox with the lootboxes you get now. Are you getting the same enjoyment? Nope. \nThink how many times you bought 11 lootboxes\u2026. only to buy another 11 and another 11 and another 11. It becomes mechanical, pressing that button, opening another lootbox. Kind of like sitting at a poker machine. \nThink about how normal the lootbox system seems now. \nChance-based gambling reward systems in games are dangerous, and should be replaced either by work-and-reward systems (you get 10 credits per level, and you can spend these on rewards of your choice), combined with micro-transaction-based currency for people who do not have the time to commit to leveling 300 times for that epic Christmas skin. \nRemove chance. Just remove it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:58.035+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "223a10a56646f7bd36d47b0b4f3380e0fee21fc6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju36KO5TQAagFKfo4EoOUEifhyZd3FduGX8VC8BktjhaXfy9dZn1FWC1tCY6nbpdC3TmzuL9RVSgHelVkAdbhAR4vylD7Sd6Qd1OFVKJzCqBb6WAECvjBj8pw", "site_full": "www.ign.com", "site": "ign.com", "site_section": "http://www.ign.com/boards/forums/the-vestibule.5296/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "The Vestibule | IGN Boards", "title": "New Destiny 2 expansion/update locks players out from old previous content", "title_full": "New Destiny 2 expansion/update locks players out from old previous content | IGN Boards", "published": "2017-12-06T18:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 18, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "http://www.ign.com/boards/styles/default/ign/ign-logo-100x100.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 383, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "de607fb4611b33e82d88d845271080dd5de4c702", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju36KO5TQAagFKfo4EoOUEifhyZd3FduGX8VC8BktjhaXfy9dZn1FWC1tCY6nbpdC3TmzuL9RVSgHelVkAdbhAR4vylD7Sd6Qd1OFVKJzCqBb6TU8oPI4VAFvAWBgfNPa6Mw-", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Satern", "published": "2017-12-06T19:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Why did they even make a second?

SAN JOSE, Calif. (PRWEB) December 07, 2017 \nA revocable living trust is the most common form of estate planning in California, and creates an entity that allows for the bypassing of the probate system. \u201cInstead of going through probate it goes to the trustee you\u2019ve appointed,\u201d said estate planning attorney Adam Diran , co-founder of Diran & Grey. \u201cHowever, the trustee only has direct access to assets that are titled into the trust. No asset is in a trust unless it has a title document that says that it is in the trust.\u201d \nTo further educate people about revocable living trusts and estate planning , Diran shares the following two tips, which are not to be taken as legal advice and are only meant for public service. \nNo. 1: Transfer all financial assets into the trust. \u201cI\u2019ve discovered that the majority of people who come into my office, about 60%, have made an error that ruins their estateplan,\u201d noted Diran. \u201cMost people never fund their trusts. For example, for a house typically held as \u2018Mr. and Mrs. Smith, husband and wife,\u2019 what their deed needs to say is \u2018Mr. and Mrs. Smith as trustees for Mr. and Mrs. Smith trust\u2026\u2019\u201d \nPeople need to transfer not just their homes, but all their financial assets into the trust. For example, brokerage accounts. \u201cThey realize their house has a deed, they don\u2019t think their bank account has a title doc, and it does,\u201d added Diran. \u201cIf you have a trust, all of your assets need to be titled in the trust, otherwise it does nothing for you.\u201d \nNo. 2: Fund the revocable living trust in the future. \u201cFunding doesn\u2019t just mean the accounts you have now; it also means the accounts you open next week, next year, or ten years from now,\u201d stressed Diran. \u201cThe issue is not just trusts that aren\u2019t initially funded but trusts that aren\u2019t maintained. We all go through life opening and closing financial accounts, buying cars, and hopefully buying real estate. This is a very simple issue to deal with. A brief call to your financial institutions to make sure your assets are properly titled could potentially save your children many thousands of dollars in legal fees.\u201d \nThink about creating a trust as creating a big box. \u201cIf you don\u2019t put your assets in the box, the big empty box doesn\u2019t do you any good,\u201d concluded Diran. \u201cSadly, I frequently see people that come in with beautifully written trusts that were never properly funded.\u201d \nAbout Adam Diran, Diran & GreyAdam Diran is a J.D. and an M.B.A. Adam uses his financial expertise to advise clients in estate planning.

If the issue is not resolved, it could have serious long-term effects, especially given the prevalence of cheap natural gas and wind energy. \n\u201cSolar demand destruction is already happening. 2019 and 2020 is what\u2019s at stake here,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Sullivan, senior vice president of NextEra Energy Inc. The tariffs that have been proposed would be too high to allow new utility-scale solar projects, he said. \nThe Trade Representative\u2019s hearing will be used to help it come up with a recommendation to Trump on whether to impose tariffs on solar imports, and, if so, what kind of trade protection to apply. The U.S. International Trade Commission proposed that Trump set a tariff of up to 35 percent on imported solar panels. The all-day hearing including pleas from domestic installers, foreign supplier representatives and utilities that buy solar products. \nRepresentatives of Suniva Inc. and SolarWorld AG, the companies that petitioned the U.S. government for the tariffs and quotas, argued the protection is necessary to protect the U.S. solar manufacturing industry, which has been harmed by a deluge of imports from foreign manufacturers, particularly from China. \nRead More: U.S. Trade Panel Proposes Duties of Up to 35% in Solar Case \nSuniva urged Trump to impose higher tariffs than what the independent ITC recommended. \n\u201cThe Chinese government has made dominance of the international solar market a national priority,\u201d said Matt Card, Suniva\u2019s executive vice president. \u201cUnfortunately, the recommendations proposed by the commission are insufficient to remedy the serious injury to the domestic industry.\u201d \nThe issue has drawn together Republicans and Democrats that say protection would result in fewer U.S. jobs, because so many are dependent on installing solar panels. In addition, representatives of foreign governments, trade associations and companies asked for particular exemptions from the tariffs, if the administration agrees to impose them. \nJames Durling of Curtis Mallet, a lawyer for LG Electronics Inc., said imports from South Korea should be exempted from any tariffs being considered by the president. \n\u201cKorea is not China,\u201d Durling said, adding that the tariffs are being considered based on continuing imports from Chinese companies. \u201cLG has supplied distinctive products and developed distinctive market niches.\u201d \nHeesang Kim, an economic minister at the South Korean embassy, said that imports from the country account for only 6 percent of solar imports and should be excluded on the grounds that they do not present a threat to the domestic industry at that level. \nOutside the trade agency\u2019s offices, solar installers protested the idea, arguing that making solar panels more expensive threatens their livelihood. \n\u201cWe\u2019re one of the rare solar companies that has a residential and a commercial division,\u201d said Micah Gold-Markel, founder of Solar States in Philadelphia. \u201cCommercial jobs have been put on pause.

Sunrise can accommodate the printing, folding, addressing and mailing all in one shot. CHICAGO (PRWEB) December 07, 2017 \nThere is something special about a paper holiday card arriving in the mail; it just feels more personal than email or text greetings. Even so, in this digital age, many people are going the easy route instead of dealing with the hassle of writing and mailing paper cards. Now what if there was an easy way to send traditional paper greeting cards without the same old headaches? that\u2019s where Sunrise comes in. \nMany websites already offer customized greeting cards, but most of them fall short in terms of quality, speed, or service. Holiday greeting cards from Sunrise Hitek take holiday cards to the next level. They offer a huge variety of options from paper: white, color, pearlescent, translucent, or metallic, envelopes: standard or custom to other more exotic materials such as clear film, frosted polycarbonate, rigid vinyl and other synthetic substrates. \nOne highly custom option is opaque white ink which is available for printing on clear and colored substrates. White ink can be printed under, over, or blended with 4-color elements for special effects. New, heavy substrates up to 18pt cover or 20pt rigid vinyl are great for heavier ornament cards. Choose from common card sizes 4.5\u201dx6\u201d, 5\u201dx7\u201d, 5.5\u201dx8.5\u201d or any custom size. Sunrise provides a turn-key solution to card sending with in-house mailing and fulfillment. Simply provide artwork and mailing list and Sunrise will take it from there. \nAnother exciting service is their new laser-cutting feature. Highly intricate laser-cutting allows for the most delicate of internal cuts to be made. Names can be cut, silhouettes, even complicated cuts such as buildings in the Chicago skyline. Laser-cutting will add pizzazz to regular Christmas and New year cards. \nSunrise Hitek guarantees the highest quality standards in their holiday card printing. The Indigo process ensures, sharp, detailed color reproduction which is a must in photo cards as well as full bleed printing at no additional charge. Sunrise does all this in a cost-effective manner with best-in-the-business turnaround times, perfect for those holiday procrastinators. \nAbout Sunrise Hitek Group, LLC. Sunrise Hitek was established in 1988 and employs the most advanced equipment and technology, such as G7-certified HP Indigo and UV flatbed presses, laser engraving, and digital die-cutting, to create best-in-class color printing, short-run packaging, P.O.P. retail displays, and signage products.

It became pretty road worn in its day and I have recently removed the scratch plate (which was very ugly), bridge & saddle, nut and tuners to refinish the woodwork.\nI have replaced the plastic nut with a bone nut and replaced the tuners. I bought a replacement rosewood bridge with compensated bone saddle, but am now uncertain whether or not I should proceed.\nThe original bridge and adjustable saddle are rosewood. They are the same as an early Gibson bridge. Obviously the early Japanese guitar makers knew what they were doing and the guitar has a particular tone of its own. I have however forgotten what it sounds like as it has been in in dry dock for about 4 years now and I currently play a D28.\nIt was a cheap guitar originally with plywood back and sides, but it has sentimental value, so that's why I'm working on it (and learning a few skills as I go).\nDoes anyone have experience with these old adjustable rosewood saddles? The question is: Should I keep it or replace it with the new rosewood bridge with bone saddle?\nAny help would be appreciated.\nFunny, right now I\u0092m visiting a guitar tech that\u0092s gonna work on the adjustable saddle on my 1970\u0092s Japanese guitar.

LONDON (PRWEB UK) 7 December 2017 \nFilestream announces that the largest not-for-profit agricultural purchasing organisation in the UK, AF Group, is using its electronic document management software (EDMS) to manage all the storage and indexing of invoices which total around 480,000 per year. \nWith a turnover in excess of \u00a3230 million annually, The AF Group (AF) purchases around 10% of the UK\u2019s total farm inputs on behalf of its 3,500 stakeholder members. Working with 1,900 suppliers, it procures 200,000 tonnes of fertiliser, 80 million litres of fuel, 105,000 tonnes of livestock feed, 500 cars and over \u00a32 million worth of tyres. In addition, AF manages 14,000 mobile phone and 5,o00 fixed lines contracts. \nWith its headquarters in Norfolk, AF formed in January 2003 as a result of the merger of two long established buying groups \u2013 Loddon Farmers and Mid Norfolk Farmers. \nAlex Morton, AF\u2019s operations manager, says, \u201cWe get greater buying power for our members through economies of scale, with an efficient back office service reducing their administrative overheads. It means farmers can get on and farm rather than dealing with all the invoicing and accounting tasks related to the purchasing of equipment and supplies for their businesses.\u201d \nEDMS solves the paper handling process each month \nWith so many transactions and a membership growing year on year, managing the invoice process was a paper handling headache given that most came by post. Each month, AF used to collate all the invoices from suppliers, photocopy and then post the members the originals as a printed consolidated pack with a statement outlining the amount due. Self-evidently, this was hugely laborious, time-consuming, inefficient and error prone. \nTo solve this, AF has worked closely with suppliers so that many now submit invoices electronically \u2013 via either email or XML \u2013 with an EDMS from Filestream purchased to store and index them. Today, 40% of invoices are processed via XML up from 20% in 2015. Error rates with billing are just 0.4% \u2013 an impressive figure given the quantity of invoices received. Paper invoices received are scanned and stored in File Stream, too. \nFile Stream integrates with AF\u2019s bespoke built CRM called AFi which allows all staff in the office to view any invoice related to a supplier or member at the touch of a button. The use of XML also means that staff avoid having to rekey information into its systems thereby improving data capture. \nAlex Morton says, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to extract more data from our invoices so we can complete further analysis about what we\u2019re buying. Historically, if an invoice was received with 20 or so line items, for example, this would be entered as 1 line and coded to \u2018machinery\u2019, which is not very useful. Now we use a tool called Esker to extract all the detail from a PDF invoice and then business intelligence and data analytics software from Tableau to interrogate this \nfurther. This means ultimately we\u2019ll be in a better position to assess at a granular level precisely what we\u2019re buying and then negotiate better prices with suppliers on behalf of our members.\u201d \nThe use of an EDMS to store copies of all invoices helps AF\u2019s back office staff to automate the generation of members\u2019 eBilling packs each month. \nAlex Morton says, \u201cOur eBilling process has become quite advanced, allowing us to consolidate 40,000 invoices each month and send packs to each member, 75% of which are e-mailed. Members can also view invoices via a portal called AF Interactive, and then download accounts data straight into their own software packages like Farm Plan.\u201d \nWhile 95% of the content stored in File Stream is invoice related, AF is also using the software to manage other corporate information such as membership renewal forms, contracts and order confirmations. \nEDMS delivers clear return on investment \nFile Stream is delivering five key benefits to AF: \n1. Productivity is enhanced through the removal of paper-based processes. Compared to the volumes in 2003, AF processes about ten times as many invoices each month but with the same number of administrative staff;2. Service to members is improved as billing information is provided accurately to them and on time.3. Levy costs to members per transaction have been maintained due to the increased efficiency of AF\u2019s back office operation.4. Access to accounting and corporate information is quick and easy and available at a touch of a button.5. Data retention policies can easily be set in the software so that auditing and compliance rules are met. \nCharles Hooker, Filestream\u2019s managing director, says, \u201cOur software is easy to use, flexible and has created a central repository for AF to store invoices and other corporate data. It is an excellent use case example of where EDMS really delivers commercial value given a manual paper-based way of managing invoices has been removed.\u201d \nAbout Filestream Limited \nBased in Wokingham, Filestream Limited is a supplier of electronic document management software. First developed in 2003, Filestream\u2019s EDMS is written in-house by developers using current Microsoft\u00ae technology including MS SQL and .net framework.
