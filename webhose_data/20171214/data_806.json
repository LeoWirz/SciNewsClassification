Have your say Dame Muriel Spark's fans will get the chance to see the handwritten manuscript of her most famous novel for the first time ever in a major new exhibition in her home city of Edinburgh. \nThe writer shot to fame with The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, which was written in just four weeks in four exercise jotters bought at James Thin\u2019s bookshop in the capital. The first page of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. \nThe National Library of Scotland has secured the loan of the original manuscript from the University of Tulsa, in the United States, which acquired it several decades ago. \nIt is understood that the manuscript, which the writer sold direct to the university, has never been on public display before. \nPublished in 1961, the book was adapted for the stage give years later, was turned into a film in 1969, which won Maggie Smith an Academy Award, and was then adapted into an STV series, starring Geraldine McEwan, in 1978. \nIts exhibition will feature the writer\u2019s handbags, dresses, a portable typewriter, a ration book and personal letters. \nHighlights include correspondence and betting slips relating to a race-horse she bought from the Queen, a note from Hollywood star Elizabeth Taylor telling the writer that she and Richard Burton were \u201cgreat fans\u201d and a letter from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis offering to buy the worldwide rights to the author\u2019s autobiography. \nBorn in Edinburgh in 1918 to a Jewish father and a Presbyterian mother, Spark attended James Gillespie\u2019s High School, where one of the teachers, Christina Kay, was to inspire her best known novel, The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie. \nShe left the city aged just 19 when she met and married Sydney Oswald Spark, and the couple moved to Southern Rhodesia. \nShe moved to London in 1944 when the marriage broke up shortly after the birth of their son, Robin. Determined to carve out a writing career, Spark took a job with the British intelligence service. \nSpark, who lived with her close friend Penelope Jardine in Tuscany from the early 1970s until her death in 2006, famously refused to throw out any of her personal papers. \nThe archive has gradually been acquired by the National Library, one of the main organisers of a nationwide programme of centenary events over the next 12 months. \nThe exhibition, which opens to the public tomorrow, explores her negotiations to see her life story turned into a big-screen movie and stage musicals, the support she generated from fellow writers, such as Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene, and private correspondence with Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and US President Richard Nixon\u2019s wife, Pat. \nCurator Colin McIlroy said: \u201cWhat comes through strongly from correspondence in the archive is a picture of a generous, fun loving individual which is not how she has always been portrayed. \n\u201cShe did fall out with people and she knew how to stand up for herself but she comes across as a much warmer and caring person than perhaps I was expecting. \n\u201cShe kept friends for decades and she was fiercely loyal. I hope this exhibition helps people to get a better understanding of the person behind the books.\u201d Follow Us On ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

"text": "Source: imported from this press release . \nThe biological product manufacturing is a complex process which produces products derived from recombinant DNA technology to develop a series of processes to manufacture therapeutic products. A biological product can be a virus, antitoxin, vaccine, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, or analogous product, or any therapeutic serum used for the treatment of a disease in humans. These biological products were developed from multicellular systems comprising of plants, animals, unicellular organisms and a mammalian cell. Biological products are composed of sugars, nucleic acids or combination of both. \nReport overview @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/biologi\u2026 \nDuring the 20th century, the world witnessed many great discoveries in the biological product manufacturing industry. One of the first biological products to be introduced in the U.S. market was a blood protein known as Factor VIII which was first sold in 1966.The first FDA approved modern biological product designed for human therapeutic use was insulin; the approval was given in 1982.During 1985, FDA approved human growth hormone (HGF).The manufacturing of biological product differs from product to product; the process involves product-specific process consideration. One very important step involved in biological product manufacturing is controlled the environmental control of particulate and microbial contamination of the biological product production facility. The difference between biological products and conventional drug are, the biological product is heat sensitive and are prone to cross-contamination. Therefore they require a contaminant free environment during manufacturing \nBiological product manufacturing facilities use analytical and process development capabilities for the developing and scaling up the process for increased production maintaining the quality of the biological product. The implementation of such process control assist the Phase 1 clinical studies which focus on the product safety and efficacy. The biological product manufacturing is governed by many various regulatory authorities which make it harder for products approvals, because of overlapping opinions and other redundancies. Therefore to bring all regulatory authorities under one roof, the international conference on harmonization of technical requirements was formed in 1990 for the registration of pharmaceuticals for human use. The ICH has helped biological product manufacturers to register and develop a better quality product which is safe and more efficient. \nThe biological products are produced in three ways: by developing ways to achieve commercial production of the substance to be used, by gene alteration of the molecule and finally by developing an entirely new substance. Some of the tools used by modern day researcher in the manufacturing of biological products are recombinant DNA and monoclonal antibodies. Recombinant DNA involves altering of the DNA chain of one organism with desired DNA molecule to produce a novel biological product. Monoclonal antibodies were developed from single cell cultures using cloning techniques; these were designed to fight against toxins, viruses, and cancer cells. The first genetically engineered biological product approved for use in the U.S. was a vaccine for hepatitis-B which was approved in 1986, in the same year, other biological products like therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (MAB\u2019s) and alpha interferon\u2019s were approved. \nRequest to sample report @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/13591 \nThe biological product manufacturing strictly follows GMP (Good manufacturing practices) rules for all production process from beginning to the last step for biological product manufacturing. These guidelines imply to the change in facility, manufacturing processes and other guidelines regarding clinical trials of the biological product related to its safety and purity. The major drivers for biological product manufacturing market increase in population, increasing the incidence of chronic diseases and increased government initiatives. \nBy regional presence, global biological product manufacturing market is segmented into five key regions viz. North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia-Pacific-Pacific, and the Middle East & Africa. The region of North America is a forerunner in biological product manufacturing market globally mainly because of strong product development, technological advancements and increasing the population. The North America market is closely followed by Europe and Asia-Pacific. The region of Asia Pacific is an emerging market for referral management system mainly because of increasing proficiency in IT skills and growing healthcare expenditure in the region. \nThe leading players in the referral management market are Novartis AG, F.Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Merck & Co., Inc., Bayer AG, Lonza, China Biologic Products, Inc., Pfizer Inc., Sanofi, GOLDEN WEST BIOLOGICALS, Inc., Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Amgen Inc. \nBuy now @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/checkout/13591 \nAbout Us \nPersistence Market Research (PMR) is a third-platform research firm.

I cordially said Yes, I would love to go with them, not knowing where they were going actually.  But I did ask whether it is a formal or informal and my friend's reply was, \"just be casual and I would be wearing Bermuda shorts\".... LOL.. Sounds good to me, I like casual wear too!\n\nIt was drizzling that evening and on the way, we went to the railway station to pick up a lovely lady who was coming back from Kuala Lumpur.  Then we adjourned for our dinner at STG Boutique Cafe in old town. This is my second time to this place, the first time was a few years back if I am not mistaken.  Anyway, the ambience was beautiful and cozy...unfortunately I didn't go round taking pictures of the place.  Shy ma... \nChristmas tree at the corner....  Managed to take this from the corner I was sitting...  As for the food, this is Mine! Orange Grilled Chicken...  A better light and angle from another camera...  Lamb Shank for the younger generation...  Managed to take two dishes in one picture...  One is Braised Duck (if not mistaken) and Tomyam meehoon with Fried Chicken..  Ahhh... another photo from another camera...  A bit too bright...  Then when everything was eaten up and the table cleared... The staff came out singing... Happy Birthday and holding these in their hands....  Sparkling \"champagne\"...LOL... And The Beloved Desserts!! MY SURPRISED EXPRESSION.. captured! My Lovely Friend who planned this!

I think Dershowitz has a need for public attention that blinds him to the lethal level of stupidity and arrogance currently holding sway in DC.\nTrump and his useful Republican idiots like Lindsay Graham are edging closer to military conflict on the Korean peninsula in order to distract from Mueller's investigation:\nhttp://therealnews.com/t2/story:20629:Preemptive-Strike-on-North-Korea:-Is-Trump-Wagging-the-Dog?\n\"REPORTER: Where are we with North Korea right now?\n\"SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: We're getting close to military conflict because North Korea is marching toward marrying up the technology of an ICBM with a nuclear weapon on top that can not only get to America but can deliver the weapon. We're running out of time. McMaster said that yesterday. I'm going to urge the Pentagon not to send any more dependents to South Korea. South Korea should be an unaccompanied tour. It's crazy to send spouses and children to South Korea given the provocation of North Korea, so I want them to stop sending dependents. I think it's now time to start moving American dependents out of South Korea.\n\"REPORTER: How close? You say we're getting close to a military confrontation. What are we talking about here?\n\"SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: The intelligence community can tell you that better than I can but I have an extensive discussion with the administration about this topic. The policy of the Trump administration is to deny North Korea the capability to hit America with a nuclear-tipped missile, not to contain it. That now means preemptive war as a last result. That preemption is becoming more likely as their technology matures. Every missile test, every underground test of a nuclear weapon means the marriage is more likely. I think we're really running out of time . The Chinese are trying, but ineffectively. If there's an underground nuclear test, then you need to get ready for a very serious response by the United States.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Penn. State - 10 pointsOther receiving votes:Miami - 8 pointsWashington - 1 pointComments: our composite poll turned out pretty damn good in my eyes, but I know that many people would heavily disagree with these rankings. What was really odd about our rankings is that while the rest of the country was having a huge debate about whether Alabama or Ohio State should get the 4th spot, we really didn't have much disagreement in this area. Every single one of our writers had Alabama at the 4th spot, and there was really no debate between any of us in conversations of who should make the 4th spot. We all thought Alabama was considerably better and more deserving than the Buckeyes, as evidenced by our rankings. In fact, Auburn vs. Ohio State for the 5th spot was far more of a debate between our writers, and we actually ended up favoring Auburn for the most part. The majority of us felt like Auburn had less egregious losses than Ohio State while also having a better resume in terms of quality wins. Auburn beat half of all of the teams who are going to be in the playoffs come January 1st, so our writers, for the most part, decided Auburn was even more worthy of a playoff spot than Ohio State was. We aren't going to have the most popular poll in the eyes of Ohio State fans, but I believe we made the right choices.Patrick Rodgers, MLB lead writer/NCAAF writer1.

The state charged the baker with unlawful discrimination. Those vexed lawyers are having trouble deciding whether the baker has a First Amendment right to refuse to create a wedding cake for the gay couple. Some of them say yes and some say no. Floyd - Abrams - Times - Nation - First Floyd Abrams, who the Times calls the nation\u2019s most prominent First Amendment lawyer, at first leaned toward the baker, repelled by the notion that the state could require him to create some sort of artistic rendering that violated his conscience. But then he started leaning the other way, asking \u201cCould a painter invite the public to his gallery at which he painted portraits of them for a fee but refused to paint black people?\u201d Abrams finally came down on the side of the gay couple.Eugene Volokh, who the Times describes as a \u201cleading First Amendment scholar,\u201d sided with the gay couple as well. While photographers and painters have the First Amendment right to decide which commissions to take, Volokh says, it\u2019s different with bakers. A chef cannot claim a free speech right not to serve people at his restaurant, he said, no matter how beautiful his dishes look. Ilya - Shapiro - Lawyer - Cato - Institute Ilya Shapiro, a lawyer with the Cato Institute, said that writers, singers, actors, and painters are entitled to First Amendment protection but not caterers and limousine drivers. Bakers, he said, are a close call because they are \u201cclose to the line.\u201d Shapiro has sided with the baker.The legal controversy vexing all these great...   www.zerohedge.com 5  ",

Doctors - Lack - Symptoms Though he was slow to develop, doctors were impressed by his lack of other symptoms.Months later when Allison went for her postpartum appointment, the couple were...

annistonstar.com", "text": "Lincoln's Surles earns The Daily Home Player of the Week honors LaVonte Young, Daily Home sports editor, Dec 6, 2017 \nJavion Surles averaged 26.5 points per game last week for the Lincoln Golden Bears. Submitted photo Save Javion Surles was selected The Daily Home Player of the Week after leading Lincoln High School\u2019s boys basketball team to a 1-1 record over a seven-day span. Surles averaged 26.5 points over two games for the Golden Bears. The sophomore guard scored 27 points in an 88-82 win over Pell City on Nov. 28 after the Golden Bears fell to Pell City 65-49 on Nov. 21 in the Lincoln Thanksgiving Tournament. Surles said the team played better against Pell City the second time around. \u201cWe were moving the ball better,\u201d Surles said. \u201cI was getting open looks, so I took them. Some of my friends were taking good shots as well. On defense, we were getting good stops, sometimes it wasn\u2019t good, but we stopped them enough where they wouldn\u2019t score. I played good because of my teammates. They encouraged me.\u201d Surles had another solid outing against Alexandria in a losing effort. Surles scored 26 points against the Valley Cubs. The 6-foot-2, 185-pound guard said playing against Alabama-Huntsville commit Dalton Dobb helped him see what it takes to get to the next level. Dobb scored 41 against the Golden Bears. \u201cIt helped a lot \u2026 playing against someone who is committed to a college team,\u201d Surles said. \u201cIt helps us because he is taller, he is stronger, and I don\u2019t want to say smarter, but he knows what it takes to get to the next level. Playing against him, you try to think more and play better. Playing against him lets you know what you have to do to make it to the next level.\u201d Lincoln head coach Jeffrey Lumpkin said he was pleased with the way Surles was able to balance disturbing the ball to his teammates as well as being aggressive and looking for his own shots last week. \u201cHe gave our team a real boost scoring wise,\u201d Lumpkin said. \u201cHe is our point guard, and everything runs through him. He is really good about getting players involved and helping them get their shot. Obviously, he can get his own shot as well; he scored 27 and 26 in our games last week. He had a really nice week for us.\u201d Lumpkin said he is going to need Surles to continue to play with composure, especially when playing area teams like Talladega and Central Clay County. \u201cWe are going to need him to show the poise that he has shown in games where we had really tough competition this year, \u201cLumpkin said. \u201cWe played an awesome Sylacauga team, and that wasn\u2019t our finest moment. I want him to continue to get used to playing in big games, (I want him) to step up on the big stage and perform and continue to get everybody involved.\u201d Surles doesn\u2019t have a professional or college player that he tries to imitate. Instead, he looks up his father and stepfather. \u201cI try to be like my stepfather, (Gary Young), and my father, (James Surles),\u201d Surles said. \u201cMy stepdad played at Munford High School, and every game his father would tell him, \u2018If your opponent is not better than you, still go hard.\u2019 I always hear people talking about my father and how he was in college (Calhoun Community College). They talked about how he moved the ball and how well he could score. I try to do better than them and make them proud.\u201d Lincoln will return to action Saturday when it hosts rival Munford at 1 p.m.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "surles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lincoln", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gary young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dalton dobb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeffrey lumpkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lumpkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "munford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "save javion surles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dobb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james surles", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lincoln", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "munford high school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lincoln thanksgiving tournament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "javion surles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "talladega", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lincoln golden bears", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lincoln high school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valley cubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calhoun community college", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sylacauga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama-huntsville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central clay county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexandria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pell city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:57.024+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "978d6b160e2690bf897b874651fb3b8e122555d5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.91026zXfsQ52DTI59KEh06jHjEail1m9DONe35eqU4NT5i9XYP9PSDu305_dmnAxU5ELauuTslfKyxaEIFnH", "site_full": "www.gamefaqs.com", "site": "gamefaqs.com", "site_section": "https://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/210930-pokemon-ultra-sun", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Pokemon Ultra Sun Message Board for 3DS - GameFAQs", "title": "The poster above you is now your rival!", "title_full": "The poster above you is now your rival! - Pokemon Ultra Sun Message Board for 3DS - GameFAQs", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.02, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 569, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "978d6b160e2690bf897b874651fb3b8e122555d5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.91026zXfsQ52DTI59KEh06jHjEail1m9DONe35eqU4NT5i9XYP9PSDu305_dmnAxU5ELauuTslfKyxaEIFnH", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "The poster above you is now your rival!", "text": "User Info: RoccoRed RoccoRed 3 hours ago #1 After someone posts, that someone will now be your rival.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nWith the next transfer window less than a month away from opening, our Wolves fan pundit Ryan Leister looks at the possible outgoings from Molineux in January \nMicha\u0142 \u017byro \nSince returning from the horrible injury he sustained against MK Dons, it's been tough for the former Legia Warsaw man to get back into contention under Nuno. \nWho knows what could have been after his promising start but it appears his future is now away from Molineux. \nVerdict: sell \nBen Marshall \nDespite being one of Wolves better performers at the latter part of last season, the \u00a31.2m signing has struggled to take any of the few opportunities he's been given and as a result hasn't been making the match day squad recently. \nAbsolutely no doubting his talent but when he has Jota, Costa, Cavaleiro and now Bright all ahead of him in his position, it seems his best opportunity for first team football may be elsewhere. \nVerdict: sell \nJoe Mason \nIn his loan move at Burton so far, he's played only 287 minutes and scored just the one goal. \nThe former Cardiff man is due to return to Wolves in January and I only see another loan or permanent move away for him. \nOther than fine strikes away at Forest and Birmingham, it's never really worked out for him at Wolves. \nVerdict: Sell (but if no takers then loan) Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now \nConor Ronan \nAlong with Morgan Gibbs-White, one of the most exciting home grown prospects that Wolves have developed in a while. \nDuring the few outings he\u2019s impressed, particularly in the cup games at Southampton and Man City, but seven appearances and 254 minutes of first team football is nowhere near enough at this stage of the season. \nThe talented Irishman is 20 in March so regular first team football is a must for him to continue his development and as much as I\u2019d like that to be at Wolves, at this moment in time it seems unlikely. \nVerdict: Loan \nPrince Oniangu\u00e9 \n\u2013 Other than his ten appearances for Wolves and 14 whilst on loan at Bastia, it\u2019s not been the best 18 months for the Congo International. \nIt was clear he wasn\u2019t part of Nuno\u2019s plans from early on last summer so I guess the biggest surprise is that he didn\u2019t depart in the last window. \nVerdict: Sell (but if no takers then loan) \nKortney Hause (Image: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images) \nSo far limited to just the one appearance this season, which was an impressive one and a clean sheet at Man City. \nAbsolutely no questioning his potential but in terms of first team centre backs, he seems to be way down the pecking order at Molineux at the moment. \nLike Ronan, he\u2019s at a stage when he absolutely needs to be playing regular first team football and the best opportunity for that would most likely be away from Wolves. \nVerdict: Loan \nSylvain Deslandes (Image: Matthew Ashton/AMA) \nThe likeable Frenchman seems to be third choice left back and even further down the list as a centre back. \nIt is a struggle to see where he fits in at Molineux going forwards but he\u2019s still only 20, so the best move for his career would surely be a loan move to get regular first team football and see how he progresses. \nVerdict: Loan Further reading \nWolves have been linked with a January move for Watford striker Stefano Okaka. \nThe 28-year-old Italian striker is said to have turned down a loan move to Molineux in August with Wolves floundering for a striker to assist Leo Bonatini. \nThe Mirror have reported that Okaka looks set to leave The Hornets in the January window with a move to Wolves surely now a more attractive proposition. \nOkaka is a powerful forward who signed for Watford from Anderlecht in a \u00a310m deal in 2016, he had scored 15 goals in 37 games for the Belgian side. \nHis time at Watford has been less successful with 5 goals in 20 games and very limited playing time under Marco Silva. \nHe has been capped at international level for Italy and at 6 ft 1 in he would give Wolves a very different option up front to what they have at the moment. Nuno nominated \nThe Championship is starting to hot up as the half-way point approaches. \nWolves lead the way after finding a way to win ugly on the road to extend their lead at the top of the table. \nAt home they\u2019re a joy to watch and have been scoring goals for fun. \nBut second-placed Cardiff won\u2019t give up, neither will chasing Aston Villa. \nSo who deserves the Sky Bet manager of the month award? Here are the nominations. \nNuno Espirito Santo (Wolverhampton Wanderers) \nThe Portuguese has instilled a swashbuckling style at Molineux. \nNot only did his side win all four games, they did so with ease, scoring at least two goals in every game and managing four and five against Leeds and Bolton, respectively. Douglas nominated too \nBarry Douglas (Wolverhampton Wanderers) \nThree assists and a goal from a free-kick in three games as a defender is outstanding. What made the left-back\u2019s contributions even more valuable was that he either set up or scored the opening goal in every game he played. Three on the shortlist \nNuno Espirito Santo has made signing a striker his top January transfer window priority and three proven Championship goal-getters feature highly in his thinking. \nLeo Bonatini and Bright Enobakhare are Wolves' only senior strikers following the summer sale of Nouha Dicko and Nuno wants added frontline competition to ensure promotion to the Premier League. \nWhile the club continues to be linked with foreign buys, Nuno is also considering players already plying their trade in England. \nDwight Gayle fired Newcastle United to the Championship title last season with 23 goals in 32 league appearances but the 27-year-old has been used sparingly since and could be offloaded in January as Rafa Benitez looks to raise transfer funds. \nGayle has returned to Newcastle\u2019s line-up in recent weeks and boasts two goals in his last three appearances. \nThe Magpies paid Crystal Palace \u00a310million for Gayle 18 months ago and would demand a significant improvement on that fee to part with him.

The leader of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that rules the Gaza Strip, called for a third uprising against Israel after President Donald Trump declared contested Jerusalem as the Israeli capital Time \nHamas leader Ismail Haniya gestures as he delivers a speech in Gaza City on Thursday over President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel (Photo: Said Hatib, AFP/Getty Images) \nCONNECT TWEET 6 LINKEDIN 90 COMMENT EMAIL MORE The leader of the terrorist group Hamas called for a new \"intifada\" or uprising against Israel Thursday after President Trump announced the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and said the United States would begin the lengthy process of moving the Embassy to the city. \nThe encouragement to revolt came as clashes between hundreds of Palestinian protesters and Israeli troops erupted across the West Bank Thursday. Demonstrators in Gaza burned posters of Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as U.S. and Israeli flags, as part of \"three days of rage\" that began Wednesday. \nTrump\u2019s controversial decision upended decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem and countered long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the ancient city, claimed by Israelis and Palestinians, would be determined in negotiations.\nMore: Trump's Jerusalem plan signals to Palestinians \u2014 the less you give up, the more you lose \nIn a news conference in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, the group's chief, Ismail Haniya, said that Washington's decision to reverse its policy amounted to a \"war declaration against Palestinians\" that \"killed\" the peace process. \n\"We have given instruction to all Hamas members and to all its wings to be fully ready for any new instructions or orders that may be given to confront this strategic danger that threatens Jerusalem and threatens Palestine,\" he said.\nHaniya said the uprising should start Friday. \"We want the uprising to last and continue to let Trump and the occupation regret this decision,\" he said. \nAt least 17 Palestinians, one seriously, were injured in Thursday's clashes, but Friday, the Muslim holy day, could be a bigger test when Palestinians gather for mass prayers.\nMeanwhile, the chorus of international condemnation grew Thursday. \nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Palestinians protest Trump recognition of Jerusalem as Israeli capital   Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

Saudi Arabia, a key American ally in the Middle East, called it \"irresponsible.\" Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned it would throw \"the region into a ring of fire.\" Federica Mogherini, the European Union's top foreign policy diplomat, said \"the announcement has the potential to send us backwards to even darker times than the one we are already living in.\"\nMogherini called for calm and appealed for \"the status quo of the holy places\" in Jerusalem to be preserved. The United Nations Security Council is expected to meet for talks and a briefing Friday over the policy change. \nMore: Trump's Jerusalem plan signals to Palestinians: less you give up, more you lose \nHamas' new \"intifada\" marks the third time such a request has been invoked.\nIsrael, the U.S. and the European Union consider Hamas either wholly or in part to be a terrorist organization. The group killed hundreds of Israelis during the Second Intifada, an armed uprising against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the early 2000s. Previous Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat led the First Intifada from 1987 to 1993. Hamas is currently locked in a feud with Fatah, the Palestinian nationalist movement led by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.\nMore: What is an intifada? \nAbbas was expected to travel to Jordan Thursday to meet with King Abdullah II. The monarch, who enjoys good relations with the U.S., is seen as Abbas\u2019 closest Arab ally, and the two leaders might try to coordinate a response to Trump\u2019s policy change.\nOn Wednesday, Abbas said Washington's move was a \"reward to Israel\" that encourages Israel's \"continued occupation\" of Palestinian areas. \nCLOSE There's a reason the U.S. Embassy in Israel has been located in Tel Aviv for decades. Here's why moving it to Jerusalem is raising concerns across the Middle East and beyond. USA TODAY \nIt remains unclear how destructive a new intifada from Hamas might be. The group's ability to carry out attacks is now more limited after Israel imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip. Many supporters of Hamas in the West Bank also have been arrested.\nNetanyahu said Thursday that Trump had \"bound himself forever\" to the history of Jerusalem by recognizing the city as Israel\u2019s capital. He also claimed that other nations would follow suit and make a similar recognition. \nMeanwhile, Israel's military said it would deploy additional troops to the West Bank ahead of Friday, when more mass Palestinian protests are anticipated.\nMore: Pence: Under Trump, 'America Stands with Israel' \nCLOSE President Donald Trump declared Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed Trump's announcement. But Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Trump's shift signals U.S. withdrawal from being a peace mediator.

The victim, an Anniston resident, was driving home following a basketball game when he reported hearing something like rocks striking his car. A passenger reported seeing someone hanging out of a passing car about the same time. Thompson said investigators had found at least 10 bullet holes in the windows, trunk and other locations on the car. One bullet appears to have damaged the headrest of a child safety seat in the back seat of the vehicle. The seat was unoccupied at the time of the shooting. No one in the vehicle was hit, Thompson said.
