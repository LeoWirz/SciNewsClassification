Politicians are not as popular like us; so, I believe musicians can use their names to make wealth. Instead of using your fame to sleep with every lady, use it to gather wealth for yourself. \n\nAccording to him, money doesn\u2019t make a man wealthy and he tries as much as possible to be a blessing to people around him. \n\u201cIf people say I have money, people around me must be blessed also. I am using this medium to talk to other artistes \u2013 music shouldn\u2019t be the only thing we do because no man can reign forever. Your product can sell forever, but it cannot reign forever because the young shall grow. \n\u201cYour new thing will become a thing of the past and nothing anyone can do about that. As I speak to you, I have not released any music this year because I have been working on building a television station. But I can still buy any car or anything I want.

Praise be to Allah\nFirstly :\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Your ally is none but Allah and [therefore] His Messenger and those who have believed \u2013 those who establish prayer and give zakah, and they bow [in worship]\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n[al-Maa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122idah 5:55] .\nThe word waliy [translated here as ally] means a lover, friend and supporter. This is indicated by the linguistic meaning and the context of the verse.\nAs for the linguistic meaning, it says in\u00c2 al-Qaamoos al-Muheet \u00c2 (p. 1344):\nAl-walyu means closeness, nearness\u00e2\u20ac\u015a\nAl-waliy is a noun derived from this root; it also means a lover, friend or supporter.\n[End quote]\nAs for the context of the verse, the preceding verses forbid taking the Jews and Christians as allies (or close friends), as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you \u2013 then indeed, he is [one] of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people. \nSo you see those in whose hearts is disease hastening into [association with] them, saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe are afraid a misfortune may strike us.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 But perhaps Allah will bring conquest or a decision from Him, and they will become, over what they have been concealing within themselves, regretful. \nAnd those who believe will say, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAre these the ones who swore by Allah their strongest oaths that indeed they were with you?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Their deeds have become worthless, and they have become losers\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n[al-Maa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122idah 5:51-53] .\nIbn \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAtiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe words \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Your ally is none but Allah \u00e2\u20ac\u009d are addressed to the same people as those to whom it was said [in v. 51], \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies \u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\n[End quote.\u00c2 Al-Muharrar al-Wajeez \u00c2 (2/208)]\nWhat is prohibited is taking them as allies; in other words, it is prohibited to take them as supporters and friends, and to love them, as Allah, may He be exalted, says elsewhere (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153You will not find a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day having affection for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred. Those \u2013 He has decreed within their hearts faith and supported them with spirit from Him. And We will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally. Allah is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him \u2013 those are the party of Allah. Unquestionably, the party of Allah \u2013 they are the successful\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n[al-Mujaadilah 58:22] .\nThe meaning does not make sense if it is understood as meaning that it is not allowed to seek their help to bring benefit or ward off harm. No rational person could understand it in this manner.\nThe point is that the context of the verse indicates that being an ally here is meant in the sense of love, friendship and support. The leading scholars of tafseer stated this.\nAt-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat Allah, may He be exalted, meant in the verse \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Your ally is none but Allah and [therefore] His Messenger and those who have believed \u00e2\u20ac\u009d is:\nO believers, you have no supporter or helper except Allah and His Messenger, and the believers whose description is as Allah, may He be exalted, stated. As for the Jews and Christians with whom Allah has instructed you to disavow any alliance, and has forbidden you to take allies from among them, they are not allies or supporters for you; rather they are allies of one another, so do not take any ally or supporter from among them.\n[End quote from\u00c2 Tafseer at-Tabari \u00c2 (8/529)]\nSecondly :\nFor this person to suggest that the word wali (ally) in this verse is referring to some specific individuals who were known for their righteousness, such as Shaykh \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAbd al-Qaadir al-Jilani, this is limiting the meaning of the verse without any evidence to support doing so, and it is speaking about Allah without knowledge , because the verse states that the wali from among the believers is anyone who establishes prayer, keeps up with it and gives zakaah , as Allah, may He be exalted, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 and those who have believed \u2013 those who establish prayer and give zakah, and they bow [in worship] \u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe word\u00c2 alladheena \u00c2 (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153those who\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) is general in meaning and applies to all believers.\nAbu Ja\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfar Muhammad ibn \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAli ibn al-Husayn ibn \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAli ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) was asked about the meaning of the verse \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Your ally is none but Allah and [therefore] His Messenger and those who have believed \u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201c did it refer to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAli ibn Abi Taalib?\nHe said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAli was one of the believers, which means that this refers to all the believers.\nAn-Nahhaas said: This is obvious, because the word\u00c2 alladheena \u00c2 (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153those who\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) is plural.\n[End quote from\u00c2 Tafseer al-Qurtubi \u00c2 (8/54)]\nMoreover, this person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interpretation is also one that contains elements of shirk (association of others with Allah); the texts of the Qur\u00e2\u20ac\u2122an and Sunnah, as well as the Islamic beliefs affirmed by all Muslims, prove that this interpretation is wrong, for harm and benefit are all in the hand of Allah, may He be exalted, and we should not seek benefit or the warding off of harm except from Allah, may He be exalted, alone.\nAs Allah, may He be exalted, said, addressing His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him):\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Say, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI hold not for myself [the power of] benefit or harm, except what Allah has willed. And if I knew the unseen, I could have acquired much wealth, and no harm would have touched me. I am not except a warner and a bringer of good tidings to a people who believe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n[al-A\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcraaf 7:188] .\nAbu Hayyaan al-Andalusi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThese words on the part of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) show that he is a slave of Allah, and rule out his having any of the unique attributes of Lordship, such as power and knowledge of the unseen. It is demonstrating complete surrender, by saying: I have no power to bring benefit for myself or to ward off harm from myself, so how could I have knowledge of the unseen?\nAs Allah says in Soorat Yoonus (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153And they say, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhen is [the fulfilment of] this promise, if you should be truthful?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \nSay, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI possess not for myself any harm or benefit except what Allah should will. For every nation is a [specified] term\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00c2 [Yoonus 10:48-49]\n[End quote from\u00c2 al-Bahr al-Muheet \u00c2 (4/552)]\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 And that when the Servant of Allah stood up supplicating Him, they almost became about him a compacted mass. \nSay, [O Muhammad], \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI only invoke my Lord and do not associate with Him anyone.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \nSay, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIndeed, I do not possess for you [the power of] harm or right direction.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \nSay, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIndeed, there will never protect me from Allah anyone [if I should disobey], nor will I find in other than Him a refuge. \nBut [I have for you] only notification from Allah, and His messages.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger \u2013 then indeed, for him is the fire of Hell; they will abide therein forever. \n[The disbelievers continue] until, when they see that which they are promised, then they will know who is weaker in helpers and less in number. \nSay, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI do not know if what you are promised is near or if my Lord will grant for it a [long] period.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \n[He is] Knower of the unseen, and He does not disclose His [knowledge of the] unseen to anyone \nExcept whom He has approved of messengers, and indeed, He sends before each messenger and behind him observers \nThat he may know that they have conveyed the messages of their Lord; and He has encompassed whatever is with them and has enumerated all things in number \u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n[al-Jinn 72:19-28] .\nShaykh \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAbd ar-Rahmaan as-Sa\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Say, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIndeed, I do not possess for you [the power of] harm or right direction\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for am a slave of Allah, and I have no power or control over anything .\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Say, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIndeed, there will never protect me from Allah anyone [if I should Disobey]\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00c2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there is no one whose protection I could seek to save me from the punishment of Allah .\nIf the Messenger, who is the most perfect of creation, has no power of harm or right direction, and cannot protect himself at all from Allah, If he intends ill for him, then it is more appropriate that this should apply to all other people .\n[End quote from\u00c2 Tafseer as-Sa\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdi \u00c2 (891)]\nFor more information, please see fatwas no.\u00c2 133081 ,\u00c2 200862 \u00c2 and\u00c2 153666 .\nAnd Allah knows best.\nIslam Q&A ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "awliya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "at-tabari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muhammad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al-qurtubi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "his prophet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "an-nahhaas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdul qadir jeelani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surah al-maidah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "his messenger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abu ja\u00e2", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abu hayyaan al-andalusi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:47.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "49bec459209a987a361a5b4820a2260f6ffe6862", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzCKLBODrX4D5jyWQVQS8Tyq_oVCixSBIDDPoEJbx_jsKMhp_vZ5BQwxqjAgH.AHDGiY.6mH5g7ag--", "site_full": "ffxiclopedia.wikia.com", "site": "wikia.com", "site_section": "http://wiki.ffxiclopedia.org/wiki/Special:RecentChanges?feed=atom", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "FFXIclopedia  - Recent changes [en]", "title": "Moglification: Resist Virus", "title_full": "Moglification: Resist Virus", "published": "2017-12-07T08:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 114, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "49bec459209a987a361a5b4820a2260f6ffe6862", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzCKLBODrX4D5jyWQVQS8Tyq_oVCixSBIDDPoEJbx_jsKMhp_vZ5BQwxqjAgH.AHDGiY.6mH5g7ag--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Flarecarrot", "published": "2017-12-07T08:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "Moglification: Resist Virus", "text": "Retrieved from \" http://ffxiclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Moglification:_Resist_Virus?oldid=1607340 \" Ad blocker interference detected!

At the same time, he is signing a waiver to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv for another six months, and officials say it could take years to build an embassy in Jerusalem.\nTrump said this was just a recognition of reality and rightly noted that Congress voted to authorize moving the embassy during the Clinton administration, but it never happened.\nMuch of this is about the politics of symbolism, but the negative reaction in the Arab world, given Jerusalem\u2019s divided status, is all too real. Some people in Gaza City and Rafah yesterday took to the streets chanting \"Death to America,\" \"Death to Israel\" and \"Down with Trump.\"\nThe New York Times says Trump is \"upending nearly seven decades of American foreign policy and potentially destroying his efforts to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians.\"\nBut the president, perhaps out of diplomatic sensitivity, didn\u2019t immediately move the embassy. He could have ordered a sign placed on the existing U.S. consulate in Jerusalem, declaring it the new embassy. Instead, he gets to declare victory on an issue important to some American Jews and evangelical voters.\nThis split-the-difference approach is almost a replay of what Trump did with the Dreamers program. He had Jeff Sessions announce that the administration is ending the Obama-era decision to shield immigrants who were under 18 when their families brought them here illegally, but then granted a six-month extension. The move pleased immigration hard-liners, but Trump also said he wants to negotiate a new law with congressional Democrats that would permanently protect the dreamers.\nIn October, the president disavowed the Iran nuclear deal, but stopped short of killing the Obama agreement.

The situation may come where you may not get these shops; therefore getting self-prepared is your best option. Along with the car jack and tire iron you need two other things, one is Knowledge, and the other is Confidence.\nIf you ever try to change a flat tire, first look for the spare tire. The spare tire is the extra tire kept ready in hand with proper air pressure checked for any emergency. Having the extra tire available, take your vehicle jack and place it in the appropriate slotted position. Now keeping the tire on the ground, unscrew the tire nuts putting the tire iron pointing nine o\u2019clock. Once loosen, now jack up the vehicle in the air, and take out the flat tire. You may face problem while taking it out, so you can hit the tire with a rubber mallet until it breaks free. Having the flat tire removed; fix the spare one in its place. Hold it with your hands in eight o\u2019 clock and four o\u2019 clock direction to get a grip and mount it easily. After that jack down the vehicle and tighten out the nuts. Take a moment to look into what you did, and if all is \u2018ok,\u2019 jobs accomplished.\nIt just involves few tricks and practice to make you away from irrelevant searches like \u2018Automotive repair business near me\u2019 or \u2018Tire shop near me.\u2019\nRelated Article:- https://medium.com/@tirehost266/start-an-automotive-repairing-business-along-with-a-proper-planning-3916f4065b4d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:48.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5092da5d62e14fafb229251fb621cdd5f055a7e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.rZxEMSci6mbglD4hAY1PQt8RMmSBZ0ROI0zSfjDX6kh2PMsWsBShkaOfy1LKIuDDv0Rv_N1q5gpr_9iVfBAfGabH5ene6Bsp0YY6yIht.QR7AlkAWur2k", "site_full": "www.stockmarketwire.com", "site": "stockmarketwire.com", "site_section": "http://www.stockmarketwire.com//rss/headlines/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Stock Market Wire", "title": "UK house price growth eases to 3.9%", "title_full": "UK house price growth eases to 3.9%", "published": "2017-12-07T11:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5092da5d62e14fafb229251fb621cdd5f055a7e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.rZxEMSci6mbglD4hAY1PQt8RMmSBZ0ROI0zSfjDX6kh2PMsWsBShkaOfy1LKIuDDv0Rv_N1q5gpr_9iVfBAfGabH5ene6Bsp0YY6yIht.QR7AlkAWur2k", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "UK house price growth eases to 3.9%", "text": "UK house price growth eases to 3.9% 7 December 2017 | 09:40am StockMarketWire.com - UK annual house price growth eased to 3.9% in the three months to November, lower than the 4.5% annual growth recorded in October. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, house prices were 2.4% higher - the fastest price growth on this measure since January. House prices rose by 0.5% between October and November, following a 0.3% increase in October and marking the fifth consecutive monthly rise. The average price of \u00c2\u0141226,821 is 3.2% higher than in January (\u00c2\u0141219,741). Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax Community Bank, said: \"Whilst the annual rate of growth eased in November, with the first decline in this measure since July, when looking at quarterly change prices in the three months to November were marginally higher than in the preceding three months; the fourth consecutive quarterly increase.. \"The imbalance between supply and demand continues to support house prices, which doesn't look like changing in the near future. Further ahead, increasing affordability issues, as price increases continue to outstrip wage growth, are likely to curb housing demand and cause price growth to ease. We do expect the government's first-time buyer stamp duty changes to provide some stimulus to demand, particularly in London and the South East where the impact is greatest.\" Story provided by StockMarketWire.com LATEST STOCK MARKET NEWS AND OFFERS Get the latest stock market and investment news, market wraps, promotions and more!

(We already have Xolos and I personally have Liverpool, would be really devastated to lose the one football team I have left). But we still have no specifics or guarantees of how this sucker is going to be built. Basically the people who called the Soccer CIty deal a backroom deal are essentially asking us to \"Trust them\".\nFinally I don't have the issues with congestion that everyone else does. San Diego is growing and hopefully will continue to grow. More housing and businesses are going to come whether we like it or not. It makes a lot more sense to build along already existing transport links like the ones we have in Mission Valley. Finally the idea that Mission Valley is already to crowded I found to be a fallacy. I lived in Mission Valley as recently as six months ago and while there was traffic on Charger days and the holiday season the rest of the year it wasn't bad at all. I actually found the traffic where I live now in Talmadge much worse. Click to expand...

If they use the same parameters as they did for the Soccer City one can't imagine how much the city \"could\" be on the hook for.\nIn theory I am actually in favor of the SDSU plan, if I HAD to choose between the Aztecs and MLS i'd take the Aztecs, purely for sporting reasons. (We already have Xolos and I personally have Liverpool, would be really devastated to lose the one football team I have left ). But we still have no specifics or guarantees of how this sucker is going to be built. Basically the people who called the Soccer CIty deal a backroom deal are essentially asking us to \"Trust them\".\nFinally I don't have the issues with congestion that everyone else does. San Diego is growing and hopefully will continue to grow. More housing and businesses are going to come whether we like it or not. It makes a lot more sense to build along already existing transport links like the ones we have in Mission Valley. Finally the idea that Mission Valley is already to crowded I found to be a fallacy. I lived in Mission Valley as recently as six months ago and while there was traffic on Charger days and the holiday season the rest of the year it wasn't bad at all. I actually found the traffic where I live now in Talmadge much worse. Click to expand... I too am waiting for her analysis. I find it curious that its taken so long. Maybe because there hasn't been much to analyze? The SDSU initiative itself is only 14 pages and has been out for a good few weeks now.\nAlso, what makes you think you'll lose football?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:48.057+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "af559d84809b6119e327372ebf94372440736e99", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzCKLBODrX4D5jyWQVQS8Tyq_oVCixSBIDXnUYBdXCKK4pEdv2z1OS02XcAcUvgwDo6HoAsb5iaaaD9UNpM_RmgQYcshfyTuq8-", "site_full": "ffxiclopedia.wikia.com", "site": "wikia.com", "site_section": "http://wiki.ffxiclopedia.org/wiki/Special:RecentChanges?feed=atom", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "FFXIclopedia  - Recent changes [en]", "title": "Moghancement: Moglification: Resist Virus", "title_full": "Moghancement: Moglification: Resist Virus", "published": "2017-12-07T07:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 114, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "af559d84809b6119e327372ebf94372440736e99", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzCKLBODrX4D5jyWQVQS8Tyq_oVCixSBIDXnUYBdXCKK4pEdv2z1OS02XcAcUvgwDo6HoAsb5iaaaD9UNpM_RmgQYcshfyTuq8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Flarecarrot", "published": "2017-12-07T07:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "Moghancement: Moglification: Resist Virus", "text": "Retrieved from \" http://ffxiclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Moghancement:_Moglification:_Resist_Virus?oldid=1607338 \" Ad blocker interference detected!

Palestinians   04:35pm Print \nKUALA LUMPUR : Umno is holding a solidarity gathering in support of the Palestinian people as a protest against plans by United States President Donald Trump to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, said its vice-president, Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi. \nWithout disclosing the date and location of the proposed gathering, he said Umno and Barisan Nasional (BN) would discuss with various parties, including non-governmental organisations (NGOs), to get their participation. \n\"We see this as not only an Islamic religious issue, but it is also a question on universality,\" he told a media conference after the policy speech by Umno President Datuk Seri Najib Abdul Razak at the party's general assembly at Dewan Merdeka, Putra World Trade Centre (PWTC) here today. \nAhmad Zahid, who is also Home Minister, opined that that announcement by Trump was a direct interference in the Middle East, which he feared could lead to a political conflict in the region. \nAhmad Zahid said he and Najib had met with Palestine's Al-Fattah and Hamas leaders who attended the Umno general assembly, and that they, too, were against the United States' plan. \n\"Although the two parties Al-Fattah and Hamas) often differed in their opinions, but (in this matter) they shared the same opinion that the action by the United States (US) in wanting to shift the capital from Tel Aviv to is something that should be opposed, not only by the Palestinians but also by all Muslims,\" he said. \nAsked whether Umno would join PAS which was planning a protest outside the US Embassy tomorrow, Ahmad Zahid said Umno would send its members who were not directly involved in the assembly. \u2014 Bernama Related articles", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

The T3 underground scoping study is aiming to complete by Q3 2018. To date, 45 holes at T3 have returned significant vein hosted copper mineralisation intersections below, down-dip and along strike from the planned T3 open pit.

Under the agreement, Yantai CIPU will make a payment of \u00c2\u014116.5 million to Advanced Oncotherapy. At the same time, the company has secured \u00c2\u014120.9m of equity investments to fund the continuing technical development of its first LIGHT system and its installation at the Harley Street Proton Therapy Centre. Chief executive Nicolas Serandour said: 'I am delighted that we have been able to conclude deals to provide shareholders not only with the security of longer-term financing, but which also introduce a new experienced strategic investor with strong distribution capacity and already established commercial interest in Asia, particularly in one of our key target markets, China. 'It is a little over a year now since I took on the role of Chief Executive Officer and I am pleased to note that as the calendar year draws to a close we have successfully integrated and tested the proton source, RFQ and SCDTL significantly de-risking the development process. 'We are also pleased with the progress of the Harley Street site with the next stage of sub-structural work well underway. 'This deal is consistent with our strategy to focus our resources on the technological development of the first LIGHT system and to establish partnerships with those businesses that have a strong track record of market access and a unique expertise in their own geographies. 'With our long-term financing arrangements now well engaged we can continue to focus on making our unique proton therapy technology available to patients around the world.'
