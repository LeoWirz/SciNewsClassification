The high court, while referring to the Sanjay Leela Bhansali\u2019s controversy-hit film \u201cPadmavati\u201d, observed that the director has not been able to release his film and an actress is facing death threats. The HC also pulled up the CBI and the state CID, which are investigating the murder cases of rationalists Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare respectively, over the failure to arrest the main suspects in these cases so far. \nThe strong remarks were made by a division bench of Justices S C Dharmadhikari and Bharti Dangre while hearing the petitions filed by family members of Dabholkar and Pansare seeking court supervision on their murder probe. \n\u201cIn this country, we have come to a situation where people cannot voice their opinions. Everytime a person says he or she wants to voice their opinion, somebody or a fringe group says they would not allow it. This does not augur well for the state,\u201d Justice Dharmadhikari said. \n\u201cIn which other country do you see threats given to artists and performers? It is distressing to know that a person makes a feature film and several people work tirelessly towards it, but is not able to release the film because of continued threats. What have we come to?\u201d he said. \n\u201cToday, somebody says I will give a reward to anyone who kills an actress. Such open threats! People are taking pride in saying we will give reward to those, who will kill an actress. And even chief ministers are saying they will not allow the release of the movie in their states,\u201d Justice Dharmadhikari said referring to some states banning the release of \u201cPadmavati\u201d. \nHe added that if such things are happening to people with financial backings, what will happen to poor people. \nThe court noted that this was censorship of a different kind and it was damaging India\u2019s image. \n\u201cWhat concerns us is India\u2019s image and reputation as a democratic country. We are the largest democracy. We cannot take pride in the happenings of such incidents day in and day out. We are cutting a very sorry figure,\u201d Justice Dharmadhikari said. \nReferring to the recent case where a foreign couple was attacked in Uttar Pradesh, he said, \u201cSomebody visits this country as tourists and they are attacked.\u201d \nThe bench noted that states like Maharashtra and Karnataka are known for their \u201cprogressive and modern thinking\u201d. \n\u201cMaharashtra and Karnataka are known for social reformers and thinkers and with such incidents these states are cutting a sorry figure politically too,\u201d the court said. \nIt added that in other countries when any major incident occurs, the suspect is apprehended, dead or alive, within hours. \n\u201cHowever, our country\u2019s agencies have not learnt anything from past incidents like the attack on Parliament and the Prime Minister,\u201d Justice Dharmadhikari said. \nThe court said Dabholkar was killed in 2013 and Pansare in 2015, but till date the investigating agencies (CBI and state CID) have not been able to arrest the main suspects. \n\u201cWe cannot allow such serious matters to linger for years. We cannot allow constitutional rights to be taken away. Enough damage has been caused already. Has any senior official from the two agencies bothered to find out why the probe is not getting any headaway?\u201d the court asked. \nIt said even after these two attacks, there are persons, who are openly and boldly voicing their opinions, are being threatened. \n\u201cAt the core of these two crimes is the bold attempts being made by fringe groups to attack those who voice their rational views, thoughts, feelings and expressions,\u201d the court said. \n\u201cHence, we feel that it is time to call upon the CBI and the CID to involve their superiors. If the senior officials do not wish to be summoned to court, then they should meet with the counsels appearing in court and take stock of the situation,\u201d Justice Dharmadhikari said. \nThe court directed a meeting to be convened with secretary of state home department, Director General of Police (DGP) and Joint Director of CBI with Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh and Ashok Mundargi, who appears for CID in the matter. \nThe bench has now posted the matter for further hearing on December 21. \nWhile the CBI is probing the Dabholkar case, the Pansare murder case is being investigated by a Special Investigation Team of the CID. \nDabholkar was murdered in Pune on August 20, 2013 and Pansare was shot on February 16, 2015 in Kolhapur.

Stepping away from the traditional Christmas films like The Grinch, Miracle on 34th Street, Home Alone etc, I do love finding and watching random festive films whilst flicking through the tv channels and on Netflix. \n\n\nBecause of this, I found A Christmas Prince and well, of course I watched it and actually quite liked it so I thought I would do a film review for you all for your next Blogmas post!\n\nSo get ready for some Christmas royalty...\n\nStaring: Rose McIver [iZombie, Masters of Sex], Ben Lamb [Now You See Me 2]   Netflix's plot description: Christmas comes early for an aspiring young journalist [Amber Moore] when she's sent abroad to get the scoop on a dashing prince [Prince Richard] who's poised to be king.   Ok so this film might be the stereotypical romantic Christmas film where it focuses on Amber and Richard's growing closeness but it is a good film just to relax and watch on a cold day. I love Rose as actress, I adore her in iZombie [she is class in that so watch it if you haven't] so I really watched this film because she was in it and she was fab as Amber.\nYeah, it is predictable as everyone can hazard a very good guess at what happens in the end but it is one of them films where you don't care about that and just enjoy the plot and the acting. It certainly got me in the festive mood, that's for sure!   Well there you go, a festive film perfect for a day on the sofa! Another Blogmas post done as well wooo!

He packed his bag with his most treasured possessions before going to bed: the 1 terabyte hard drive with his evidence against the Islamic State group, an orange notebook half-filled with notes on Ottoman history, and, a keepsake, the first book from Amazon delivered to Mosul. \nHe passed the night in despair, imagining all the ways he could die, and the moment he would leave his mother and his city. \nHe had spent nearly his entire life in this home, with his five brothers and five sisters. He woke his mother in her bedroom on the ground floor. \n\u201cI am leaving,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cI am leaving,\u201d was all he could say. He couldn\u2019t endanger her by telling her anything more. In truth, since the IS had invaded his city, he\u2019d lived a life about which she was totally unaware. \nHe felt her eyes on the back of his neck, and headed to the waiting Chevrolet. He didn\u2019t look back. \nFor nearly two years, he\u2019d wandered the streets of occupied Mosul, chatting with shopkeepers and Islamic State fighters, visiting friends who worked at the hospital, swapping scraps of information. He grew out his hair and his beard and wore the shortened trousers required by IS. He forced himself to witness the beheadings and deaths by stoning, so he could hear the killers call out the names of the condemned and their supposed crimes. \nHe wasn\u2019t a spy. He was an undercover historian and blogger . As IS turned the city he loved into a fundamentalist bastion, he decided he would show the world how the extremists had distorted its true nature, how they were trying to rewrite the past and forge a brutal Sunni-only future for a city that had once welcomed many faiths. \nHe knew that if he was caught he too would be executed. \u201cI am writing this for the history , because I know this will end. People will return, life will go back to normal,\u201d is how he explained the blog that was his conduit to the citizens of Mosul and the world beyond. \u201cAfter many years, there will be people who will study what happened. The city deserves to have something written to defend the city and tell the truth, because they say that when the war begins, the first victim is the truth.\u201d \nHe called himself Mosul Eye . He made a promise to himself in those first few days: Trust no one, document everything. \nNeither family, friends nor the Islamic State group could identify him. His readership grew by the thousands every month. \nAnd now, he was running for his life. \nBut it would mean passing through one Islamic State checkpoint after another, on the odds that the extremists wouldn\u2019t stop him, wouldn\u2019t find the hard drive that contained evidence of IS atrocities, the names of its collaborators and fighters, and all the evidence that its bearer was the man they\u2019d been trying to silence since they first swept in. \nThe weight of months and years of anonymity were crushing him. He missed his name. The city turned dark, and Mosul Eye became one of the outside world\u2019s main sources of news about the Islamic State fighters, their atrocities and their transformation of the city into a grotesque shadow of itself. (Source: AP Photo) \nFrom the beginning, Mosul Eye wrote simultaneously as a witness and a historian. Born in the midst of the Iran-Iraq war in 1986, he had come of age during a second war, when Saddam Hussein fell and the Americans took over. At 17, he remembers going to a meeting of extremists at the mosque and hearing them talk about fighting the crusaders. \u201cI should be honest, I didn\u2019t understand.\u201d \nAs for the Americans, whose language he already spoke haltingly, he couldn\u2019t fathom why they would come all the way from the United States to Mosul. He thought studying history would give him the answers. \nThe men in black came from the north, cutting across his neighborhood in brand new trucks, the best all-terrain Toyotas money could buy. He had seen jihadis before in Mosul and at first figured these men would fade away like the rest. But in the midst of pitched fighting, the extremists found the time to run down about 70 assassination targets and kill them all, hanging enormous banners announcing their arrival in June 2014. \nBy then a newly minted teacher, the historian attended a staff meeting at Mosul University, where the conquerors explained the Islamic State education system, how all classes would be based upon the strictest interpretation of the Quran. To a man who had been accused of secularism during his master\u2019s thesis defense just the year before, it felt like the end of his career. \nIn those first few days, he wrote observations about the Islamic State group on his personal Facebook page _ until a friend warned that he risked being killed. With the smell of battle still in the air, he wandered the streets, puzzling over its transformation into a city at war. He returned to find his family weeping. The smell of smoke and gunfire permeated the home. \nOn June 18, 2014, a week after the city fell, Mosul Eye was born . \n\u201cMy job as a historian requires an unbiased approach which I am going to adhere to and keep my personal opinion to myself,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI will only communicate the facts I see.\u201d \nBy day, he chatted with Islamic State fighters and vendors, and observed. Always observed. By night, he wrote in his native Arabic and fluent English on a WordPress blog and later on Facebook and Twitter. \nThe city turned dark, and Mosul Eye became one of the outside world\u2019s main sources of news about the Islamic State fighters, their atrocities and their transformation of the city into a grotesque shadow of itself. The things IS wanted kept secret went to the heart of its brutal rule. \n\u201cThey were organized as a killing machine. They are thirsty (for) blood and money and women.\u201d \nHe attended Friday sermons with feigned enthusiasm. He collected and posted propaganda leaflets, including one on July 27, 2014, that claimed the Islamic State leader was a descendent of the Prophet Mohammed\u2019s daughter. Back home, writing on his blog in his other, secret identity, he decried the leaflet as a blatant attempt \u201cto distort history\u201d to justify the fanatics\u2019 actions. \nHe drank glass after glass of tea at the hospital, talking to people who worked there. Much of the information he collected went up online. Other details he kept in his computer, for fear they would give away his identity. Someday, he told himself, he would write Mosul\u2019s history using these documents. \nThe most sensitive information initially came from two old friends: one a doctor and the other a high school dropout who embraced Islamic State\u2019s extreme interpretation of religion. He was a taxi driver who like many others in Mosul had been detained by a Shiite militia in 2008 and still burned with resentment. He swiftly joined an intelligence unit in Mosul, becoming \u201cone of the monsters of ISIS\u201d _ and couldn\u2019t resist bragging about his insider knowledge. \nOnce he corroborated the details and masked the sources, Mosul Eye put it out for the world to see. He sometimes included photos of the fighters and commanders, complete with biographies pieced together over days of surreptitious gathering of bits and pieces of information during the course of his normal life _ that of an out-of-work scholar living at home with his family. \n\u201cI used the two characters, the two personalities to serve each other,\u201d he said. He would chat up market vendors and bored checkpoint guards for new leads. \nHe took on other identities as well on Facebook. Although the names were clearly fake, the characters started to take on a life of their own. One was named Mouris Milton whom he came to believe was an even better version of himself _ funny, knowledgeable. Another was Ibn al-Athir al-Mawsilli, a coldly logical historian. \nInternational media picked up on Mosul Eye from the first days, starting with an online question-and-answer with a German newspaper. The anonymous writer gave periodic written interviews in English over the years. Sometimes, journalists quoted his blog and called it an interview. In October 2016, he spoke by phone with the New Yorker for a profile but still kept his identity masked. \nIntelligence agencies made contact as well and he rebuffed them each time. \n\u201cI am not a spy or a journalist,\u201d he would say. \u201cI tell them this: If you want the information, it\u2019s published and it\u2019s public for free. Take it.\u201d \nFirst the Islamic State group compiled lists of women accused of prostitution, he said, stoning or shooting around 500 in the initial months. Then it went after men accused of being gay, flinging them off tall buildings. Shiites, Christians and Yazidis fled from a city once proud of its multiple religious. \nWhen the only Mosul residents left were fellow Sunnis, they too were not spared, according to the catalog of horrors that is Mosul Eye\u2019s daily report. He detailed the deaths and whippings, for spying and apostasy, for failing to attend prayers, for overdue taxes. The blog attracted the attention of the fanatics, who posted death threats in the comments section. He was an anonymous blogger known only as Mosul Eye, documenting Islamic State atrocities since June 2014. (Source: AP Photo) \nLess than a year into their rule, in March 2015, he nearly cracked. IS executed a 14-year-old in front of a crowd; 12 people were arrested for selling and smoking cigarettes, and some of them flogged publicly. Seeing few alternatives, young men from Mosul were joining up by the dozens. \nThe sight of a fanatic severing the hand of a child accused of stealing unmoored him. The man told the boy that his hand was a gift of repentance to God before serenely slicing it away. It was too much. Mosul Eye was done. He defied the dress requirements, cut his hair short, shaved his beard and pulled on a bright red crewneck sweater. He persuaded his closest friend to join him. \u201cI decided to die.\u201d \nThe sun shining, they drove to the banks of the Tigris blasting forbidden music from the car. They spread a scrap of rug over a stone outcropping and shared a carafe of tea. Mosul Eye lit a cigarette, heedless of a handful of other people picnicking nearby. \n\u201cI was so tired of worrying about myself, my family, my brothers. I am not alive to worry, but I am alive to live this life. I thought: I am done.\u201d \nHe planned it as a sort of last supper, a final joyful day to end all days. He assumed he would be spotted, arrested, tortured. The tea was the best he had ever tasted. \nSomehow, incredibly, his crimes went unnoticed. He went home. \u201cAt that moment I felt like I was given a new life.\u201d \nHe grew out his hair and beard again, put the shortened trousers back on. And, for the remainder of his time in Mosul, smoked and listened to music in his room with the curtains drawn and the lights off. His computer screen and the tip of his cigarette glowed as he wrote in the dark. \nThe next month, he slipped up. His friend the ex-taxi driver told him about an airstrike that had just killed multiple high-level Islamic State commanders, destroying a giant weapons cache. Elated, Mosul Eye dashed home to post it online. He hit \u201cpublish\u201d and then, minutes later, realized his mistake. The information could have come from only one person. He trashed the post and spent a sleepless night. \n\u201cIt\u2019s like a death game and one mistake could finish your life.\u201d For a week, he went dark. Then he invited his friend to meet at a restaurant. They ate spicy chicken, an unemployed teacher and the gun-toting ex-taxi driver talking again about their city and their lives. His cover was not blown. \nThe historian went back online. Alongside the blog, he kept meticulous records _ information too dangerous to share. \nHis computer hard drive filled with death, filed according to date, cause of death, perpetrator, neighborhood and ethnicity. Accompanying each spreadsheet entry was a separate file with observations from each day. \n\u201cISIS is forcing abortions and tubal ligation surgeries on Yazidi women,\u201d he wrote in unpublished notes from January 2015. A doctor told him there had been between 50 and 60 forced abortions and a dozen Yazidi girls younger than 15 died of injuries from repeated rapes. \nApril 19, 2015: \u201cThe forensics department received the bodies of 23 ISIS militants killed in Baiji. They had no shrapnel, no bullets, no explosives and the cause of death does not seem to be explosion. It is like nothing happened to the bodies. A medical source believes they were exposed to poison gas.\u201d \nJuly 7, 2015: \u201c43 citizens were executed in different places, this time by gunfire, which is unusual because they were previously beheadings. A source inside ISIS said that 13 of those who were executed are fighters and they tried to flee ..\u201d \nHe noted a flurry of security on days when the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, seemed to be in town. \nMany in Iraq, especially those who supported the Shiite-dominated leadership in Baghdad, blamed Mosul for its own fate. Mosul Eye freely acknowledged that some residents at first believed the new conquerors could only be an improvement over the heavy-handed government and the soldiers who fled with hardly a backward glance at the city they were supposed to defend. \nBut he also wrote publicly and privately _ of the suffering among citizens who refused to join the group. He was fighting on two fronts: \u201cOne against ISIS, and the other against the rumors. Trying to protect the face of Mosul, the soul of Mosul.\u201d \nHe tested out different voices, implying one day that he was Christian, another that he was Muslim. Sometimes he indicated he was gone, other times that he was still in the city. \u201cI couldn\u2019t trust anyone,\u201d he said. \nIn his mind, he left Mosul a thousand times, but always found reasons to stay: his mother, his nieces and nephews, his mission. But finally, he had to go. \u201cI had to run away with the proof that will protect Mosul for years to come, and to at least be loyal to the people who were killed in the city.\u201d \nAnd he did not want to become another casualty of the monsters. \u201cI think I deserve life, deserve to be alive.\u201d \nA smuggler, persuaded by $1,000 and the assurances of a mutual acquaintance, agreed to get him out. He was leaving the next day. Mosul Eye had no time to reflect, no time to change his mind. \nHe returned home and began transferring the contents of his computer to the hard drive. He pulled out the orange notebook with the hand-drawn map of Mosul on the cover and the outlines of what he hoped would one day be his doctoral dissertation. Into the bag went \u201cFather Bombo\u2019s Pilgrimage to Mecca,\u201d an obscure American satirical novel from 1770 that he had ordered from Amazon via a new shop that was the only place in town to order from abroad online. \nIt was time to leave.

The Schumacher House, which dates from around 1750, is located at Clinton G. Martin Park in New Hyde Park. \n\u201cThe change in the exterior of the house is extraordinary,\u201d said Supervisor Bosworth. \u201cI am very pleased that this restoration project is moving forward and that we can see real results. We still have a long way to go, but we are on our way to returning this house to its original beauty.\u201d \nThe addition of new siding is just one component of this current phase of restoration, which is aimed at stabilizing the structure after years of neglect and exposure to the elements. This work includes a new historically-accurate cedar roof and Yankee (copper) gutters and chimney reconstruction; new lightning protection, repairs to damaged framing, removal of asbestos; and the cleanup and removal of debris inside the structure. The most recent work also included adding special covers over the windows that will allow for ventilation, while also protecting the house. According to the town\u2019s Public Works Department, that is overseeing the project, the house needs time to dry out before further work can be done. This could take up to a year. This undated photo of the Schumacher House shows some of the original architecture and elements of the building. \n\u201cThe installation of the siding makes a tremendous difference in the appearance of this historical house,\u201d said Council Member Seeman. \u201cSaving this house saves a part of our history and that is well worth while and I am hopeful that the house will become an educational tool for our schoolchildren to learn of the history of the town.\u201d \nThe work was done by WGP Contracting, which has been working on renovations of the Schumacher House since January 2017. \nThe next phase of the project is to replace the exterior windows and shutters and moving into the restoration of the interior areas. This work will begin in early 2018. \nThe Schumacher House was originally located at the southeast intersection of Marcus Avenue and Lakeville Road. It was acquired along with significant additional acreage in the unincorporated area of the Town, as well as the Village of Lake Success by the Sperry Corporation in 1941 as part of the War effort. The House then served many uses and was called \u201cthe Sperry Guest House.\u201d When the United Nations was formed, the first General Assembly began meeting in the main Sperry Building. At that time, the House served as a school for children of UN employees and members. \nIn 1952, the Sperry Corporation needed the area for additional parking and sold the house to Fred Schumacher, Jr., a member of a prominent local farming family. Mr. Schumacher had the house moved in one piece by truck approximately \u00bd mile east to its current location north of the intersection of Marcus Avenue and New Hyde Park Road. The property has since been incorporated into the Clinton G. Martin Park. \nThe Town Board of North Hempstead listed the Schumacher House as a local landmark on March 15, 2005. After more extensive research into the history of the house by the Town\u2019s Planning Department, and with great support from the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) staff, the house attained listing on the State Register and was then listed on The National Register of Historic Places as the Cornell-Van Nostrand House on Aug. 28, 2007.

All of the drilling tested the deposit at shallow to moderate depths of up to 300 vertical metres with the exception of drill hole OB-17- 14, that tested the deposit at a vertical depth of 400 vertical metres.\nHighlighting the drill results are intercepts of 7.15% Zn, 2.35% Pb, 0.13% Cu, 56.8 g/t Ag & 0.44 g/t Au over 3.20 metres (OB-17-2), 7.38% Zn, 2.25% Pb, 0.45% Cu, 75.6 g/t Ag & 0.55 g/t Au over 5.30 metres (OB-17-08) and 4.49% Zn, 1.26% Pb, 0.22% Cu, 32.4 g/t Ag & 0.25 g/t Au over 5.40 metres (OB-17-14).

Here, thicker intercepts of existing mineralization are currently thought to offer the best chance of defining a mineral resource with significant grades.\nDrill results will be released as they become available.\nGENERATIVE:\nThe Company is actively completing due diligence on a number of attractive base-metal opportunities in North America.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:30.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fa3059c684808d6f685f6a11024287c24ed022e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mSh91Z6kH0DQATXjqxkZDfUfkh6KPJfEDkUADxSzYPx3z4pEzK69a4ly7FtcUzIKZ14C7zI783nicAE9ji0i0JycBiw2JY6R697IgUYIl1RffEUa8FTZVoH.73fWGqZtvA-", "site_full": "12160.info", "site": "12160.info", "site_section": "http://12160.info/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "12160 Social Network", "title": "Newspaper owner poisoned with thallium, a tasteless, odorless heavy metal formerly used in rat poison", "title_full": "Newspaper owner poisoned with thallium, a tasteless, odorless heavy metal formerly used in rat poison - 12160 Social Network", "published": "2017-12-07T09:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://govtslaves.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/skulls-1433178_640.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0f6f742d6078ae7764f8d02979b301a4aa0553d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mSh91Z6kH0DQATXjqxkZDfUfkh6KPJfEDkUADxSzYPx3z4pEzK69a4ly7FtcUzIKZ14C7zI783nicAE9ji0i0JycBiw2JY6R697IgUYIl1RffEUa8FTZVoH.ooixHnE3r61s_.xE8Pakg--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "bananaman", "published": "2017-12-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Fucking Rats,", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:30.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1dcff5934dd4936c8276b1ebccf339dafaa23d0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsK9GQSXef4A.SC3nQlp.OgKRkCWkMpDDwhKd3jpjncxf0XAlUSP3KUAt8_5dZou.Qoh3Bp_MEnlPG39zmuhBI5XW8Nh8XcuqHFwW8n__eNARMTZI.VeGzMriejKPFjMOZtA--", "site_full": "community.du.ae", "site": "du.ae", "site_section": "https://community.du.ae/t5/Community-Announcements/bd-p/Forum3", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Community Announcements - du Community", "title": "http://www.supplementssafe.com/optimal-choice-cbd/", "title_full": "http://www.supplementssafe.com/optimal-choice-cbd/ - du Community", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AE", "spam_score": 0.01, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 21444, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1dcff5934dd4936c8276b1ebccf339dafaa23d0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsK9GQSXef4A.SC3nQlp.OgKRkCWkMpDDwhKd3jpjncxf0XAlUSP3KUAt8_5dZou.Qoh3Bp_MEnlPG39zmuhBI5XW8Nh8XcuqHFwW8n__eNARMTZI.VeGzMriejKPFjMOZtA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "vifyk", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "http://www.supplementssafe.com/optimal-choice-cbd/", "text": "Optimal Choice CBD\nshould add some protein to your diet.

Lubiprostone is a novel laxative that sometimes causes nausea, but preventive strategies remain unconfirmed. Methods. We retrospectively chose 126 patients prescribed lubiprostone from 2013 to 2016. Medical records were reviewed to clarify whether nausea developed after administration of the drug. Background characteristics, including concomitant medicines, were also reviewed. Results.

I\u2019ve been quite spoiled lately by the likes of Moebius Models and Polar Lights, with their fine sculpting and excellent fit of parts, so this 21 year-old (yes! TWENTY-ONE!!) model figurine kit of Marvel\u2019s green-hued behemoth came as something of a challenge. The sculpting\u2019s fine enough, albeit a bit basic (aimed at a younger audience, perhaps), but the fit of parts, especially when it came to joining the legs and arms to the torso, left a LOT to be desired (about 2mm to be precise). So out came the Magic Sculp, along with the judicious smoothing properties of water and an index finger and thumb.\nAnd it\u2019s turned out just fine \u2013 and I thoroughly enjoyed having my skills pushed. And furthermore, as basic as the kit is, it\u2019s full of energy and \u2018R RGH1\u2019 as our friendly green giant shows us how NOT to do maintenance on a tank. I did a little bit of adding bits \u2018n\u2019 pieces here and there (principally tarting up the ultra-basic tank wheel, and sticking a rock or two made from spare cured Magic Sculp [I have quite a few of those lying around]), weathered the elements on the base to give them some realism, and created some shading on our guest star.\n(It has to be said that, without the base, the Hulk appears to be getting\u2019 down with his big bad self to some dancefloor groove\u2026 and that\u2019s given me an idea\u2026. )\n\nNext up \u2013 the second Stooge figure, aka Moe =)", "highlightText": "",

with expertise in evaluating financial and investment information, typically for the purpose of making buy, sell and hold recommendations for securities. Brokerage firms, investment advisors and mutual fund companies hire investment analysts to prepare investment research for multiple purposes. The most prestigious certification an investment analyst can receive is the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation. BREAKING DOWN 'Investment Analyst' \nAn investment analyst researches economic conditions , company information and market trends to determine business, sector and industry recommendations for buying or selling stocks or mutual funds. A stock analyst stays updated with developments in his industry focus and creates financial models estimating future outcomes for companies and the economy. Analyst Education \nAn undergraduate student typically majors in finance, computer science, biology, physics or engineering and takes courses in business, economics, accounting and math. A master of business administration (MBA) is also often preferred for senior investment analysts. Investment analysts may also seek Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) securities licensing which requires corporate sponsorship. Securities licenses often required by investment analysts include the Series 7 general securities representative license and the Series 63 uniform securities agent license. FINRA licenses are typically associated with the selling of specific securities as a firm\u2019s registered representative. Investment analysts may also seek to obtain the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) certification. Analyst Positions \nInvestment analysis expertise is required in numerous senior investment management roles. A portfolio manager chooses, manages and presents products, industries and regions for a company's investment portfolio. Portfolio management is required for a broad range of responsibilities within the investment management industry. Portfolio managers are hired by investment companies to manage all types of funds with various objectives and fund structures. Portfolio managers are responsible for analyzing market conditions and investment securities and making buy and sell decisions for the fund. \nA stock investment analyst works on either the buy-side or sell-side for a business. A buy-side analyst is primarily a portfolio management analyst creating investment research and investment recommendations for portfolios with large amounts of capital such as mutual funds, hedge funds and insurance companies. A sell-side analyst advises financial service companies on securities, such as stocks or bonds. Analyst Duties \nAn analyst evaluates historical and forward-looking financial data, typically through advanced financial models. They study and incorporate research on economic and business trends for a specific industry, geographical region or type of product.

DEFINITION of 'Institutional Shares' \nInstitutional shares are a class of mutual fund shares available for institutional investors. Institutional mutual fund share classes typically have the lowest expense ratios among all of a mutual fund\u2019s share classes. They usually require a minimum investment of approximately $200,000 and may require other specifications for investment. BREAKING DOWN 'Institutional Shares' \nInstitutional share classes are one of many share classes offered in a managed mutual fund offering. Investment companies offer multiple share classes of a fund, giving investors the option to choose the share class that best fits their investment interests. Retail share classes can include Class A , B, C and R. Each retail share class has different fees associated with it but all of the share classes purchased are pooled into one fund managed by the designated portfolio manager. Investment companies use commingled fund structures to manage their fund offerings to facilitate pooled fund investing from all share classes. \nIn addition to the retail share offerings, investment companies also offer institutional shares of a mutual fund. Institutional shares have their own fee structuring and investing specifications. Institutional Investors \nThere are a broad range of institutional investors that are eligible to buy institutional shares. These investors typically maintain large investment positions of over $250,000. In most cases, an institutional investor will be a money manager responsible for investment decisions of large investment programs. Institutional investors include investment managers of retirement benefit plans, endowments, foundations, government units, institutional insurance accounts, corporate institutional accounts and institutional investment funds. Institutional investors can also include financial intermediaries seeking to invest for high net worth clients. Institutional Share Class Fees \nMutual funds are known for offering multiple share classes with multiple fee structures. Institutional share classes usually have the lowest expense ratio of all share classes offered by a mutual fund. They also don\u2019t typically require sales charges. Institutional Share Class Variations \nLow fees make institutional share classes the most attractive class of fees for mutual fund investors. For that reason, many fund companies may offer various types of institutional share classes, some which are tailored for high net worth investors. Vanguard\u2019s admiral shares are one example. \nVanguard Admiral Shares \nAdmiral share expense ratios average 0.12% and range from 0.05% to 0.38%. Index and tax-managed funds require the lowest minimum investment at $10,000. Actively managed funds have an investment minimum of $50,000. Certain sector-specific index funds may require a minimum investment of $100,000.

Helmed by Akshat Verma, this ensemble film is slated for a 12 January release, as of now. The uncertainty over the release date of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's period film 'Padmavati' has left Saif Ali Khan worried over his film.\nSaif Ali Khan has said that if Bhansali's controversial mega budget film hits the theatres in January, the makers of 'Kaalakaandi' will have to change their release date accordingly.\nTalking about possible clash between these two film, Saif said, \"If Padmavati comes in (on that day), we will think of shifting our release date. I hope we don\u2019t have to do that. Kaalakaandi is a film I am proud of.\"\nHowever, the 'Chef' actor also added, \"Recently, we saw Secret Superstar and Golmaal Again releasing on the same day and both films did well. Personally, I feel it's a good time to have films releasing alongside one another. But filmmakers are wary about it and you need to take that into consideration.\"\nSpeaking on dark-comedy 'Kaalakaandi', Saif said, \"The film is a cross-section of Mumbai with underworld goons, doomed bankers and idealistic lovers all mixed together in this karmic tale about love, crime and living a lifetime in one night!! I truly consider it to be one of my best films and am really forward to the release.\"\nKaalakaandi stars Saif Ali Khan along with the impressive ensemble of Deepak Dobriyal, Vijay Raaz, Kunaal Roy Kapur, Sobhita Dhulipala, Akshay Oberoi, Isha Talwar, Shenaz Treasury, Shivam Patil, Amyra Dastur, Nary Singh and Neil Bhoopalam.

"Investopedia Staff", "published": "2017-12-07T04:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Life-Cycle Fund", "text": "Life-Cycle Fund DEFINITION of 'Life-Cycle Fund' \nLife-cycle funds are a type of asset-allocation mutual fund in which the proportional representation of an asset class in a fund's portfolio is automatically adjusted during the course of the fund's time horizon . The automatic portfolio adjustments run from a position of higher risk to one of lower risk as the investor ages and nears the fund\u2019s utilization date. Life-cycle funds may also be referred to as \"age-based funds\". BREAKING DOWN 'Life-Cycle Fund' \nLife-cycle funds are designed to be used by investors with a specific goal, requiring capital at a specific utilization date. Most life-cycle funds are used for retirement investing but generally they can be used for any capital need required at a specific time in the future. Each life-cycle fund defines its time horizon by naming the fund with a target date. \nFor investors with a targeted need for capital at a specific utilization date, life-cycle funds offer the advantage of convenience. Life-cycle fund investors can easily put their investing activities on autopilot through the use of just one fund. The fixed asset allocations of life-cycle funds over time allow investors to invest in a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds. Most life-cycle funds are managed to a pre-determined glidepath which gives investors greater transparency and even more confidence in the management of the fund over its full time horizon. A life-cycle fund\u2019s glide path provides for steadily decreasing risk over time by reconstituting asset allocations toward lower risk investments. Investors can also expect a life-cycle fund to manage through the defined utilization date. \nSome critics of life-cycle funds say that their \"one size fits all\" approach is suspect. For investors who seek to take more of a passive approach to their retirement investing, a life-cycle fund may be appropriate. However, investors who seek to more actively manage their retirement investments may rather direct the management to a financial advisor or use other types of funds to meet their long-term investment goals. Life-Cycle Fund Investing \nThe Vanguard Target Retirement 2065 Trusts are one example of life-cycle funds. In July 2017, Vanguard launched its life-cycle offering for 2065, the Vanguard Target Retirement 2065 Trusts . The Fund offers an example of how life-cycle funds transition their allocations for risk management. The asset allocation remains fixed for the first 20 years with approximately 90% in equities and 10% in bonds. For the next 25 years leading to the target date the allocation gradually moves more toward bonds. At the target date of utilization, the asset allocation is approximately 50% in equities, 40% in bonds and 10% in short-term TIPS.

What I am concerned about is the affect it is going to have on cricket relations between the two countries in the long run,\u201d Mani said on Geo Super channel. \n\u201cI just think all avenues of talks, discussions and back door diplomacy were not explored by the PCB before going ahead with its compensation claim in the ICC. \n\u201cI would have waited and first exhausted all options of trying to get something out of India for them not playing bilateral ties with Pakistan before opting for the compensation claim option,\u201d he added. \nMani, who served as ICC President between 2003-2006, said even if Pakistan won its compensation claim what guarantee is there India would agree to pay out the amount. \n\u201cSay if Pakistan is successful in its compensation claim what happens if India holds back the money. Then Pakistan has to go to the ICC board and it will not help relations between both countries,\u201d he said. \nMani said even though there was a clause that said the Disputes Resolution Committee\u2019s decision was binding on both parties and could not be challenged in any other forum, but when it came to money things often get ugly. \n\u201cIf India holds back on payment what does Pakistan do, does it ask the ICC to deduct India\u2019s share of revenues from ICC events? Can the ICC do that?\u201d \nMani said Pakistan would have filed the compensation claim after going through all legal aspects and there is a clause in the ICC constitution which said no government interference is tolerated in any member board\u2019s affairs. \n\u201cIndia says it is not getting government clearance to play Pakistan and that clause will than become important in this case. But overall I think there will be bad blood and feelings and it will impact future cricket relations between the two,\u201d he said. \nMani also felt that former BCCI President and ICC Chairman N Srinivasan had a significant role to play in India not resuming bilateral cricket ties with Pakistan. \n\u201cHe was not good news when he was there at helm of affairs. He was anti-Pakistan and in his tenure all chances of India taking initiative to get government clearance to play regular bilateral cricket with Pakistan were non-existent.\u201d \nMani said that India had become a difficult member to deal with in the ICC due to its stubborness but felt that this was also because they were weak officials in the world body. \n\u201cIndia does contribute significantly to the ICC revenues but I don\u2019t buy this 70 percent talk. The bottom line is ICC failed itself by not exploring the markets of USA and China. \n\u201cEven today there just has to be the right moves made to make India realize that it can\u2019t operate independently in world cricket.\u201d For all the latest Sports News , download Indian Express App More Related News ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sachin tendulkar", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ehsan mani", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ehsan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "n srinivasan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mani", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "icc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "indian cricket board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan cricket board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bcci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pcb", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:32.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d6c77c1aced55f0dea164f3ec54086f070a1bf3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pA7GA3Tmp9AhWiPAKZskxxh0HRypWdUb1", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/news/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/news/ - Current News - 4chan", "title": "Trump intends to move embassy to Jerusalem.", "title_full": "/news/ - Trump intends to move embassy to Jerusalem. - Current News - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T10:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.176, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "25c9fff63e5bb9afbc518e62d150e313df6d251a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pA7GA3Tmp9AhWiPAKZskxxkzZCZByVTW8cq0HBgpPzUg-", "ord_in_thread": 10, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T14:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>205185\nGet your facts checked.

By Julia Brucculieri ruigsantos via Getty Images Of all the hair myths floating around out there, one of the most popular has to be the idea that we inherit our hair \u2015 more specifically, whether we\u2019ll lose our hair \u2015 from our mother\u2019s father.\nFirst of all, there are many genes that dictate what our hair looks like, Dr. Christopher Cunniff , clinical geneticist at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, explained to HuffPost.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not one gene for black hair and one gene for blond hair, one gene for wavy hair and one gene for straight hair,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s known is that there are a lot of genes, probably dozens, that influence all of these traits.\u201d\nThat means it\u2019s not really fair to blame one person for the hair on your head. Sure, your hair traits could come from your mother\u2019s father, but according to Cunniff and Dr. Robert M. Bernstein , a clinical professor of dermatology at Columbia University, there\u2019s a solid chance you inherited your strands from someone else, or more than one person, in your family.\n\u201cIt is more complex than that,\u201d Cunniff explained to HuffPost, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s no good support for the idea that hair distribution or baldness is something that is more inherent in the maternal side than the father\u2019s side.\u201d\nCunniff also said that there is no good support for the idea that hair traits skip generations.\n\u201cIt really has to do with how those multiple genes combine, because obviously, every one of us is a combination of each of our parents,\u201d Cunniff said.\nBernstein echoed Cunniff, noting that hair traits can come from either side of the family.\n\u201cThe androgen receptor gene is an X-linked gene, so there\u2019s a slightly greater incidence of it following the mother\u2019s side of the family than the father\u2019s side, but genetic hair loss is polygenetic and the expressivity is very variable, so both sides can contribute to someone\u2019s hair loss,\u201d Bernstein told HuffPost.\nHe noted, however, that genetic hair loss does come from the mother\u2019s side \u201ca little over half the time.\u201d\nAccording to Cunniff, the ideas and theories surrounding hair loss, and the genetics of hair in general, are thought to be the same for both men and women. However, he explained, there\u2019s a possibility the expression of hair-related genes could differ in males and females.\nIn more scientific terms, Cunniff reasoned, \u201cWomen have two X chromosomes and men have one X and one Y chromosome, so it\u2019s possible there could be differences in women that are not seen in men, or vice versa.\u201d\nGenes found on the X chromosome could potentially have sex-specific differences, because women will have copies of the chromosome from their mothers and their fathers, while men will only have copies of the X chromosome from their mothers, Cunniff explained. But, he said, of the genes that have been most clearly identified as having influence on hair texture or color, none have been on the X chromosome.\nSo if you\u2019ve been blaming a certain person in your family for your receding hairline or gray strands, it\u2019s probably time to let go of that grudge.\nRELATED COVERAGE Mom Hair, Don\u2019t Care: 12 Reasons My Hair Is A Mess Today Gabrielle Union Launches Hair Care Line For Women With Textured Hair 'Wow, I Love Your Hair!' : A Curly Top\u2019s Hair Care Secrets Download ALSO ON HUFFPOST PHOTO GALLERY The Best Instagram Accounts For Short Hair Julia Brucculieri Style and Beauty Reporter, HuffPost Suggest a correction", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://weillcornell.org/ccunniff", "https://www.twitter.com/juliabruc", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-cover-default-5f3c3863a7fb8e0f8b5bb389b19adbcf951249f84f791305b31e0f195437db08.png);", "https://www.bernsteinmedical.com/about-us/dr-bernstein/", "https://wdo-m.tlnk.io/serve?action=click&publisher_id=353714&site_id=125341&my_placement=b_page&site_id_android=125343"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christopher cunniff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julia brucculieri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert m. bernstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cunniff", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "columbia university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weill cornell medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newyork-presbyterian hospital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:32.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6f354ca131cbca7b0675098efeee84a7e5e1d715", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkd6Ay60oCLGDuQgKCFKSYn6x0vuPQMVXDikYR9G1O5vVeRM6P4M7j6T7XDpmArPC503OFGGvgNHtD_JnmZCaTX6LFaiAJBweVgdWax7qCv6OkC6vzKYPk0VpUHoXfrODiqkJbGy71qDc5KbNBDdJWIK", "site_full": "www.americanbankingnews.com", "site": "americanbankingnews.com", "site_section": "http://feeds2.feedburner.com/AmericanBankingNews", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "American Banking News", "title": "Analysts\u2019 Downgrades for December, 7th (ACGL, ALNY, ALOG, ALRM, BELFB, BPFH, CAVM, CDEV, CGNX, CORT)", "title_full": "Analysts\u2019 Downgrades for December, 7th (ACGL, ALNY, ALOG, ALRM, BELFB, BPFH, CAVM, CDEV, CGNX, CORT)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/downgrade-image.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6f354ca131cbca7b0675098efeee84a7e5e1d715", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkd6Ay60oCLGDuQgKCFKSYn6x0vuPQMVXDikYR9G1O5vVeRM6P4M7j6T7XDpmArPC503OFGGvgNHtD_JnmZCaTX6LFaiAJBweVgdWax7qCv6OkC6vzKYPk0VpUHoXfrODiqkJbGy71qDc5KbNBDdJWIK", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ABMN Staff", "published": "2017-12-07T11:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "Analysts\u2019 Downgrades for December, 7th (ACGL, ALNY, ALOG, ALRM, BELFB, BPFH, CAVM, CDEV, CGNX, CORT)", "text": "Tweet \nAnalysts\u2019 downgrades for Thursday, December 7th: \nArch Capital Group (NASDAQ:ACGL) was downgraded by analysts at BidaskClub from a hold rating to a sell rating.

to cover up sexual misconduct, is a producer on the show. By Alanna Vagianos Astrid Stawiarz via Getty Images Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson are trying to figure out what to do with a producer on their show who was involved in covering up an episode of sexual misconduct by comedian Louis C.K. 770 Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson are finally addressing Dave Becky\u2019s involvement in their hit TV series \u201cBroad City.\u201d\nBecky, who is comedian Louis C.K.\u2019s former manager, came under fire last month for attempting to cover up an incident in 2002 where Louis C.K. masturbated in front of two young, female comedians without their consent. Now, Glazer and Jacobson say they are \u201cfiguring out\u201d what to do with Becky, who is credited as a producer on \u201cBroad City.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely something that we\u2019re figuring out right now,\u201d Jacobson told EW Radio . \u201cHe\u2019s not our manager. And he\u2019s been a producer on the show through Amy [Poehler] from the beginning. And it\u2019s like this upsetting thing to find out his involvement in the whole thing, so it\u2019s definitely something that we\u2019re constantly talking about right now.\u201d\nGlazer added that the two take responsibility for any success they may have had because of Becky.\n\u201cWe take accountability for using this white dude power to get our show on TV,\u201d Glazer said. \u201cWe\u2019re accountable for that.

testifies during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 12, 2017, in Washington, D.C. Alex Wong / Getty Images \nFour months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in \"tatters\" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics. \nIt's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray. \nOn Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch. 1. Russia, Russia, Russia \nWray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, \"a witch hunt.\" \nWray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied to the Trump campaign, including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nDoes that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Stzrok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation , suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case? \nShould there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him? \nLook for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this. \n\"The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,\" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing. \n\"We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,\" Goodlatte added. 2. Independence \nThe job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was \"the Russia thing.\" \nFor his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees , who have faced criticism from the president this year. \nThis week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to \"keep calm and tackle hard\" amid the current adverse climate. And, at his confirmation hearing, Wray pledged his loyalty was to the Constitution, not a political regime. \"I will never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice, period, full stop,\" he said at the time. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee will no doubt want to ask Wray about his contacts with President Trump and others in the White House this year. 3. Oh, yeah \u2014 FBI business \nIn a matter of weeks, an important electronic surveillance tool will expire if Congress does not reauthorize it. The murder rate has spiked in several major American cities. \nCourts have thrown out corruption charges or reduced sentences of public officials accused of bribery and other offenses, following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the tools the Justice Department's public integrity unit can use to attack graft in state houses across the country. \nThe bureau also has open investigations into activity by sympathizers of the Islamic State in every one of its field offices. \nThe FBI, in short, has its hands in many baskets.

Source: Supplied ESSENDON has become the second AFL club to acquire its own esports organisation. \nThe Bombers announced on Thursday night they had secured the license of Abyss, a professional gaming team currently competing in the Oceanic League of Legends leagues (Pro and Challenger). It has also competed in Rocket League and Paladins. \nFoxsports.com.au previously reported that Essendon was one of a number of clubs, including Carlton, Collingwood, Port Adelaide, GWS and West Coast to be interested in the growing industry. \nThe Adelaide Crows became the first club to invest in the growing industry when it acquired Legacy earlier in 2017. \nHowever unlike the Crows\u2019 purchase of Legacy, which also competes in League of Legends, Essendon plans on rebranding Abyss with a new name, brand and logo in the works. The Herald Sun reports the team is likely to be named the Bombers. \nThe team will be moved from Sydney to Melbourne and based at the club\u2019s Tullamarine headquarters. \nResearch conducted by the AFL suggests that 21 per cent of its fan base either has an interest in or watches esports regularly. The global esports industry was estimated earlier this year to be worth $1.2 billion with an annual audience of 239 million people. Essendon has embraced the esports craze. Source: Getty Images \nThe AFL itself is interested in the field of esports, with Foxsports.com.au previously reporting that it has considered the potential of running events at Etihad Stadium or at a dedicated esports studio it could build in Melbourne. \n\u201cEsports is the fastest growing sports category in the world and is quickly changing the entertainment and sports landscape,\u201d Essendon chief marketing officer Justin Rodski said in a statement. \n\u201cThe international audience is close to 300 million people, the majority are aged 14-34 years, providing a unique platform to engage and reach a younger demographic of fans. \n\u201cAs a club, we are looking at ways to diversify our business, invest in growth and create new opportunities to drive incremental consumer and commercial revenues. \n\u201cEsports teams are no different to any other professional sports club model and esports fans are no different to any other sports fans in their passion to support their team. \n\u201cWe will bring our expertise in elite and professional sport to strengthen the team across all areas, including a particular focus on player welfare and development. \n\u201cThere is a rich and diverse community ecosystem in esports and this is our opportunity to be culturally relevant to the millennial audience and engage a new fan base. \n\u201cOur investment in esports will not impact our core business of winning games of football. The team and players will align to our values as a club and our vision of being the most respected, inclusive and successful club in Australian sport.\u201d View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.

Scott Applewhite) OAN Newsroom, Marty Golingan The House overwhelmingly rejected an attempt by Democrat Representative Al Green to impeach the president.\nOn Wednesday, 364 lawmakers immediately voted to kill Green\u2019s impeachment measure with only 58 Democrats voting to move ahead.\nThe resolution was expected to fail as it was widely opposed by Republicans and most Democrats.\nTexas Congressman Al Green has described the president as having \u201cbehavior unfit for the oval office,\u201d but previous accusations against the congressman himself reveal his own behavior was out of line.\nGreen is a vocal member of the anti-Trump movement in the House of Representatives, and has been at the forefront of the liberal effort to see President Trump removed from office.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) However, past allegations of sexual misconduct have called the Texas congressman\u2019s integrity into question.\nBack in 2007, Green\u2019s former district director Lucinda Daniels accused him of sexual contact without consent at her home.\nAfterwards, Daniels said the politician tried to pursue a romantic relationship, and when she spurned his advances \u2014 Green created a hostile work environment.\nShe also said Green tried to smear her character, making it difficult for her with future employers.\nAn attorney for Green said Daniels demanded $1.8 million dollars in damages, but the congressman countered the allegations.\nHe filed a lawsuit against the alleged victim, claiming he was being extorted by Daniels.\nGreen suggested she threatened to sue him for workplace discrimination if he did not pay her the large sum.\nA year later, lawyers from both Green and Daniels issued a joint statement saying both the congressman and the alleged victim resolved their dispute outside of court without any sort of settlement or litigation.\nThe congressman\u2019s attorney later said Green would drop his lawsuit if Daniels dropped her accusations and signed an agreement refuting her claims against the Democrat.\nAfter she signed the agreement, Green\u2019s spokesman says the congressman indeed had a \u2014 quote \u2014 \u201cromantic encounter\u201d with Daniels, but any suggestion of sexual assault was false.\nThis back-and-forth between Green and his former employee raises questions about his present conduct in the House.\nGreen appears obsessed with impeaching President Trump, calling for his impeachment whenever the president says something he disagrees with.\nHe is currently playing \u201cchicken\u201d with his articles of impeachment after scheduling to present them on the House floor and swerving left by not showing up for his presentation\nHe later claimed he wanted his fellow Democrats and the public to review his proposal.\nAfter more than a decade in office, Green has not done much legislatively.\nHe has shown strong liberal bias in his political stances, favorably voting for everyone of former President Obama\u2019s budget proposals and voting against everyone of former President George W. Bush\u2019s tax and spending cuts during his tenure.\nCritics say a man willing to file a frivolous lawsuit against an alleged assault victim and draft partisan impeachment documents, clearly does not have his priorities or his constituents at heart.\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "al green", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marty golingan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george w. bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott applewhite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "green", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucinda daniels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dem al green in", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "green", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oan newsroom", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "d-texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:33.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "26f3b3b9066973d8003c8576488fb0cdeda39242", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWSUKtEk4sQ4venLwVj1tytcz6YsnTawO7S5y04lFr9A5H6doJEG4aTh7QjN1hl58GzU6frwsH3g--", "site_full": "www.investopedia.com", "site": "investopedia.com", "site_section": "http://www.investopedia.com/feedbuilder/feed/getFeed?feedName=rss_headline", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "rss_headline", "title": "Equity-Linked Security - ELKS", "title_full": "Equity-Linked Security - ELKS", "published": "2017-12-07T04:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.investopedia.com/inv/genericcontentimages/etfsmutualfunds/95528215.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 854, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "26f3b3b9066973d8003c8576488fb0cdeda39242", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWSUKtEk4sQ4venLwVj1tytcz6YsnTawO7S5y04lFr9A5H6doJEG4aTh7QjN1hl58GzU6frwsH3g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Investopedia Staff", "published": "2017-12-07T04:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Equity-Linked Security - ELKS", "text": "Equity-Linked Security - ELKS DEFINITION of 'Equity-Linked Security - ELKS' \nAn equity-linked security is a debt instrument with variable payments linked to an equity market benchmark. BREAKING DOWN 'Equity-Linked Security - ELKS' \nEquity-linked securities are an alternative type of fixed-income investment. They are structured products most often created as bonds . Equity-linked securities are often used in private market corporate capital financings. They are offered to investors for the purpose of raising corporate capital. They are not traded on financial market exchanges. \nAn equity-linked security offering provides corporations with an alternative way to structure interest payments to investors. An issuer can base security interest payments on a range of equity market products including a stock, a group of stocks or an equity index. They may also cap or pay a specified portion of the benchmark\u2019s return. A standard equity linked security structured as a bond would offer variable interest payments tied to an equity benchmark and the return of principal at maturity. ELKS offer a controlled interest rate product for the issuer. Equity-Linked Security Investments and Solutions \nInvestors may be offered the opportunity to invest in ELKS from a few different issuers. They may also find ELKS advertised as market-linked. \nCorporate ELKS \nCorporations typically work with investment banks for support in structuring equity-linked security offerings for capital financing. The Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) is a leading source for structured finance equity linked securities. RBC works with companies to structure equity linked security offerings with various types of provisions. \nBank Offered ELKS \nRetail investors may see equity linked security offerings from a bank alongside certificates of deposit. An equity linked security can be any type of investment with interest payments tied to an equity benchmark. \nUnion Bank advertises equity-linked CDs as one component of their market-linked CD offering. The interest on the CDs is linked to an equity index. The minimum investment is $4,000. \nMarket-Linked Securities \nSecurities with payments linked to a market benchmark are offered across the investment industry. A market-linked security can have payments linked to any type of market benchmark. An issuer could structure a market-linked security to make payments based on an equity benchmark. They can also use any other market benchmark such as gold or currency. \nFor the security issuer, market-linked products offer the opportunity to control the payment to the investor by choosing a specified benchmark. For investors, they can offer an easy alternative to investing in the benchmark itself. An investor in a gold-linked CD would generally seek to earn the same rate of return as gold. Issuers can structure market-linked products in numerous ways. Market-linked products are also known to be illiquid and not tradable or redeemable without penalty during the duration of the investment. \nTo read more about equity-linked and market-linked securities see also 6 Reasons to Beware of Market-Linked CDs .

The film starring Sharman Joshi, Renuka Shahane and Masumeh Makhija also brings back Fukrey actors Pulkit Samrat and Richa Chadha in pivotal roles. But are all of them sharing screen space? At least, the teaser hints at a different story. \nThe minute-long teaser takes us through every nook and corner of a chawl or a residential unit in Mumbai. The thrilling clip shows all the actors giving a sneak peek into their characters leaving us thinking about their \u2018real\u2019 faces. While on one hand it looks like a murder mystery and how three stories at the three levels of the chawl have some connection to it, on the other hand it hints at a plot based around love and betrayal. Its makers claim that 3 Storeys \u201cexplores intertwined lives where secrets are revealed and life in this small community is not as it seems.\u201d \nFarhan Akhtar and Pulkit Samrat, both tweeted the teaser. The film is directed by debutant Arjun Mukherjee and co-produced by Ritesh Sidhwani and Farhan. The makers had in June released its motion poster leaving many excited.

We firmly believe there is an opportunity for a lasting peace,\u201d he said. \nTillerson said the the safety of Americans was the State Department\u2019s highest priority, and with other federal agencies, it has implemented robust security plans to protect its citizens in affected regions. \nIn his landmark announcement, Trump said consistent with the Jerusalem Embassy Act, he was directing the State Department to begin preparation to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. \u201cThis will immediately begin the process of hiring architects, engineers and planners, so that a new embassy, when completed, will be a magnificent tribute to peace,\u201d he said. \nThe controversial decision received mixed reactions. \u201cI have long believed that Jerusalem is the true capital of Israel. However, issues surrounding the final and permanent status of Jerusalem must ultimately be resolved by Israelis and Palestinians as part of an internationally supported peace process,\u201d Senator John McCain said. \n\u201cThat is why today\u2019s policy announcement, as well as any future relocation of the US Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, should be part of a comprehensive diplomatic strategy in coordination with regional partners to achieve peace and security between Israelis and Palestinians,\u201d he said. \nDemocratic Senator Tim Kaine, member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the reaction from across the world is \u201ctroubling\u201d, including from important allies of Israel, and asserted that the announcement could have \u201cdestabilising consequences\u201d for a region already rife with tensions. \n\u201cI am worried about the impact of this decision on the safety of US personnel overseas and have raised my concerns with the State Department to ensure sufficient security measures are in place at all US embassies and consulates,\u201d he said. \nAnother Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi rued that in the absence of a negotiated settlement between Israel and the Palestinians, moving the US embassy to Jerusalem now may \u201cneedlessly spark mass protests, fuel tensions, and make it more difficult to reach a durable peace\u201d. \nSenator Marco Rubio said, \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is an important step in the right direction. Unequivocal recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital will be complete when the US embassy is officially relocated there\u201d. \nFollowing the Trump\u2019s decision, many Arab leaders warned that it could trigger an upheaval in the already volatile Middle East.

My ego was a lot bigger when I first started,\u201d Pattinson said while appearing on Variety\u2019s \u2018Actor on Actor\u2019 along with Jamie Bell. \nRobert Pattinson said the feeling of losing your identity in the franchise filmmaking was \u201cfrightening\u201d. \u201cThen you start losing control of a lot of different aspects of your life and also the job, especially when you\u2019re doing sequels to something. It doesn\u2019t matter what you think: a) it\u2019s already been written in a book and b) the tone has already been set up and the machine is already in motion. It\u2019s frightening when you lose your sense of identity,\u201d Pattinson said. \nBefore playing a vampire in Twilight, he played a wizard in Harry Potter. Earlier, in another interview he had confessed that he skipped going to University to play the part. \u201cIt was so nice to be a part of it. That, more than anything, changed my life. It\u2019s the reason I didn\u2019t go to university. It went so far over schedule, I couldn\u2019t go. It was supposed to be four months, but it ended up being 10 or 11. I\u2019d turn up to set every day but not work for weeks at a time,\u201d Pattinson told Time Out London magazine. \n(With inputs from PTI) For all the latest Entertainment News , download Indian Express App \u00a9 IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd More Related News ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert pattinson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "stephenie meyer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie bell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harry potter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edward cullen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pattinson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "time out london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ie online media services pvt ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "variety", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:34.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9148d2868241e3427489ad1e7164f06b21c10eae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhPbLRiV4sjqJlX5lz268f1aQTpLcRwwBHWT7bUTLqkAZmTLsrIOPbRTNdqLHIDOAFUGDvptjr4bsSnopdXWhW2Ki4rlvgR60lNAnb1PJyjEpYZ.sRczZWuJNAPsQ2h3NvjDkoJWMjrMGUnJaRaesHNvNFzvFZ2pltlGeaTJywbZ_S33YI1m.HqKg--", "site_full": "www.military-technologies.net", "site": "military-technologies.net", "site_section": "http://www.military-technologies.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["table_tennis_ping_pong", "financial_news", "finance", "sports"], "section_title": "MilTech", "title": "Compound Semiconductor Market Report: Key Leading Countries, New Product Offerings, Geographic Presence Analysis and Forecast 2021", "title_full": "Compound Semiconductor Market Report: Key Leading Countries, New Product Offerings, Geographic Presence Analysis and Forecast 2021", "published": "2017-12-07T10:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "PL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9148d2868241e3427489ad1e7164f06b21c10eae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhPbLRiV4sjqJlX5lz268f1aQTpLcRwwBHWT7bUTLqkAZmTLsrIOPbRTNdqLHIDOAFUGDvptjr4bsSnopdXWhW2Ki4rlvgR60lNAnb1PJyjEpYZ.sRczZWuJNAPsQ2h3NvjDkoJWMjrMGUnJaRaesHNvNFzvFZ2pltlGeaTJywbZ_S33YI1m.HqKg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sagar G", "published": "2017-12-07T10:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "Compound Semiconductor Market Report: Key Leading Countries, New Product Offerings, Geographic Presence Analysis and Forecast 2021", "text": "Source: imported from this press release . \nCompound Semiconductor Market new global report offers key vendor landscape, CAGR with market dynamics and forecast.
