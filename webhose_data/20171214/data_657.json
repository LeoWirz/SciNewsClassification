And like Gorn says, ancient strings are just ancient strings. Nothing new will feel or sound the same, even if you were able to determine the brand. It's sort of like asking what kind of motor oil your used car originally came with. Only the people who built it would have any idea.\nWhat you *can* go on are the size of the string (the 'gauge', how thick they are), the type of windings (look like rounds), and then what kind of music you want to play - because that will steer you to something currently in production that might suit you. People are suggesting things like flats and pressurewounds because we assume you like the 'deadness' (more thump, less zing) of the strings being old.\nAlso, the mention of the strings being out of tune is an odd one. Do you mean you can't tune the bass and have it stay in tune for any length of time? I mean, most people have to tune their bass every so often, some every time they play - if you play hard, sometimes a couple times per song set, even! If your strings just won't stay in tune, it's possible they're not even the issue.

The first thing they did when deciding on a new manager after Brad, was to go in the complete opposite direction.\nExperience? Ron Gardenhire has loads. Brad Ausmus? He had none. No managerial experience whatsoever. And after frightening failure, the Tigers headed back to old and gray and called it day.\nAs I am sure you all remember, Brad was highly endorsed by Tiger brass throughout the interview process. Leyland recommended him and we will forever remember how Brad \u201cblew them away\u201d in the interview, per Dave Dombrowski.\nBrad was considered someone who would bring a fresh approach to the Tigers. Sounded good at the time. His intelligence. His Ivy-League education. Young and smart is where they hung their hats.\nOver the entire tenure of the Brad Ausmus regime here in Detroit, this site was littered with criticism of the Tigers and their choice of someone completely inexperienced expected to lead the team to the next step \u2013 a World Championship.\nBut look what has happened in baseball. Analytics has exploded. Teams are being described as analytics-driven. And there are examples everywhere we turn where teams, expected to achieve great things, have turned their rosters over to the inexperienced.\nWhat the Tigers had done in hiring Brad Ausmus to run a team primed to win a championship was considered one of the most foolish things they could have done. Well, as it turned out, it was. But maybe not because of inexperience. They just picked the wrong guy.\nWhen you think of baseball, eventually all attention turns to New York. They are the team everyone loves to hate, but also a team everyone pays attention to when they are playing. They have the nation\u2019s attention. And little did we know, after the Yankees came within one game of the World Series, they would fire their manager.\nAnd as inexperienced candidates were hired by contending teams all over baseball, could it be possible that the Yankees might do the same thing? No possible way, right?\nBut lo and behold, they did it. Aaron Boone emerged as a candidate. Someone who wasn\u2019t even on Brian Cashman\u2019s initial list, found the list, because he was recommended by so many baseball people around the league.\nBut why? What did Aaron Boone have? Broadcasting experience. Played baseball for the Yankees. Hit a big home run for the Yankees. Grew up in a baseball family. Practically lived in major league clubhouses since he was 4 years old. Baseball has been his life.\nAll that is well and good, but what are the intangibles? Because he had to sell the Yankees on something and of course, he impressed them in the interview. He was considered very intelligent. You\u2019re nodding your head, right? We have heard this before. So, what else?\nWell, his press conference, which he passed with flying colors revealed a side about Aaron Boone that makes me feel that if any of these young guys is going to be successful, this is the guy who may have the best shot.\nNumber one on his list of things to move on right from the start, and it was mentioned many times, is to form a respected relationship with his players. It was important to him that he earn their respect, that he form a relationship based on trust. Boone said players are good at figuring out who is real and who is not \u2013 a reputation he will again need to earn.\nIn Detroit, you never felt like Brad Ausmus had that connection with his players. You never felt like his players trusted or respected him. But Aaron Boone couldn\u2019t say enough about how important it is to achieve that trust and that respect; to communicate and foster relationships in order to maximize potential, develop their talents and then sustain was is accomplished.\nWhich brings us back to analytics. The Yankees are one of those analytics-driven franchises. And Boone knows you must strike a balance between what\u2019s on the sheet and knowing your personnel; a knowledge based on the relationships he has formed.\nHe said he has to learn which players they can bombard with data and who needs to be left alone. He has so much to digest.\nPeople, I have nothing else to work with on with how well he will do as manager of the Yankees. I have the press conference. But he seems to have a calculated plan, an impressive one, considering his inexperience. And you get the feeling this guy is not going to be sitting still in that dugout.\nBut here is the kicker, and it should get your attention. He said every evaluation from game to game will be different.\nBrad Ausmus could never open himself up to flexibility. And Boone\u2019s synopsis on everyday managing screams flexibility, open-mindedness, instincts, communication \u2026 need any more? These are the things we would have liked to have heard when Brad was introduced as we were heading into a new season with high hopes and still starving for a title.\nNow, of course, saying it and doing it are 2 different things, but I get the feeling that there is a very distinct difference between Aaron Boone and Brad Ausmus. The initial impressions, at least, not only suggest it, but they shout it out pretty emphatically.\nTotally Tigers reminds readers to follow the rules found above the Comment box as well as those listed under the Rules tab.

Located in Baltimore, the ESPN Zone was less a place to grab a bite than a 35,000-square-foot monument to the broadcast company\u2019s ascendancy \u2013 home to a baseball batting cage, a mural of local athletic heroes signing the Declaration of Independence, and a fully functional replica of the set for SportsCenter, its flagship nightly newscast.\nBack then, none of this seemed unusual. To the contrary, ESPN was so popular and beloved that restaurant industry observers expected a smashing success, with one analyst gushing to the Washington Post that ESPN\u2019s parent company, Disney, was \u201cso good. They know their limitations \u2013 even the precise moment when to pull a video off the shelf. They\u2019re not going to go into a market until the customers are going to drool.\u201d\nTimes change. Last week, ESPN laid off approximately 150 people , eliminations that came after 300 employees were let go in late 2015, and another 100 were eliminated in April. Taken together, the losses reflect the new reality facing the self-proclaimed \u201cWorldwide Leader in Sports,\u201d the biggest and most influential brand in American sports media.\nESPN kneels before advertisers by silencing Jemele Hill for doing her job | Marina Hyde Read more\nLong synonymous with the games it covers, ESPN has been one of the great success stories of the cable television era, a multibillion-dollar empire consisting of broadcast networks, a glossy print magazine, and a strong web presence. But today, the company is under siege, battling many of the same forces eroding both the cable industry and sports media.\nRight-leaning political commentators have attacked ESPN for perceived liberal bias, with the White House calling for SportsCenter anchor Jemele Hill to be fired after she called Donald Trump white supremacist. Younger fans have embraced edgier, digital-native competitors such as fast-growing Barstool Sports , placing ESPN in the uncomfortable role of stodgy, establishment incumbent.\nHovering over those high-profile headaches is a more serious problem: the ongoing, accelerating contraction of the cable market, a potentially existential threat. Over the last six years, ESPN reportedly has lost 13m television subscribers worth $1bn in revenue , numbers that have left Disney shareholders grumbling and executives scrambling to reconfigure how they do business.\n\u201cThere once was a time when ESPN was a safe harbor, the destination job for people in sports media,\u201d said Sports Illustrated media reporter Richard Deitsch. \u201cBut that\u2019s no longer the case. They\u2019re facing all sorts of headwinds, and facing them in an incredibly challenging media environment.\u201d\nFounded in 1979, ESPN is arguably one of the most important companies in American television history \u2013 and inarguably the most valuable sports property. Its rise followed the growth of cable; as niche channels supplemented and supplanted legacy broadcast networks, what started as a small-time college basketball and Australian rules football broadcaster operating out of a muddy plot of land in suburban Connecticut grew into a legitimate rival to the likes of CNN and TBS, by offering obsessive, round-the-clock coverage of the National Football League and other sports.\nFor hardcore fans, ESPN wasn\u2019t simply a one-stop shop for games, highlights, and analysis. It was, well, cool. Star anchors like Keith Olbermann and Craig Kilborn did more than deliver the athletic news of the day. They infused it with winking irony, matching the Seinfeld and David Letterman-shaped comedic sensibility of the 1990s. During newscasts, injured players would dutifully be listed as \u201cday-to-day\u201d \u2013 \u201cbut then again,\u201d Olbermann would quip, \u201caren\u2019t we all?\u201d Popular, mockumentary-style This Is SportsCenter promos featuring athletes and mascots made the sports world part of the joke. When ESPN appeared in the 1996 Tom Cruise film Jerry Maguire, it made perfectly authentic sense .\nBy the time the 2004 Ben Stiller comedy Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story featured a fictional eighth ESPN network \u2013 the immortal \u201cOcho\u201d \u2013 the conceit was less throwaway gag than a nod to the company\u2019s status as sports leviathan. ESPN had spawned sister networks like ESPN2 and ESPN Classic, created its own alternative sports Olympics in the form of the X Games, dabbled in dramatic film and series production , and even co-branded itself in sports video games.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Smith and Jemele Hill (left) have helped diversify ESPN\u2019s onscreen talent, while Bill Simmons (top right) set up a deal with HBO after leaving the company\nComposite: Getty/NBAE/Bloomberg/USA Today Sports\nUnderlying everything was a wildly-profitable business model that was the envy of the broadcast industry. Typically, cable and satellite providers pay no more than $2 per month, per subscriber to networks like ESPN in order to carry them. But because the company held the rights to so many sports that fans couldn\u2019t do without, it was able to charge more than double that amount.\nAt the same time, ESPN managed to include itself in the basic channel bundles offered by pay television providers to just about every customer, which meant that tens of millions of households that didn\u2019t watch the company\u2019s networks still paid for them . In 2013, ESPN made roughly $10bn \u2013 with $6.5bn of that coming from subscription fees.\nTwo years later, however, the company gave transgender women and former Olympic decathlete Caitlyn Jenner the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the ESPYs, an ersatz sports Oscars created by ESPN to celebrate itself, raise money for charity, and fill a summer programming dead spot.\nThe broadcast drew a program-record 7.7 million viewers, but also made ESPN a target for conservatives. Subsequently firing baseball analyst Curt Schilling, an outspoken conservative, for posting a crude anti-transgender meme on Facebook further irritated right-learning viewers; by the time White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee-Sanders demanded Hill\u2019s dismissal after she called Trump a \u201cwhite supremacist who has largely surrounded himself w/ other white supremacists\u201d on Twitter, writers for The Wall Street Journal and Breitbart News were accusing the company of bowing to \u201cprogressive political correctness\u201d .\nCompounding matters, ESPN now covers an increasingly politicized sports world, with stories such as the national anthem protests aimed started by former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick dominating the news cycle.\nIn the mid-1990s, ESPN was so of the moment ... But it\u2019s nearly impossible to stay cool for multiple generations\n\u201cPeople say ESPN has a political viewpoint, but I don\u2019t believe that,\u201d said Deitsch. \u201cI think their point of view has always been about commercialism and money. But in 2017, the world has changed. You can see everything [ESPN host] Kenny Mayne thinks about from sports to politics on his Twitter feed. If you agree with him, good, but if you don\u2019t, that can change the dynamic of how you perceive him and ESPN.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve also gone into more issue-oriented discussion on their daytime shows. They have journalistic chops. I admire that. But that means there can be a price to pay, especially in some corners that don\u2019t want anything in sports to be about more than just sports.\u201d\nEven in that narrow band, ESPN has lost some of its cachet with fans. A messy split with Bill Simmons in 2015, at the time one of America\u2019s most popular sportswriters, led the company to shutter Grantland, a Simmons-helmed site whose relatively modest traffic belied its influence and acclaim. Barstool Sports \u2013 a bro-ier site known for rape jokes and speculation about the size of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady\u2019s baby\u2019s penis \u2013 has made inroads with ESPN\u2019s core young male demographic.\n\u201cIn the mid-1990s, ESPN was so of the moment,\u201d Deitsch said. \u201cIt felt fun, airy, vibrant. People felt like they wanted to hang out with this network. But it\u2019s nearly impossible to stay cool for multiple generations. Think about music. People like Jay-Z or Johnny Cash, who transcend generations, are like one-in-a-million types. I don\u2019t know if a sports network could ever be that.\u201d\nWarriors, Charles Barkley and Bob Ley pay tribute to fired ESPN workers Read more\nESPN\u2019s most pressing concern is financial. \u201cCord-cutters\u201d and \u201ccord-nevers\u201d \u2013 cable and satellite customers who have opted out in favor of streaming options like Netflix, or else never adopted pay television in the first place \u2013 are eroding the company\u2019s subscriber base. So are traditional customers snapping up \u201cskinny\u201d bundles that cut costs by cutting out ESPN , the most expensive non-premium channel on basic cable at roughly $7.50 per month and subscriber.\nOver the last half-decade, Netflix has surged from 25m to 50m subscribers . By contrast, ESPN has dropped from around 100m households to an estimated 87m, costing the company an estimated $1.08bn a year. Those losses come as ESPN is spending more than $8bn a year for the rights to the NFL ($1.9bn), NBA ($1.4bn), and other sports, deals that run through the early 2020s.\nWhen Disney CEO Bob Iger admitted during a 2015 earnings call that ESPN had seen \u201csome modest sub[scriber] losses\u201d and that the company\u2019s profit growth would slow, Disney shares fell nearly 10% the next day.\n\u201cESPN is no longer the golden child of Disney,\u201d said Sports Business Journal reporter John Ourand, who has covered the company in depth. \u201cNobody knows the floor for falling subscriptions. That\u2019s the biggest issue in the media business right now. Everybody is waiting to see where this is headed.\u201d\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s appearance at the ESPYs (left) did not go down well with some conservative viewers but ESPN can still afford to air events such as Wimbledon. Composite: Invision/AP/PA\nAt times, ESPN appears to have been caught flat-footed by the shift from cable to digital. Earlier this decade, the company invested $175m in an upgraded SportsCenter studio \u2013 never mind that highlights and analysis now are available almost instantaneously on social media, making the show itself increasingly obsolete. Perhaps wishfully, ESPN president John Skipper once believed that weak income growth among viewers was the primary driver behind cord-cutting \u2013 and not a desire by customers to treat television like music, paying only for the shows and songs they actually consume.\nMore recently, the company has moved to address its threats. ESPN is placing younger, more diverse multimedia talent \u2013 Bomani Jones, Pablo Torre, Mina Kimes, and Katie Nolan \u2013 into larger, forward-facing roles, and has launched The Undefeated, an African-American-focused sports and culture website. In what was seen by some as a sop to Red America , ESPN recently rehired Hank Williams Jr \u2013 let go in 2011 after publicly comparing President Obama to Hitler \u2013 to sing his popular Monday Night Football opening song.\nIn August, Disney announced plans to start two streaming services that would directly compete with Netflix . One will offer movies; the other, ESPN\u2019s second-tier sports. The company is also adapting SportsCenter for Snapchat. \u201cPart of what we\u2019re seeing is the sloppy process of ESPN trying to pivot from being a gigantic TV company to a more nimble media company,\u201d Ourand said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the newspaper industry when the internet started to take hold.\u201d\nOf course, that transition has ravaged print media. Some observers believe an \u201cimploding,\u201d \u201cdying \u201d ESPN faces a similar fate. In October, the Hollywood Reporter speculated that the company might consider punting on the NFL after its eight-year, $15.2bn deal with the league expires in 2021, a heretofore unthinkable cost-cutting measure. Squint hard enough, and it\u2019s possible to envision a scenario in which traditional television continues to contract, ratings collapse alongside, and an increasingly cash-strapped ESPN gets outbid for key sports by rich, content-hungry tech giants such as Facebook and Amazon \u2013 leaving the company hollowed out, with little of value to offer.\nBut that\u2019s unlikely. ESPN remains a powerful, profitable enterprise: the highest-rated cable network among men, and adults ages 18 and 54, with the second-most total viewers in primetime, well-positioned to fend off would-be rivals like Fox Sports that also are being hit hard by pay television\u2019s contraction. It doesn\u2019t need to recapture its youthful hipness; to the contrary, a recent mini-fiasco in which the company announced and then cancelled a Barstool-branded show after being criticism from its own employees suggests that the middle-aged company probably shouldn\u2019t try. Nor should ESPN waste time attempting to pacify the politically-peeved \u2013 if the Trump Era proves anything, it\u2019s that brands can\u2019t escape America\u2019s all-encompassing grievance vortex .\nUltimately, math is math. ESPN faces a future with fewer paying customers. Those who remain will still be sports fans. Can the company translate their passion into sufficient profit? Disney reportedly is negotiating a $60bn purchase of 21st Century Fox\u2019s entertainment assets , including 22 Fox-owned regional sports networks \u2013which carry teams like the New York Yankees, charge hefty local subscription fees, and serve roughly half of the nation\u2019s television markets. For ESPN, acquiring those rights would be both a doubling down and a bet on the future: own the games, and people will pay you plenty to watch.\n\u201cESPN can\u2019t just make money by showing up anymore,\u201d Deitsch said. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to be 1998 again. That said, anybody who thinks they are going out of business tomorrow is insane. One day, they may be a 3,000-person company as opposed to 8,000 people. But that\u2019s still a powerhouse.\u201d\nAlbeit a smaller one. Seven years ago, ESPN closed five of its seven theme restaurants \u2013 including the Baltimore location \u2013 and blamed the Great Recession. It was, perhaps, a harbinger. Larger economic and cultural trends lifted ESPN to unprecedented heights. Going forward, the company may find itself in an unfamiliar inversion: still at the mercy of outside forces, and managing its own decline.\nTopics ESPN Television industry US television industry features", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pablo torre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hank williams jr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom brady", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bomani jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colin kaepernick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob ley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben stiller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay-z", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard deitsch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olbermann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob iger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hitler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom cruise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ourand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenny mayne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grantland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david letterman-shaped", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caitlyn jenner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keith olbermann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerry maguire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnny cash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "curt schilling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deitsch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katie nolan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles barkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill simmons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah huckabee-sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jemele hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig kilborn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john ourand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marina hyde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mina kimes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "espn", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "getty/nbae/bloomberg/usa today sports  underlying", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netflix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tbs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "breitbart news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sports illustrated", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national football league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "espn classic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "red america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england patriots", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "espys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york yankees", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "disney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "21st century fox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hbo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollywood reporter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sports business journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook and amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "baltimore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jemele hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "espn zone", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:43.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d1ac274694cc16c80e0440460532ecd5ddb062d5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9XkS5JYZS5jRbn0zsJ3859mwjJh9MPhlFeopmH0OCjsOIdUaU9ZjG8lJuoqXGmmotudBSnQpW6GpElZ7Dw..23nxGxXbg.pXQJF_uqv44OQ_UWusv5awKr", "site_full": "www.kswo.com", "site": "kswo.com", "site_section": "http://www.kswo.com/category/84964/news?clienttype=rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "KSWO -

Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio, left, and Keith Gregg, the county's Chief Information Technology Officer, right, speak at a press conference Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, at the Government Center about t... \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

As a means of payment on the platform xChainge Token (XCT) is introduced.\n\n          The xChainge token is an ERC-20 Ethereum-based utility token, which is used on the platform to pay for Matcher node services and make Matcher node security deposits. It is issued by a non-profit fund which is creating the xChainge platform.\n\n          xChainge was co-founded by Albert Ibragimov, Danil Popov, Artur Ustimov and Egor Klimenko. All co-founders have a unique expertise in private equity, venture investment, financial products and marketing solutions. The core team of founders and early investors are the shareholders of Aktivo, a leading service of collective investments to commercial real estate property.\n\n          The crowdsale is scheduled to run between December 5th and December 30th, 2017. The team chose the Dutch auction model, similar to Raiden Network. At the start of the crowdsale each token will cost 0.05 ETH and the price will gradually decrease over time with constant rate. The auction hard cap is equal to 20 000 000 XCT tokens.\n\n          Source: xChainge", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "danil popov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "artur ustimov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egor klimenko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albert ibragimov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "raiden network", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "aktivo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:43.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "927742b6da5ab2042b761a6c4653590828966be6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVgFg1upPBCWHn7vgpLkpAy9wNpHWBlRiqmI_8tKvjkUCZ0ZfBNHdoc6Ih_oG8ijEStJsB93nuvfeN3Z66z6xAbV5lLs_wyHWk_MikMe_pk.", "site_full": "www.expedia.es", "site": "expedia.es", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.es/Oakland-Hoteles.d602144.Guia-Viajes-Hoteles", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "74 Hoteles en Oakland, Memphis baratos con Expedia.es", "title": "Baymont Inn & Suites Memphis East", "title_full": "Baymont Inn & Suites Memphis East (Memphis, Estados Unidos) | Expedia.es", "published": "2017-09-11T21:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26131, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "803548629601cb80e18c3b1fca431f5fd624a7e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVgFg1upPBCWHn7vgpLkpAy9wNpHWBlRiqmI_8tKvjkUCZ0ZfBNHdoc6Ih_oG8ijEStJsB93nuvfeN3Z66z6xAbV5lLs_wyHWo8q3nhnIaba_BrE2GbHdvW9lMmqz5ArmZxlRz51zrR8cuG3K8lmNPs-", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-04T06:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "This place was fantastic.

I came across your post and would like to assist.\nI understand that you have an HP Officejet 6110 All-in-One Printer. I read that the motor that moves the carriage, keeps turning even if the carriage reaches the far right corner.\nThis sounds like a hardware issue with the printer. However, you may perform a hard reset on your printer and check if that helps:\nThe steps to perform a hard reset are as follows: Disconnect the power cable from the printer while the printer is still ON. Disconnect any other cables if connected the printer. Press and hold the printer\u2019s power button for 15 seconds. The printer should be directly connected to the wall outlet and not to a surge protector. Reconnect the power cable to print and the printer should power ON by itself. If the printer doesn\u2019t power ON then please manually power it ON.\nIf the issue persists then I suggest you HP phone support team to check the available service options for this printer model.\nto contact our\nHope this helps.

(Owen Humphreys/PA) \nSEVERE gales are beginning to strengthen across parts of the UK as Storm Caroline arrives \u2013 with forecasters warning of a danger to life amid \u201cdevastating\u201d gusts in some areas. \nThe Met Office has issued an amber \u201cbe prepared\u201d weather warning for northern Scotland on Thursday. \nHigh winds were already picking up in the early hours, with gusts of up to 90mph expected to batter the region through the morning. \n(PA Graphics) \nTrain services in the north and west of the country have been cancelled, while Traffic Scotland is warning of potential disruptions on the road. \nMet Office meteorologist John West said: \u201cStorm Caroline is well on its way across northern parts of the UK. \n\u201cThere will be devastating winds in some parts. More broadly across Scotland there will be 60-70mph gusts, but in exposed areas we could see 90mph.\u201d \nThe strong wind warning is valid from 6am until 11.55pm on Thursday, with an amber warning for northern Scotland. \nMeanwhile, Storm Caroline also brings a frontal system, which will mean a wet and windy start for the southern half of the UK, before cold temperatures set in. \nDuring Thursday afternoon a mixture of sleet and snow showers will work their way across the whole of Britain, with the potential for blizzard conditions in Scotland. \nThe wintry showers will become more widespread over the next 24 hours, with forecasters also issuing a yellow severe weather warning for snow and ice on Friday. \nIt covers much of Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and parts of northern and western England. \nTo read the full story, click here .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john west",

She is currently working remotely while travelling around France with her partner and five-month-old son.\nHow having children impacts your career Read more \n\u201cI get small pockets of time when my baby\u2019s asleep and that\u2019s when I speak with my team and do my own work, so it can be a bit frantic. I\u2019m often writing strategy or new business documents pre-9am and after 7pm,\u201d she says.\nThis \u201cnever really leaving\u201d mentality is one that many sole traders and small business owners will relate to. For self-employed women in the UK, Maternity Allowance (MA) is technically available for up to 39 weeks. However, the sticking point for small business owners is that in order to claim, you are only permitted to work for 10 \u201ckeeping in touch\u201d (KIT) days throughout this period \u2013 anything further will stop your payments. \nThis presents a conundrum: taking time completely away from the business is at best difficult and at worst impossible. For those who do take time off, many return to work very quickly. Research from the National Childbirth Trust (NCT) found that almost half (43%) of women return to work sooner than they would like to after maternity leave.\n\nHolly Tucker, who went on to be the founder of notonthehighstreet.com, was freelance when her son was born; she had no choice but to return to freelance work soon after the birth.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Holly Tucker, cofounder of notonthehighstreet.com, with her son, Harry. Photograph: Holly Tucker \n\u201cWe really couldn\u2019t afford the mortgage repayments, and I just had to go. I was of course, beyond shattered. But I had to bring in those sales targets, and in a way it made it easier, because I didn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d she says.\nTucker\u2019s latest enterprise, Holly & Co, advises small businesses. She says that \u201ctraditional\u201d maternity leave is simply not an option for most small business owners.\n\u201cWith all the businesses that I work with every day, there is no question really \u2013 except for a few, they\u2019re back within a week,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen the buck stops with you, when it\u2019s your career ... when you\u2019ve got people that are reliant on you \u2026 I don\u2019t judge anybody for the fact that they need to get back to work.\u201d\nSuzie Cregan, co-founder of Jimmy\u2019s Iced Coffee, also ended her maternity leave early. \u201cI took three weeks off work after having my baby before I was back in meetings at the office. Jimmy\u2019s [Iced Coffee] is also my baby and I felt incredibly guilty about not going in during those weeks I took off. The emails didn\u2019t stop when my baby arrived and when the business faced a few unexpected challenges, it was important for me to get back in the ring again.\u201d\nJoeli Brearley is behind the campaign Pregnant Then Screwed , which aims to end pregnancy and maternity discrimination. She believes that a new approach to shared parental leave could be the key to better supporting self-employed parents and offering more choice to female business owners.\n\u201cThe way Shared Parental Leave (SPL) was set up means that if one parent is self-employed, the family are unable to access SPL and shared parental pay,\u201d she explains. \u201cThis means that the entire burden of childcare is placed on the mother: a self-employed father has no right to leave or pay whatsoever. For the mother to access Maternity Allowance, she must take her maternity leave, so she therefore risks damaging her business,\u201d she says.\nAccess to SPL for the self-employed was one of the five demands made by the March of the Mummies , a protest march in October of this year spearheaded by Pregnant Then Screwed. Thousands of women and men marched on Downing Street in London \u2013 with sister events taking place in four other UK cities \u2013 to demand better rights for working mothers.\n\u201cImplementing [SPL for the self employed] would cost the government nothing, as it is simply a process of redistributing the funds that are already allocated to women,\u201d Brearley says.\nIt certainly isn\u2019t straightforward, but in a working world where pregnancy discrimination is rife and flexible working remains a buzzword rather than a reality, being self-employed can be a definite advantage when it comes to parenthood. For the most part in small businesses, unlike more corporate environments, you\u2019re not expected to leave your identity as a parent at the door when you arrive at the office.\nMat Lyon, co-owner of design agency Lyon & Lyon, sees that flexibility as a huge advantage. He took two weeks\u2019 leave after the birth of his daughter, Eve, and says the flexibility of being your own boss allows you to take time off \u201cwhen you really need to\u201d. \u201cFor the first six months [after Eve was born], I would take a day or two off as and when stuff got hard at home. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t do any work as such during my leave, but I did check in a couple times a week to creatively direct projects. I remember Skyping the studio with Eve asleep on my chest \u2013 that was quite cool and totally not what I\u2019d imagined,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said that if someone wants to see me, my baby needs to come,\u201d Werner says. \u201cAll of my meetings have obliged, and the result is that I have breastfed in boardrooms and cafes across the city, with entrepreneurs, journalists and CEOs who don\u2019t even blink an eye.\u201d\nTucker adds: \u201c95% of small businesses on notonthehighstreet.com are run by women.\n\u201cI do think that we\u2019ve got to count our lucky stars that we\u2019ve got the opportunity now to do these things. We just have to muddle on through.\u201d\n\nSign up to become a member of Guardian B2B \u2013 f or insight and advice direct to your inbox. \nTopics Accessing expertise Business to business Women Small business Entrepreneurs features", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tucker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holly tucker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suzie cregan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucy werner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joeli brearley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mat lyon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "werner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimmy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "brearley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national childbirth trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lyon & lyon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holly & co", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "downing street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:44.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9db0223e8113ec20862213616c44feec2cfcf69f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqIBRdCDNqED9ihSoln8lZVEk7eI5MF3enL2NsDyo1qDB6OMEmEtKcS5FzI6CgalPodace3cC1k0zk15We2W.6WIpFFdhTN1RojZT5NodAVCQTtC28WS2_atqm9ieoaLQq7rKwl_HnLM6gkiT7z5JviXxWAYCURFI3", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/politics/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Politics links", "title": "(9829158) Good news: Greek's debt crisis is coming to an end.

He has a low sex drive anyway so unless we TTC (trying to conceive) there is almost no chance of conceiving using a laid back approach!\nI kind of think now he was always unsure and I can't see it happening. I really don't think its anything to do with the mc other than the fact he probably felt less inclined to say he didn't want to ttc after it. I am just annoyed that he did drag it outand lead me to think we would have another. Its such an energy drain thinking about it every month and hoping and its been a waste of time.\nI see what you're saying about the course but I've thought it all out since I had my first. I wouldn't want to regularly leave a baby before a year old or close to that (had to with my first but didnt like it) and I don't want to work properly when I haven't with my other kids. Well, I do but only a few hours. My actual profession is very male dominated and there's no part time work so I need to be able to work long hours. I'm totally out of it right now despite spending years training to do it. The longer I leave having a baby the wore it is for us financially and for my job prospects and as I said the age gap also bothers me. The reason our first gap was 24 months was due to making sure my career break isn't too long so its nuts to have a huge gap now! It'll get to a point where it just won't be practical and actually that point isn't very far away.

Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box - although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action. \n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" \nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. \nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" \nTrump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \n\"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\" Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Childs Walker/Baltimore Sun video) Jeff Zrebiec \u2019s qualities that Ravens players and coaches have frequently praised since the first time the rookie first-round draft pick took the field as a pro is his intelligence, so it was hardly surprising to hear that the cornerback knows exactly what to expect Sunday night when he starts against the Pittsburgh Steelers in place of Jimmy Smith .\n\u201cLast game, I gave up a few plays,\u201d Humphrey said after the Ravens practiced Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m sure if there\u2019s a weak link they have to pick out, it would definitely be me. [ Ben Roethlisberger ] likes to throw it up. He\u2019s a great quarterback, so I\u2019m sure if he has to take those shots, it will probably be at me.\u201d \nHumphrey\u2019s teammates and coaches also rave about his confidence, and the rookie spent much of his five-plus-minute talk with reporters downplaying what awaits him Sunday night at Heinz Field. He praised Roethlisberger and wide receiver Antonio Brown , who leads the league in receptions, receiving yards and touchdown catches, but he made clear he\u2019s not approaching this week much differently from his previous 12 games even though the circumstances are now entirely different. \nThe rookie out of Alabama has played just over 38 percent of the Ravens\u2019 defensive snaps this year, substituting in on different series for either Smith or Brandon Carr . But Smith\u2019s season ended Sunday when he tore his left Achilles tendon against the Detroit Lions and was subsequently suspended the next day for four games for violating the NFL \u2019s policy on performance-enhancing drugs. \nThe Ravens\u2019 plans for life without Smith and for stopping the Steelers\u2019 high-powered offense Sunday will lean heavily on Humphrey. Alex Brandon / AP Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Justin Hunter (11) is stopped by Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey (29) during the second half Oct. 1, 2017. Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Justin Hunter (11) is stopped by Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey (29) during the second half Oct. 1, 2017. (Alex Brandon / AP) and Jerraud Powers .\nThe defense held steady until the fourth quarter, when Roethlisberger led the Steelers on three touchdown drives and threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Brown with 13 seconds to go to give Pittsburgh a 31-27 win and the AFC North championship. The Ravens secondary was powerless to stop Roethlisberger when it counted as the quarterback completed eight of 10 passes for 75 yards and the two incompletions were spikes to stop the clock. \nRavens coach John Harbaugh has said on several occasions this week that the team is now better equipped to deal with Smith\u2019s absence and that\u2019s partly because it now has Humphrey, who has hardly looked overwhelmed when facing receivers such as the Cincinnati Bengals \u2019 A.J. Green and the Green Bay Packers\u2019 Davante Adams this season. \nEvery week during the season, The Baltimore Sun will spotlight how a member of the Ravens organization does his or her job. \nIt\u2019s weird to say this of a punter, but watching Sam Koch practice is a joy. \nOn one kick, the 12th-year Raven might send the ball soaring on a line over the returner\u2019s head.... \nEvery week during the season, The Baltimore Sun will spotlight how a member of the Ravens organization does his or her job. \nIt\u2019s weird to say this of a punter, but watching Sam Koch practice is a joy. \nOn one kick, the 12th-year Raven might send the ball soaring on a line over the returner\u2019s head.... (Childs Walker) \n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be tested. There\u2019s going to be good moments, and there\u2019s always when you play that position \u2014 I don\u2019t care whether you\u2019re a rookie or a veteran \u2014 \u2013 you\u2019re going to have moments where they\u2019ll make a play,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cThe league is built that way; it\u2019s built for playmakers to make plays in the passing game, and that\u2019s just going to happen, and you\u2019re going to have to bounce back and make the next play and understand how that works. Marlon seems like he has a good understanding of that. He plays hard, he plays focused, he\u2019s developing his technique. He\u2019s a very talented guy. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how he does. I think he\u2019ll do well.\u201d \nBut the onus going forward to replace Smith won\u2019t entirely be on the rookie first-round pick. Carr, a veteran, has had a solid season lining up opposite Smith. The Ravens also feel good about young cornerbacks Maurice Canady and Jaylen Hill , and they promoted Stanley Jean-Baptiste from the practice squad earlier this week.

U.S. health of... \nBy LAURAN NEERGAARDAP Medical Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens. \n___ \nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.
