The current level of the shares currently stands at 102.65 at the time of writing. \nSAR stands for stop and reverse and it is a trend following indicator, designed to identify the turning point in price action. The parabolic SAR is shown on the charts as a series of small \u2018dots\u2019 that are placed either above or below the price. When the price is trending to the upside, the dots are below the price action and when the price is trending to the downside, the dots are above the price action. \nWhen the share price closes above the upper Parabolic SAR, a trader could interpret a buy signal. The Parabolic SAR will move from being above price to below price and the trader would cover any existing short positions and reverse direction and buy long. \nWhen the price closes below the lower Parabolic SAR, a trader could interpret a sell signal.

Many technical chart analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend.

The ADX is typically plotted along with two other directional movement indicator lines, the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI). Some analysts believe that the ADX is one of the best trend strength indicators available. \nSome investors may find the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R as a helpful technical indicator. Presently, Allstate Corp (ALL)\u2019s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R is resting at -28.32. Values can range from 0 to -100. A reading between -80 to -100 may be typically viewed as strong oversold territory. A value between 0 to -20 would represent a strong overbought condition. As a momentum indicator, the Williams R% may be used with other technicals to help define a specific trend. \nWhen performing stock analysis, investors and traders may opt to view technical levels. Allstate Corp (ALL) presently   91.36. Investors and traders may use this indicator to help spot price reversals, price extremes, and the strength of a trend. Many investors will use the CCI in conjunction with other indicators when evaluating a trade.

Moving averages may be used by investors and traders to shed some light on trading patterns for a specific stock. Moving averages can be used to help smooth information in order to provide a clearer picture of what is going on with the stock. Technical stock analysts may use a combination of different time periods in order to figure out the history of the equity and where it may be headed in the future. MA\u2019s can be calculated for any time period, but two very popular time frames are the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. \nShifting gears to the Relative Strength Index, the 14-day RSI is currently sitting at 70.82, the 7-day is 67.47, and the 3-day is currently at 51.82 for Allstate Corp (ALL). The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a highly popular momentum indicator used for technical analysis. The RSI can help display whether the bulls or the bears are currently strongest in the market. The RSI may be used to help spot points of reversals more accurately. The RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder. As a general rule, an RSI reading over 70 would signal overbought conditions. A reading under 30 would indicate oversold conditions. As always, the values may need to be adjusted based on the specific stock and market. RSI can also be a valuable tool for trying to spot larger market turns.

It went something like: She\u2019s just looking for attention and a payday. It really affected me. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. I remember going to my phone and I started writing. And I couldn\u2019t stop. What it became was this sixteen-tweet missive from me. I just remember having to say what I felt. I was really angry because these women were being discounted. These women were being discarded. Their pain was just\u2014it was nothing. I wanted to join in. I wanted to say something. I wanted to support. But I did have to let these women know they weren\u2019t alone. And that I understood. My whole mission was to give them strength. Don\u2019t accept the shame that people are giving you. Because that\u2019s what it was. They were being shamed. They were being victimized again. I just couldn\u2019t stand for it. \nOn the aftermath of his tweets: In a matter of hours it had become the #1 trending topic on Twitter. And I had a realization: I didn\u2019t check with my wife, I didn\u2019t check with my publicist, I didn\u2019t check with anybody. I just did it. But at that moment, I was free. Until men stand up and say, \u201cThis harassment, this abuse, these assaults are wrong,\u201d nothing will change. If I was silent, it would mean I\u2019m consenting to all of it. I always have felt women have been able to take care of themselves, 100%. But men need to hold other men accountable. That\u2019s my thing. I came up in the cult of masculinity, in football and the sports world and entertainment. You\u2019re in places and guys are saying the wildest thing. People need to be called on that. You need to be held accountable for the things you say, the things you do. What it came from is literally a belief that as a man you are more valuable than a woman. The reason I have the authority to say it is because I was like it. I truly believed I was more valuable than my wife and kids. Until I had a major paradigm shift in my own life\u2014it was like I hit rock bottom in order for me to see that I had it all wrong. \nOn the reaction from Hollywood: Hollywood was so far into the fact that everyone thought this behavior is normal. It needs to swing all the way back. What we need is a reset. People say, \u201cOh, it\u2019s a witch hunt. People could lie.\u201d You know what? First of all, the thread of that is going to keep people right. We need to know you can\u2019t do it. If it\u2019s not a witch, it\u2019s a witch hunt. If there are actual witches there, we need to stop them. I have people coming to me saying, \u201cHey, man. You could ruin this guy\u2019s life.\u201d Very clever. That\u2019s a very clever thing to say. But he ruined it when he did it. All these people need to be disciplined into knowing what is acceptable and what isn\u2019t. The only way to do that is by holding people accountable every time. This is something that gives my life meaning. There\u2019s no reason why\u2014why should I be the guy to survive Flint, Michigan; survive forty-nine years on this Earth; married twenty-eight years with five kids, the whole thing\u2014and then I just sit in my big house and relax. This gives my life meaning. Now I know why I was put here. Let me tell you\u2014the guy who messed with me messed with the wrong guy.

There's a dent in the tailgate, but it still works just fine. New oil and filter, antifreeze, serpentine belt and PCV valve installed in Aug 2017. The heat and AC work VERY well. Has cruise control, power windows and locks, sliding rear window and power driver's seat. Also a plug-in winter heater which I have never needed to use. The brakes are good and tight. It travels straight, doesn't pull to one side going down the road, nor when you brake. I have included photos of 2 Kelly Bluebook values of this truck. I am selling this for a lot less than the KBB value, so I don't expect to be asked to sell this for less than the $2,700 I have it listed at.

Then we can talk about all the great moments, who hooked up with who, and how badly I dominated all who dared attack me\nAlso, I would love to set up some sort of troop destroying party since I dont want to keep such a high gen score and it's just such a shame to dismiss them all. I'd be willing to host the party and anyone and everyone is welcome to come dump troops into the battle (no waving though, this is about dying not about who wins)!! Quote: Go to Page Top Slash Guest\n20 May 12th 2010, 5:13pm\nI like the idea of a troop destroying party. I'm sure the LAW guys would like to burn off their excess troops in a way that isn't just clicking \"dismiss\" as well.

Picture: SNS \nAberdeen to blame for McInnes exit \nKris Boyd reckons Aberdeen have no one to blame but themselves if Derek McInnes leaves the club for Rangers. The former Ibrox striker has credited McInnes with rejuvenating the city as well as the club, and says the 46-year-old has been let down by Aberdeen\u2019s failure to get a new stadium and training ground during his time in charge. (Scottish Sun) \n- Aberdeen want McInnes more than Rangers, says former goalscoring hero Duncan Shearer. (Daily Record) \n- Moving to Rangers would show a lack of ambition from McInnes, according to Aberdeen legend Joe Harper. (Scottish Sun) \nMcInnes holds talks with Milne \nRangers target Derek McInnes appears to have taken a major step towards his Aberdeen exit after holding showdown talks with Pittodrie chief Stewart Milne. The Dons boss and his assistant Tony Docherty did not take their team\u2019s training session on Wednesday morning and instead headed for a face-to-face meeting with Milne after the Reds chairman rejected Rangers\u2019 request to speak to McInnes. (The Scotsman) \nREAD MORE - What the Belgian newspapers are saying about Celtic 0-1 Anderlecht \nO\u2019Neill a target for Aberdeen \nAberdeen could make a shock approach for Michael O\u2019Neill if, as expected, Derek McInnes makes his move to Rangers. The Northern Ireland boss is the No.1 target for the Scottish FA after Gordon Strachan\u2019s sacking in October, but the Dons may look to pinch the manager from under the noses of the national team as they look to tempt him back into club football. (Scottish Sun) \nBrighton to make \u00a320m move for Dembele \nBrighton are ready to spend \u00a320million to bring Celtic striker Moussa Dembele to the club in the January transfer window. The English Premier League side are desperate for more firepower up front having missed out on the chance to sign Vincent Janssen in the summer. They may need to up their offer, though, as Celtic consider Dembele to be worth closer to \u00a330million. (Daily Mail) \nREAD MORE - Brendan Rodgers: Celtic \u2018nowhere near\u2019 Champions League elite \nBrendan Rodgers\u2019 transfer window plans \nBrendan Rodgers will not splash out on a marquee signing in the January transfer window to boost Celtic\u2019s chances in the Europa League. The Parkhead manager had previously indicated he was looking to strengthen in January to give his side time to settle for next year\u2019s Champions League charge. However, he insists he won\u2019t be spending big bucks in order to do so. (Daily Express) \nFerguson rubbishes Rangers return rumours \nBarry Ferguson has rubbished reports linking him with a return to Ibrox, branding the speculation \u2018a lot of nonsense\u2019.

The ADX is typically plotted along with two other directional movement indicator lines, the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI).

Brazil (Nov. 11 at Interlagos) and Abu Dhabi (Nov. 25 at Yas Marina) are the last two races. \nQuestions were raised about the Brazilian GP being held next year in Sao Paulo after serious security scares last month. \nMembers of Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes team were robbed at gun point in their minivan while leaving the track. Valuables were stolen but there were no injuries reported. \nStreet crime is endemic in Brazil, which has been battered in the last several years by its worst recession in memory. Thieves at the F1 race often target cars stuck in traffic jams at the exit of the circuit located about 30 kilometers (20 miles) south of Sao Paulo city center. \nAt this year's race, FIA spokesman Matteo Bonciani said the car in which he was leaving the track was assaulted by gun-wielding assailants who attempted to smash in the bullet-proof windows with the vehicle stuck in traffic. \nIn response to these latest incidents, new security measures were proposed Wednesday. \nThe FIA directly urged that the race promoter uses an \"independent security expert to evaluate and advise on security plans,\" while implementing a police reporting hub at the circuit and improving \"overall communication between the promoter security, police and F1 stakeholders.\" \nThe French GP, meanwhile, returns after a 10-year absence and will be hosted at the iconic Paul Ricard circuit, also known as Le Castellet, in southern France on June 24. \nPaul Ricard last hosted the French GP in 1990. The race was then organized at Magny-Cours from 1991-2008 but was dropped from the calendar in 2008 because of financial issues. \nThe German GP, which has struggled with attendances and track fees, was scrapped this year but will return at Hockenheim on July 22. \nThe Azerbaijan GP has been moved forward to April 29, making it the fourth race of the season.

The current level of the shares currently stands at 31.60 at the time of writing. \nThe main usage of the Parabolic SAR is for trailing stops and exit points. The principle of trading using this indicator is easy. A long position should be maintained as long as the indicator is moving above the price levels, whereas a short position \u2013 while it is below them. In addition, when the SAR changes its direction and crosses the price levels, not only the current position should be closed, but it is suggested that the opposite one should be opened at the same price levels. \nHowever, it should be used only when the market has the defined trend (around 30% of the time) and is smoother. When the trend is absent or the market is volatile, this system generates a lot of incorrect signals. Moreover, the indicator should be adjusted depending on the characteristics of the underlying shares. \nInvestors and traders using technical analysis to examine stocks may be interested in taking a look at the ATR or Average True Range. Currently, NCR Corp (NCR) has a 14-day ATR of 0.73. The Average True Range is an investor tool used to measure stock volatility. The ATR is not used to figure out price direction, just to measure volatility. The ATR is an indicator developed by J. Welles Wilder. Wilder has developed multiple indicators that are still quite popular in today\u2019s investing landscape. The general interpretation of the ATR is the higher the ATR value, the higher the volatility. \nThe Williams Percent Range or Williams %R is another technical indicator worth checking out. NCR Corp (NCR) currently has a 14 day Williams %R of -19.83. The Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and -100 measuring whether a security is overbought or oversold. The Williams %R is similar to the Stochastic Oscillator except it is plotted upside-down. Levels above -20 may indicate the stock may be considered is overbought. If the indicator travels under -80, this may signal that the stock is oversold. Chart analysts may also use the indicator to project possible price reversals and to define trends. \nThe Average Directional Index or ADX is technical analysis indicator used to discern if a market is trending or not trending. The ADX alone measures trend strength but not direction. Using the ADX with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) may help determine the direction of the trend as well as the overall momentum. Many traders will use the ADX alongside other indicators in order to help spot proper trading entry/exit points. Currently, the 14-day ADX for NCR Corp (NCR) is 27.16. Generally speaking, an ADX value from 0-25 would indicate an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would indicate a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would signal a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would indicate an extremely strong trend. \nTraders may be leaning on technical stock analysis to help with investing decisions. NCR Corp (NCR) currently   92.03. Despite the name, CCI can be used on other investment tools such as stocks. The CCI was designed to typically stay within the reading of -100 to +100. Traders may use the indicator to determine stock trends or to identify overbought/oversold conditions. A CCI reading above +100 would imply that the stock is overbought and possibly ready for a correction. On the other hand, a reading of -100 would imply that the stock is oversold and possibly set for a rally. \nTraders are paying renewed attention to shares of NCR Corp (NCR). The current 14-day RSI is presently sitting at 49.51, the 7-day is 59.11, and the 3-day is 64.60. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index is a popular oscillating indicator among traders and investors. The RSI operates in a range-bound area with values between 0 and 100. When the RSI line moves up, the stock may be experiencing strength. The opposite is the case when the RSI line is heading lower. Different time periods may be used when using the RSI indicator. The RSI may be more volatile using a shorter period of time. Many traders keep an eye on the 30 and 70 marks on the RSI scale. A move above 70 is widely considered to show the stock as overbought, and a move below 30 would indicate that the stock may be oversold. Traders may use these levels to help identify stock price reversals.

The ministry said it received a complaint from the owner of the company Tuesday that the Egyptian worker was beaten while he was at work. Commenting on a video posted on social media showing the incident of beating the Egyptian worker, the ministry's security media and public relations department said the criminal security sector managed to arrest the fugitive attacker, and his fellow whose vehicle was used in the incident by the offender, in Salwa area. During the investigations, the attacker admitted that he committed the incident, the department said, adding that required measures will be taken against them by competent authorities. The Egyptian worker was taken to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for some hours as he was suffering from serious injuries, but his condition is improving and he is still receiving treatment, it concluded.

Execution of Justice Release Date: July 14, 2017 Genre: Militiary Action Adventure Buy Link: Amazon About the book: When three Covert Operatives are brutally murdered while investigating a human trafficker who has taken a congressman's daughter, John Drake is called in. Driven by personal demons, he is determined to deliver his own brand of justice to this ruthless gang. As Drake tracks the most powerful enemy he has ever faced, an already tough mission becomes nearly impossible when Drake's assignment propels him to the fulcrum of a new World War, and a CIA plot to incite conflict between the Muslim oil countries and Israel unfolds. Haunted by trauma from his past, Drake must ultimately confront the most terrifying identity of all - his own. Can he hunt down the most dangerous man in the world and prevent a war? Or will he become the monster he hunts? EXCERPT Outside, Drake had moved to the north side. Men occupied all eight windows, their AK-47s at the ready. By his count, there were over twenty men remaining inside the citadel. It was time for the claymores. When Drake hit the button, the result was devastating. All the men in the windows on the north side were shredded as thousands of steel balls passed effortlessly through the heavy wooden shutters, then through the soft tissue and bones of their bodies. After the smoke and dust had settled, Drake shouldered his weapon and sprinted toward the aqueduct grating. Gip was back at his original position, flanking the south entrance. He continued to move to and fro, rattling off automatic fire to create the illusion that he was an entire squad. Abruptly, the earth shook with a massive explosion from the north side. He was caught by surprise. His ears rang terribly. He ceased fire and low crawled his way toward the claymore switch. Tartus' men were bustling with panic on the south side. After the enormous explosion from the north side, the firing from the rocks had stopped.The northern entrance had obviously been compromised. After much shouting, the men outside stopped their wild firing, eventually realizing they were shooting at no targets. Gip peeked out and saw heads or silhouettes occupying all the southern windows, rifle barrels waving back and forth across the rock formations. Although he couldn't see them, he guessed there were at least six more men hiding outside among the rocks. Bracing himself against the sound, he fired the claymores. Again, concussion rocked the night. Body parts were strewn about the compound, falling to the ground with a sickening, wet sound. A preternatural silence followed the explosion. No gunshots, no birds, no insects, no voices; merely the ringing in his ears. Everything outside the citadel was dead. Gip estimated about a dozen bodies in the south compound. He didn't know how many Drake had gotten on the north side, but with luck he had gotten at least the men in the windows. That left the four snipers on the roof, plus between two and five inside, plus Tartus. Gip checked his watch. Drake would be in the aqueduct soon. It was time for phase two. AUTHOR Bio and Links: Patrick received Advanced Infantry Training while stationed at Fort Benning. This inspired him to write his first novel, Execution of Justice, a story driven by John Drake's mission to rescue innocent women from the world's most dangerous criminal. Drake's advanced military tactics prove handy when he steps right into the middle of an impending World War. Patrick's degree in Political Science helped him incorporate the geopolitical boiling pot of the early 1970s with a military action adventure plot. His Master's degree in chemistry provided a foundation for some of the more creative military tactics used in \"Execution of Justice\". Patrick has had eight poems published in the Presbyterian College annual literary magazine, Figs and Thistles, and is a member of Mensa. Patrick's newest project, Mortal Coil, is a techno-thriller about the catastrophic possibilities of genetic engineering. From the Author In \"Execution of Justice\", I wanted to add deep characterization to the military action adventure genre, exploring concepts such as: revenge vs. forgiveness, universal vs. relative morality, self-discovery and the roots of what makes each of us who we are. Family, abuse, trauma, personal loyalties, betrayals and patriotic obligations conflict and eventually form the amalgam that is our protagonist, John Drake.

In a speech broadcast by the state-run TV Wednesday night, Abbas said the decision also will not give any legitimacy for Israel as Jerusalem is an Arab Muslim and Christian city, the capital of the eternal state of Palestine. Responding to Trump's decision which recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, Abbas said this is a reward to Israel for its violations to international resolutions and an encouragement for Israelis to continue their policy of occupation, settlements, apartheid and ethnic cleansing. \"We say Jerusalem is the city of peace, the city of the Al-Aqsa Mosque,\" he said. He added Jerusalem is the first of the two Qibla, the second mosque on earth and the third of the two Holy Mosques, and the city of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. He pointed out that the US administration has chosen to violate all international and bilateral resolutions and agreements. He went to say that the US preferred to ignore and contradict the international consensus expressed by the positions of various countries, world leaders, spiritual leaders and regional organizations over the past few days on the subject of Jerusalem. The Palestinian leader revealed that these measures serve extremist groups attempting to turn the conflict into a religious war in the region, which is facing critical situations amid international conflicts and endless wars. Abbas noted that such denounced and rejected measures are a deliberate undermining of all efforts to achieve peace. This refers to a declaration of the withdrawal of the United States from playing the role it played over the past decades as a peace broker, he explained. He spoke about contacts conducted over the past days with leaders of friendly and sisterly countries which stressed the unified position by Arab and Muslim nations, as well as international countries towards Jerusalem and the Palestinian cause. He said that the coming days would witness a call for various Palestinian committees and bodies to hold emergency meetings so as to follow up the latest developments due to this move. \"We will call on Palestine Liberation Organization's Central Council to hold an emergency session and all factions will be invited to attend in order to affirm the unified Palestinian national position and put all options before the conferees,\" he concluded. nq.hm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mahmoud abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kuna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestinian authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine liberation organization's central council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kuwait", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem   ramallah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qibla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al-aqsa mosque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:06.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dea2b9c525b8b0bdcbd4cf19edd6d2fd299d7eba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm0.vchjV90MifbE6RQ2ZbQR", "site_full": "www.ooyuz.com", "site": "ooyuz.com", "site_section": "http://www.ooyuz.com/newsanalysis?term=pac-12", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "pac-12 News Results and Analysis |OOYUZ", "title": "Senior Bowl adds 26 players for 2018 game, including 4 QBs | AL.com", "title_full": "Senior Bowl adds 26 players for 2018 game, including 4 QBs | AL.com : Related Articles | OOYUZ", "published": "2017-12-05T06:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53324, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dea2b9c525b8b0bdcbd4cf19edd6d2fd299d7eba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm0.vchjV90MifbE6RQ2ZbQR", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "AL", "published": "2017-12-05T06:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "Senior Bowl adds 26 players for 2018 game, including 4 QBs | AL.com", "text": "The Reese's Senior Bowl on Monday officially added 26 players for the 2018 game, including four quarterbacks.

California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles and Ventura counties due to wildfires that broke out this week and quickly expanded across the region fueled by strong blowing Santa Ana winds. The largest fire, known as the Thomas Fire, erupted in Ventura County northwest of downtown Los Angeles has engulfed 65,000 acres and destroyed hundreds of homes, threatened 12,000 structures and forced 27,000 people to evacuate, officials said. Fire officials are reportedly battling a new blaze that threatens the city of Los Angeles, including the historic Getty Center. Late Tuesday, Governor Jerry Brown declared states of emergency in Los Angeles and Ventura counties due to the fires, and his office said the blazes threatened thousands of homes. \"It's critical residents stay ready and evacuate immediately if told to do so,\" Brown said in a statement. So far, officials have not announced any deaths due to the fires. Three firefighters in Los Angeles were injured and taken to a hospital, all in stable condition, according to local officials who did not elaborate on their injuries. A battalion chief in Ventura was injured in a traffic accident and was expected to recover. The coming days could continue to present new risks of additional wildfires, authorities warned. Charlie Beck, the Los Angeles police chief, said the region was facing \"a multiday event,\" adding: \"This will not be the only fire.\" (end) hy.ibi \nMENAFN0712201700710000ID1096199827", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie beck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerry brown", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuna", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kuwait", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern california   washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa ana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:06.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "701fc515cafd1cbe68e6a0a92d95cf2aaeaf6e2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9pZjbkz0yttu0HCHKIvYECDTrZKKvhJ4MHuS20rj9vlb2M324Ekg9djJU4Jm470o-", "site_full": "mybroadband.co.za", "site": "mybroadband.co.za", "site_section": "https://mygaming.co.za/forum/forumdisplay.php/82-MyBroadband-Broadband-Internet-gadget-and-technology-discussions", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "MyBroadband", "title": "Looking for a decent dual sim phone", "title_full": "Looking for a decent dual sim phone", "published": "2017-12-07T05:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://mybroadband.co.za/vb/images/misc/facebook_share.jpg?v=1.1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5974, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5d734127860b00abc597be26aafc135aedb7ecd7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9pZjbkz0yttu0HCHKIvYECDTrZKKvhJ4MHuS20rj9vlb2M324Ekg9sabyKl5xP_O.y9HTq1QIIXj2CKGHG43l", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "jnvdh06", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Originally Posted by Sumen Hi, the Mate 10 is actually shorter and narrower than your iPhone 7 Plus\nhttps://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php...&idPhone2=8854 Ja I noticed.

The collections from the brand are a combination of style and substance, drawn from Hrithik Roshan and his lifelong dedication to achieve the fittest version of himself. The brand from the year of its establishment has not only diversified its products offering (sports shoes, men\u2019s joggers, t-shirts, backpacks and select womenswear, joggers, sports bras, t-shirts) but has also used different marketing mediums to promote itself. HRX is currently valued at INR 150 Cr. and in an exclusive conversation with Afsar Zaidi, Co-Founder, and CEO, HRX we at EVENTFAQS decode the relevance of experiential marketing for the brand. How was the idea to establish the brand HRX conceived and how did its journey begin? HRX, India's largest homegrown fitness brand was founded in 2013 by Hrithik Roshan and Exceed Entertainment. The brand was envisioned to serve as a platform for bringing like-minded people together to endorse the philosophy of becoming the best version of them. HRX aims to revolutionise the fitness scenario in India, as a value-for-money, high-quality alternative to international brands. The brand strives to provide products and services of substance, drawn from Hrithik Roshan and his lifelong dedication to achieving the fittest version of him. The brand takes off from various facets of Hrithik Roshan\u2019s lifestyle and fitness regime to create value offering for consumers in relevant categories. The brand is not present in the market through retail footprints. What has been your market strategy for it and what are the marketing tools you have used? HRX is exclusively available on India\u2019s largest e-commerce platform Myntra and it's allied portals- Jabong & Flipkart. It is the 4th largest brand in the sportswear category on Myntra. As a part of the expansion strategy, one will soon see HRX in the offline retail formats - Emerging Brand Outlets and Multi Brand Outlets across all major metros. The brand currently stands being valued close to 150 Cr. How do you plan to take the story forward? HRX is looking at investing in an enhanced retail experience through the use of technology. Product and design innovation with a continued focus on new category introductions will drive the sales. Our core focus continues to be Digital Marketing and all our marketing and communication content will serve the purpose of keeping our consumer motivated along his journey towards being the best version of himself. You have also made your presence felt on-ground through association with sporting properties like ISL. How have these helped the brand? Through association with ISL, HRX garnered a lot of visibility from in-stadium branding, apparel partnership, TVC and other communication and became more ingrained in the sports ecosystem of the country. After cricket, football is the second most invested sports in the country and being a part of this league gave a fillip to the brand. What is the yearly marketing budgeting for HRX and how do you allocate it to different marketing mediums? It is usually kept comparable with the monies incurred by other e-commerce platforms on this category to ensure we have enough for new customer acquisition, the visibility that translates into sales and sufficient buzz during the big events and campaigns. Does the brand thrive on experiential marketing campaigns? At HRX we tap into every possible group of engaging audience. We are building a strong association with the running community by partnering with the marathon franchises in our country. HRX provides a live experience through pop-ups at these marathon expos, it helps in extending the live HRX experience to a captive audience that is willing to be engaged. Hrithik Roshan himself is a huge inspiration and along with him, we have tried to include people at every stage of the fitness curve in our campaigns. The idea is to show that whether you're just starting out or are an expert, we all go through the same struggles and the way to overcome them is by simply taking small steps forward. Our Influencer program is undoubtedly the most organic today. Thoughtful customisation, a great in hand experience and a good outreach gets us responses, which unlike others are unpaid and most genuine. Any upcoming brand campaign in the pipeline? We are working on the next one but at this point, it\u2019s hard to reveal the concept. However, this is going to be one of its kind! HRX is currently valued at INR 150 Cr. and in an exclusive conversation with Afsar Zaidi, Co-Founder, and CEO, HRX, EVENTFAQS decodes the marketing strategy for this homegrown brand.

Winner of multiple awards, the multi-tasker who balances multiple roles as an Anchor, Moderator, Writer, Content Curator, Actor runs EVENTFAQS through her journey and her passion for talk. The industry has quickly evolved over the past decade. How have you, as an anchor, kept ahead of the times? For any category of artists to be under the spotlight, the attention of the target audience needs to be repeatedly captured and in the right manner. From the way anchors engage on stage, how they present themselves, their personalities, how they market their brands and run their business, every aspect stands transformed for the better. One can safely say that anchors in India, in general, have raised the bar. A few years back it had shifted to being a largely cosmetic function, but now is back in the reckoning as a frontline function on an event. What is one of the biggest challenges for an anchor? Anchors need to focus harder on their core job and much harder on the content they are expected to deliver. An anchor is not only expected to deliver on stage but has to be multi-tasking, ensuring every aspect right from content creation to content delivery is beyond expectations. Great expectations call for great delivery. If that does not happen now, a great opportunity will be lost. Have we come of age? No, but we are close, very close. What is the thumb rule you bear in mind while engaging with a LIVE audience? The LIVE audience wants to be arrested by a baritone voice, to be commanded by content that arrests their attention, they want their intelligence to be respected, they want to be enraptured. Now, whether a celebrity anchor does that or a professional anchor does that, believe me, they truly do not care.Anchoring is one category that is about calibre not physicality or celebrity status. There are many professional anchors who do not deliver; there are many celebrity anchors who rule the stage with their talk. It has to be about the job at hand. The rest of the fluff-baggage does not matter when the audience is listening to you. They are the judge and the jury. It is time we take the audiences a little more seriously. Is there any mantra you follow while taking up an assignment? I am only taking up the best or the most interesting work coming my way. I\u2019d rather sit at home than invest my time towards events that do not understand the value-add that an anchor can bring to the table. Also, I have expanded my core team. I can no longer deliver good quality work being a one woman army. My thought process is very clear, I will either deliver good work or I will do no work at all. Volumes have never attracted me. Tell us about your best work this year. The most important thing I feel I have achieved this year is the balance between different genres of events. I have been roped in for critical government events, for prestigious PSU events, for some of the biggest weddings of the season and many key, flagship summits. As an artist, I feel very satisfied. To defy the image stereotype has always been a key goal for me. From The International Children\u2019s Film Festival to the EFactor4U wedding in Jaipur to IDC, Insights to WOW Awards Asia to the EEMAGINE International Summit, IIFCO Golden Jubilee Celebrations, Sufi Route Concert, Indian Army Infantry Day Celebration, Jagran Film Festival, TATA Motors Annual Meet, Tomorrow\u2019s India Global Summit, Hotelier Awards, Eazy Diner Foodie Awards to the Ironation Nutrition Series, it has been a wholesome mix of top quality events that have come my way. I have also gone back to acting in commercials. I shot for four this year - not a great number, but a start - given the limited amount of time I get apart from executing events. I was also pampered with two awards this year. I once again thank EEMA and the jury for the EEMAX Spotlight Best Anchor Female India. But now, it is time to think ahead. What are your plans for the near future? To take this generous gift of opportunities and expectations on a solid journey. I have some very interesting plans for 2018. Let us see how much I can push myself. I am going to take a month off soon, to think, ruminate, and explore the ideas in my head. I want to write a book and structure my career as a motivational speaker. I also see myself giving back to the industry through an organisation that may curate or nurture talent for talk, but let\u2019s see. And, I will continue to talk the stage till I want to. If there is anything I am sure of, it is the feeling that I have a very long and interesting innings ahead of me, as an anchor, not just in India but probably elsewhere too. Your thoughts on our new initiative, Live Quotient Handpicked Artists of India... Firstly, I\u2019d like to thank EVENTFAQS for this initiative. Also, what was special was that I was the first Live Quotient Handpicked Artist to be showcased in this new initiative. Artists are the main element of any event. A showcase of the best available in the Indian live industry will not only benefit artists but also be of solid use to the experiential community. I am looking forward to another set, maybe a master class set curated by industry leaders... You are a part of EEMA. Which according to you is the most important initiative that you would want to support? I think team EEMA\u2019s top priority needs to be to drive membership across the country, which I think it is. Alongside, brand EEMA needs to be nurtured at a national level. EEMA We Care needs to be adopted by the industry in much larger numbers. There is a genuine enthusiasm amongst the working team, thanks to Sabbas Joseph\u2019s leadership. The future too, looks bright. \nThe multi-tasker Anchor, Moderator, Writer, Content Curator, Actor talks about her journey and the way she elevates any event to a new level.

Col. Deo Akiiki, deputy spokesman for the Ugandan military, said Thursday that 281 troops will leave Somalia by Dec. 31. \nAkiiki said that under an agreement between the African Union and the U.N. Security Council the number of all African peacekeepers in Somalia will be reduced by 1,000 before the end of 2017. \nUganda has over 6,000 troops deployed in Somalia as part of the multi-national African Union force.

Long", "text": "Buy Link: Amazon Following the same routine, day in and day out, Charlie Winters was about to give up on getting the break she deserved. Things begin to look up when her brother Nick suggested she to come to New York to work at his landscaping company. Moving from the small town of Cedar Grove to the big Apple was everything Charlie dreamed of, until her brother witnessed a brutal murder, which put his life in danger. Charlie would do everything she could to protect him even if it meant contacting the boy she fell in love with as a teenager. Leaving the only girl, he had ever loved, the last thing Ryan Hyatt expected was to run into her, especially in Manhattan. Regretting his decision to push her away after he had enlisted in the military, he tried to make it up to her by offering to protect her brother Nick. When tragedy stuck, he soon found that his brother Josh may have been involved. Ryan would stop at nothing to protect the woman he would never stopped loving. EXCERPT Walking over to her, I placed my hand on her flushed cheek and lowered my lips to hers. At first, there was a slight hesitation, but once I dipped my tongue inside the warmth of her mouth, her tongue began to dance with mine. I could feel the vibration of small whimpers escape as I continued my play. Charlie\u2019s arms wrapped around my neck, allowing me to kiss her even deeper. Trailing my hands down her back, I found her butt and cupped her firm cheeks. Just the feel of her this close was making my cock jump with excitement. When I lifted her by the waist, her legs enveloped mine as I carried her over to the small couch that was pushed up against the wall. Even though this wasn\u2019t the way that I imagined our reunion would be, it really didn\u2019t matter because all I knew was that I needed her and my cock longed to be deep inside her. Placing her gently on the couch, I took a moment to absorb her beauty. Her eyes fluttered shut as I traced the outline of her lips before I swept inside her warmth. Her tongue mingled with mine and our exploration of each other began. Charlie\u2019s body told me she was eager for my touch. Slipping my hand underneath her thin t-shirt, I worked it upward until I reached her firm breast. Lowering the cup of her bra, I could feel the warmth and softness of her breast as I fondled the pea-sized bud between my fingers. Bracing my body above hers with the other hand, I managed to find the clasp of her bra. \u201cGod, how I loved the person that created front clasps on bras,\u201d I smiled to myself. Just the feel of her skin under my touch left me needing more. All I wanted was to consume the beauty that was hidden beneath the thin material. With one leg planted on the floor and the other bent between her legs, I grasped the hem of her t-shirt and in one movement pushed it upward, freeing her shirt and her bra from her body at the same time. When her luscious breasts came into view, they were as I remembered, only more beautiful. \u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d I whispered as I lowered my lips to the small bud, nuzzling her breast as I savagely began licking and sucking the tip. Charlie\u2019s moans of pleasure sounded and it triggered my cock to become increasingly more uncomfortable locked away in my jeans. I moved back slightly, resting my upper leg on my butt while gliding my hand down her silky skin, stopping purposely at the waistband of her shorts. With one flick of my wrist the button was undone and the zipper began sliding down as I moved my hand beneath her pretty yellow panties. I could feel the soft curls of her pubic hair as I worked my hand further down. At first I was unable to get where I needed with the restriction of her shorts, and then her butt lifted from the couch, allowing me to easily remove her shorts and take her panties with them. With her body completely displayed before me, she was even more beautiful than I could ever have imagined. Lowering my body, I trailed light kisses down her body to the apex of her sex. Her womanly scent overflowed as I moved to her folds, which were wet with desire. Lapping up her sweet honey, I could feel her hips move, keeping in rhythm to my play. Something intense flared through my body, reacting to her moans of satisfaction as her body gave way. Exposing my own desire for her, I freed my cock from its confines, encased it with latex, and slowly entered her with gentle, even thrusts. I could feel her body light with pleasure as it clenched around me, coaxing me towards my own release. What had taken me so long to find was finally delivered, sending my body in an upward spiral to heaven and back. Never was I going to let her go again. About the Author Award winning Author of the Independent Press Award and NYC Big Book Award. My love for writing began several years ago after an early retirement from a demanding job that I loved, but also hated because it consumed so much of my time. Now, I am able to focus my time on what I love. Writing romance has been a life long dream and to actually say that I am a published author is beyond what I would have ever expected. Even though some may say I have a little naughtiness in my books, I look at it as an added bonus for my readers. After all what is a romance book without a little spice. When I am not writing, I enjoy spending time with friends either at home or out on the town. Mostly, I enjoy a relaxing night at home where I can enjoy a glass of wine in the company of a good book.

This week the Seminoles sent a letter to top legislators regarding pending bills that would declare fantasy sports legal and not subject to regulation. A Senate committee is scheduled to take up one of the bills (SB 374) on Thursday. \nThe letter contends the legislation would violate the deal that allows the tribe to offer blackjack as well as slot machines at several locations. \nFlorida's attorney general in 1991 issued an opinion saying football fantasy leagues were a form of illegal gambling. But fantasy leagues have continued to expand since then.

Brayden works with Ariel to help her control her magic but discovers she's a High Witch - one of only three witches in the world with a rare kind of power. Immediately the two must flee; evil warlock Julius wants to enslave Ariel - mind, heart and body. Julius and his lover the High Witch Nadia will stop at nothing to capture Ariel, and the danger threatens to tear Ariel apart from Brayden.

Her blonde hair flowed down her shoulders, soft, silky. She curled her fingers around the hair at the nape of his neck, and brought her mouth close to his. His heart beat erratically in anticipation of the moment their lips would touch. He shut his eyes, then felt the softest, sweetest sensation of his life. He tasted her sweet lips, shuddered as her tongue played with his. He wrapped his arms around her waist, holding her closely, tightly. His entire body quivered as it was pressed against hers. She began to pull away. He held her to him. She broke the kiss. She looked at him with sadness in her eyes. He could feel it \u2014 she was leaving. He felt like she\u2019d left him a thousand times before. That they were endlessly reliving this moment. He tried to hold onto her, but she turned and began to fade from view. He grasped at her disappearing figure, but his hands clutched air. She was gone. He stood there, sorrow consuming him. Then the faint sounds of bells twinkling, and her soft, sweet voice. Find me. Witch Emerging High Witch, Book 2 After surviving being hunted by Julius, Brayden and Ariel settle into their married life. Ariel is determined to find the other High Witches to make sure they\u2019re alright. But there\u2019s something going on with her pregnancy, something unusual, and she needs to find out what. In the meantime, Hallie, an eighteen-year-old witch, is being pursued by Nicholas, a strange young man who knows about her past. What does Nicholas want with Hallie, and how are they both connected to Ariel? And what about Sean, the man Hallie loves? Will they end up together, or will Nicholas\u2019 plan hurt all of them?
