It got out of control after dealing with too much family problems, money problems, mom having a surgery, being gay with strictly catholic parents and in the closet, and finally one of my childhood friends dying in a car accident. Anxiety spiraled out of control from hyperventilation, muscle cramps, stiffness, dry mouth, fidgeting, pain and/or numbness in hands, neck and stomach. Alcohol was the only thing that stopped it almost instantly so soon enough I became dependent on it. This year I finally decided to see doctors and one finally prescribed medication earlier this year. It works great, I went from having a panic attack almost 3-5 times a day to rarely. I became focused on my business, took a $3k school loan and flipped it into $8k in a few months. Unfortunately my friend passed away in February, broke my heart. Then Older brother was losing everything, gave him half of my money to help him and in the end he screwed me over and I lost all my money in 2 weeks. (Eventually) Good credit destroyed, bank accounts closed, so many things in collections, car got repossessed.\nFrank\u2019s death gave me the courage to open up to my friends. Most have been very supportive and don\u2019t care that I\u2019m gay.\nI drive passed the spot where frank died and it gives me strength to move on, to get out of bed...and work. (Self employed here).\nThere were many days were I spent them crying in bed, most nights I couldn\u2019t sleep without drinking, refused to take meds...stopped going to the gym, gained so much weight and lost my sexy muscular body... found myself trapped and drowning in anxiety, having crippling depression, anger, hatred, and feeling weak. Unable to fix everything as I usually would.\nNow I work every day and work out again. I can\u2019t continue to waste this precious time that I know Frank would\u2019ve wanted digging myself in a shit hole. Frank was one of the first close friends I opened up to about most of my problems with anxiety and being gay, and he was always very supportive. Funniest guy I have met. Reading an eulogy for him was probably the hardest thing I have ever done in my life so far...\nMy anxiety is under control most of the time. His birthday would have been December 16. Convinced my older brother to get in college, get a loan and take the time to pay me. He\u2019s actually going to class. Our relationship went from Id beat the shit out of him any second, to now we work together everyday. He\u2019s barely giving me money compared to what I lost, on the course of almost 10 months, but at least I know I\u2019ll get some back very soon.\nI\u2019m finally getting my shit together. I know this new year will be wonderful.

The company I worked for didn't believe me. I went into the hospital for two weeks. I was going to be flown to a bigger hospital but I didn't want to pay for it, so they drove me (not useless info, just proves I was dire). I spent two weeks with a cyclic 106\u00b0F fever. I left the hospital and spent two weeks finishing my online college working whenever I had a little time awake, not puking, able to think, with the pain receded enough so it took me hours to do what was minutes before. I nearly destroyed myself doing it. From that action, my company said I wasn't sick so no more long term benefits, also the doctors said, well you're sick but we can't prove with what, so the government said no. Luckily, before my insurance with the company I wad employed by they hired a disability lawyer (yay union?) that got me into docs, the docs said I am sick BUT the doctor employed with my old employer still said, yeah he acts sick but I can't prove he isn't either so he's faking it because he finished college and he'd only do that if he wasn't sick.\nWithin, about 5 years, tops. I lost my job, my house, moved in with my parents, can't afford housing, can't afford doctors, owe probably around six figures to doctors that didn't do anything. I went to the Mayo clinic, out of network, per primary care physician and they said, \"Yeah, they did everything, we can't help you.\" Then sent me to a brain doc, he said the same. The Mayo visit that could've been done through phone cost $20,000 for about 15 minutes of him taking 5 minutes to say, can't help. Not sure on the head doc, still expensive. The employer that I had long term disability with called me and my doctors a liar every month, for hours, on the phone only wanting to speak to me to tell me I'm lying (seriously, that's what they said). Led to me yelling, \"You guys are the reason I'm going to put a bullet through my brain! I've shown you for over a year and through multiple doctors that I'm certifiably sick through several different legal forms and statements and you still say I'm lying. You're the reason I'm going to kill myself!\"\nMy wife stepped in, they hospitalized me, after the insurance nurse told me to go immediately. However, that insurance nurse that said to leave now didn't mean then because out was a holiday and I need special authorization to save my life. That bill that was rejected...? Somewhere around $15,000 or so. They all dropped me then, including my life insurance. So, luckily, I got disability, and that was a whole new ball of wax. I forgot to say, this all happened right as the financial system collapsed.\nTo answer this question, what happened in around a month caused a 5 year domino effect. It caused us to get our house repossessed, we didn't have equity in the years we fought to keep it, we owed about $20,000 more than it was worth. I lost over half my income and gained probably over six figures in medical debt. I had to move to another state. I can't work a full time job, not even part time, so I've gained tons of weight. I'm currently, always suicidal. Each day drains me to fight to exist. I have no way to help my kids for college. My car was broken into (so the passenger windows broken) and then completely stolen and emptied out. They took the only nice things I bought my wife in five years, both times. (I got her a tablet, she got me one. Had to do payments, they're gone and payments aren't). I hate myself, my life, my burden on my family and mostly myself. We'll be lucky to get a couple nice things for the kids this year. They say they don't mind but I see the sadness over, lol, not electronics. Over no nice shoes, or boots, or jacket, or a suit, the boys want a suit. Nicest thing they've asked for? A couple older video games.\nGlad I've got birthday money, spend it on Christmas. Ticks my wife off, done it for over ten years. Oh yeah, been sick over ten years, petrified that one day a random guy will say he can't prove I'm not sick but he can't prove I am so we lose my disability. That, or Trumps tax cuts will lead to me losing the food my kids eat. We get by, I want to die and in a few short years I went ass up in health, buried in debt, useless in life and hopeless forever.\nOh great, gotta try to sleep, the urge to suck on an exhaust pipe is too strong, hope I forget it tomorrow, lol!\nTLDR; OP is a whiny cry baby loser that doesn't deserve the read.

Become a cab driver: \u2013 There is usually an increase in movement at Christmas period. You can either do inter/intra-state cab transport. Both men and women can engage in this business. Its no longer a strange thing seeing women as taxi drivers. Pick people up, take them to their location, and get paid. There are lots of people earning good money from doing that. \nDangote Emerges Only African In Bloomberg 50 List Of 2017 Most Influential People \n4. Design and sell Christmas Cards: When Christmas is near, people buy and exchange Christmas greeting cards with their friends, relatives, and customers. This explains the reason why the demand for Christmas cards start booming anytime from 1st December . So, If you are a creative artist, you can design beautiful greeting cards and put them up for sale. You can design them either by hand or with a computer. Either ways, there\u2019s money to be made. If you don\u2019t have the required artistic creativity, you can buy greeting cards in wholesale quantities and sell them. Believe me, not everybody has the time to go buy a card at a store or mall. So take the chance. \n\n5. Sell your unused items: If you look around your home\u2014your closet, garage, bookshelf, and everywhere else\u2014chances are that you will find loads of items you no longer need, but are still in very good conditions. \nGuess what? There are many people out there who need those items badly and are ready to buy them from you at mind-blowing costs. You might think those items are worthless and would sell for crumbs, but that\u2019s because you no longer need them. Those who need them value them much more than you do. You can also find buyers for your used, electronics, furniture, and other items online markets. This will fetch you some extra cash for the season. \n6. Catering Services: One of the most time consuming activities during Christmas is having to cook, but if cooking is your passion, you could offer catering services so that hosts can enjoy more time with their guests instead of being in the kitchen. Many Christmas parties are held well ahead of Christmas Day, so you can have your advertising sorted out now giving ample time for people to book your catering services. You could organize tasting sessions where people can sample your food before they decide on a menu for their parties. \nGoodLuck!!!

Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box - although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action. \n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" \nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. \nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" \nTrump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \n\"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\"   Can't Find Something? 5545 Highway 93, Eau Claire, WI 54701 (715) 835-1881", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron david miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garrison keillor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilan goldenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catherine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eau claire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill galston", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for a new american security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east security program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faith and freedom coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mpr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver international airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:52:51.018+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15105055, "moreResultsAvailable": 15104955, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512640371018&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 415}
