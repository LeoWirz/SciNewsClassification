Symbiont currently has two projects where the buy-side is involved: a syndicated loans initiative where it has partnered with 19 financial institutions including four buy-side firms, and a distributed ledger program with the state of Delaware known as the Delaware Blockchain Initiative. . \nCaitlin Long, Symbiont president and chairman, says the buy side is attracted to projects that level the playing field. \u201cI think we offer a truly decentralized platform where there are no gatekeepers,\u201d says Long. \u201cThe buy side is attracted because a lot of the technology they use, say for syndicated loans, are prescribed by the originators of the financial instrument, the sell-side. They don\u2019t have much choice in which technologies to use. But with distributed ledger , it\u2019s an even playing field.\u201d \nShe adds that some distributed-ledger projects often have \u201csupernodes\u201d or assigned gatekeeper roles to sell-side institutions, but the projects Symbiont so far has initiated do not feature such nodes. The firm recently upgraded the multi-layer privacy feature of the syndicated loans blockchain project. It partnered with Credit Suisse and R3 for the proof-of-concept. Long says it was done to ensure that buy-side firms are able to hide their identities in transactions yet be transparent to regulators. She adds that stability enhancements to the platform were also added in order to be able to meet Credit Suisse\u2019s go live date of 2018. The project was first announced in September 2016 and the proof-of-concept was deemed a success in March. \u201cIt\u2019s been our goal to provide value to the buy side and be the premiere distributed-ledger provider,\u201d says Long. \nSpeaking broadly about distributed-ledger technology, Long feels the hype cycle has moved ahead of reality, so people might see a slowdown in projects being launched and may even see some shelved. But this does not mean that these blockchain experiments have failed, just that the technology is now in the evaluation phase before being scaling up. \u201cEnterprise blockchain has to go through a high due diligence so there is a perceived slowdown. It\u2019s easier to do a science project than to get it out so that\u2019s where enterprise blockchain is now,\u201d she says. \u201cAll the hype has gone to initial coin offerings but that\u2019s really because people are in the process of evaluating current projects, particularly since these are regulated markets. It just takes time to implement.\u201d Tweet", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "caitlin long", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "long", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "credit suisse", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "delaware", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:35.041+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "342f7e6e7c9355b3eb99d1580e9fd7c687df0545", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS28CfmYeJcRgzxX4E8ROcuo_ys8xZe1MFQmhBUfE7Dt7ehaQq1.wFV.HREmy4SKSvovm3qfWOh3Mf9Y4RDvTE5F29DjLTMoAvTSiyCB6W1utRzrNgccXsQA--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Makeup Addiction", "title": "How do y'all afford all of this makeup ?", "title_full": "How do y'all afford all of this makeup ? : MakeupAddiction", "published": "2017-12-06T20:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 74, "participants_count": 58, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3c3dfef786a41be79d17cd124a8e4f1c7482933d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS28CfmYeJcRgzxX4E8ROcuo_ys8xZe1MFQmhBUfE7Dt7ehaQq1.wFV.HREmy4SKSvovm3qfWOh3Mf9Y4RDvTE5F29DjLTMoAvTSiyCB6W1utt5xjdeq.WfW6YB1QpfMRMMjr1jeF5maQ-", "ord_in_thread": 54, "author": "heemie", "published": "2017-12-07T03:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I feel like if you are a makeup addict, you do not have to get everything that is released because you probably have it already, or know what works for your skin so you don't get it.I don't buy everything.

Last year it was UBS Delta\u2014now bedded down in the StatPro stable\u2014who joined the list of past winners of this category, which includes Advent Software (now part of SS&C Technologies), Charles River Development, Eze Software Group, Fidessa, Algorithmics (now part of IBM ), and last year\u2019s recipient, RIMES Technologies. FactSet is now part of that exclusive club, thanks to wins in two individual categories\u2014best performance measurement and attribution product and best data analytics tool\u2014and strong showings in three others: best client reporting platform, thanks to its Vermilion offering, best implementation at a buy side firm, and best data provider to the buy side. \nIt\u2019s fair to say that FactSet has had a busy last 12 months. On December 20 last year, it announced that it had acquired Vermilion Software\u2014the last-standing independent client reporting specialist focusing on the buy side after SimCorp snapped up Equipos in February 2014\u2014although its most noteworthy move of the last year came some three months later when it acquired performance measurement and attribution specialist BISAM , a firm that has dominated the performance category in these awards for the past decade. Then, just a fortnight later it announced that it had acquired the Interactive Data Managed Solutions business from Intercontinental Exchange ( ICE ). Not bad for four-month spending spree. \nIn the final reckoning, however, FactSet didn\u2019t have it all its own way: SimCorp won four individual categories in this year\u2019s awards, but it was FactSet\u2019s strong showing in the three categories that it didn\u2019t quite manage to win that swung the vote in the end. Make no mistake, FactSet\u2019s acquisition of BISAM is huge move \u2014 BISAM has an impressive buy-side pedigree, underlined by its enviable client list and retention record, factors that the parent company will no doubt seek to capitalize on. Add to that Vermilion\u2019s highly thought-of Vermilion Reporting Suite and you have the makings of a highly effective buy-side middle-office provider, and one that deserves this year\u2019s highest profile award.

In my 20s and 30s, I went years without hardly ever wearing makeup. By the time I was 36, the products I had were old and could fit into a small makeup bag. When I got married, I decided to refresh my collection and do my own makeup for the wedding. I went a little overboard (for me) on buying products (all cruelty free and drugstore), but have since downsized considerably. I now know what types of looks I like (i.e., mostly warm neutrals), and have more than enough products to enjoy. It's fun to look at new things coming out, but the last thing I need is more warm-toned eyeshadows in my life, so I'm really not tempted to buy any of it. My advice - DO NOT go crazy trying to keep up with all the hyped releases. Don't buy a lot of palettes at first. Do your research, maybe get one or two, and discover what you like and then build your collection only as your technique and knowledge improves and your budget allows. Makeup should be fun -- not a source of financial stress and debt.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:38.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "342f7e6e7c9355b3eb99d1580e9fd7c687df0545", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS28CfmYeJcRgzxX4E8ROcuo_ys8xZe1MFQmhBUfE7Dt7ehaQq1.wFV.HREmy4SKSvovm3qfWOh3Mf9Y4RDvTE5F29DjLTMoAvTSiyCB6W1utRzrNgccXsQA--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Makeup Addiction", "title": "How do y'all afford all of this makeup ?", "title_full": "How do y'all afford all of this makeup ? : MakeupAddiction", "published": "2017-12-06T20:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 74, "participants_count": 58, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b8e04eef4d58dd7c74a4ae071687e9cee12cda6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS28CfmYeJcRgzxX4E8ROcuo_ys8xZe1MFQmhBUfE7Dt7ehaQq1.wFV.HREmy4SKSvovm3qfWOh3Mf9Y4RDvTE5F29DjLTMoAvTSiyCB6W1utt5xjdeq.WfXMaw8TD1NXIrA8uK6whak4-", "ord_in_thread": 68, "author": "sables1", "published": "2017-12-07T06:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "And really, even if you CAN afford endless amounts of makeup, after a point it just becomes overwhelming to have that much stuff.

It\u2019s been around 34 years. That\u2019s a whole generation,\u201d Sofos said. \u201cWhen we all started going there in the 80s it was the happening place. Now the millennials are the ones driving the whole game in retail and restaurants. They\u2019ll go to boutique restaurants.\u201d \nMeanwhile, the cost of doing business in Hawaii is escalating, she said. \n\u201cThe cost to run a large restaurant is phenomenal,\u201d Sofos said. \u201cNot only has rent gone up but also the food costs and labor. In order to make a profit you have to have a smaller place.\u201d \nLong-time customers are feeling nostalgic about the impending loss. \n\u201cFor my generation, Ryan\u2019s was one of the best places for lunch and dinner. The bar was vibrant and super crowded, a sign of its popularity. You would see everyone there, from state officials to colleagues,\u201d said former TV news reporter Tina Shelton. \nShe said the restaurant was the choice spot for farewell parties for reporters and photographers leaving the business. \nAfter 30 years in news, Shelton\u2019s farewell party was held there in 2007. \n\u201cToday, I wanted to take my young (in their 20\u2019s) colleagues to lunch after a tough project. They had never been to Ryan\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were taking photos of their food, naturally\u2014millennials.

December 06, 2017 02:55 PM UPDATED December 06, 2017 02:56 PM LITTLE ROCK, Ark. \nMore than a dozen Arkansas residents headed to a rally in Washington, D.C., in support of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protected immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children and which President Donald Trump canceled earlier this year. \nThe group of residents left Little Rock on Tuesday. Officials with the organizing groups United We Dream and the Fair Immigration Reform Movement say they expect up to 17,000 people to attend Wednesday's rally, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported . \n\"For us, this is the moment,\" said Adrian Reyna, a member of United We Dream. \nTrump canceled the 5-year-old program that allows nearly 800,000 immigrants living in the country illegally who were brought as children to remain here. The program provides temporary protection from deportation and permission to legally work. Never miss a local story. Sign up today for a free 30 day free trial of unlimited digital access. SUBSCRIBE NOW \nDemonstrators are calling for passage of the Dream Act of 2017, a bipartisan bill that would restore protections, before recipients begin losing their deferred status next year. The rally comes amid negotiations on a government spending bill for which some Democratic lawmakers said they'll withhold support unless Congress passes the Dream Act of 2017. \n\"I think no matter what happens, keep fighting,\" said Humberto Marquez of Fort Smith, whose deferred status will expire in 2019. \"The presence that we'll have out on the streets, the presence that we'll have toward our congressmen will be stronger than ever.\" \nMembers of Arkansas' congressional delegation previously agreed with Trump's decision to dismantle the deferred-action program. Sen.

After that, it was another two years of beta testing with select hedge funds to finalize the service. \nThasos combines GPS data and Wi-Fi triangulation to provide real-time location data, allowing the vendor to accurately locate a cellphone user to between 1-3 meters. This accuracy is unique to Thasos because other vendors use carrier data, which is only accurate\u2014at best\u2014to approximately 30 meters, as it uses cellphone tower triangulation, which cannot accurately place a single individual in a single location. Thasos then creates reports for hedge funds thirsty for this new form of alternative data. \nJohn Collins, chief product officer at Thasos, says that two key changes have transpired to help make this service more viable. First, cellphone users are more comfortable with the notion of companies collecting this kind of information. For the Thasos product, the individual\u2019s identity is protected as the data is anonymized and aggregated. Second, Thasos uses Amazon Web Service\u2019s cloud to store and crunch these massive datasets. \u201c AWS gives [users] a large number of machines that allow us to compute on 5 terabytes\u2014per day\u2014of raw data, which is a massive number,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving a cost-effective solution that not only allows our data sources to push data directly to our cloud, but also allows us to push our products directly to our clients through the same cloud\u2014well that becomes really efficient.\u201d \nThe ability to use technology to accurately pinpoint individuals, combined with the ability to ingest and drill down into these massive datasets to provide information supporting hedge funds\u2019 trading decisions is why Thasos is both the BST Awards newcomer and product of the year winner. We expect big things from this company for years to come.

You fix fights\nto maneuver a fighter up the ranks toward a championship fight.\nYou fix fights to win\nin order\nagain to position someone strategically.\nYou fix fights to lose in\norder to get paid and in order to make - you know - betting coups.\nThe way you fix fights\nvaries greatly.\nYou fix fights by buying judges.\nThat's... you know... that's one easy way to do it. You fix fights by having the referee working for you, so that\nif there's any way that the ref can stop a fight in your guy's favor, he does.\nYou fix fights by colluding with the fighters, generally the loser. It's al... it's almost always the loser.\nWinners almost never know that the fight is fixed.\nOne of the things that you're cognizant of when you are fixing fights is\nthat you're doing something illegal.\nSomething that theoretically can wind you up - you know -\nwind you in jail and get people angry at you. So you never really say anything?\nYou know, nothing that's culpable.\nSo there's a code and\nif you're in boxing for a while, you know the code everybody knows the code.\nYou will go into a gym\nwhere there's either a trainer or manager and you're looking for somebody\nyour guy can beat.

Nobody's done anything where they've come out and stated anything explicitly.\nBut that's a done deal, and you get... you get what you pay for.\nCan you say how many fights you've fixed?\nHundreds. How many I'm not sure, but hundreds.\nI see it all the time now, I mean, I don't make our living in boxing anymore.\nBut I see fixes all the time, sure. It will always exist, it always has.\nAlright fans, here we go with our main event of the evening\nwith over 90 countries in six continents tuning in. It's Showtime!\nVegas I think tends toward the sensational.\nIrish hurricane Peter McNeeley!\nKeep laughing, keep laughing.\nReal funny huh?\nIf you go... if anyone of you\ndoesn't respect me or what I'm doing or what I've been doing for the last three months\nsince I been asked... and going against a guy like this,\nyou'd have a big dump in your pants.\nI'm hurricane Peter McNeeley from Medfield, Mass, (Massachusetts). On Saturday night, watch me kick Tyson's ass.\nBut if you haven't made your pay for view arrangements yet, make them soon because remember what happens when I wrap you in my cocoon.\"\nMcNeeley's manager was a guy named Vin Vecchione.\nVecchione had no money,\nso I... for a while was bankrolling what they were doing. I was bringing McNeeley sometimes and Vecchione to New York.\nFor various... you know and I was making fights for Peter,\nso I mean I knew them very well, and I was very involved in what was going on.\nSo I bring Vecchione to Al Bravermans office, who was Don Kings Director of Boxing. And we worked out a deal.\nfor McNeeley to be Tyson's first opponent which is a completely win-win situation for everybody.\"\nI'm just happy to be here, everybody's made their statements.\nMr McNeeley had a cute statement,\nI'm just ready to fight. Thank you everyone for your support. Thank you.\nAnd I get a phone call\nfrom a guy whose voice I recognised but not somebody I really know.\nAnd he said, look, somebody\nthought I should give you a call, to let you know that a bet got made,\nThat the fight wouldn't\nYeah, I'm trying to remember how he described...\nI think he told me, the fight won't go... it's... it's not gonna go 90 seconds.\nIt was you know it was a million dollar bet and the fights not gonna go 90 seconds. Somebody thought,\nyou might be interested in that.\n89 seconds at which point Vin Vecchione steps\nbetween the ropes to prop the ending to the fight\nVecchione who really had this thing figured out, understood that\nit was crucial that\nthere be no finding of impropriety\nbecause Tyson was the machine\non which boxing ran.\nBy far the biggest earner in the world and...\nYou know when he fights in Vegas\nthey generate a billion dollars in added revenue. I mean not from boxing per se but you know from all of the ancillary revenue.\nSo it has to be okay?\nAnd Vecchione knows that.\nSo he gets his payday, whatever it is, and I don't know what it is. I never did know what it was,\nand I get a phone call from from him\nand I'm still in Puerto Rico because... you got to come to the house\nI got to see you, and I said I can't do it. I'm I'm still out of the country and he says:\nSend somebody you trust.\nAnd... when that somebody got there\nHe was given an envelope, and that envelope\nput my son through college.\nI got hit. You know I got knocked down\nThe man's quick, he hits hard.\nfelt like the first knockdown was a good quick punch;\non my part it was a little bit of a flash knockdown but I was OK.\nThe second knockdown, as the film will show, I was shaky and I slipped and I fell on the rope,\nand I twisted part of my knee, and-hey,\nyou see the film, look at the film, my knee buckled without even getting hit-look at the film.\nImagine that you're up against a very well-placed\nhigh profile\nmachine that is capitalized\nto a degree that you can't even begin to imagine a billion-dollar multibillion-dollar industry.\nSo this guy was nothing, except for his brain and his nerve.\nAnd I'm thinking okay,\nI know now he's got 90 seconds to make his move and\nthere has to be a plausible reason to do it. You can't just\nwalk into the ring, so you've got to watch this thing and you have to figure out\nWhen can I do this?\nAnybody who's got the kind of nerve\nfrom that background dealing with what is on the other side,\nyou know, the establishment side,\nto wait until one second\nto step in.\nIf you don't admire that I don't know that yeah you see things that I don't because to me\nthat is the greatest single underdog score that...\nthat I've ever seen in all of my years in boxing. You know the single\nmost savvy maneuver that I've ever seen.\nIf you're in the boxing business, if you're doing it worldwide\nyou're going to run into gangsters, it's always been a sport that's had a lot of criminal activity, the Russian mob and the Mafia.\nBoth fractions figured out that I really didn't know my way around the game a lot\nunderstood a lot about boxing and so I wound up making some fights for\nmob guys of both both stripes...\nand fixing some fights for some people but\nthere were problems, that... that showed up some things didn't go our way. Some bad things happened.\nWell obviously, they didn't send somebody I mean, they didn't send somebody to kill me because, here I am.\nI got a phone call from somebody I knew,\nwho said that I'd better take care of things I'd better iron out this problem\nIf I don't hear from you in two weeks, we'll have to\nresolve this in a different way.\nI really hope that we can resolve this the right way.\nI mean if I have to take it just for the ... we can discuss the... it is entirely up to you.\nSo I brokered a deal that allowed me to get out.\nFor more infomation >> Ex-Boxing Manager Reveals How Boxing Matches Are Fixed - Duration: 12:56. \nDota 2 \u041b\u044e\u0442\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430 | Ursa | 7.07 | - Duration: 37:09.

Opening in 2012, he oversees daily operations of the\npharmacy working with patients, health care providers, and business\nleaders, he has established a network that continues to expand and identify\nthe needs of his community. Educating physicians, nurses, and others on drug\ntherapy, providing free medication delivery service, and home visits for\nmedication therapy management and compounding for both humans and animals\ninclude some of the services offered to better reach the underserved populations\nthat he does serve. As secretary for the Pevely Lions Club and a volunteer in the\ncommunity, Dr. Wang assists the visually impaired in obtaining eyeglasses,\nperforms presentations at local schools and nursing homes and participates in\nvarious public health screenings in community centers, health fairs, and\nschools. He's also a member of the National Community Pharmacists Association, the Missouri\nPharmacy Association, association of American Pharmacists Association,\nPharmacy Eldercare Coalition, and is a preceptor and on the Preceptor Advisory\nCouncil here at the college. He has conducted research for the\ncollege's collaborative research project on COPD. His favorite memories as a\nstudent outside of class and student organizations were getting together with\nfriends for pickup games of basketball and exploring St. Louis. Please join me\nin congratulating Dr. Jason Wang, the class of 2011, as a recipient of the\nDedicated Service Award.\nThank you. It is such an honor to be here today. Thank you to the Alumni Association\nfor recognizing me for this award and I would just like to start off by saying thank you to the college\nas a whole because it is this college that has given me the tools and foundation to do what I do today.\nI would also like to thank Rebecca Jones that is here in the audience for giving me the opportunity as an orientation leader to gain new perspectives on leadership as well as communicating with others. I would also like to thank Dr. Nicole\nGattas who is also here today for really inspiring me and igniting my passion for patient\ncounseling through her involvement with the American Pharmacists Association.\nI would like to thank Dr. Ken Schafermeyer, who is also here today, for really\nguiding me on my path towards entrepreneurship and business through his\ninvolvement with the National Community Pharmacists Association. I would like to\nthank my business partners, Jerry Callahan and Bill Jehling, who continue to\nmentor me as we continue to grow our business. And most importantly, I would like to thank my\nwife, Jamie, who is here today...for putting up with me and supporting me both\nemotionally and financially \u2013 especially the year after we graduated and we decided to use a\nlot of our money to open up a brand new pharmacy. This award means a lot to\nme. Inherent in our profession \u2013 the profession of pharmacy is this idea of\nservice. In our oath, the Oath of a Pharmacist, we say \"I promise to devote myself to a\nlifetime of service to others through the profession of pharmacy.\" I was privileged\nenough to be part of the STLCOP community and it is their service to\ntheir community that has allowed me to be shaped and molded into who I am today.\nNow, the nature of community pharmacy, I'm sorry, the nature of community service\nis very cyclical and starts with one person. And when that one person reaches out and\nthey touch the lives of others, they in turn give back. And as this cycle continues, it\nbegins to grow and to expand. It is my hope today that I can inspire others to do the same and\nstart that cycle or continue the growth of that cycle \u2026 and together united,\nI think we will be able to elevate our profession to the next level and\nmake a big difference in our communities.

Chromatography is an essential technique for life science research, agriculture, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry. Chromatography technique isolates the mixture into two phases specifically mobile phase and stationary phase. The mobile phase travels through the stationary phase by taking compound to be tested with it. At different points in the stationary phase the different components of the compound get absorbed and stop moving with the mobile phase. Over 60% of analysis worldwide is currently done by chromatography technique. Chromatography has a number of advantages over older separation technique such as solvent extraction, distillation, and crystallization.\nRequest Free Sample Report @ https://www.zionmarketresearch.com/sample/chromatography-systems-market \nIncreased importance of chromatography in pharmaceuticals, laboratories, forensic labs is a major driving factor for the chromatography systems market .

Johnny Hallyday, France's biggest rock star for more than half a century and an icon who packed sports stadiums and all but lit up the Eiffel Tower with his high-energy concerts at the foot of the Paris landmark, died early Wednesday. He was 74. Bob Edme AP Photo Rocker Hallyday idolized in native France, obscure elsewhere By ELAINE GANLEY Associated Press December 06, 2017 01:17 PM UPDATED December 06, 2017 01:18 PM PARIS \nWhen French TV crews descended on a Los Angeles hospital in 2009, American reporters didn't get it. Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized. Who's he? Only a rock music idol and legend, a man France's president would eulogize Wednesday as \"a French hero.\" \nHallyday, known simply as Johnny, made generations of fans in his native France squeal, jump and jive with his dazzling dress, pumping pelvis and tunes by American artists belted out in French. His death at age 74 was a loss even for younger people who might have found his Elvis Presley-inspired act passe. \nBut the beloved rocker's stardom mostly remained confined to France. Media outlets in the U.S. reported Wednesday on the \"Johnny\" phenomenon that endured for more than half a century. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron a fan and offstage acquaintance of Hallyday's, offered a lyrical on-the-spot tribute while visiting Algiers for talks on fighting terrorism.

He is among these men who should have died 100 times because of their lifestyle, because of their overindulgence, because of their battles,\" Macron, 39, said \"But he never fell.\" \nHallyday had been treated for lung cancer and repeated health scares in the years before he died, but performed as recently as the summer. \nMacron wasn't the only French politician to talk Johnny while on state business. Nicolas Sarkozy called the Hallyday family during a European Union Summit in 2009 to get updates on the singer's condition \u2014 at the time an infected herniated disk. \nWhy was Johnny Hallyday so loved? Was it his rugged good looks and scratchy voice? Or was it the charisma that singer Line Renaud, who helped launch his career and is known as his \"godmother,\" said \"there's no school for.\" \nFans seemed to viscerally grasp the tender side hidden under the image of a singer whose stage presence wasn't particularly French. With sparkly suits, a large cross on his bare chest and hi legs spread, he looked like an act out of Las Vegas or Hollywood. \n\"I know that happiness doesn't exist. There is but pain and solitude,\" he said in an extensive interview with the newspaper Le Monde in 1998. \"I talk about it often because I can only speak of what I know. When I say talk, it means sing.\" \nHallyday has said he never stopped grieving his absent father, a Belgian who disappeared from his life when his parents divorced before he was 1 year old. He only occasionally sang \"A Propos de Mon Pere\" (Concerning My Father), which appeared on his 1974 album and he said was about his dad. \nBorn in Paris on June 15, 1943, Hallyday stopped using his given name, Jean-Philippe Smet, when he was 16 years old and had followed his father's sisters to London. There, he met Lee Ketchman, an American singer who gave him his first electric guitar. \nHallyday covered American songs in French, from \"Johnny B. Goode\" to \"Black Is Black\" and \"Roll Over Beethoven.\" He sang the \"The House of the Rising Sun\" in English \u2014 the melody of which was also used for one of his most famous songs, the 1964 \"Le Penitencier.\" \n\"If the artistic quality of his work is under debate, his ability to embody the contradictions of French society is obvious,\" sociologist Jean-Louis Fabiani told the newspaper Le Monde. \"Johnny is a veritable cultural sponge, fed on the spirit of the times and its uncertainties.\" \nHallyday's widow, Laeticia Hallyday, said in a statement announcing his death that his battle with cancer had given \"everyone extraordinary life lessons.\" \n\"The heart beat so strongly in this body of a rocker who lived a life without concession for the stage, for his public, for those who adored and loved him,\" her statement, transmitted overnight to the French national news agency AFP, said. \"My man is no more.\" \nBut he never stopped being vulnerable. \n\"All my life, I was obsessed with the absence of my father,\" Hallyday told the Journal du Dimanche weekly newspaper in 2014. He recalled attending his father's funeral in Brussels in 1989. \n\"That day I was the only one there. Not a woman, not a friend. Absolute solitude in death. I wouldn't like to end like that,\" he said. \nJohnny didn't. \nOne fan, Yves Buisson, his arms bearing Johnny tattoos, stood outside Hallyday's gated home west of Paris, calling the rocker \"our God.\" \nLawmakers in the French National Assembly stood briefly and applauded the star, and Prime Minister Edouard Philippe gave an informal tribute. \nThe fan occupying the presidential Elysee Palace made it clear Hallyday hadn't died alone. \n\"I know that this morning there are many French people who probably feel more lonely,\" Macron said. \"So we'll comfort each other by thinking about him.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "halli", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rocker hallyday", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "johnny hallyday", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "elaine ganley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicolas sarkozy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edouard philippe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lilian lissalde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yves buisson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emmanuel macron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee ketchman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnny b. goode", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean-louis fabiani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laeticia hallyday", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "halliday", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beethoven", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hallyday", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "line renaud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean-philippe smet", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "south park magazine lilian lissalde", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "journal du dimanche", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "le monde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "french national assembly", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "algiers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elysee palace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anglet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eiffel tower", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:42.006+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15133379, "moreResultsAvailable": 15133279, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512638502006&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 782}
