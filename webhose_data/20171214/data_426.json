Our previous paper showed that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) played a crucial role in L-selectin- and PSGL-1-mediated F-actin redistribution and assembly during neutrophil rolling on E-selectin. However, it is not clear whether L-selectin and PSGL-1 induce other similar physiology events by PI3K. Here, we investigated the possibility of PI3K linking the signaling pathways of L-selectin and PSGL-1 to IL-18 transcription. We first demonstrated that L-selectin and PSGL-1 stimulation upregulated IL-18 transcription level in Jurkat cells. Then we found that PI3K inhibitor LY294002 reduced L-selectin- and PSGL-1-induced mRNA upregulation of IL-18 in Jurkat cells. Transfection of phosphatase and tensin homolog expressing plasmid inhibited the transcription level of IL-18. Therefore, PI3K is a signal linker between L-selectin and PSGL-1 in IL-18 transcriptional activation at the promoter level. To our knowledge, this is the first time to directly link PI3K to L-selectin- and PSGL-1-mediated IL-18 transcription, providing a foundation for intervention of PI3K-related inflammation.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2iys6lu", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "jurkat", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:44:21.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c95aa51fefa080469e88dbb1fbaf52caf986414b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf5GYEum3FbuSWbU7GeAu2j4SaKpHlvm_tOKK35dC.40RrUgAi5qRZOLiKLFD8beDglR8X3J8sfLo0DW0J.3WMjX8kxCSkce5cgwVvb5cgM1jw--", "site_full": "www.expedia.se", "site": "expedia.se", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.se/Alla-Hotell-I-Toronto.d178314.Reseguide-Stad-Alla-Hotell", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Alla hotell i Toronto", "title": "Four Points by Sheraton Mississauga Meadowvale", "title_full": "Four Points by Sheraton Mississauga Meadowvale (Toronto, Kanada) | Expedia.se", "published": "2017-09-06T03:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 96941, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "93cde4ccc49f1181f001b6c965902684a5d70277", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf5GYEum3FbuSWbU7GeAu2j4SaKpHlvm_tOKK35dC.40RrUgAi5qRZOLiKLFD8beDglR8X3J8sfLo0DW0J.3WMjX8kxCSkce5cieRadVbhY2alYfXkSPKTgFZVcjJ7CeShagQueJ8eEQVA--", "ord_in_thread": 16, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-20T11:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Comfortable bed, close to the highway, very reasonable rates", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 4.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:44:21.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c95aa51fefa080469e88dbb1fbaf52caf986414b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf5GYEum3FbuSWbU7GeAu2j4SaKpHlvm_tOKK35dC.40RrUgAi5qRZOLiKLFD8beDglR8X3J8sfLo0DW0J.3WMjX8kxCSkce5cgwVvb5cgM1jw--", "site_full": "www.expedia.se", "site": "expedia.se", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.se/Alla-Hotell-I-Toronto.d178314.Reseguide-Stad-Alla-Hotell", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Alla hotell i Toronto", "title": "Four Points by Sheraton Mississauga Meadowvale", "title_full": "Four Points by Sheraton Mississauga Meadowvale (Toronto, Kanada) | Expedia.se", "published": "2017-09-06T03:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 96941, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8e42003abda1684f57e4dcb8aeee6165936998a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf5GYEum3FbuSWbU7GeAu2j4SaKpHlvm_tOKK35dC.40RrUgAi5qRZOLiKLFD8beDglR8X3J8sfLo0DW0J.3WMjX8kxCSkce5cieRadVbhY2agjrePEwkNXuFdP2Wc7U2KJ2jCVxljW3uQ--", "ord_in_thread": 15, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-18T23:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Location of the hotel is good, close to shopping center and food.

We're having about five times the amount of influenza B pickup during the autumn period in British Columbia than we typically have,\" she said. \"We don't normally see this kind of influenza B uptick until February, so this is quite unusual.\n\"If this persists, there could be kind of a double-barrelled threat with B/Yamagata and influenza A/H3N2.\"\nIn its weekly FluWatch report, the Public Health Agency of Canada says the annual sneezing-coughing season began early this year -- especially with illness due to influenza B -- and the percentage of laboratory-positive tests for flu is higher at this point on the calendar compared with previous seasons.\nAs of Nov. 25, almost 2,100 lab-confirmed cases had been detected in various parts of the country, of which 84 per cent were influenza A. Those infections resulted in 371 hospitalizations, including 21 ICU admissions, and eight deaths, the report says.\nDr. Allison McGeer, director of infection control at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, said lab testing in Ontario is turning up \"quite a lot of B isolates, nearly as many Bs as H3N2.\"\nBut she said it's too early to predict what strain will predominate or how severe the season will be.\n\"This prediction ahead of time is a mug's game, but I think it's probably not going to be an H1N1 season,\" McGeer said. \"But whether it's going to be a B or H3N2 or mixed is still open.\"\nAdded to that uncertainty is the question of how effective this season's vaccine may be in preventing people from getting the flu.\nThis year's shot is the same as the one used in 2016-17, containing components for three major strains: A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B/Victoria, based on a recommendation by the World Health Organization made in February.\nHowever, the shot does not provide exact matches for the H3N2 and the B strains now circulating, said Skowronski.\nIn the case of H3N2, the vaccine component has been genetically altered somewhat as a result of the manufacturing process, which involves growing vast quantities of the virus in eggs.\nAnd the B strain circulating isn't a Victoria lineage as predicted by the WHO, but a Yamagata known as B/Phuket.\nLast year in Canada and the U.S., the vaccine was found to be only 35 per cent effective in preventing cases of H3N2 influenza, she said. And in Australia, which used the identical vaccine as Canada's this past season, its effectiveness against H3N2 infection was far less - only about 10 per cent.\n\"So given that, particularly for the H3N2 component, the vaccine effectiveness we're anticipating will be low,\" predicted Skowronski.\nDespite those misgivings, she encourages the elderly and those with underlying heart and lung conditions or with suppressed immune systems, who are vulnerable to influenza and its complications, to get their shot to obtain \"all the protection you can get.\"\nHealth-care workers and people whose close contacts have underlying medical conditions have additional impetus to get inoculated against the flu, she said.\n\"But for others, healthy young adults with no comorbidity and no close contacts with such conditions, it's a personal choice. And this isn't the season to be thumping the pulpit over that.\"\nStill, McGeer said there's good evidence accumulated over time that getting the flu shot every year \"is a safer and healthier thing to do for myself and better for my patients and my family.\"\nAnd while it may not work well against H3N2, she said it's worth getting the shot for protection against infection with H1N1 and even the B strain (the B/Victoria components may offer cross-protection against B/Yamagata).\n\"Yeah, it's not a great vaccine, but it's a lot better than nothing.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle":

The scheme was first launched in 2011 and is available across the UK and offers a grant towards the price of eligible new cars. The paperwork for the grant application is handled by the dealer you purchase your car from. \nHMRC publishes a list of qualifying cars, and only cars listed are eligible for the grant. The list is divided in to 3 main categories. Category 1. Vehicles with CO2 emissions lower than 50g/km and a \u2018zero-emission\u2019 range of at least 112km. Category 2. Vehicles with CO2 emissions lower than 50g/km and a \u2018zero-emission\u2019 range of at least 16km. Category 3. Vehicles with CO2 emissions of 50 to 75g/km and a \u2018zero-emission\u2019 range of at least 32km. \nThe maximum grant of \u00a34,500 (previously \u00a35,000) is available for cars listed in category 1. For cars listed in categories 2 and 3, the maximum grant is \u00a32,500. The grant will pay for up to 35% of the purchase price for these vehicles up to the monetary cap of each category. The scheme is open to qualifying purchases by private individuals and businesses. \nPlanning notes \nTo qualify for the grant, the cars must also come with a warranty covering batteries for at least three years, or 60,000 miles. There is also an \u2018on the road\u2019 price cap of \u00a360,000 over which no grant is available. This means that many popular environmentally friendly electric cars such as some Tesla models are not available under the scheme. \nAs part of the Budget measures, it was confirmed that the a further \u00a3100m has been set aside to ensure the scheme will remain available until at least 2020 to help encourage the growth of this sector.

Menkor As harvesting and selling of cocoa increases, farmers and dealers are complaining of the deplorable roads across the county as well as the primary roads connecting Grand Gedeh which are impediments to the sector. According to George Howard, a cocoa dealer in Nimba, cocoa is being sold for L$175 per kilogram or US$1.48 and the price is expected to climb. He said however that transporting cocoa from the bush to Ganta remains one of the greatest challenges to the sector because the roads, including the primary and secondary ones, are all bad. \"We are facing problems because of the bad roads and the current exchange rate in the market,\" he said. David Gbeadeh, a cocoa farmer, told this paper, due to the bad conditions, cocoa buyers are not offering prices to their satisfaction. Nimba is one of Liberia's leading cocoa-producing counties \"By this time last year, we were offered L$ 200 per kilogram, but now they shifting all the blame on the bad road condition to reduce the price,\" he said. \"This main road from Ganta to Grand Gedeh is a challenge for the movement of cocoa, but the farm to market roads are not too bad compared to the main road,\" Napoleon Brewer, another farmer added. Nimba is one of the leading cocoa producing counties, especially in the areas bordering the Ivory Coast. Last year the prices of cocoa went up very high in the Liberian market, prompting the Ivorian farmers to shipped their cocoa to Liberia. Cocoa season begins in July every year, but at a small scale and around October to December, the harvest increases. By January, it drops completely, but Howard said the cocoa season will likely extend to February, due to a new farming method. Liberia does not have any factory where cocoa is processed, something farmers are yearning for. The raw cocoa is exported to other countries which process and sell cocoa products on the world market.

Activation of the IFN-\u03b3 and its downstream interleukin-12 (IL-12) pathway can correct these diseases. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is a cytokine signaling inhibitor that blocks downstream pathways of IFN-\u03b3 by blocking the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathways. Oxymatrine (OMT), a quinolizidine alkaloid extracted from the herbal medicine Radix Sophorae flavescentis , is used to treat allergic skin diseases in China. The non-cytotoxic concentrations of OMT in HaCaT cells were determined through 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 were used to stimulate HaCaT cells, and OMT was added to this system with tacrolimus (FK506) as a positive control. The mRNAs of cytokines, MDC, ICAM-1, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, and IFN-\u03b3 receptor (IFN-\u03b3R)\u03b1 were detected by RT-PCR. Western blot analyses were performed to assess activation of the MAPK (p38, Jun N-terminal kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and Akt signaling pathways. OMT increased the mRNA levels of the IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3R\u03b1, reduced the mRNA levels of ICAM-1, MDC, and SOCS1. But FK506 increased the mRNA levels of IL12 and inhibited the expression of ICAM-1 mRNAs and had no effects on the IFN-\u03b3R\u03b1, MDC, and SOCS1 mRNA in HaCaT cells stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3. Thus, the mechanisms through which OMT and FK506 ameliorate allergic skin diseases differ.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2BHtnOL", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "downregulates mdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mdc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:44:24.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3bcaab2d4756ebea56b6300ca652a11048c5d58f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpoUCWzGZSovIko9TxG9S.3IJnTP2mF3VHvvbAiqGbwbchvb7uH9sYRMXuJ15sYPrXuictP9xtq0p_Pxp1a5Ey3DKx0azr_Vy7ahJ6gZaXs7Q--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Dems look to use Moore against GOP", "title_full": "Dems look to use Moore against GOP", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3bcaab2d4756ebea56b6300ca652a11048c5d58f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpoUCWzGZSovIko9TxG9S.3IJnTP2mF3VHvvbAiqGbwbchvb7uH9sYRMXuJ15sYPrXuictP9xtq0p_Pxp1a5Ey3DKx0azr_Vy7ahJ6gZaXs7Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "Dems look to use Moore against GOP", "text": "Dems look to use Moore against GOP \n\nDems look to use Moore against GOP The Hill Bannon on Romney: 'You hid behind your religion' to avoid Vietnam CNN Doug Jones launches misleading attack ad about Roy Moore's court record on sex crime cases PolitiFact Woman shares new evidence of relationship with Roy Moore when she was 17 Washington Post The Daily 202: Why so many women are still supporting Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate race Washington Post Full coverage Google ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hill bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "romney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doug jones", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gop dems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop   dems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington post full", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vietnam", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:44:24.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9c1a3f9f39fc021239240e8d66dfcdd443fd60da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pwYVyQ48uVCeCCEPI.XBj73XNweZVAD0w", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/mu/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/mu/ -

Keeping in line with move towards a paperless world, financial institutions are now offering paperless personal loans. Here we give you a low down on what these loans are and if they are as good as a normal loan and do they offer any additional benefits? Paperless Personal Loans Explained: So as the name indicates instead of following the usual route of filling out a physical form and submitting documents physically, in this option the applicant takes the digital route to getting a personal loan sanctioned.  The applicant will visit the website of the financial institution offering the paperless loan and will fill out the online application form for the loan. The form like a physical form requires usual information on personal, employment and financial aspects. Even though you are applying for a paperless loan, it does not mean that you do not have fulfill the eligibility criteria or submit the required documents. These documents are submitted in the digital form; based on the documents being in order and the applicant fulfilling the eligibility criteria the loan application is approved. However do keep in mind that apart from checking the eligibility and the documents the financial institution will also check the credit score of the applicant to assess the candidates risk profile. If required one may take some time to improve CIBIL score before actually applying for it the personal loan online.   Paperless Personal Loans: Worth the Hype. Any loan whether personal or any other, paperless or in the physical form should be taken only when a person truly requires it. Personal loans are often the most expensive loans and must be opted for after careful consideration. While paperless personal loans have a few advantages, the applicant cannot ignore the basic aspects when opting for it. Applying for a paperless loan does not mean one can ignore the fine print; even though you may not have a physical loan agreement with you it is still available in the online form. Go through the loan agreement in detail to get a fair idea about various terms and conditions like what are the penalties for late payment, pre-payment (if at all), also understand about the various costs whether hidden or explicit before deciding to opt for the loan. Often banks advertise about getting a loan within 24 hours or 48 hours; while it may sound promising especially if you need the amount urgently, don\u2019t be tempted! Take your time and research before applying, compare various options available in the market based on interest rates, hidden cost and other features before choosing one. Some lenders may offer a personal loan without CIBIL score ; however do not be fooled by promises. Check if the interest rates or other costs are higher or there is some other catch for loans that are offered despite the candidate having a low credit score.  Having said that, paperless loans do offer some advantages over the option of applying for a loan through the normal way. This process is much faster and also more convenient. One is not required to visit the branch physically, so if you are stuck someplace else and your family or you need money you can do so without having to physically visit any bank or branch. One is not restricted by time also and can apply for a loan anytime, for doing so physically one has to visit a branch with the banking hours which might not be possible in a few cases. Another advantage which may come in handy at the time of need is the turnaround time; the processing for these loans is faster than for loans in the normal case. This feature could be of great help for a person who is in need. \nSo just like any other loan, a paperless personal loan should also be taken after careful analysis of one\u2019s requirements, repayment capacity and alternatives to taking a personal loan. Researching and comparing various available options or going through the fine print cannot be ignored before opting for any loan! These loans do offer some advantages which make them convenient for the borrower.

Methods This is a retrospective cross-sectional analysis using birth certificate data from 2004 to 2015 retrieved from the Finger Lakes Regional Perinatal Data System. Primiparous women with singleton pregnancies were analyzed in the study. Two multivariate logistic regression models were conducted to assess potential paternal risk factors including age, race/ethnicity, and education on four birth outcomes, including preterm birth (PTB), low birthweight (LBW), high birthweight (HBW), and small for gestational age (SGA). Results A total of 36,731 singleton births were included in the analysis. Less paternal education was significantly related to an elevated risk of PTB, LBW, and SGA, even after adjustment for maternal demographic, medical, and lifestyle factors ( P \u2009<\u20090.05). Paternal race/ethnicity was also significantly associated with all four birth outcomes ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) while controlling for maternal factors. Older paternal age was associated with increased odds (OR 1.012, 95% CI 1.003\u20131.022) of LBW. Maternal race/ethnicity partially mediated the association of paternal race/ethnicity with HBW and SGA. Maternal education partially mediated the relationship between paternal education and SGA. Conclusion Paternal factors were important predictors of adverse birth outcomes. Our results support the inclusion of fathers in future studies and clinical programs aimed at reducing adverse birth outcomes.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2jmPFhZ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:44:25.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6e2de008414c9f437cd45e1a0668fe1412aabd54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwrlKEagknWD2k4gGKhKwFCf27y01aD_KnXgarDqIF1_XoK2QRZeF3sSMeYkeiIszg-", "site_full": "forums.d2jsp.org", "site": "d2jsp.org", "site_section": "http://forums.d2jsp.org/forum.php?f=107", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Softcore Trading - d2jsp Forum", "title": "Orbs Of Fusing And Jewels Orb", "title_full": "Orbs Of Fusing And Jewels Orb - d2jsp Topic", "published": "2017-12-06T19:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.132, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46006, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "040f20af520d8893d0b355bc032fa5632833e809", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwrlKEagknWD2k4gGKhKwFCf27y01aD_KnXgarDqIF1_XoK2QRZeF3sVfFExAIJFmrRu4U2tFpUVA--", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "Sho4n4n4s", "published": "2017-12-07T00:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "50 fsing for 0.4/e = 20 fg ?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:44:25.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6be60f450a37072653e48d590db17ee60c8305e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJX_deGCi7DGaTpfN9mktSqm2LesdUjNTyXdHuN3Ved5EYlFdFX7cvpyEElq6cizFnxmD7scBhInhgGW9_aNWxBU1C.by9jHb5Q-", "site_full": "newsflyers.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://newsflyers.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "your news", "title": "Avisering fr\u00e5n Google \u2013 Padmavati", "title_full": "Avisering fr\u00e5n Google \u2013 Padmavati", "published": "2017-12-07T11:44:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6be60f450a37072653e48d590db17ee60c8305e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJX_deGCi7DGaTpfN9mktSqm2LesdUjNTyXdHuN3Ved5EYlFdFX7cvpyEElq6cizFnxmD7scBhInhgGW9_aNWxBU1C.by9jHb5Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kalpedal (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "Avisering fr\u00e5n Google \u2013 Padmavati", "text": "Padmavati Direktuppdatering \u22c5 7 december 2017 WEBB Aditi Rao reveals why she accepted the controversial ' Padmavati ' First Journalist Bollywood sources have stated that Aditi Rao Hydari will be seen playing the character of Ranveer Singh's (Allauddin Khilji) wife Kamla Devi in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's magnum opus ' Padmavati '.
