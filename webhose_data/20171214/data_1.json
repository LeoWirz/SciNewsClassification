Mac Ride is a child-seat system that allows children to experience off-road riding at a younger age while developing skills that they will be able to transfer to their own bikes. Mounted to the steerer and seat post and running along the top tube, it places your child in front of you and allows them to place their hands directly on the handlebars. The stirrups give them the experience of pedals and allow them to stand up over bumps. \u201cWith Mac Ride, as it\u2019s built for off-road use, we can head out on more adventurous outings with single track trails and swooshy berms, which keeps the cycling more interesting for our eldest, Savannah,\u201d explains Mac Ride Co-Creator, Ashley Howard. \u201cWhen our son, Mackinley, was 3 and started enjoying cruising trails on his run bike, we would take both his run bike and Mac Ride with us. It meant that we could stay out all day, swapping between the two \u2013 Mac Riding up the hills, and cruising down them as a family.\u201d This innovative product is a fun new way to get the whole family out on the trails sooner! Glen Dobson \u2013 father, mountain biker, and engineer \u2013 designed Mac Ride when he couldn\u2019t find a viable solution that would allow him to take his young son out on the trails. He and Ashley quickly realized that while there were plenty of child bike seats on the market, there wasn\u2019t a product that met their specific needs. The existing models offered bulky, hard plastic, molded seats that transferred the bumps from the trail to the child, harnesses that keep the child strapped to the bike even in the event of a fall, and hard plastic or steel foot protectors that prevent the child from standing up in anticipation of rougher terrain. The biggest deterrent they found with conventional rear-mounted child bike seats is that the child will often lean out causing balance issues and the rider had to take their eyes off the trail or road to check on them. When Glen and Ashley researched other front mounted seats they found they were all quickly outgrown and for much younger children than their kids at the time. We saw a lot of great things in a variety of bike seats, but couldn\u2019t find a solution that met all of our needs. I got to work pulling together all of the best bits and landed on Mac Ride \u2013 a lean design that is more engaging for the child is easy to take on and off and is compatible with almost any bike. \u2014 Glen Dobson, Mac Ride Co-Creator Mac Ride has really expanded the range of our rides. Now we have an option to all ride together, far beyond when a child\u2019s legs run out of pedaling power. \u2014 Matt Hunter \nUnderstanding what they didn\u2019t want was the first step for Glen in creating Mac Ride. It was important to put the child in front to give them the same view of the trail as the rider and allow them to chat and interact. From there he positioned them with their hands on the handlebars to feel the steering and to balance themselves and added the stirrups to allow them to stand up and lean in the corners. The seat is a non-slip silicon design similar to a horse saddle that uses a pommel for comfort and security going both up and downhill. The seat is designed to support kids from ages 2 to 5 and with the lack of bulkiness, it provides a richer, closer interaction between the rider and passenger. It also takes advantage of the bike\u2019s existing suspension and allows for a more comfortable ride. Lastly, Mac Ride positions the child on the bike without seat belts or straps, allowing them to find their own balance within the safety of their parents\u2019 protective arms, if a fall occurred, the child would come away from the bike with the rider, rather than being strapped to the bike. Robbie loves it. He is always asking me to find little jumps and corners to hit. I think it helps him to see what he can do when he\u2019s on his own bike too. \u2014 Matt Hunter \nThe attention to detail for safety, usability, and longevity of Mac Ride are the result of many years in the testing and designing phase. Mac Ride is built with forged aircraft grade aluminum making is lightweight but also strong and stiff. The seat uses high-quality silicon rubber for comfort \u2013 and durability. The unique mounting system replaces a spacer on your steerer tube with a custom one that allows Mac Ride front clamp to attach around it. The rear clamp uses a quick release bolt to tighten it around your seat post \u2013 this is compatible with dropper posts as well. The headset spacer is the only item that is left on your bike when the seat is removed, meaning that it can quickly be taken on and off your bike between solo rides and family rides or swapped between bikes \u2013 it takes less than 1 minute to put it on or take it off a bike. With a variety of front mount spacers available Mac Ride fits a wide range of bikes from old commuters to the newest carbon mountain bikes. It is important to note that there is no damage to or adverse effects on the bike frame; the weight of the child mimics that of the rider and is evenly distributed on two very strong points that are intended for heavy loads. Not only does this make the seat safe for even carbon frames, but also easier to maneuver than other similar child seats on the market. Mac Ride has enabled us to ride as a family, first and foremost, so that\u2019s an easy win. Being able to take Myla places, with her bike strapped onto our backpacks, while using Mac Ride allows her to ride around lakes, past waterfalls, and old growth trees on her own and ride in places that are just too far for her to get to under her own power. She can feel the air in her hair, see the cool trees, and beautiful forest. She can experience the flow of trails and travel at speeds not available to her \u2013 within reason, obviously \u2013 with her limited ability, fitness, and experience at age 6. These moments are priceless and give her a real feel for why we, her parents, love mountain biking so much. The impact it has had on our family is incredible. Instead of doing the typical taking turns as parents, or not covering very much terrain, we get the keys to the castle so to speak, to be able to truly ride as a family. The positive impacts of this are invaluable and truly priceless! \u2014 Darren Butler Myla, shown here with her dad three years ago, still enjoys using Mac Ride with her family. Designed to adapt four different ways, Mac Ride easily grows with your child. The seat position can be moved forward and back, while the stirrups and foot strap length can be adjusted. Most importantly to your child\u2019s comfort is that the stirrups can be pivoted both back and forth as well as up and down to allow for the best positioning. With Mac Ride, we could plan cycling trips again. We really wanted a child bike seat we could travel easily with so we could keep up with our active holidays. Mac Ride is simple to fold up and pop in your carry-on luggage \u2013 and is lightweight. \u2014 Glen Dobson, Mac Ride Co-Creator \nMac Ride has been tested to the highest standards \u2013 the equivalent of thousands of hours of use \u2013 in an independent SGS testing lab. As Mac Ride was designed with Glen and Ashley\u2019s own children in mind, safety was at the forefront of their design and testing. Currently, there is no safety certification for front-mounted child bike seats, but the seat does conform, with the exception of not having a strap, to an EU safety standard for child bike seats (EN 14344). \nAt the end of the day, Mac Ride\u2019s most proven quality is that the kids who use it, have fun! \u201cOur kids love it,\u201d says Glen. \u201cNow that our son is on a pedal bike, we explain to him where we\u2019re going and offer him a choice of transport: his bike, a trailer bike, or Mac Ride. He\u2019s able to gauge the distance, how his legs are feeling, and whether he\u2019s craving that bonding time up front on Mac Ride before letting us know how he\u2019s going to travel. His favorite time for Mac Riding right now is after school. I think he\u2019s pretty knacked by 3 o\u2019clock and loves to chill with me up front and chat about his day. Which is great for me too!\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matt hunter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2014 matt hunter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashley howard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "myla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2014 glen dobson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glen dobson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2014 darren butler myla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mac ride", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mackinley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robbie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mac ride co-creator  mac ride", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mac ride", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mac ride co-creator mac ride", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sgs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kamloops", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "savannah", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:05:52.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f1119a6ad1c387ae05757b70c1ddf3100a2859a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSpUqYXnI_xJhmCK7ZeMyrYGQW8nIEIc2KONKEyFkfsqkI_AYxu7gxOYmj8XeyhxQY-", "site_full": "reemasandhu.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://reemasandhu.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Life\u00c2\u00a0 \u2013 A Moment With Your Book", "title": "Life\u00c2", "title_full": "Life\u00c2", "published": "2017-12-07T11:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f1119a6ad1c387ae05757b70c1ddf3100a2859a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSpUqYXnI_xJhmCK7ZeMyrYGQW8nIEIc2KONKEyFkfsqkI_AYxu7gxOYmj8XeyhxQY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "reemasandhu", "published": "2017-12-07T11:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "Life\u00c2", "text": "Emotions are meant to be healed and balanced.\nWater nourishes our mind and soul, carries if we even fail in our goal.\nWrote by Rksandhu\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rksandhu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:05:52.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a76f207d181afdb4f3f869c38c4815b823ee649", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3IINhAMqcQzzbXmH3HpVXkSOGZ7qBT2D.DfPeDoyjIzHCtvwcBeJ0B72MWrjv3aHJijjO0Xh7FJeJ.mMIPT7Lc5jftfbkOtGZ562GypyJZWHJb0tgu3tDVTTEwFAveDdwmxKqY2w1M8kQ--", "site_full": "etvradio.org", "site": "etvradio.org", "site_section": "http://etvradio.org/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "A South Carolina Public Radio Podcast", "title": "Tax reform would let big companies bring profits home, but would it send jobs abroad?", "title_full": "Tax reform would let big companies bring profits home, but would it send jobs abroad?", "published": "2017-12-07T01:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://styles/medium/https/cdn1.pri.org/sites/default/files/story/images/RTR2DB4U.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3a76f207d181afdb4f3f869c38c4815b823ee649", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3IINhAMqcQzzbXmH3HpVXkSOGZ7qBT2D.DfPeDoyjIzHCtvwcBeJ0B72MWrjv3aHJijjO0Xh7FJeJ.mMIPT7Lc5jftfbkOtGZ562GypyJZWHJb0tgu3tDVTTEwFAveDdwmxKqY2w1M8kQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The World staff", "published": "2017-12-07T01:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "Tax reform would let big companies bring profits home, but would it send jobs abroad?", "text": "Tax reform would let big companies bring profits home, but would it send jobs abroad? By The World staff \u2022 2 hours ago Related Program: \nPeople walk out of a branch of the Cayman National Bank in George Town, Cayman Islands. Gary Hershorn/Reuters \nThe clock is counting down: Now that tax reform bills have made their way through the House and Senate, Republicans in both chambers are working to iron out the differences between the two bills \u2014 with a goal of overhauling the US tax system by December 22. \nCritics say the plan is riddled with glitches and loopholes, including a provision that would give US corporations a huge tax cut on $3 trillion in profits they have stored outside the country. \nUnder current law, multinational companies must pay a 35 percent tax on all foreign profits \u2013 unless those profits stay overseas. Some large companies \u2013 including Apple, General Electric, and others \u2013 stash billions of dollars overseas in tax havens, like Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands, so they can effectively defer payment of their taxes. \nThe \u201crepatriation provision\u201d proposed by Republicans would change give American companies a tax break \u2013 allowing them to pay a minimum of 10 percent tax on some types overseas earnings (in the Senate version of the bill) and a 20 percent tax on domestic profits. \nBut the bill is being rushed through Congress, says Chye-Ching Huang, a tax policy analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. \u201cI think we're going to see a whole lot of loopholes come into the light of day,\u201d he says. \nOne consequence is that when overseas profits are taxed at a lower rate than domestic profits, companies may be incentivized to shift factories and manufacturing abroad. Under the proposed tax overhaul, Huang says, \u201cyou're not even subject to this minimum 10 percent tax on foreign profits if the profits are from manufacturing offshore.\u201d \nFrom PRI's The World \u00a92017 PRI \u00a9 2017 South Carolina Public Radio", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "huang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chye-ching huang", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "general electric", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cayman national bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for budget and policy priorities", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south carolina public radio", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cayman islands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luxembourg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george town", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:05:52.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee1acb7d7c84f58e29ed97ce46a7ad52e428be6a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspar3onQ57kqtCwBPJDCyu_648CToiq4kWlprE6T0bNMX1MUAtz0N.aXdzb6I4jnvCYif9iS8IW2WKzppEcLb6F6g--", "site_full": "www.expedia.com.br", "site": "expedia.com.br", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com.br/Praga-Hoteis.d180014.Guia-de-Hoteis", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hot\u00e9is em Praga: Pague em parcelas em at\u00e9 12x sem IOF | Expedia.com.br", "title": "BoHo Prague Hotel:", "title_full": "BoHo Prague Hotel: Pre\u00e7os, promo\u00e7\u00f5es e coment\u00e1rios | Expedia.com.br", "published": "2017-09-24T10:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46532, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4090980c4bc611b3db5b9fe22d1ebc5540013f47", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspar3onQ57kqtCwBPJDCyu_648CToiq4kWlprE6T0bNMX1MUAtz0N.aXdzb6I4jnvCYif9iS8IW2WI58MuxCCAh8r7QNKDjDuIwe2f48cI6iL8EoZZlghxfow--", "ord_in_thread": 16, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-22T18:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Excellent service.

The remnants of what is left of IS\u2019 forces are isolated to the remote desert region and the Iraqi government is soon expected to announce the terror group\u2019s total military defeat in the country. Iraq\u2019s Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari recently called for the creation of a \u201cMarshall Plan\u201d to help rebuild the country\u2019s economy. Violence is showing signs of declining, now at the lowest levels in five years. Yet Iraq now faces a plethora of social and economic issues which will need to be resolved in order to prevent future conflicts. Financial assistance is steadily working its way to the Iraqi government. As the second-most populated city in the Arab World after Cairo, Iraq\u2019s capital Baghdad will be at the center of this new environment. But is the city\u2019s infrastructure ready to meet modern challenges and become a regional and international hub for transit, economics, and global politics? At the city\u2019s helm is the upstart mayor, Dr. Thirka Alwash, who took over the city\u2019s municipal responsibilities in 2015. Alwash gained international recognition for her historic selection as the first woman to land the city\u2019s top job. Highly qualified, she is a civil engineer and received a PhD in 2007 in construction project management from Baghdad University of Technology. The past few years have seen Baghdad slowly begin to recover amidst, war, terrorism, and economic hardships, and Dr. Alwash regularly appears on the city\u2019s front lines, whether repairing infrastructure or inspecting the aftermath of a deadly bombing. Touring the Karrada neighborhood in 2016 after one of the country\u2019s most deadly bombings, Dr. Alwash promised to help compensate owners and offer government assistance to businesses. There are visible signs of change. Last December, Christmas decorations were displayed prominently in bustling shops lining the Mansour district. Elsewhere, Iraqi biker groups ride along the country\u2019s highways sporting Harley-Davidson gear. Still, providing security for Baghdad has proven to be a logistical nightmare. In early 2017, the issue of an infamous concrete security barrier was debated amidst fears that the barriers should not be removed while terrorist sleeper cells remain in the city. Speaking to AI Monitor in January, one security officer said \u201cThe checkpoints are burdening citizens and do not offer real benefits. They only cause traffic and create complaints and anger among citizens.\u201d Last summer, Dr. Alwash held a joint meeting with the security forces to explore ways to alleviate the situation for the city\u2019s residents. Most experts point to the need to curb corruption now that IS has been defeated. Iraq\u2019s Prime Minister Haider al Abadi regularly stresses the importance of fighting corruption; he most recently spoke at the Teachers Union Council and called for a new anti-corruption culture in Iraq. Several Iraqi politicians have fallen to such scandals, including the former governor of Mosul and Majid al-Nasrawi, Basra\u2019s unpopular governor who fled to Iran last summer after an anti-graft probe was launched against him and his associates. In 2015, Alwash pledged to create an atmosphere of \u201ctransparency and trust,\u201d along with a dose of realism, in order to directly reach regular Iraqis. A lot has changed since then. Now married to an Iraqi army general, she is also highly active on Twitter, YouTube, Google Plus, and Facebook, firing off daily updates from around the city. Mustafa H., who lives in Baghdad, told Raddington Report \u201cDr. Alwash is keen on monitoring social media in Iraq (particularly on Facebook) to gain an insight into the people\u2019s daily problems. A lot of the issues raised by the public were treated immediately which can be considered as \u2018quick wins\u2019 for the mayor. However, these efforts will not be enough to regain the people\u2019s trust in the government since they want to see significant changes among general services in the capital\u201d. While in the past, revitalization efforts had been the subject of corruption probes and scandals, Dr. Alwash pushed forward with the Al Rasheed Street development project aiming to spruce up the beautiful but decaying facades of the neighborhood\u2019s historical buildings. She has also made efforts to repair the Freedom Monument designed by the famous Iraqi architect Jawad Salam in Baghdad\u2019s Tahrir Square to commemorate the overthrow of the monarchy in 1958. Electricity is a constant trouble for Baghdad\u2019s residents. Power outages plague the city especially in soaring summer temperatures. Last summer, workers were sent home due to an extreme heat wave. The government secured a $400 million deal with GE Power to bolster the electrical grid, which is heavily reliant on neighboring Iran. Water is another struggle. In August 2016, the Baghdad Municipality launched the Rusafa water project for the city\u2019s northern Bab al-Sham neighborhood. Baghdad\u2019s Zayouna neighborhood especially suffers from flooding during Iraq\u2019s rain season. In September Alwash visited sewer treatment facilities and inspected repairs to drainage system in anticipation of the rainy season, listening to the complaints of local residents who gave her a piece of their mind. Mustafa H. explained, \u201cRecently, Dr. Alwash and the Directorate of Traffic Police announced one of the main highways would be closed due to maintenance needs. Although 6 weeks had passed, nothing actually happened in terms of maintenance to the highway. As a result, it took hours for people to commute to and from work and their homes in Baghdad\u2019s Rusafa district. This resulted in a public outrage. Eventually, this led Alwash to settle for quick solutions and eventually decided to reopen the highway later in December, without commencing any type of action that would help to repair the damaged highway.\u201d With or without the help of the city\u2019s administration, the capital is well on its way to restoring Baghdad\u2019s cultural life. New cafes, such as this one on Abu Nuwas Street would look not out of place in New York or London. News of female book sellers appearing amongst the shops on the famous Al-Mutanabbi Street as well as the legendary Shabandar caf\u00e9, described by some journalists as Iraq\u2019s collective for literature, is thriving and attracting global attention. Others in the Baghdad\u2019s cultural circles are feeling the renewed confidence. The art scene has been picking up with anew exhibit of twenty four Picasso lithographs on display at the Hiwar gallery in Baghdad. One Iraqi painter wondered: \u201cThis exhibition reflects a return to stability in the country. Who would have dared mount a show of such valuable works just a few years ago?\u201d Dr. Alwash will face the ultimate test at the hands of Baghdad\u2019s voters in the city municipal elections next spring. Either way, it\u2019s hard to argue that she has not at least tried to work towards building a new and improved Baghdad. Her determination and commitment will soldier on as Baghdad sets out for life in the post-conflict era.

By Ibby Caputo \u2022 9 hours ago Related Program: Hospitals in the US mainland are facing shortages of IV fluids and medicine because of Hurricane Maria's damage to Puerto Rico. Paulo Whitaker/Reuters Listening... / \nWhile Puerto Rico slowly recovers from the destruction of Hurricane Maria in September, hospitals on the mainland are dealing with some of the side effects of that destruction. They're struggling with a shortage of intravenous fluids directly linked the hurricane damage. \nBaxter , a major manufacturer of intravenous fluids and bags, has three factories in Puerto Rico. In an email, a spokesperson at Baxter said 10 weeks after the hurricane hit the island, one of their factories in Puerto Rico is still being powered by a diesel generator. The other two factories are back on the electrical grid, but power is intermittent. Severe damage to roads and bridges is also slowing the recovery. \nIV fluids like saline and dextrose are the lifeblood of hospitals. They\u2019re needed to deliver medications and rehydrate patients. Hospital pharmacies use the smaller IV bags to mix medications. But they\u2019ve been in short supply, especially since the hurricane, so pharmacists have relied on the larger bags. Now those larger bags are running out, too. \nOn Nov. 22, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston received an email urging them to conserve intravenous fluids as much as possible: \n\"As some of you are aware, nearly all hospitals across the country are currently reporting significant shortages of IV fluids. Although IV fluid shortages have occurred intermittently since 2014, the impact of Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico this fall has greatly exacerbated the situation, given the significant medical products manufacturing industry on the island that sustained damage. Although the initial impact from manufacturing shortfalls was mostly limited to shortages of small volume bags, there have now been secondary effects, causing a shortage of 'regular' IV fluid bags as health systems have had to switch their use to these products.\" \nThe email continues, \u201cWe have now reached a point where the shortage is of potential operational concern.\u201d \nChris Fortier, chief pharmacist operator at Massachusetts General Hospital, says that conservation is key to dealing with the shortage. \n\u201cWhere we can conserve, let\u2019s conserve. Let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re reserving our products for the patients that we need them for, and when we can use other alternatives that are as equally effective as the product in an IV fluid, let\u2019s do that,\u201d he says. \nSome substitutions include injecting medication with a syringe when possible, and assessing whether a patient can take meds in a pill form, or be rehydrated orally. \nThe FDA is temporarily allowing IV saline products to be imported from Baxter\u2019s factories in other countries, but it\u2019s unclear how much relief that will provide. \n\u201cEvery day is sort of a moving target,\u201d Fortier says. \u201cSome days we expect to get product and we don\u2019t. Some days we expect to get a lot of product and we only get some of it.\u201d \nIn the pharmacy department at Deborah Heart and Lung Center, a small specialty hospital a mile from Fort Dix in New Jersey, are stacks of boxes labeled \u201cBaxter.\u201d Deb Sadowski, the hospital\u2019s director of pharmacy, says the boxes, filled with small IV fluid bags, would usually be kept in the hospital\u2019s central supply but she is \u201choarding\u201d them in the pharmacy department so they are not mistakenly sent to the hospital floors. Nurses on the hospital floors can often use a bigger bag, for example, to rehydrate a patient, whereas the pharmacy needs the smaller bags to mix medications, she says. \n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of robbing Peter to pay Paul, as they say,\u201d Sadowski says. \u201cIt\u2019s all going to the same good cause \u2026 making sure that we have what the patient needs.\u201d \nAccording to the FDA, there have been shortages of IV fluids on and off since 2014 for a variety of reasons, but nothing like this. In November, the American Hospital Association sent a letter to Congress stating that the US healthcare system was \u201con the brink of a significant public health crisis.\u201d \n\u201cI think it\u2019s about to hit critical mass over the next week or two,\u201d Sadowski says. \u201cThere\u2019s just no more to be had and you can only go so far with your conservation methods. We\u2019re all doing everything we can do.\u201d \nPharmacists also worry the ripple effects of Hurricane Maria won\u2019t stop with IV fluids. Puerto Rico produces more pharmaceuticals for the mainland than any of the 50 states and more than any single foreign country, according to an FDA economic analysis released in November. Cancer drugs and HIV medication are among the products manufactured on the still-devastated island. \nFortier says it\u2019s difficult to prepare for potential shortages because the FDA does not require companies to disclose where their drugs are made. \n\u201cThere are other plants in Puerto Rico that made drugs, and will those products go on shortage? We don\u2019t know,\u201d Fortier says. \nHospitals say patient care is not being compromised, but they don\u2019t expect the shortage to let up until at least early next year. \nFrom PRI's The World \u00a92017 PRI \u00a9 2017 South Carolina Public Radio", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ibb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fortier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sadowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baxter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris fortier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deb sadowski", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "massachusetts general hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american hospital association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south carolina public radio", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lung center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deborah heart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fort dix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new jersey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:05:52.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b90d85273dfec6d8797a955f16e9521dd40ae2ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ9OXReQDzxcjvL.fUr.HjSVqGJl1056XJ5OLBS8Kl5dHFTfC0GXnZMWnwx5YFEULk9hbVECwHl5G2g5BpMkNsD5vNVOP53c1GhosTY3whB.7SlUyeD7x9L", "site_full": "finnewsreview.com", "site": "finnewsreview.com", "site_section": "http://finnewsreview.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Financial News Review", "title": "What\u2019s Behind the Numbers For Signet Industries Limited (SIGNET.NS)?", "title_full": "What\u2019s Behind the Numbers For Signet Industries Limited (SIGNET.NS)?", "published": "2017-12-07T11:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://finnewsreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Direct-Market-Touch-Stock-Exchange-News-300x161.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b90d85273dfec6d8797a955f16e9521dd40ae2ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ9OXReQDzxcjvL.fUr.HjSVqGJl1056XJ5OLBS8Kl5dHFTfC0GXnZMWnwx5YFEULk9hbVECwHl5G2g5BpMkNsD5vNVOP53c1GhosTY3whB.7SlUyeD7x9L", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Financial News Staff", "published": "2017-12-07T11:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "What\u2019s Behind the Numbers For Signet Industries Limited (SIGNET.NS)?", "text": "What\u2019s Behind the Numbers For Signet Industries Limited (SIGNET.NS)?   \nSignet Industries Limited (SIGNET.NS) shares have experienced bearish momentum as the Average True Range of the shares have trended downward over the past 10 sessions.

Alvin Baez/Reuters \nEveryday life in Puerto Rico these days \u2014 in the still-ragged aftermath of Hurricane Maria, two months ago \u2014 is a test of patience, even for the middle class. \nFew traffic lights function and that slows commutes to a crawl. Electricity is sporadic, so stocking the fridge remains a risky proposition. \n\"You get tired of eating cold stuff, or eating things in a can, or not being able even to have a warm bath,\" says marketing executive Edmaris Carazo. She was born and raised in Puerto Rico and writes the blog Siempre Jueves . \"It's the little things that you miss the most.\" \nCarazo has written about her frustrations about daily life in Puerto Rico in the online magazine \"Catapult.\" \nHere's an excerpt. \nAs I write this, it's been three weeks since my not-so-new-anymore-spouse, my two dogs and I quartered ourselves in the middle of a hallway. Barely a month since the roar that violently entered through our doors and windows-a long, persistent roar that tormented us for hours; a roar that was followed by a profound and desolating silence. A silence that was filled by an AM radio station. An AM radio station that only narrated bad news. Bad news delivered by voices that didn't know where their aunt, their cousin, their grandson, or their grandma were. People that cried for their hearing-impaired, blind, and disabled family members. Human beings begging those who lived near the ocean, or on the side of a river, or at the foot of the mountain to please report themselves. And then the wrath of the wind was replaced by the cruel whisper of the unknown. \nThey say that after twenty-one days, anything you do can become a habit, a part of you. I think that's why we are only now starting to realize that this actually happened to us. \nI lived almost four years with my not-so-new-anymore-spouse before marrying him, and in that time I managed to create a fantasy where I didn't go to the bathroom, making him believe that I'm either a princess or a perfect robot. Now I have to announce the purposes of my visit if I go to the toilet, if I have to flush it. I've had to overcome humiliation. I've tried to convince myself that I'm on a camping trip, one of those camping trips I never liked before, but this time it's an indefinite camping between concrete and cement walls-camping without an ocean view, without the salty breeze that refreshes, without the sweetness of a make-believe holiday. \nI once traveled for two weeks and I woke up in five different cities. It's always been simple for me to get used to changes, so when I woke up sweaty, overheated, I thought I was in another new city-but it wasn't the case. I woke up in my house, in my living room; we had to move the mattress because the heat in our bedroom is hellish since it happened. I woke up in my own country, the island that has always been hard for me to love, and it smelled like bags that have been in the trash cans for eleven days, like toilets that are flushed only after three or four pisses. It smelled like bodies that are bathed with buckets; like our beach cooler that used to have butter, milk, cheese, and ham, and was already out of ice, giving off a smell of profound putrefaction. Nevertheless, we can't dispose of it, since any liquid now is toilet-flushing fuel. \nI once took a screenplay workshop with a professor who told us that he flushed the toilet every time he took a shower. He wasted water without any remorse, approximately three to seven gallons depending on the model, because the sound of the toilet caused a weird sensation of closure and satisfaction for him. I can't help but wonder if today he throws the buckets of rainwater into the bowl, just to preserve any sense of normalcy after what happened to us. \nFrom PRI's The World \u00a92017 PRI \u00a9 2017 South Carolina Public Radio", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joyce hackel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carazo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edmaris carazo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siempre jueves", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south carolina public radio", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utuado", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:05:52.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0fa99462598d1e0fb8bac2f3acabc24291c93449", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSu2pBmyvyP_UVfznq.FEr9DytlgBD57jH4RkE7NIubtPge8Vd4Re645MAuVvv9lIkoJ6soimYqsg--", "site_full": "hypixel.net", "site": "hypixel.net", "site_section": "https://hypixel.net/forums/blitz-survival-games.72/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Blitz Survival Games | Hypixel - Minecraft Server and Maps", "title": "Horsetamer or Meatmaster 8", "title_full": "Horsetamer or Meatmaster 8 | Hypixel - Minecraft Server and Maps", "published": "2017-12-06T17:10:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.999, "main_image": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1ea9111d752828b0637363956845f54a?s=96&amp;amp;d=https%3A%2F%2Fhypixel.net%2Fstyles%2Fdefault%2Fxenforo%2Favatars%2Favatar_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 11753, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e0918b0239984bdccd2b3a102566e3ba9e64baa7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSu2pBmyvyP_UVfznq.FEr9DytlgBD57jH4RkE7NIubtPge8Vd4Re645MAuVvv9lInylU_cnCMfvgKpSc4ZvQ74", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "PqndaShade", "published": "2017-12-06T18:23:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I got meat 8 and it\u2019s actually pretty decent.

It\u2019s right on the edge of Burnet and Llano counties, which both voted 75 percent in favor of President Donald Trump. \nThere\u2019s a wait to get a table at Julie\u2019s Cocina on a weekday just after noon. The restaurant has been in Horseshoe Bay since 2009, and the wait staff knows the regulars by name. The bartender takes me over to one loyal customer perched on a chair \u2013 a vocal Trump supporter. \nLeon Fuller said he works at Horseshoe Bay veterinary clinic. He\u2019s got faith in the tax bill. \n\"I hope we do get some money back to the middle class, which, all it\u2019s going to do is turn it around and make our economy stronger,\u201d he said. \nRetired marketing and sales representative Frank Hosea is a little more cautious. \n\u201cIt\u2019s way too early,\" he said, \"between the Senate and Congress, they\u2019re going to have so many different reiterations of this, so anything we think about that we know, [we] don\u2019t.\u201d \nHosea does think the tax system needs an overhaul. He voted for Trump and thinks the bet on trickle-down economics is a good one. \n\u201cHaving the highest corporate tax rate in the world makes no sense,\" he said. \"We\u2019re seeing the amount of jobs that are leaving the country and have been leaving the country. Let\u2019s figure out how to bring monies back to the country as well as jobs back to the country.\" \nNadine Roeder is a customer at the R Bar, a couple miles down the road in another little town. She\u2019s from Marble Falls and is a server at the Noon Spoon Caf\u00e9. She is 25. \nRoeder didn\u2019t vote in last year\u2019s presidential election and said she's a single mom of two kids. \n\u201cSo I\u2019ll get two child credits back at the end of the year, and that\u2019s not going up for me, but as far as somebody who is making $150,000 in the home, they\u2019re going to get more money back than me, who is below $20,000 a year, just barely making it with two kids as a single mom,\" she said. \"I mean, yes they are putting more money into the system, but, no, it\u2019s not helping me.\" \nAcross the street is Bill\u2019s Burgers, where Roland Parker is grabbing a beer. He\u2019s a self-employed cabinetmaker and also didn\u2019t vote in the presidential election. He said even with no state income tax in Texas, he still feels burdened by taxes. \n\"At the end of the quarter it seems like I pay taxes three times \u2026 I gotta pay taxes, taxes, taxes, taxes. It seems like that\u2019s all I do,\" he said. \nBack at Julie\u2019s Cocina, the crowd thins after the lunch rush, but there are still a few folks eating the day's enchilada special. Adolph Perez said he installs retractable screen doors in the area. \n\u201cI\u2019m really not that much concerned about [the tax bill],\" he said. \"Because what control do you have? We already voted people in, and those people are going to do whatever they want because that\u2019s how it is. You can tell me you\u2019re going to do this, you\u2019re going to do that as a politician. Then once you get there, the money starts rolling in and you forget what you told me.\" \nLike the majority of folks in this part of Central Texas, Perez voted for the president.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andy uhler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roeder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hosea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nadine roeder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frank hosea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roland parker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leon fuller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adolph perez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "llano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lake lbj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burnet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cocina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "horseshoe bay", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:05:53.074+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0dbcbcd62b3ef9a28bd3dec15f9453481537ab26", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg91bHJN3vQZIxX61q00bn3sETrta6K0XFjD0kkH2NMWs1LzerVdHloT2bsx.qDvGd6Wy5qWTVa697iiV4.t5g44Op7hi6Pc1_FD00CAmO5uZOdtyyEvAVcOGjx6qlIeqi19PGkITdN5ZkMo5UnDdPvRedNvY6F3Xnk-", "site_full": "www.canberratimes.com.au", "site": "canberratimes.com.au", "site_section": "http://feeds.canberratimes.com.au/rssheadlines/top.xml#", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Canberra Times RSS News Headlines", "title": "Buoyant banks boost ASX to first gain in four sessions", "title_full": "Buoyant banks boost ASX to first gain in four sessions", "published": "2017-12-07T13:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.canberratimes.com.au/content/dam/images/g/x/8/p/t/t/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.h00gsp.png/1512629800852.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 28115, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0dbcbcd62b3ef9a28bd3dec15f9453481537ab26", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg91bHJN3vQZIxX61q00bn3sETrta6K0XFjD0kkH2NMWs1LzerVdHloT2bsx.qDvGd6Wy5qWTVa697iiV4.t5g44Op7hi6Pc1_FD00CAmO5uZOdtyyEvAVcOGjx6qlIeqi19PGkITdN5ZkMo5UnDdPvRedNvY6F3Xnk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "canberratimes.com.au", "published": "2017-12-07T13:56:00.000+02:00", "title": "Buoyant banks boost ASX to first gain in four sessions", "text": "The ASX pulled higher on Thursday, with gains in the banking sector helping the benchmark to its first positive session in four days.\nThe S&P/ASX 200 index rose 31 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 5977.

In its first comprehensive assessment of China's financial system since 2011, the IMF recommended \"a gradual and targeted increase in bank capital.\" In a worst-case scenario, IMF stress tests suggested the country's lenders would face a capital shortfall equivalent to 2.5 per cent of China's GDP - about $280 billion in 2016 - together with ballooning soured loans. Overall, 27 of 33 banks stress-tested by the fund, covering about three quarters of China's banking-system assets, were under-capitalised by at least one measure.\nAsia Asian equities were mixed, with stocks rising in Japan, falling in China and South Korea and fluctuating in Hong Kong.

But Donald Trump did it. \n\u201cMy announcement today marks the beginning of a new approach to conflict between Israel and the Palestinians,\u201d Trump said on Wednesday during a speech at the White House. \n\u201cIt is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,\u201d Trump said from a podium flanked by two decorated Christmas trees. \n\u201cWhile previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering.\u201d \nAmong those applauding the move by President Trump was Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. \nNetanyahu issued a statement calling it a \u201chistoric day,\u201d saying \"the Jewish people and the Jewish state will be forever grateful\" to the United States for the decision.

Jerusalem has been the capital of the Jewish people for 3,000 years.\u201d \nThe Israeli mayor of Jerusalem, Nir Barkat, said Trump made the right move and it should have been made by the US long ago. \n\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do. And here in Jerusalem and Israel, we applaud the president,\u201d Barkat told CNN. \nNOW: Jerusalem Old City walls light up in colors of Israeli and American flags as Trump to declare Jerusalem capital of Israel. pic.twitter.com/uu6s1LNRR3 \n\u2014 Israel Breaking (@IsraelBreaking) December 6, 2017 \n\nAmerican evangelicals celebrated today\u2019s announcement on the status of Jerusalem.

We are ecstatic Jerusalem is recognized as Capital! Israel is a sacred place \n\u2014 Paula White-Cain (@Paula_White) December 6, 2017 \n\nBut other religious leaders were critical of Trump\u2019s decision to dispense with nearly 70 years of US foreign policy tradition. \n\u201cJerusalem is a unique city,\u201d Pope Francis said during his weekly appearance at the Vatican, \u201csacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, where the Holy Places for the respective religions are venerated, and it has a special vocation to peace.\u201d \nFrancis said, \u201cI pray to the Lord that such identity be preserved and strengthened for the benefit of the Holy Land, the Middle East and the entire world, and that wisdom and prudence prevail, to avoid adding new elements of tension in a world already shaken and scarred by many cruel conflicts.\u201d \nChristian leaders in the Holy Land expressed concerns about President Trump\u2019s declaration on Jerusalem, warning that \u201cany sudden changes would cause irreparable harm.\u201d \nPalestinian leaders denounced the new American policy in no uncertain terms. President Mahmoud Abbas said Trump has undermined the US role as a mediator between Israel and the Palestinians, hurt the chances of reaching a two-state solution and encouraged the Israeli occupation. \nWhile Trump specifically allowed that a \"two-state solution\" might still emerge from future peace talks, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said , \"President Trump has delivered a message to the Palestinian people: The two-state solution is over. Now is the time to transform the struggle to one of one state with equal rights for everyone living in historic Palestine, from the river to the sea.\" \nJerusalem resident and Israeli lawyer, Daniel Seidemann, expresses similar concerns. \nFrom the trenches in Jerusalem, this is what the conflict looks like tonight: we're in a vehicle w/ no brakes, no steering wheel, the traffic laws are unclear, there is no destination and the driver is an adolescent with a learner's permit and a personality disorder. \n\u2014 Daniel Seidemann (@DanielSeidemann) December 5, 2017 \n\n\u201cFor me, [Jerusalem] is the capital of Israel,\u201d Seidemann tells PRI\u2019s The World. But for the international community, going back to 1948, Seidemann says that the status of Jerusalem is something to be determined in negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. \n\u201cIf I look outside my window, I see a city that is divided, that is bi-national, that\u2019s contested, unsustainable, and no hollow gesture of recognizing or moving a capital is going to change that.\u201d \nPresident Trump said he ordered the State Department to begin preparations for moving the American Embassy, which is currently in Tel Aviv, to Jerusalem. But it\u2019s not clear how long the move would take. \nIn any event, Diana Buttu, a Palestinian Canadian lawyer and former spokeswoman for the Palestine Liberation Organization, says she failed to hear anything positive in President Trump\u2019s speech. \n\u201cHe\u2019s sending the message to Israel that might is right, that they can seize land in violation of international law and with time, that seizure will be recognized.

To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/. \nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: \nSome breaking news from Minnesota tonight. Minnesota Public Radio News reports that Senator Al Franken will announce his resignation from the Senate tomorrow. His decision comes after at least 30 Senate Democrats, including leader Chuck Schumer, today called on Franken to step down. Joining us now from the Capitol is NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis. Hey there. \nSUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey there. \nKELLY: So these allegations of sexual harassment against Franken have been out there for weeks. What changed today that prompted this avalanche of Democrats to call for him to step aside? \nDAVIS: Politico reported this morning about a seventh accuser. It was an anonymous woman, but she alleged that in 2006 then Al Franken, who was a comedian, not yet a senator, had - again - forcibly tried to kiss her. This is what a group of female senators, including New York Democrat Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, said for them was the tipping point. This morning, in a very rapid succession, about a half a dozen female Democratic senators put out statements calling for him to resign. And they sort of started an avalanche. From that point throughout the day, Democrats in the Senate, one after another, just started calling for Franken to resign. \nI spoke to several Democratic aides who had said that this was a conversation that had been happening quietly inside the Democratic caucus for several days now but that it was just determined that it was time for him to go. I do want to add one note of caution - that the senator's office tweeted out that his final decision had not been made. He will make an announcement tomorrow. But Democrats here in the Capitol tonight certainly expect that that announcement will be his resignation. \nKELLY: Now, this, of course, comes just a day after Michigan Democratic Congressman John Conyers resigned over sexual harassment allegations. Is this starting to add up to a message that Democrats are sending? \nDAVIS: You know, we have to also talk about that this is happening, one, in this broader context of this national conversation, and then within politics, it's also happening as the Alabama Senate races is playing out. \nKELLY: Sure. \nDAVIS: And I think Democrats, particularly following President Trump's decision to re-back Roy Moore and for the Republican National Committee to get back into that race even though Moore is facing similar allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault, Democrats want to draw contrasts. Party leaders like Nancy Pelosi are saying that they want to be a party of zero tolerance towards this kind of behavior. And I would note that it might not be over. There are two additional sitting congressmen in the House - a Republican from Texas, Blake Farenthold, and a Democrat from Nevada, Ruben Kihuen - who are facing allegations of sexual harassment, and they are also facing some calls to step aside. \nKELLY: Well, other than calling for lawmakers to step aside, what else is Congress doing in response to all of these allegations? Is there some sort of legislative action, some bill brewing? \nDAVIS: It's actually been quite a lot. Already both chambers in the House and the Senate have passed new rules to mandate sexual harassment training for everyone that works here, including lawmakers, once a year. They also have competing legislation that would affect both internally how sexual harassment is handled inside the Capitol. And today, Gillibrand introduced a bipartisan bill that would essentially end forced arbitration in private companies when - they say as many as 60 million Americans, when you sign up to work for a company, part of your terms of employment or that if you have a sexual harassment complaint, it has to go through a mandatory private arbitration process. They want to get rid of that. \nI would note at this event today that I covered they also had former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson there to make a statement because she was one of these women, these tipping point women, that started this national conversation. So, yeah, you know, there's just - there's significant momentum, and I would say this has bipartisan support. There's a lot of Republicans in support of this legislation who want to capture this cultural moment and send a message that it's time to sort of remake how we think about the American workplace. \nKELLY: And real quick, Sue, to circle you back to Al Franken - if he does say he's resigning, what happens to his seat? \nDAVIS: They have a Democratic governor, it's Mark Dayton. He would get to appoint an interim senator. He's a Democrat, so there's no chance this seat will flip in the short term. Whoever that senator is will have to run for re-election in the 2018 midterms. \nKELLY: And we'll see. Maybe he'll pick a woman. Who knows? Thanks very much, Sue. \nDAVIS: You're welcome. \nKELLY: That's NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis.

By Alex Newman \u2022 7 hours ago Related Program: \nEmployees stitch together blue plaid shirts in a factory in China in 2013. Wages have risen in China, but it still controls more than a third of apparel exports. Jianan Yu/Reuters \nIt took him 32 years, but scientist Sam Hudson and a team of other researchers have found a way to produce silk without silkworms. \nUnlike fabrics such as polyester or nylon, there\u2019s no petroleum-based plastic. Unlike rayon, there\u2019s no toxic chemicals or deforestation involved. \nIt\u2019s a yeast that when you add sugar and vitamins, it grows \u2014 secretes, to be precise \u2014 a spider silk. \n\u201cYou take a tank of water, put the yeast in it and put in the sugar and the salts and the vitamins,\u201d explains Hudson, a polymer chemist at the College of Textiles at North Carolina State University. \u201cThe yeast starts growing and reproducing. It gets a little cloudy, but the yeast manufactures this protein and secretes it out. [We] filter it out and dry it, and we get a whitish powder. That\u2019s where I step in. I take that powder and dissolve it into a solvent, and then we can spin it.\u201d \nHudson is working with Bolt Threads , an Emeryville, California-based biotech startup, to perfect the process of creating spider silk thread. So far, they\u2019ve created 50 neckties and a yellow silk used by designer Stella McCartney in an exhibit for MoMA in New York City called, \u201c Is Fashion Modern ?\u201d \nHudson and Bolt Threads' new fabric is just one solution to the fashion industry\u2019s pollution problem. The garment industry is also guilty of underpaying and overworking workers, polluting the sites where clothes are made and overproducing so much that cast-off clothes are hurting economies in developing countries and filling landfills. \nHudson has spent his entire professional career as a chemist chasing a feasible product. \u201cIt took me 32 years to even hold something in my hand,\u201d he says. \nBolt is nearly able to make a 1-ton batch of silk protein about every three days. How much silk is that? According to Hudson\u2019s math, that one batch is equal to the silk of 20,636,363 spiders. \n\u201cYou just can\u2019t farm spiders,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried.\u201d \nHe\u2019s tried a lot of things to find a way to grow the silk protein found in spiders. \n\u201cThe bacteria didn\u2019t work; the potatoes didn\u2019t work; the silkworms didn\u2019t work,\u201d he says. \u201cWe never had access to sufficient quantities of these materials from some kind of biotech process. We finally found the right organism to make this protein.\u201d \nThe resulting fabric is a silk that can be engineered for more stretch, easy washing or other desirable qualities. And when a consumer is done with it? Since the silk comes from natural materials, the end product will be biodegradable. \nBut it\u2019s a long road before all our clothes will be made from spider silk. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a commodity like polyester,\u201d Hudson says. \u201cBut hopefully, 100 years from now, most of the fibers will be made from some biological process and not petrochemicals.\u201d \nWorldwide production of polyester and nylon has exploded since it was first created in the 1930s. Both materials are made from petroleum-based plastics, and when these things hit a landfill, they don\u2019t biodegrade. \nSome experts estimate that half of the world\u2019s clothing supply is made from synthetic materials and these clothes shed plastic microfibers during the washing cycle, which are now being found all over the planet. \nSo, what should consumers do until spider silk is more common? \nJocelyn Whipple is a materials expert and a member of the global coordination team for Fashion Revolution , an ethical fashion advocacy group. \n\u201cI think the very first thing that people can do is take the time to look at your label before you even buy something and inform yourself about fibers,\u201d Whipple says. \nHer advice: Look for recycled polyester and secondhand clothing and avoid blends, which are nonrecyclable and tend to shed more fibers during washing. \nPolyester and nylon that hasn\u2019t been blended with other fabrics can be melted down and turned back into another fabric. She points to companies like Adidas, which is experimenting with recycled polyester and reclaimed ocean waste.

Adam Beam / AP Originally published on December 6, 2017 8:22 pm \nDavid Ermold once again stepped inside the Rowan County, Ky., courthouse on Wednesday, except this time he wasn't asking for a marriage license \u2014 he was asking for Kim Davis' job. She is the Rowan County clerk who refused Ermold and his partner, among other couples, a marriage license on the basis of her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage. \n\"I have an obligation here, really, to do this and to set things right,\" Ermold told The Associated Press about his decision to run for the position. \"I don't think the other candidates are looking at a larger message.\" \nErmold is an assistant professor of English at the University of Pikeville and has lived in Morehead, in the county, for more than a decade. He received a clear message from Davis when she twice denied him and his now-husband marriage licenses in the summer of 2015, after the Supreme Court effectively legalized same-sex marriage . \nDavis told Ermold that it was \"God's authority\" that kept her from complying with the Supreme Court. She spent time in jail for defying a federal judge's order, was sued by Ermold and Moore and other couples, and rose to international prominence as a symbol of the bitter divide over same-sex marriage, even meeting with the pope in 2015. \nLast month Davis announced that she would be running for re-election, seeking the judgment of voters for the first time since the controversy erupted. \nThe AP described the scene on Wednesday as Ermold, alongside his now-husband, filled out the paperwork to run for office with Davis sitting across from him: \n\"Davis smiled and welcomed them, chatting with them about the state retirement system and the upcoming Christmas holiday. She made sure Ermold had all of his paperwork and signatures to file for office, softly humming the old hymn 'Jesus Paid It All' as her fingers clacked across a keyboard. \n\"When it was over, she stood and shook hands with Ermold, telling him: 'May the best candidate win.' \" \nErmold and Moore finally married in the fall of 2015. \nErmold told Newsweek that he wants to send a message to people who have been discriminated against. \"We need to not just symbolize. We need to send a message out to all these people saying it's OK,\" Ermold said. \"You are important.\" \nErmold, who is running as a Democrat, told the AP that his campaign will be about more than LGBT issues and will focus on fairness and bringing people together. \nHe added, \"It doesn't matter whether I'm LGBT or not. If I'm qualified to do a job, I should be able to do the job.\" \nSocial issues aside, that job is in many ways simply about keeping records. As Ermold's campaign website pledges , \"As county clerk, I will act responsibly with taxpayer money, and I will seek out ways to be cost efficient ... and I will keep accurate records of all transactions.\" \nDavis no longer objects to issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples now that Kentucky changed the rules so clerks no longer have to attach their names to the licenses. \nBut she has maintained her opposition to same-sex marriage, even visiting Romania in October to urge that country to change its constitution to bar same-sex marriage. \nWhen asked on Wednesday whether she thinks she deserves to be re-elected, Davis, who is running as a Republican, told reporters, \"That will be up to the people. I think I do a good job.\" Copyright 2017 NPR.

By Kai Ryssdal and Shaheen Ainpour \u2022 9 hours ago Related Program: Marketplace \nBitcoin has gained $1,000 in value over the last 24 hours. The current exchange rate as of today's date is somewhere around $13,000 to one bitcoin. The frenzy around the cryptocurrency has many wondering if there is a bitcoin bubble. But what if someone had given you a bitcoin several years ago? Would you have cashed out early or ridden the wave? That's exactly the situation journalist Ben Eisen found himself in, and he wrote about it for The Wall Street Journal. Marketplace host Kai Ryssdal talked with Eisen about what happened after he received a rather unorthodox wedding gift. An edited transcript of their conversation follows. \nKai Ryssdal: Give us your bitcoin saga in a nutshell then, would you? \nBen Eisen: Sure. So I received a bitcoin as a wedding gift from a friend who had been into the cryptocurrency, and this was in mid-2015, and I held onto it for about a year and a half. I sold part of it last year after the prices started rising, and then after the price rose a bit more sold all the rest of it at the end of last year. \nRyssdal: For how much? Like a thousand dollars, right? \nEisen: Just below a thousand dollars. And then the price just started surging right after I sold it. \nRyssdal: It is now, I'm sitting here looking at my monitor, it's $12,870 per bitcoin as we speak. Which raises a whole bunch of questions that I want to throw them at you. First of all, is bitcoin a currency, do you think? Or is it just speculation at this point? \nEisen: Well, it's interesting. It was designed as sort of a stateless currency that's not beholden specifically to one government or monetary system. And it started to develop like that, but it's developed as an investment much quicker. You're starting to see a bunch of mainstream investors get into the market, and a couple of exchanges are about to launch futures contracts on bitcoin as a way of actually paying for stuff, not quite as fast. \nRyssdal: Yeah, I mean the mechanics of it are still a little tricky, but the total market cap, if you will, of bitcoin out there is bigger than some, you know, big companies in this economy. It's a force. \nEisen: Yeah, absolutely, it's bigger than General Electric, a bunch of other blue chip companies. It's really gigantic, and there's other cryptocurrencies as well that bring the value up, something like over $300 billion in market cap. \nRyssdal: Do you believe that this is a bubble at $13,000 a pop? \nEisen: I mean, it's really hard to say. I think bubbles are usually kind of determined in hindsight. Just looking at the way the price has gone up, it definitely seems to mirror certain other bubbles that we've seen in the past. \nRyssdal: It is not yet clear what the the regulatory framework will be for bitcoin, right? I mean, the SEC has been looking at this, the Fed, I know, was concerned about it. We don't know what the rules are going to be, do we? \nEisen: No. It's very new. It's moved a lot quicker than the regulatory bodies that typically look at this stuff. That said, there have been something called initial coin offerings, which is sort of an alternative to an initial public offering. And that's a market that's kind of gotten pretty big pretty quickly, and the SEC has started cracking down with some enforcement cases on that. So perhaps that's one area where we could see a little bit more regulation coming in. \nRyssdal: You did all right on the wedding gift you got, right? You say you tripled your money? \nEisen: Something like that, almost tripled the money. It paid off better than the stock market, for sure. \nRyssdal: You say that your buddy who got you this, he just got married and you got him a 30-year Treasury note, right? \nEisen: I did. Yeah. \nRyssdal: Now the question is, and you asked this in your piece, which one's going to be worth more in 30 years? Bitcoin or the 30-year note? \nEisen: Definitely, I mean, it's hard to tell. Treasury notes, they pay very low interest, but they accumulate over a long period of time. This is paid out a lot quicker but remains to be seen what will happen 30 years from now.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shaheen ainpour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kai ryssdal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben eisen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eisen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "general electric", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "treasury", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:05:53.173+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b93ed5a9ae2ae94aa0172e1471acb64371652394", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ9OXReQDzxcjvL.fUr.HjSwZ9EwjW5MFqWGUYg3lRazLUuomDg1vs9uvBZmgZTRQ1bSgLOZQEEO9QvVh6lLLRbOmsd08jofgw-", "site_full": "finnewsreview.com", "site": "finnewsreview.com", "site_section": "http://finnewsreview.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Financial News Review", "title": "How is Applied Industrial Technologies (AIT) Trending?", "title_full": "How is Applied Industrial Technologies (AIT) Trending?", "published": "2017-12-07T11:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://finnewsreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/14.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b93ed5a9ae2ae94aa0172e1471acb64371652394", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ9OXReQDzxcjvL.fUr.HjSwZ9EwjW5MFqWGUYg3lRazLUuomDg1vs9uvBZmgZTRQ1bSgLOZQEEO9QvVh6lLLRbOmsd08jofgw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Financial News Staff", "published": "2017-12-07T11:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "How is Applied Industrial Technologies (AIT) Trending?", "text": "How is Applied Industrial Technologies (AIT) Trending?   \nApplied Industrial Technologies (AIT) moved -0.45% in the most recent session, touching a recent bid of 63.60. Current price levels place the shares above the rising trendline. \nA principle of technical analysis is that once a trend has been formed (two or more peaks/troughs have touched the trendline and reversed direction) it will remain intact until broken. That sounds much more simplistic than it is! The goal is to analyze the current trend using trendlines and then either invest with the current trend until the trendline is broken, or wait for the trendline to be broken and then invest with the new (opposite) trend. \nOne of the basic tenets put forth by Charles Dow in the Dow Theory is that security prices do trend. Trends are often measured and identified by \u201ctrendlines.\u201d A trendline is a sloping line that is drawn between two or more prominent points on a chart. Rising trends are defined by a trendline that is drawn between two or more troughs (low points) to identify price support. Falling trend-s are defined by trendlines that are drawn between two or more peaks (high points) to identify price resistance. \nTaking a glance from a technical standpoint, Applied Industrial Technologies (AIT) presently   69.11. Typically, the CCI oscillates above and below a zero line. Normal oscillations tend to stay in the range of -100 to +100. A CCI reading of +100 may represent overbought conditions, while readings near -100 may indicate oversold territory. Although the CCI indicator was developed for commodities, it has become a popular tool for equity evaluation as well. \nThe 14-day ADX for Applied Industrial Technologies (AIT) is currently sitting at 15.78. Generally speaking, an ADX value from 0-25 would indicate an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would indicate a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would signal a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would indicate an extremely strong trend. The ADX is a technical indicator developed by J. Welles Wilder used to determine the strength of a trend. The ADX is often used along with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to identify the direction of the trend. \nMoving average indicators are used widely for stock analysis. Many traders will use a combination of moving averages with different time frames to help review stock trend direction. One of the more popular combinations is to use the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Investors may use the 200-day MA to help smooth out the data a get a clearer long-term picture. They may look to the 50-day or 20-day to get a better grasp of what is going on with the stock in the near-term. Narrowing in on Moving Averages, the 200-day for Applied Industrial Technologies (AIT) is at 60.31, the 50-day is 63.35, and the 7-day is resting at 63.74. The RSI is computed based on the speed and direction of a stock\u2019s price movement. The RSI is considered to be an internal strength indicator, not to be confused with relative strength which is compared to other stocks and indices. The RSI value will always move between 0 and 100. One of the most popular time frames using RSI is the 14-day. The 14-day RSI is presently standing at 55.96, the 7-day sits at 57.49, and the 3-day is resting at 43.24. \nInvestors may be watching other technical indicators such as the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. The Williams %R is a momentum indicator that helps measure oversold and overbought levels. This indicator compares the closing price of a stock in relation to the highs and lows over a certain time period. A common look back period is 14 days.

Tommy Adaptive \nMany young girls take fashion cues from their Barbie dolls, and I suppose I was no different. OK, I was pretty different. I have spastic diplegic cerebral palsy , and when I was about 10, someone gave me a Share-a-Smile Becky . \nThough I am mobile without the aid of a wheelchair (unlike Becky), my awkward gait is a noticeable marker of physical disability, and I have used walkers in the past and currently wear ankle-foot orthoses to gain greater balance. \nNo doubt, the giver of the Becky doll wanted me to have a toy that made me feel represented as a child with a physical disability. This impulse is positive, and Becky has helped girls who use wheelchairs see themselves in the world . \nAs I played with Becky, however, I couldn\u2019t help noticing the ways her body and her clothes marked her as unlike my other Barbie dolls. Her knees were bendable, which, looking back, actually made her more mobile than my typically straight-legged dolls. At the time, her bent knees just emphasized to me the degree to which she belonged in her chair and not with the other Barbies. \nWorse, she did not come with the satin party dresses and spiked heels that accompanied my favorite Barbies \u2014 accessories that telegraphed the exciting mysteries of adulthood. Instead, she wore pants and sneakers that seemed casual and boring. Combined, these differences worked to tell me that bodies with disabilities, bodies like mine, should be concerned with function rather than fashion. \nThis story is a part of a special Across Women's Lives series.

And, participate in our i nteractive : How fair is your fashion? Take the quiz. \nOne company currently trying to situate itself at the intersection of adaptive clothing technology and on-trend fashion is Tommy Hilfiger. Its Tommy Adaptive line began with children\u2019s clothes in 2016, as a collaboration with the nonprofit Runway of Dreams , which describes itself as \u201cworking with the fashion industry to adapt mainstream clothing lines for the differently-abled community.\u201d \nHilfiger himself echoed this language in a statement about Tommy Adaptive\u2019s decision to expand to include clothes for men and women: \u201cInclusivity and the democratization of fashion have always been at the core of my brand's DNA. These collections continue to build on that vision, empowering differently-abled adults to express themselves through fashion.\" \nDisability theorist Simi Linton notes that terms like \u201cdifferently abled,\u201d \u201cspecial\u201d and \u201cphysically challenged\u201d appear accepting on the surface, but are used more by able-bodied people than by people with disabilities themselves. Thus, they \u201cconvey the boosterism and do-gooder mentality endemic\u201d of a paternalistic, privileged group helping a marginalized one without viewing them as complex human beings. \nThere is a marked difference between the language Hilfiger and Runway of Dreams use and the terminology around the Cerebral Palsy Foundation\u2019s 2017 Design for Disability challenge, which is an equal collaboration between people with disabilities and design students. The foundation, along with design students from Parsons, Pratt Institute and the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, produced six adaptive lines, culminating in a fashion show. The models (who have various disabilities) were involved in the entire creative process alongside the designers. \nIn one video from the competition , model Jessica Yates talks about the conflict between how able-bodied people sometimes see her and how she sees herself: \u201cI think that when you\u2019re disabled, you don\u2019t get to be rough-and-tumble as much as we actually are. We\u2019re really, like, kind of badass.\u201d Designer Dominique Kelly describes the clothes she makes with input from Yates and her other models as \u201ctrendy and stylish,\u201d and says, \u201c[The models] all want to look great. Who doesn\u2019t?\u201d \nSuch a spirit of collaboration and beginning from a place of commonality, rather than difference, seems truer to creating fashion that is inclusive and adaptive. \nWhat\u2019s good about the Tommy Adaptive lines, though, is that the company mentions how hard they've worked to ensure that the adaptive line looks as much like the designer's clothes for able-bodied children as possible and costs the same. Blogger Ellen Seidman says of the children's line, on her site, Love That Max , \"Clothes like these will be a game-changer for our kids. Not only will they have more autonomy, they'll better fit in with their peers, given that the clothes have the usual cool, crisp, Tommy style.\" \nTommy Adaptive also says that Tommy Hilfiger and his wife have children with autism, so they\u2019re personally connected to the issue. So, I want to make clear that despite the line\u2019s use of outdated language, there\u2019s a lot of positives there. They are trying, and mostly succeeding. \nAnd there are others making good strides, too. Like Schuler Shoes in St Louis Park, not far from where I live in Minnetonka, Minnesota. When I first got my new ankle-foot orthoses a few months ago, they spent lots of time with me, listening to my style preferences and helping me find shoes that I liked that also fit over the braces. I bought these in extra-wide with removable soles and they match my jeans and look professional enough for work while still making me feel young and cute. \nIn my post- Barbie-playing years, I\u2019ve gotten married, earned three degrees, had jobs in two different fields, and moved from the Florida sunshine to the Minnesota cold. All of these changes have made me consider my body\u2019s relationship to my clothes and shoes in new ways. Balancing professionalism, accessibility and fashion will always be an issue for me, but I have learned that that balance will shift from circumstance to circumstance, and that\u2019s OK. \nSometimes fashion needs to give way to function \u2014 I\u2019m going to feel more like the Michelin man than a cute, young professional when I yank on snow boots big enough to accommodate my orthotics, but I\u2019ll be less likely to fall down. On the other hand, I don\u2019t need to feel guilty for skipping my AFOs to wear skinny jeans and my favorite heeled riding boots on a date night with my husband. Those choices can accommodate the many facets of my life. \nHere\u2019s a list, below, of some of the companies and designers that don\u2019t sacrifice fashion in the name of accessibility \u2014 and also seem to recognize disability as both a spectrum of conditions and a single part of a person\u2019s complex life. My list contains items for both children and adults, but it\u2019s by no means exhaustive, so feel free to add to it in the comments of this article. \n1. Cat & Jack\u2019s adaptive expansion : Target describes its Cat & Jack line, established in July 2016 , as \u201ckids\u2019 clothing with an imagination all its own.\u201d The line, which was made with ideas and feedback from children themselves, lives up to that description. Its clothes come in bright, cheerful colors and display animals, rainbows and positive affirmations, all of which connote children as people with rich inner lives. Its adaptive expansion was released in October 2017 and recognizes the needs of a range of disabilities. The expansion includes pajamas and bodysuits with hidden abdominal openings for those using gastrostomy tubes , tagless and sensory friendly items with zippers that can be worn in the back or the front, and wheelchair-friendly jackets that open on the side to make it easier for children to dress themselves. \n2. Converse Kids All-Star Easy Slip : When I was in kindergarten, I wanted nothing more than a pair of Chuck Taylors like my big brother\u2019s, but they wouldn\u2019t fit over my ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs). Lucky for today\u2019s kids with disabilities, these classic sneakers now come in adaptive versions with elastic laces and easy-open flaps at the ankle, making them fit over a variety of orthotics and inserts much easier without requiring assistance. They come in \u201cbig kid\u201d and \u201clittle kid\u201d sizes for both boys and girls, making it easier for kids of all ages and abilities to play together and look cool doing it. Unfortunately for me, they don\u2019t yet come in adult sizes. \n3. Zappos.com : If, like me, you\u2019re an adult who\u2019s a little bummed about the above, online shoe and clothing warehouse Zappos offers an entire section of adaptive shoes and clothes for men, women and children from a variety of styles and brands. Subcategories include orthotic-friendly shoes, reversible clothes \u2014 good for people with limited mobility because they do not have a defined front or back, meaning that there\u2019s less work flipping the garment around to put it on \u2014 and sensory-friendly items that come without buttons, zippers or tags. This convenient, searchable resource recognizes that people with disabilities are not monolithic and that we deserve an easy online shopping experience. \nIn fact, I\u2019m considering treating myself to these fun Mary Janes for my birthday in a couple of months. The strap looks wide enough to clear my AFO hinges easily, and the pattern will give me some joy during early spring when I\u2019m ready for the snow to melt for good here in Minnesota. \n4. Bezgraniz Couture : If your taste is more glam, check out this Russian designer line . They did a fully adaptive show at LA Fashion Week 2016 , and they don\u2019t just design clothes. The company also funds an art festival and has an educational partnership that teaches designers the principles behind adaptive clothes. Their website states that their ultimate goal is the \u201crebranding of disability\u201d in the public sphere.

AP \nHigh-ranking U.S.-based Volkswagen executive, Oliver Schmidt, has been sentenced to seven years in prison and ordered to pay a $400,000 fine for his part in a decadelong diesel-emissions cheating scandal. \nSchmidt was the chief of Volkswagen's engineering and environmental office in Michigan. In August, he pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to defraud the federal government and violation of the Clean Air Act by participating in a scheme to circumvent federal emissions tests with rigged devices in diesel cars. Federal regulators uncovered the plot in 2015. \nVolkswagen already has admitted guilt to charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, customs violations, obstruction of justice, as well as violation of the Clean Air Act. The German company has paid more than $20 billion in fines and settlements. \nIn a letter to U.S. District Judge Sean Cox of Detroit, Schmidt acknowledged his guilt. Reading a written statement in court, Schmidt broke down saying, \"I made bad decisions and for that I am sorry.\" \nFederal prosecutors also have charged eight other current or former Volkswagen executives. As The New York Times reports: \n\"But most of the people suspected of taking part in a conspiracy to defraud United States regulators are out of reach of American justice in Germany, which normally does not extradite its own citizens. Mr. Schmidt may well turn out to suffer the harshest punishment for the emissions fraud even though he was not by any means the only participant or the highest ranking.\" \nSchmidt was arrested in January while vacationing in Miami with his wife.

Read More Sgt Harry Tangye says some South Western emergency ambulances just don't show up when called by Devon and Cornwall Police \nHe wants to ask the ambulance service why it took so long for the ambulance to be sent, and to ask a doctor whether earlier medical intervention could have saved Mr Woods\u2019 life. \nSusan Fisher, Mr Woods\u2019 mother, told the coroner in a written statement that they had moved to Bude three and a half years ago and he had attended Budehaven Community School. \nShe said: \u201cHe was a happy-go-lucky type of person. I last saw him on Friday, April 7. We chatted for an hour or so. I dropped him off outside his home. He was in good spirits.\u201d \nDC Gary Page, of Launceston CID, told the coroner that CCTV footage showed Mr Woods left his home at 6.26pm that day. \nConnor Salt, saw him in BED (Bude\u2019s End Destination, a nightclub) later that night. Read More South West Ambulance Service Trust thrust into darkness by a serious systems crash \nHe said: \u201cWe got on straight away and would help each other out when we had problems. He was a nice person who worked hard and was really smart. He was never into drugs. He started to use recreational drugs and I knew he had used cocaine, MDMA, and ketamine. He was getting them straight from the dealer. This is something I wasn\u2019t happy with and never encouraged. He was down because he was worried about his stepfather who was unwell. \n\u201cI saw him in BED and we left together. He suggested we get some drugs so we went back to his place to get money. We went to a house I didn\u2019t know where there was one male and two females. Oliver started asking how he could get drugs. I became worried they were going to take drugs so I left. On Sunday I was told he had died from a drug overdose. I was devastated.\u201d \nCCTV footage of a communal hallway showed Mr Woods next entered Saratoga House, 1 Downs View, which police refer to as a \u201cproblem premises\u201d, at 3.37am. At 4.13am he is seen going upstairs and returns downstairs at 4.20am, now in an \u201capparent playful state\u201d, according to DC Page. Within 20 minutes this has become an \u201cagitated, erratic state\u201d. Read More NHS accused of clinical negligence over death of suicidal Tina McLean of Penryn \nAccording to Ricky Chard, whose flat Mr Wood was in, he told the group he had \u201cdropped three pills\u201d. Mr Chard said: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t making any sense. He began to lose it completely and kicked a hole in my wall. We called an ambulance.\u201d \nPC Christopher Moore and his colleague were informed at 5.30am of a reported drug overdose at Saratoga House. The officers were met outside by two males and taken inside. \nPC Moore said: \u201cOliver Woods was sat on a mattress on the floor. I could see he was in the midst of a serious medical episode. This was a medical emergency and he needed to get into an ambulance immediately. When the ambulance arrived I had to handcuff and restrain him so the paramedics could assist him because he was resisting.\u201d \nParamedics described him as \u201cagitated\u201d, with a high temperature and fast heartbeat, and he was taken to North Devon District Hospital at 5.44am. File photo \nThe intensive care unit team tried to cool him down and intubated him. He suffered a cardiac arrest and they started CPR immediately. He did not respond and they stopped attempting resuscitation at 8.20am. \nDC Page told the coroner: \u201cThere is no sign he was given the pills without his knowledge or agreement. People normally take one, in my experience. Someone supplied these drugs to Oliver but proving who is very difficult.\u201d \nCoroner John Tomalin told the court: \u201cThere are two issues here: why was there a delay in getting the ambulance to Oliver, and if he had been seen by a doctor sooner, would that have made a difference? I cannot answer these questions at present. \n\u201cIn one sense we know what he had died from and I can answer the inquest questions that have been set out by statue. But I will adjourn this to put those two questions to the ambulance service and the doctor.\u201d Like us on Facebook ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

have announced new restrictions on \"smart luggage\" because of the fire hazard posed by lithium-ion batteries in cargo holds. The airlines say any such batteries need to be removable. Rob Carr / Getty Images Originally published on December 6, 2017 7:42 pm \nAirlines including American, Delta and Alaska have announced restrictions on so-called smart luggage because the lithium-ion batteries found in many of these suitcases pose a fire risk. \nThese kinds of bags have proliferated in recent years, including motorized suitcases you can ride and one pitched as an autonomous \" robot companion \" that follows you around. \nPrices can range from $275 to more than $1,000 , depending on a bag's bells and whistles, like device charging, GPS tracking, remote locking and built-in weight sensors. But these features require power, often in the form of lithium-ion batteries. \nThe batteries are in many electronics these days, because they are extremely efficient . But li-ion batteries have the potential to overheat and ignite, as shown in dramatic fashion by the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which the Department of Transportation banned from flights last fall after dozens of reports of the smartphone's batteries smoking, catching fire and exploding . In 2015, many airlines banned hoverboards owing to similar concerns. \n\"Beginning Jan. 15, customers who travel with a smart bag must be able to remove the battery in case the bag has to be checked at any point in the customer's journey. If the battery cannot be removed, the bag will not be allowed,\" American said in a statement on Friday. The same day, Delta and Alaska announced similar policies on their flights. \nAmerican's policy dictates that if the bag is carry-on size, passengers can take the luggage onboard, so long as the battery can be removed if needed. If passengers need to check the bag, the battery must be removed and carried onboard. But if the bag has a nonremovable battery, it can't be checked or carried on. \nAn FAA spokesman told The Washington Post that the airlines' policies are \"consistent with our guidance that lithium-ion batteries should not be carried in the cargo hold.\" \nThe FAA's policy on portable electronic devices containing these batteries states: \n\"Devices containing lithium metal or lithium ion batteries (laptops, smartphones, tablets, etc.) should be carried in carry-on baggage when possible. When these devices must be carried in checked baggage, they should be turned completely off, protected from accidental activation, and packed so they are protected from damage. \n\"Spare (uninstalled) lithium metal and lithium ion batteries are always prohibited in checked baggage and must be placed in carry-on. When a carry-on bag is checked at the gate or at planeside, any spare lithium batteries must be removed from the bag and kept with the passenger in the aircraft cabin.\" \nIn May, the International Air Transport Association, an airline trade association, published suggested smart bag guidelines for airlines. Its list of hazards and potential consequences is enough to make any flyer a little nervous. \nA spokesman for American tells NPR that rules banning the bags' powerful lithium batteries from checked baggage aren't because they're more likely to catch fire in a cargo hold, but because it's hard to fight a fire that breaks out there. \n\"You have very limited options in the cargo hold,\" American spokesman Ross Feinstein says. If a fire starts there, the crew can use fire suppression bottles to fight it, \"but you can only deploy them once.\" \n\"In the cabin, passengers and crew can fight a fire,\" he adds. \nFor manufacturers of luggage with nonremovable batteries , the airlines' restrictions are a blow. \n\"Before and at the time of production, we did our due diligence to make sure that we complied with all international regulations defined by DOT and FAA,\" one such company, Bluesmart, said on its website . \"While most airlines understand and approve of smart luggage, others might still be getting up to speed. We are saddened by these latest changes to some airline regulations and feel it is a step back not only for travel technology but it also presents an obstacle to streamlining and improving the way we all travel.\" \nSome luggage makers advertise that their bags are \"TSA-approved.\" \nBut TSA does not approve or endorse bags. And Feinstein says that on American, there won't be any exemptions to its policies, no matter the manufacturer. \n\"We know these bags are getting popular,\" Feinstein says. \"American is not opposed to smart bags. However, the battery must be removable.\" Copyright 2017 NPR.

The city now has four major wildfires burning nearby. Just to describe it, it looks like there's a massive layer of smoke over the city that we can see. \nI can see smoke from the biggest of these wildfires. That's the Thomas Fire just up the coast in Ventura County. That one has burned more than 65,000 acres. You can also see smoke from the closest fire, the Skirball Fire, which actually closed one of LA's biggest freeway interchanges this morning. \nOn the line are reporters who are covering these two fires. We have Stephanie O'Neill in Ventura County and KQED's John Sepulvado in LA. Hello to both of you. \nSTEPHANIE O'NEILL, BYLINE: Hello. \nJOHN SEPULVADO, BYLINE: Hi. \nMCEVERS: So John, we'll start with you. What are you seeing there at the Skirball Fire? \n(SOUNDBITE OF SIREN) \nSEPULVADO: Well, what I'm seeing is probably what your listeners are hearing, which is large fire trucks pass through. They're headed a little bit north of here where the Getty Museum is. That neighborhood right now is still under considerable danger, but we have started to see some beat back of this fire. \nIt is not as smoky as it was earlier. The smoke that is happening is not being spread throughout the Los Angeles area as it was. It's kind of rising straight up, which means that the winds aren't blowing it around. And it actually looks a lot like an idyllic Christmas if you switch out the ash for snow or snow for ash. It is falling a white ash right now. It's like... \nMCEVERS: Wow. \nSEPULVADO: ...Reminds me of my aunt's old ashtray. \nMCEVERS: You know, you mentioned that this is near the Getty Museum. This is this renowned museum here in LA. What are authorities saying about the danger to that or to other parts of LA? \nSEPULVADO: Well, the Getty Museum is believed to be really protected partly because of design. TMZ had an article out today about how it was designed to withstand massive heat and fires and also because it has a filtration system to protect some of the world's most valuable arts. As for the rest of the neighborhood, Fire Chief of LA Ralph Terrazas said this earlier about conditions. \n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) \nCHIEF RALPH TERRAZAS: Right now we're experiencing favorable wind conditions, but we are anticipating a continuation of the red-flag conditions throughout the week, at least until Friday. \nSEPULVADO: And of course, these red-flag conditions are what helped spread the fire from where Stephanie's at to where I am now. \nMCEVERS: And Stephanie, yeah. Let's talk to you. You're in the town of Ojai. Tell us what's happening there. \nO'NEILL: Well, today the winds have calmed down dramatically. And while that's great news, it has left the Ojai Valley completely socked in with smoke. And ash particles, like John described, have been falling down like rain, so the air's really unhealthful here. \nBut most notable today was the arrival of the cavalry. Dozens of fire tankers, engines and at least four bulldozers rolled in this morning in anticipation of an afternoon wind shift that sent the fire back up toward us here in Ojai, where it's consuming unburnt fuel. And then tonight, strong Santa Ana winds predicted with gusts as high as 70 miles per hour are expected to turn the fire back toward the ocean. So things are still quite erratic here. \nMCEVERS: Yesterday when we talked, it seemed like authorities were focused on getting people evacuated, getting people out. What's their focus today? \nO'NEILL: Today the focus is on building a line of protection against the fire with all the equipment and crew who arrived. And that's a big change from yesterday when I literally watched houses burn down right in front of me with no firefighters anywhere in sight. \nToday I spent much of the day in Ojai's upper valley, where I could see this hopscotching of the fire through the valley that - where it burned yesterday. And you could see that one house was burned down while one just adjacent to it was left standing. And then a number of folks I spoke with today didn't heed the mandatory evacuation order. They stayed to defend their homes, and some of them were successful, and some were not. \nMCEVERS: And quick question for both of you, Stephanie and John. I mean, it's been a few years since we've seen fires this big in Southern California. How prepared are people to evacuate and handle these fires? Stephanie, you first. \nO'NEILL: Well, in Ojai, people aren't really surprised. It's a mountainous zone. But that being said, you're never really prepared for something like this, so you just grab your precious things and get out. \nSEPULVADO: And here in Los Angeles, this is home to some of the most exclusive homes, I should say, in the world. They actually are paying for their own private firefighters to come and mitigate the effects of this. So we're seeing... \nMCEVERS: OK. \nSEPULVADO: ...For people who have money, they're preparing by hopefully not getting burned in the first place. \nMCEVERS: John Sepulvado and Stephanie O'Neill, thank you both. \nO'NEILL: Thank you. \nSEPULVADO: Thank you.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nStaff at a west Cornwall wildlife sanctuary who have hand-reared an adorable Palm Cockatoo chick are reflecting on its start to life so far. \nThe tiny but demanding chick, Herbert, is being cared for by the keepers at Paradise Park in Hayle . \nThe responsibility of raising him fell to Leanne Gilbert and Sarah-Jayne Cooke. \n\u201cHerbert\u2019s parents have produced an egg several times in the past two years but always broken them before they got a chance to hatch\u201d, said Leanne.

(Image: Paradise Park) \nFortunately Herbery hatched successfully. These cockatoos take a long time to raise and the keepers have been hand-rearing Herbert for nearly three months now. \n\u201cSoon Herbert will move over to solid food but at present, he is fed what is called \u2018Witches Brew\u2019\u201d, said Leanne. \n\u201cA blended mix of carrot, apple, broccoli, macadamia nuts, smooth peanut butter and macaw formula.

He is already showing interest in chewing carrot sticks.\u201d \nThis species of cockatoo is slow to reproduce as just one egg is laid at a time and the chick is in the nest for at least 80 days and then stays with its parents for about a year. \nAlthough rarely seen in aviaries, in the wild they have a large range and are thought to be quite common in remote areas of New Guinea, although rare around settlements. \nThe unusual patch of bare skin on their cheeks blushes bright red when they call to a mate or defend their territory which makes them very expressive.

Stories coming out of Libya have been gruesome, highly unbelievable. What has been playing out in Libya, a sovereign state in the Maghreb region of North Africa, has been so pathetic, dehumanizing to say the least. Indeed, it is one story that should actually belong to the dark ages. \n\nMigrants\u2026 bought and sold in car parks Libya, it would be recalled, descended into a civil war in 2014, and is widely considered a failed state. Incidentally, the chaos-ridden country has long been a major transit hub for people trying to reach Europe. And many have fallen prey to serious abuse in the North African country at the hands of traffickers among other heartless beings. So today, all over the media, pictures are being splashed of young African men, especially, and women in their very productive years undergoing one form of torture or the other in the hands of Libyan officials. The women are in addition molested, sexually, and oftentimes, forced to drink the urine of their captors, who directly do that right into their mouths.b The men among them are mostly tied to walls, iron rods and often times beaten to death. Or even roasted alive! They are sold into slavery, also, where they are murdered, mutilated, tortured or worked to death. One of the victims in a story online, who had opportunity to place a call from where they were being held captive, narrated to a relation back in Nigeria his unimaginable experience. According to him, he would be dead any moment from the time he was speaking, if no one came to his rescue by providing the amount of dollars being demanded of him for his freedom. A delay, he said, would see him killed by his captors, who would then harvest his organs and sell to willing buyers. Although this barbaric treatment on migrants has always been there, the very brutal dimension was blown open when a CNN news report showed video evidence of illegal African migrants, among them Nigerians, en route to Europe but captured by Libyan authorities. They were being sold off for various amounts in the range of $400. Incidentally, Italy, the country where most of the girls end up as prostitutes, is alleged to be paying the same Libyan traffickers more money in order to stop them from sending migrants on boats to their country (Italy). This EU policy of helping Libyan authorities intercept people trying to cross the Mediterranean and return them to prisons, so to speak, is inhuman and the suffering of the migrants detained in Libya is no doubt an outrage to the conscience of humanity. The international community therefore, cannot continue to turn a blind eye to the unimaginable horrors endured by migrants in Libya, and pretend that the situation can be remedied only by improving conditions in detention. As a matter of fact, the situation in Libya is best described as modern day slavery. With many young Nigerians among the victims, it calls for urgent action from both the government, National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) as well as other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to sensitise young Nigerians on the dangers of submitting themselves to traffickers in a desperate bid for greener pastures in Europe. It also calls on the Federal Government to, as a matter of urgency, liaise directly with the government of Libya to free those who have been enslaved with the view of also stopping the slave trade immediately. A situation where about 27,000 Nigerians are said to have died in their failed, though illegal bid to cross into Europe, is unacceptable and is the more reason why those still nursing such ideas must be urged to perish the very risky venture. Thankfully, President Muhammadu Buhari has assured that all necessary steps will be taken to stem the tide of illegal migration by Nigerians, adding that all Nigerians stranded in Tripoli would be brought home. This is indeed, a welcome development. And the president who said this during an interactive session with members of the Nigerian Community in Cote D\u2019Ivoire on the margins of the 5th AU-EU Summit, would add that to reduce the number of Nigerians heading for Europe illegally through the Sahara Desert and the Mediterranean Sea, basic social amenities such as education, healthcare, and food security must be provided at home. It is hoped that these words would, as a matter of urgency, be matched with action, for when all that is put in place, there would likely be no need for any young Nigerian, a vital segment of the country\u2019s future, will have no need risking their lives for imaginary jobs abroad, even when they are not sure of reaching their destination alive. Young Nigerians must be encouraged to make demands on their creativity and ingenuity in order to survive the tough times, rather than succumbing to the allure of a false paradise abroad. In addition, every effort aimed at imposing sanctions on the people involved in the Libya\u2019s slave trade of African refugees and migrants, must be supported. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "muhammadu buhari", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national agency for prohibition of trafficking", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "libya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cote d\u2019ivoire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mediterranean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tripoli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sahara desert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mediterranean sea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:05:54.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c7ead35c1ef03746a6f0da164a80b8d55d5881d5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrNtR1qz6IwmHFtZweS1VHcJcbfKL2bu2VjHb_63RY4ON99a_Oaztyobbo4FIRq8M1HMrGwyzdHXc0HegsqU72j.EqqUPj1WzNXWeAf_w1eapEyvwDrBZ61", "site_full": "shiriallwood.tumblr.com", "site": "tumblr.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Ambidextrously Erotic \u2014 shiriallwood: Last of the GIFs from Daddy\u2019s...", "title_full": "Ambidextrously Erotic \u2014 shiriallwood: Last of the GIFs from Daddy\u2019s...", "published": "2017-12-07T16:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.649, "main_image": "https://78.media.tumblr.com/2759f5728c1941b06148efcfec9133b3/tumblr_p01m49iQr41sp2dw3o5_540.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c7ead35c1ef03746a6f0da164a80b8d55d5881d5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrNtR1qz6IwmHFtZweS1VHcJcbfKL2bu2VjHb_63RY4ON99a_Oaztyobbo4FIRq8M1HMrGwyzdHXc0HegsqU72j.EqqUPj1WzNXWeAf_w1eapEyvwDrBZ61", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T16:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "Ambidextrously Erotic \u2014 shiriallwood: Last of the GIFs from Daddy\u2019s...", "text": "Ambidextrously Erotic Welcome to the wide world of sexuality.

In 2013, Cornwall Council introduced the Bodmin Town Framework, a plan looking to reinforce the town as a \"sustainable and vibrant community\" by creating better job and housing opportunities. \nCornwall Live is looking into the proposal as part of a series of articles. In the previous story , we showed you how County Hall was planning to build 3,000 new homes by 2030, increasing Bodmin's population by more than 30%. \nBut the local authority also set itself another target, which is to economically revive the town. By 2030, Bodmin is expected to have many more offices and industries, a much more active town centre and 650 new jobs. The satellite image of Bodmin will be quite different once all of the town's housing developments and employment sites will be completed (Image: Google Earth) What issues has Cornwall Council identified? \nAlthough there seems to be enough job opportunities in Bodmin for most of the residents, County Hall has highlighted that the main issue is the quality of the offered jobs. \n\"This work has generally been in lower skilled occupations and subsequently lower pay,\" the town's framework stressed. \n\"Currently wage levels for Bodmin and surrounding area is \u00a3392, which is only 78% of the national average (\u00a3504).\" \nThe issues raised were then the lack of high quality offices for businesses, a poor image, poor retail offer in the town centre and a lack of appropriate skills from locals. \nCornwall Council added that the objectives were mainly to improve the quality of jobs, improve the town centre and the tourism offer. Read More The six major projects that will change everything in Bodmin This is what the proposal contained: \nThe Bodmin Town Framework has promised to deliver \"at least 7,700sqm of additional office space and 8,800sqm of industrial space\" by 2030, thus creating up to 650 jobs during this period of time. \nFor this purpose, Cornwall Council identified seven places where new employment sites could be built. Beacon Technology Park: The plan was to deliver high quality premises, mainly offices. About 15- 16,000sqm of space were planned on site. Bodmin town centre : No target was set as for the number of offices that could be built, however these would be restricted to upper storeys Callywith Urban Village: Between six and eight hectares for offices and industries were planned on this site opposite Old Callywith Road. Castle Street: Offices were planned there as well as light industries. However, no size was planned as part of the plan. Cooksland Industrial Estate: Cornwall Council wanted the site to be extended. St Lawrence Urban Extension: A minimum of 2,000sqm of offices and light industries was planned as part of the town framework. Priory Urban Extension: About 1 or 2,000sqm of commercial space were offered in the north of Priory Road. This is the map Cornwall Council shared in 2013 to highlight their housing proposal for Bodmin and on top of this will be the employment sites \nThe framework also looked into the shopping offer in Bodmin. It concluded that although residents and an increasing population would need extra shops, food shopping would not be an issue. \nThe document states: \"Even with the proposed increase in population, it is suggested that there will only be the need for approximately 500sqm of additional food related retail floorspace at the end of the plan period. \n\"The same study also indicates that approximately 5-6,000sqm of retail floorspace should be created by 2030, to provide for the additional demand (assuming the same low proportion of residents spending being retained in the area); although this could rise if two extant, currently unimplemented, planning permissions do not come forward.\" \nIt added that the effort should be focused on improving the \"non-bulky town centre offer\".

The town's framework states that it should also be focused on improving the \"non-bulky town centre offer\" (Image: Google Street View) \n\"This was followed up three years later by the Bodmin Town Framework \u2013 designed to support the development of growth, particularly economic growth in Bodmin. It is important to note that these are long term aims for the town and require significant investment to deliver.\" \nThey are now looking into delivering new offices at Beacon Technology Park and in Bodmin town centre. \n\"Bodmin is an important economic hub and we are keen to maintain and enhance its economic role,\" Cornwall Council added. \n\"There are various proposals within the Cornwall Site Allocations DPD and Bodmin Town Framework to support these ambitions, including the safeguarding of existing industrial estates, as well as delivering new employment sites at Callywith, Beacon Technology Park and in the town centre. \n\"We are working with a range of partners to take forward a range of other projects which will support the town\u2019s economy, improve infrastructure and support the regeneration of Bodmin.\" Like us on Facebook ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bodmin",

every so often someone becomes more attuned to their elemental leaning and develops true power. When an evil Elemental known as Thanatos arrived in Olympus City, it saw the rise of its first hero\u2014Zeus. But the death toll caused by defeating Thanatos changed Zeus, who by day is young detective Danny Grant. \n\nIt\u2019s been six months since Thanatos terrorized the city at the start of Lovesick Gods. Danny should be used to his duty behind the mask, but the recent past haunts him. His girlfriend left him, he snaps at the barest provocation, his life feels empty\u2014he needs an outlet, any outlet to pull him out of his depression. \n\nEnter notorious thief Malcolm Cho, the Ice Elemental Prometheus. There was a time when Danny welcomed a fight with Cho, filled with colorful banter and casual flirtations that were a relief compared to Thanatos. Even as a criminal, Cho had recognized the threat Thanatos posed and promised to help Danny stop him, but the day Danny needed Cho, he never showed. Cho was the reason so many people died that day\u2014including Danny\u2019s mother. \n\nDanny decides to teach the man a lesson and fan the fire of their attraction into something more. At worst, he\u2019ll get some no-strings-attached sex out of the deal and finally blow off steam; at best, he\u2019ll get Cho to fall in love with him and then break his heart to spite him. Danny doesn\u2019t expect to fall for Cho in the process, and he certainly can\u2019t predict the much darker threat on the horizon. \n\n\nExclusive Excerpt: Danny hissed as Lynn cracked his nose back into place, then handed him a damp cloth to wipe away the blood. She\u2019d done the same for Camo first, cleaned him up as best she could so he\u2019d be able to rest comfortably in one of the morgue\u2019s store rooms until morning. \nIt might seem morbid that they held criminals in the precinct\u2019s old morgue before transport to the Elemental wing, but it was the most secure place in the building, even more secure than the actual morgue. \nThe whole past year of Danny\u2019s life had been built on coincidence. After the encounter with Thanatos that triggered his Elemental Awakening, he\u2019d blinked out of his first lightning jump right outside the precinct. Crawling his way to a side door that was blessedly unlocked, he lay in the hallway unsure of what to do, while his heart rate seemed out of control and he could barely breathe as his powers stabilized. \nThat\u2019s when Andre and Lynn had found him. \nAs a detective at the precinct, Danny knew them both, but only in passing\u2014Andre Vaughn the CSI and Lynn Rivers the medical examiner. It wasn\u2019t until that night when they happened upon Danny by accident that the three of them became close. \nEveryone on earth was element leaning toward something\u2014Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Lightning, Light, Dark, or Metal. In some cases there were even specialties, like Water people focused on Ice or Earth people communing more with seismic occurrences than plants. For most people that meant trivial things. The color of their eyes that marked them at birth, and maybe, if they were lucky, they\u2019d get some resistance to or benefit from their element, like a Water person being able to breathe underwater longer or someone Air leaning growing into an elegant dancer. \nOnly a handful of the population had true abilities, powers tied to their element that stood them above the rest. In Olympus City, Malcolm Cho\u2019s father had been the only notable Elemental for years, until the Titans themselves and a few stragglers like Camouflage came along. \nThen Thanatos had come. Then Zeus had been born. Then everything\u2026changed. \n\n\na Rafflecopter giveaway \nDon\u2019t forget to visit the other stops on the tour. \n\nAuthor Bio and Links: Amanda Meuwissen has been writing and posting online for many years, including maintaining the website and blog for the software company Outsell.

Dawn Pickett at home in St Cleer with her husband Ian and daughters Alexia, 7, Kiera, 10 and Lucia, 12 (Image: Tom Last) \nPreparing for the operation involved her having to consume nothing but milk for an entire two weeks before the surgery, book sick leave from work and arrange days off for her husband to transport her to and from the hospital. \nFinally in November, on the third time she had suffered the diet and headed into the hospital to prepare for surgery, the operation went ahead.

I thought they were coming to say that they were ready to take me down for the operation. But instead they just handed me another pre-typed letter to say they were sorry, but my operation was cancelled.\u201d \nMrs Pickett added: \u201cThey just wave you off and expect you to do it all again. \n\u201cIt\u2019s twice it\u2019s happened now, you make all of these arrangements and it\u2019s just cancelled at the last minute. \n\u201cTo do it once if forgivable, but to do it twice is just ridiculous.\u201d Read More Man breaks his leg moments before proposing to girlfriend on Newquay cliffs - but pops the question anyway \nAlready this year, hospital cancellations has become the most common reason for appointments not going ahead as planned, becoming more common than patients not attending the arranged appointments. \nWhile the number of outpatient appointments made has nearly doubled in the last ten years, the number of cancellations is rising at a much faster rate.

his wife, Favour; and their two children, Miracle and Marvellous. \n\n\nAccording to Punch Metro, Kenneth was reported to be the pastor in charge of World Harvest Ministry in the Gbagada area of the state. \n\nIt was learnt that the family of four lived inside a shop where Kenneth and his wife sold drugs and provisions. \n\nKenneth reportedly relocated his family to the shop after he could not raise money to pay rent for his former apartment. \n\nAccording to Punch Metro, it was gathered from witnesses that the Ikeja Electric restored power around 2am, which allegedly triggered off the fire in the shop. \n\nThe victims were said to have been trapped by the two-level security burglar proof at the entrance of the shop and its extension, leading to their death. \n\nOfficials of the Lagos State Fire Service, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency and policemen from the Bariga division, were said to have responded to the emergency. \n\nA LASEMA official was alleged to have collapsed during the rescue operation. \n\nAs soon as the fire was put out, relatives of the victims were said to have taken the corpses to their hometown in Umueze Ala Ogboko, in the Ideato South Local Government Area of Imo State. \n\nBurnt clothes, drugs, fans and a pot of vegetable soup were seen by Punch Metro in the shop during a visit on Wednesday, as smoke still billowed from the dying flames. \n\nResidents and family members of the victims also besieged the scene, as many sympathisers and passersby fought to catch a glimpse of the burnt shop. \n\nTwo other shops were affected by the inferno before the intervention of firefighters. \n\nA screen printer, whose shop was opposite the victims\u2019, told Punch Metro that a power surge triggered the inferno. \n\n\u201cI sleep in my shop as well because of the nature of my work. Power was restored around 2am and that was when the fire started. There was a sudden explosion in the shop. It was difficult to get close to the place because everywhere was on fire. The heat was intense. \n\n\u201cLater, firefighters brought out their corpses. It was the body of the woman that was brought out first, before those of the two children. They initially couldn\u2019t find the pastor. After some search, they found his corpse in the shop, where he was probably attempting to find a way out,\u201d the printer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. \n\nThe two children, Miracle and Marvellous, were said to be aged six and three  respectively. \n\nA friend of the victim, Okechukwu Idoko, claimed to have mobilised some residents to put out the fire before the arrival of the firefighters, adding that their efforts were futile. \n\nIdoko said he had discussed with the victim the previous day on the completion of his (Kenneth\u2019s) house in the Ikorodu area of the state. \n\n\u201cHe said he wanted to lay the tiles on the floor, and I advised him to put certain things in place first. That was our last discussion before he died. Despite the fire, the money he made from the previous day sales in the shop, and his telephone were intact,\u201d he added. \n\nPunch Metro reports that Kenneth\u2019s wife, Favour, had been sick for some time. \n\nHer sickness was said to have been caused by two caesarean births, which left her bedridden. She had to be taken to the village for treatment. \n\nA family member of the victim, Okey Emereonye, said the sickness affected the finances of the family, which made Kenneth to quit his former apartment and relocate the family to the shop. \n\nHe said, \u201cWhen I visited them on Sunday at this place, I was surprised to see that she had returned from the village. She was making chin-chin, which she branded, \u2018Mirvel,\u2019 from the names of their children. I asked why Favour was brought back and Kenneth said he believed that being around her children would hasten her healing. I never knew it was the last time I would see them. \n\n\u201cKenneth was the breadwinner of the family. His parents are still alive. They have been informed and the bodies of the victims were taken directly to the village through the help of his church members.\u201d \n\nThe Director of the Lagos State Fire Service, Rasak Fadipe, said the agency received a distress call around 2.48am, adding that the Alausa and Ilupeju fire divisions responded. \n\nHe said, \u201cWe met the fire well alight and our men put it out. There were two levels of burglar proof \u2013 one at the entrance of the shop, while the other covered the extension. We found it difficult to gain access because of the burglar proof bars. \n\n\u201cWe should not turn our houses to prisons. Safety is very important. Every member of a family should know how the door is locked at night. We should discourage the use of keys to lock doors. When there is a fire incident, people should raise the alarm before it gets too late.\u201d \n\nHe said the cause of the fire incident had yet to be established, adding that investigations were ongoing. \n\nThe Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Chike Oti, confirmed the fire and the deaths. \n\n\u201cIt happened inside a chemist. A man, his wife and their two children were consumed by the fire, which started early in the morning. We alerted the fire service and other emergency responders to the scene,\u201d he added. \n\nThe Head, Corporate Communications and Media, Ikeja Electric, Felix Ofulue, said the IE was not aware of the incident. \n\nHe added that if the power company was at fault, the emergency workers would  have informed the company.

Official start of the walk Photos from the first and last day where there was less archeology. The very start of our walk: the eastern end of the cycleway in NewcastleA fortified house towards the western end of the walk. The guidebook had details but it is not to hand. Not medieval I think.The Solway FirthOur final B&B - probably my favourite, not as pretty or elaborate as some, but one which catered fairly and squarely for walkers (no need to remove muddy boots on entrance, for instance). Note that those flowers are all in discarded wall-walker's boots. B. almost left his behind as a donation, but decided against it.The end of the walk.The owner of this sign would set up the distance to your home and take a photograph of you. He was not averse to the odd monetary donation. According to the owner of our B&B the council had tried to close him down, claiming he needed planning permission to erect a signpost.

E-commerce has revolutionized the shopping experience for the customers by being of ultimate convenience to them. This factor can be considered as the leading cause in the rapidly progressing e-commerce scenario in Pakistan. Earlier, e-commerce was not quite popular among the Pakistani society considering the fact that only a limited amount of population had access to the internet. According to a research conducted on this particular matter, every minute, 26 new people are getting internet access in Pakistan. The trend towards online shopping is further being increased with the introduction of 3G and 4G services.Customerscan now readily buy the gadgets they need right from the comfort of their own homes since e-commerce sites such as Goto and Getnow have upgraded the whole shopping experience. The Encouraging Prospects of E-Commerce in Pakistan: \nE-commerce in Pakistan has become prominent owing to the online shopping websites like daraz.pk and yavo.com. This blossoming trend towards online shopping has been creating a demand in the market for small businesses to open their online shopping portals. The customer experience which was filled with traffic jams and long queues in the retail shops is now being replaced with efficient online shopping system. The products of a certain company are displayed on their website where customers can choose and buy them through online money transfer. The existing companies are seeking the services of cash on delivery and branchless banking for the purpose of monetary transactions. With the help of delivery portals, such as Leopards and TCS ,the product is conveyed to the doorstep of a customer who does not have to move a single muscle. Role of Social Media: \nSocial media is playing the role of an assistant to these online shopping portals in the domain of advertisement. Considering the accessibility of social media websites to a common user, this advertisement plays a vital role. The recent boost in smartphone usage among the population of Pakistan has made the social media accessible to a relatively bigger chunk of the society, helping and supporting e-commerce. By Means of Mobile Apps: \nThe introduction of mobile apps by some of these online shopping businesses has made it even more accessible for customers to shop from the comfort of their home. The traditional ways of shopping seem to be exhausting and time consuming when the option of shopping through websites is available. \nAs the time progresses and e-commerce becomesin demand across Pakistan, more and more businesses are diving into online shopping culture to facilitate their consumers. An example of how rapidly online shopping is becoming favorable can be seen in terms of Black Friday Sale which has been introduced and made excessively well-known by these electronic shopping forums in Pakistan.

Visiting the Big Apple during the Christmas season was on our bucket list, and this year we made it happen. Bill and I went to Manhattan in February 2008 with Bill\u2019s youngest sister, Maria, and her husband, Curt. I also went as a high schooler when I was seventeen. Benches on rollers at the High Line. I believe these benches are made of FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) ipe. In Phase I of construction which opened in 2009, wooden elements were constructed of FSC ipe, which was criticized. Phase II used reclaimed teak. Both types of wood weather to a silvery gray. \nLast week, we went back to New York with our traveling companions and what fun we had! Part of our visit had to be a trip to High Line Park, located thirty feet above the busy streets near Chelsea Marke t and the Meatpacking District . Although it was early winter, our visit was still extraordinary. Last summer, I did a lot of research on the High Line for a project, and it was magical to see the abandoned railway and gardens come alive beneath my feet. Mutations by Dora Budor, an art installation for 2017 at the High Line. Artwork is featured throughout the park. Visit High Line Park in any season. \nWinter is a great time to visit because you can see the bones of the garden and its structure without flowers to entice you. I\u2019ve read that winter is the garden\u2019s designer, Piet Oudolf\u2019s, favorite season to visit. I think it\u2019s his favorite season in his gardens period. Abandoned tracks flow into planting beds. This tension between the natural world and the industrial one is part of what this park celebrates\u2013the urban hardscape melding with natural soft textures. \nThe next time I walk the High Line I\u2019d like to return in September when the ornamental grasses and asters are at peak bloom. Oudolf found much of his inspiration from plants that self-seeded during the railway\u2019s fallow years. Before construction of the park, the people who created the Friends of the High Line organization climbed up to the railway and were surprised by nature\u2019s resiliency. Click on the photos in the galleries to make them larger. Bare tree against the blue sky at the High Line. Mexican feather grass and other plants, native and non-native make up a the palette used by Piet Oudolf. Ilex verticillata, winterberry holly loaded with beautiful berries. \nAfter much care from humans\u2013isn\u2019t that always the way\u2013the garden grew and took on a wilder aspect very pleasing to the eye. \nThe garden contains over 500 species of plants. You can download a complete plant list from the Friends of the High Line. Here, also, is a bloom list from August 2016. Taking photos of the flora and fauna with the sun at my back makes for interesting shadows at the High Line. \nIf you\u2019d like to read more about the gardens of the High Line, there is a book for you! Gardens of the High Line: Elevating the Nature of Modern Landscapes , (Timber Press) written by Piet Oudolf and photographed by Rick Darke came out last summer. I haven\u2019t read it yet, but perhaps I shall. The Hudson River from the High Line\u2019s railroad spur overlook. Our visit. \nWe entered on the \u201cslow stairs\u201d next to the Whitney Museum of American Art and walked the entire 1.5 miles. We got there as the park opened at 7:00 a.m., so there was little foot traffic except for the occasional jogger. As we ended our stroll, the High Line was starting to fill up with pedestrians walking and running. City dwellers and tourists alike adore this park, so it is well-traveled. I noticed signs throughout alerting visitors not to step on plants. Originally, the planting areas weren\u2019t fenced, but now workers must fence them because the walkways are so well used. The fences are actually small chains that don\u2019t take away from the garden. The 10th Avenue Viewing deck is the perfect place to watch the traffic below. It is especially effective at night. \nBelow is a Facebook Live video of our visit. I was in the prairie meadow section of the park. \nSituated in the center of a busy commercial area, the High Line juxtaposes nature with concrete and steel. It\u2019s known for its dynamic design features including peel-up benches, concrete risers that blend in with the railway lines and planks with open joints that melt into grasses and perennials. The High Line revitalized the surrounding neighborhood, and I noticed tall buildings being erected nearby. There are many new office buildings and hotels in an area that was once nearly desolate. \nThe railway that was built in 1934 because 10th Avenue was too dangerous and was once called \u201cDeath Avenue\u201d is now essentially a green roof. Nature, industry, and nature again form and reform. For me, it\u2019s symbolic of life, death, and rebirth. The Standard Hotel sits like an open book atop the High Line. All of the rooms have floor-to-ceiling windows. There is also a bar on the top floor called Top of the Standard. It has a great view of the Hudson River. Walking the pathway beneath the Standard Hotel. The weather in NYC has been so mild that shrubs and trees still wore their fall foliage. \nThe High Line exists only because two citizens who lived on the west side were concerned about their neighborhood and the abandoned, elevated railway. Joshua David and Robert Hammond, separately attended a community board meeting to discuss the fate of the line. At the meeting, they became interested its preservation. Afterward, they talked and decided to do something. They helped create the Friends of the High Line, the group that guided the eventual park and gardens. Great perspective shot from the High Line. \nIf you\u2019d like to read an insider\u2019s view of the High Line, check out Living the High Line blog, by Annik La Farge. It has great information. \nThe High Line was one of many highlights of our trip. Yeah, I know that\u2019s a pun, but I had to go there. If you go to the New York City, you simply must visit. It\u2019s a worthy stop whether you\u2019re a garden traveler or not.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rick darke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joshua david", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert hammond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "curt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oudolf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "piet oudolf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dora budor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "annik la farge", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ilex verticillata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forest stewardship council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "whitney museum of american art", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "standard hotel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fsc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "big apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "high line park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelsea marke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "visit high line park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hudson river", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:05:56.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fd4ce680305670ddb66961f2a6dc50807ae104ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8zICCHuagPh2Tas67WRGvCys6Yab5GtTJaCbFmE5coCsfZAD3EOhou", "site_full": "www.dailymotion.com", "site": "dailymotion.com", "site_section": "http://www.dailymotion.com/rss/1", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Dailymotion -

The scenery is generally better by train, especially when there is snow. However, winter travel after a day of sightseeing is usually in the dark, so the next question is whether you ike train or bus better, and whether you are using JR pass. Taking the train from Takayama to Osaka takes about 3.5 to 4 hours (look at the Hyperdia page for options and note that the earliest departure is not always the earliest arrival, or the least number of transfers). Taking the last bus from Takayama to Osaka (at 4:50 pm) will get you into Osaka at 10:10 pm https://www.nouhibus.co.jp/english/highwaybus/osaka.pdf) and would not be covered by JR Pass.\nIf I were doing this travel, I would travel via JR train the whole way because there is no value to riding the bus after dark, you won't see much and the train allows you to get up and walk around. Leave Takayama at 5:46 and get into Osaka at 9:17 pm, much faster. with two transfers.\nA word of caution, New Year's travel is pretty hectic on both busses and trains.

Good for these 34 House Republicans for standing up for Dreamers and reminding us that there are strong majorities that exist in both congressional chambers and across America for protecting Dreamers this year.\nIt\u2019s clear that the votes are there to resolve Dreamers\u2019 crisis before the end of the year. And yes, this is a crisis.\nIt only takes 24 House Republicans to side with the 193 Democrats in the House in order to get to the necessary majority of votes to pass legislation in the House. With today\u2019s letter, it\u2019s clear that the votes are there to resolve Dreamers\u2019 crisis before the end of the year. And yes, this is a crisis. Dreamers need relief urgently and now, not some vague promise about standalone legislation at some point down the road.\nNow the attention turns to Speaker Ryan. Will he side with these 34 members who want to get something done, who vote for spending bills and whose elections in 2018 will determine if the GOP maintains a House majority?
