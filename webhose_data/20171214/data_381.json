But up until now he\u2019s never had a chance to professionally spread his ink beyond an area zoned as either \u201cindustrial\u201d or \u201chighway business.\u201d \nThat\u2019s about to change. \nA unanimous vote Tuesday night by the Taunton City Council granting a special permit will allow the 28-year-old Jones to leave a tattoo parlor on Route 138/Broadway, where he has worked since graduating high school, and open his own business downtown. \nReal Arts Studio, which Jones said should be open in February, will fill a storefront vacancy at 27 Main St. in one of three buildings owned by Jay Dorsey within Union Block\u2013 an amalgam of six buildings that extends from Weir Street to Merchants Lane. \nBesides a tattoo room with two chairs, Jones said he\u2019ll establish an art studio and a retail and art gallery where he eventually hopes to sell his own line of clothing. \nBefore the vote was taken, Mayor Thomas Hoye Jr., who said he has known Jones and his family for years, strongly endorsed the special-permit petition. \n\u201cHe\u2019s done a lot of great work at Coyle Cassidy (High School),\u201d said Hoye, where Jones graduated and more recently has shown his paintings, which Hoye called \u201csimply amazing.\u201d \nJones and Dorsey agreed to a request by Councilor Estele Borges that terms and conditions of the lease be made available. Jones also agreed to a request by Councilor Jeanne Quinn that neon lights advertising the business not be used. \nThe City Council in September voted unanimously to change a zoning ordinance that previously had prohibited a tattoo business from operating in the city\u2019s Central Business District. \nThat move came a year after the Zoning Board of Appeals, by a 3-to-2 vote, denied a request by Jones to open his business in Weir Village, on the grounds that it would be too close to two churches. \nReal Arts Studio will fill a void created more than a year ago when Paint With A Splash, a New Bedford-based business offering art and painting classes and private parties, closed down after opening in 2014. \nDorsey says Jones\u2019s vision for an arts-oriented business in his building is consistent with the mixed-use model Dorsey is pursuing for his downtown properties. \nDorsey and the co-owners of Taunton Antiques Center recently worked with a Boston non-profit group to develop affordable- and market-rate apartments on the second and third floors of three buildings in Union Block. \nDorsey in September said he would honor a letter he submitted in July outlining five \u201ccode of conduct items\u201d stipulating, among other things that Jones will not permit body piercing on the premises; will not allow people to loiter out front; and that anything deemed \u201cobjectionable\u201d will not be on display in the windows. \nJones said he expects guest tattoo artists from Brazil and other countries to occasionally visit and be hired for their services. \nIn response to a question from councilor Deborah Carr, Jones said he typically charges $150 per hour for tattoos. \n\u201cIs there\u2019s a free one for me I\u2019ll take it,\u201d joked Carr, who said she\u2019s still waiting for her son, who is now 32, to get a heart tattoo with the word Mom inscribed inside.

Photo: facebook/Nugzar Tsiklauri \nA few thousand protesters gathered in downtown Tbilisi on December 6 at a rally organized by ex-President Mikheil Saakashvili\u2019s United National Movement party against what they call \u201ca coordinated revenge by the oligarchic regimes\u201d of Petro Poroshenko and Bidzina Ivanishvili (Georgia\u2019s former Prime Minister). Party activists and supporters gathered outside the Rustaveli Metro station, and marched to the Government Chancellery chanting \u201cMisha, Misha\u201d and holding a banner reading: \u201cFor Georgia\u2019s Victory.\u201d Some protesters were also waving Georgian and Ukrainian flags. Nika Melia, Chairman of UNM\u2019s Political Council, who addressed the rally first, told the protesters that the party and its leader were engaged in \u201ca struggle for better future, for freedom and for maintaining independence.\u201d\u201cThis is a confrontation between the oligarchs and the people, the two oligarchs came together and agreed to neutralize the main flag-bearer, the main forerunner in the fight against oligarchy in Georgia and Ukraine,\u201d Melia said. \u201c[Our rally] today has confirmed that if Ivanishvili and Poroshenko do not withdraw from their intentions, a lot of people will take to the streets in Tbilisi and won\u2019t quit protesting.\u201d Zaal Udumashvili, UNM\u2019s candidate in the October mayoral elections in Tbilisi, addressed the protesters as well, saying the rally was named the March of Dignity, \u201csince it is exactly a matter of our dignity to express loud protest about the ongoing processes in Ukraine and Georgia.\u201d He also said the decision of the \u201coligarchic ruler of Ukraine\u201d to detain Mikheil Saakashvili \u201cwas reckless.\u201d\u201cMikheil Saakashvili won yesterday, and he won not when the Ukrainian people released him from the police minivan, but when he was arrested.\u201d UNM announced the rally on December 5, when Mikheil Saakashvili, who is wanted by the Georgian authorities on multiple criminal charges, was temporarily detained by the Ukrainian Security Service.

markets", "text": "NEW DELHI: Homegrown global vaccines major Serum Institute of India plans to launch at least four products and enter European and US markets in the next three to four years as it seeks to retain number one position.\nThe company sells its products in 147 countries and is the largest vaccines manufacturer by dosage globally with 1.2 billion doses per annum.\n\"There are two ways to maintain the position - come out with new vaccines as fast as possible for the existing markets and developing new markets,\" Serum Institute of India CEO Adar C Poonawalla told .\nElaborating on the company's plans to launch new vaccines, he said Serum Institute plans to launch four new vaccines in the coming years.\n\"We are planning to launch a pentavalent meningitis vaccine. It is five-in-one meningitis vaccine. It will be coming out in less than two years time,\" Poonawalla said.\nBy end of 2019, there is a plan to launch a pneumonia vaccine, which will have a huge impact of protecting children's lives, as pneumonia causes maximum number of child deaths in the world, including in India, he added.\nThe other vaccines the company plans to launch are a dengue vaccine and a human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine for cervical cancer in women, Poonawalla said.\nHe sought government help to cut down the time required for approvals and improve ease of doing business and for the company to stay ahead of global competition.\n\"For us to stay ahead, we need support from the government to give us a fast track approval for our new vaccines,\" Poonawalla said.\nOn entering new markets, specially the developed ones in Europe and the US, he said steps are being taken up to have presence in these markets.\n\"We are not selling in the US and Europe right now but eventually in three years time we will go to Europe. Our first vaccine, TDAP (for protection tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis) should be launched in Europe in three years. It is a booster vaccine given to children,\" Poonawalla said.\nThe company's new facility in Pune, which will be ready in a year and a half will cater to Europe and the US, he added.\nWhen asked about the company's investments on new products, he said: \"We spend between Rs 300-400 crore a year on research and development.\"\nMoreover, the company spends Rs 300-400 crore every year on capex, he added.\n\"We re-plough around 80 per cent of our profits in our business for R&D and capex for future growth and for upkeep of our facilities,\" he added. 0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "poonawalla", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "serum institute", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "serum institute of india", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pune", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:23.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "16e848bd24b352a3d00590d821006ce5993f2a4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTexpoFzOWxfZXpGYObFjuN3OEBgVBMfv7x4vvV6sADaZWDbXWCcghfe4WYfiC9pSXdOXNt0gel0j7qCIVu_aQciC6_OPVE6fh5W3qBt9PIwN_d9Aypuaj5", "site_full": "www.glassdoor.co.uk", "site": "glassdoor.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Reviews/KPMG-Assistant-Manager-Reviews-EI_IE2867.0,4_KO5,22.htm?sort.sortType=RD&sort.ascending=false", "site_categories": ["job_search", "jobs"], "section_title": "KPMG Assistant Manager Reviews | Glassdoor.co.uk", "title": "KPMG -

As a young man, he\u2019d been teased by all the other young warriors. All he could grow were three wispy strands of sandy blonde hair, erupting forth from his chin. Hardly the beard worthy of a formidable berserker.\nOne by one, his peers grew thick, luscious, wiry, curly beards. Some were so long and so thick in such a relatively short time that by their eighteenth year, they were able to plait and braid their beards into intricate patterns and designs.\u201d \n\u201cBut Magnus wasn\u2019t going to be defeated!\u201d squealed Morag, not showing any signs of weariness.\n\u201cHe most certainly was not !\u201d agreed Olaf, pleased to see his daughter embracing her history so excitedly, \u201cMagnus was convinced that having a magnificent beard was the key to being a magnificent warrior. Each day Magnus would train for two hours before his peers rose\u2026\u201d \n\u201cAnd then he\u2019d train another five hours with them\u2026\u201d continued Morag.\n\u201cAnd after they all retired to fish and eat, what would Magnus do, Morag?\u201d tested Olaf.\n\u201cHe\u2019d take offerings to Thor and pray for his blessings.\u201d \nOlaf was delighted that Morag had remembered this story so quickly and was happy to keep her awake long enough to get to the end.\nHe cuddled her close and went on, \u201cThen, one day\u2026\u201d \n\u201cMagnus awoke to find his face was finally home to a full-grown beard, filled with all of the colours of fire. It had striking reds and oranges and glowing gold strands. And all of the hair was styled and shaped with plaits and braids and knots.\u201d \n\u201cGood girl, Morag! You know the whole story already! It seems you don\u2019t need me to finish it then. You can tell yourself the bedtime story today.\u201d\nOlaf grinned to himself as he felt his daughter wriggle around in protest.\n\u201cNo, Daddy! No! You have to finish it!\u201d Morag cried.\n\u201cI\u2019m s tired, I can\u2019t finish it by myself\u2026\u201d she lied, as she pretended to yawn.\n\u201cOk, my little shield princess. You cuddle up here and I\u2019ll tell you about Magnus.\u201d \nMorag did as she was told, closing her eyes with determination and lying very still within Olaf\u2019s large embrace.\n\u201cMagnus was so astounded and overcome with joy at the sight of his beard, that he ran out into the village to show it to all. \u2018Come! Come!\u2019 he shouted. \u2018Come and see the blessings Thor has bestowed upon my face!\u2019 and all the village came to see and admire.\n\u2018Thor gave you the most magnificent of beards!\u2019 they gushed.\n\u2018Thor truly is the most magnificent of Gods!\u2019 they proclaimed.\n\u2018Thor truly is the most magnificent !\u2019\nThat day, Magnus didn\u2019t train any longer than anyone else, nor did he offer sacrifices or prayers to Thor while everyone else was fishing and eating.\nBut Magnus was able to fight better than he\u2019d ever fought in his life.\nFor the next few months, Magnus trained like all the others. He enjoyed sleeping in the mornings, eating and fishing in the afternoons and being the best warrior in training.\nOne day, as he was walking along the coast, trying to spot new fishing spots, Magnus was startled by a voice\u2026\u201d \nOlaf trailed off as he heard a gentle snore issuing forth from his lap.\nMorag\u2019s body had relaxed and her eyelids fluttered as she entered a deep sleep.\nHer father lovingly put her to bed, tucked in with furs and pillows and kissed her forehead gently.\n\u201cDream of Magnus and his magnificent beard, my darling.

The military coup in Zimbabwe, explained published: 18 Nov 2017 The military coup in Zimbabwe, explained The military coup in Zimbabwe, explained published: 18 Nov 2017 views: 20600 \nWhy the Zimbabwe coup is not a revolution. Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO On November 14th 2017, Zimbabwe military troops drove tanks into the capital city, Harare. They patrolled the streets, blocked access to government buildings, and took over the state television station to insist\u2026. This is not a military takeover of government. Once praised as a war hero, Robert Mugabe helped Zimbabwe win independence from Great Britain in 1980. He became president under Zimbabwe\u2019s new constitution with the support of the people. But soon, he digressed into a repressive dictator. He secured his power through aggression and threats, there have been reports of state-sponsored torture and killings. And even though Zimbabwe is technically a democracy, there\u2019s evidence Mugabe rigged elections in his favor. Now that Mugabe is 93 years old, and reportedly in poor health, the fight for political influence is more important than ever. And it\u2019s caused a split in Mugabe\u2019s own party, the ZANU-PF. On one side we have the old guard lead by Mugabe\u2019s sacked vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa. Like Mugabe, he fought for Zimbabwe\u2019s independence and has a checkered past that includes human rights abuses against political opponents and ethnic minorities.

They call Mnangagwa \\'the crocodile\\', but can Zimbabwe\\'s new president attack the country\\'s broken economy and demonstrate a real commitment to reform? Andrew Simmons reports on the challenges ahead and why some people are skeptical. And Sami Shasha, the CEO of Cambria Africa, joins Counting the Cost to discuss Zimbabwe\\'s economic future. Libya\\'s slave trade The UN-backed government in Libya said it\\'s looking into allegations that African migrants are being sold at \\'slave markets\\' in Libya. According to reports, the trade works by preying on the tens of thousands of vulnerable people who risk everything on what\\'s been described as the deadliest route on earth. They use smartphones to connect with people smugglers to get them to the coast in the hope that they can cross the Mediterranean into Europe.

The aim of this has been to stamp out unethical conduct and corruption and to ensure a culture of accountability and transparency. \nSince the University is committed to a culture of zero tolerance towards fraud, corruption and irregular behaviour, an awareness campaign has been launched to remind people about the Ethics Hotline and to open the channels for people to continue whistle-blowing. \nThe campaign consists of awareness-raising posters, email communication and social media messages to encourage people to be aware that there is a way to report unethical, corrupt and fraudulent business and academic activities which may have taken place. \nThe Ethics Hotline is managed independently by a recognised service provider and is available 24 hours a day. Whistle-blowers remain anonymous and are protected. \nPlease inform your staff and students to be on the lookout for the contact details of the Hotline and to feel free to report any instances of unethical, corrupt and fraudulent activity at the University of Pretoria. \nPlease visit www.up.ac.za/ethicshotline for more information. \n- Author Department of University Relations Share this page", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "university of pretoria", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hotline", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethics hotline", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:25.046+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3d169c35b96b0c235a85c619f797cbc910d60ea1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWHWxXJT3jLbW2LG5as9Qe3.viIjMiVVx.1jFr.dwWhnP1gP3HtP3qkiw3Rtu0GlmKkcOMP1N.r2ScAwYduHQd4PeKzcYOEXF1UQx830p11fHsUvV6aZkRYu5IfzyOq8kX", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/petpet/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "PetPet Diapers With Best Price At Lazada In Malaysia", "title": "Petpet Jumbo L42 (3 + 1 FREE packs)", "title_full": "Petpet Jumbo Pack L42 (3 + 1 FREE packs) | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-05-18T09:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 231, "participants_count": 188, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.211, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb8df7892a0784cf820d3ae02a9b8c6066df766d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWHWxXJT3jLbW2LG5as9Qe3.viIjMiVVx.1jFr.dwWhnP1gP3HtP3qkiw3Rtu0GlmKkcOMP1N.r2ScAwYduHQd4PeKzcYOEXF1UQx830p11fHsUvV6aZkRYtQX32Z3LORjs4qTrkmD6X8-", "ord_in_thread": 222, "author": "Zalina B.", "published": "2017-12-02T20:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "Four Stars", "text": "Barang Ok.cuma lambat sampai.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:25.047+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15115945, "moreResultsAvailable": 15115845, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512639625047&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 555}
