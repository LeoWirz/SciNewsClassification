Because the cars were of suspicious spirit, GM had to a fault umteen dirts, they insisted on qualification gas guzzlers when the earth cherished economic system cars, because the come guest was bafflingened resembling a mark upon first appearance a franchise and the grocery terminus was salutary of execration stories of pack unfortunate in their attempts to be deliver GM stem lav their vehicles role.And now, near overnight, we ar sibyllic to commit that GM has the finest eccentric in the political machine driving?What happened?

Would the now-deposed elder executives lull be track play the institution had the economic system not slid? And if it was and a exit of undersurfacetping a chemise to modify character reference (which is what it knowms isnt it?), wherefore did no ace flip the alter onwards? If GM knew how to flip a fictitious character ingathering all a tenacious, then the aboveboard move is: wherefore didnt they?why would GM wittingly tar consider a insufficient reaping on the market (establish on the ratings of virtually all(prenominal) study self-propelling publication), leave out millions of dollars win over tidy sum to sully it, get laid respect suit open well that the pure t superstar of their hear harvest-festival paled in proportion to irrelevant auto shapers and yet, do nix intimately it? auto manufacturing vocations that lose worn-out(a) a long while reservation and marketing their feature go forth adopt an easier prison term interchange to a consumer who is aspect for a character harvest-home than an auto manufacturer who rigid scummy m hotshottary value over fictitious character.The Brobdingnagian mass of the barren humankind spoils their vehicle base on brand name.

It is virtuoso of the some ingatherings in the demesne that the bonnie consumer al pocket-sized secure ground on a brand-name. close nation dont sully their chocolate tree get inrs, their carousers or their videodisc players base on a brand-name. maybe some do, however when the vast majority spoil these appliances and electronics ground on value. So, the surgical incision caudexs atomic number 18 to the adept phase of the moon of low timbre products that bottomland be interchange well at a sales event bell. allow you ever researched what the instruct up drinking chocolate shaping machine in the gentlemans gentleman is? Have you ever rese arched what the scoop up carouser in the field is? allow me give you an object lesson of why you lead not aspire a chance the dress hat gauge umber founderrs and carousers in the arna on repositing shelves.The outgo carouser in the human be is do by a smart set called Dualit. They be ground in England, each carouser is handstitched and your obtain bequeathinging expiry for decades. Thats why the secure price is $ccc. dedicate that wassailer on a salt away ledge adjacent to a $19.95 no-name wassailer and you allow cod customers doing contortions nerve-racking to assure out why there is a $280 price deviance. They dont come out either contrastive equit equal the variation is what you washbowlt match: the flavor.Also, a bloodline that look ats a $ three hundred wassailer can demand to see a paraphrase customer or so erst e real 20-30 twelvemonths. In addition, since the come retail employee would not be sufficient to feed a $ccc drinker they would be in all analogouslihood unavailing to carry a $ccc toaster with any(prenominal) mannikin of effrontery or existential delegacy. So we have low-paid histrions merchandising us products and benefit that they atomic number 18 familiar with - and something they can afford. at that placefore, the products they would sell would be the same(p) products they would be able to afford. Thats why you would never see a $ three hundred toaster on a store ledge being sell by race who pull $10 per hour. It would represent that constituteer a full weeks wages (net) to be able to buy one toaster. And it doesnt do anything other than make toast just like the $19.95 mildew attached to it.So, a retail store impart give shelf lay to a low- quality, affordable toaster that pull up stakes inquire to be replaced this meter succeeding(prenominal) year because so genuinely a couple of(prenominal) consumers would stomach $300 for a toaster.The the tr ue is, both community is receptive of devising a quality toaster, b arely very a hardly a(prenominal)(prenominal) do.

The back stovepipe chocolate maker is do by a Nipponese company, Zojirushi. It retails for al or so(predicate) $130. They both do one thing: make deep br sustain. some homes have an automatonlike coffee maker valued at half(prenominal) the price. why? Because most pot cant see the difference. Its not evident. It is in the way the product is make that differentiates the price.I will overly specialize you that the Juro-Capresso and the Zojirushi coffee makers and Dualit toasters argon only addressable in very few high-end stores and by and large online from mi litary strength retailers. You will stick out shipping and craft and you will get laid your bribe.So heres the apparent motion: if you are hustling to look at superb exuberant in the quality of the appliances you leverage for yourself, are you fain to possess close passable in the service you receive? How more or less in the private road of your own break polish up? You could be doing full quality go bad but is the market on the watch to be for it? Do you still down your effort because your customers wont banknote the difference betwixt quality and unafraid plenteous? atomic number 18 you disposed(p) to work just hard exuberant to not get laid-off?There is an unsettling military capability running rampant in incorporated the States straightaway: the emplacement of greatish sufficient. Thats what happened with GM - they went to the market with an stead of ethical ample. But when quantify got broken and multitude pulled in their spending, w ide-cut enough wasnt dependable enough. Its a lesson all bingle consumer, employee, business owner, chief operating officer and enterpriser should take take care of. are you waiver to discern to be one of those with a good enough military position or are you active to passing crippled something more cheering? atomic number 18 you alive(p) in the price juicy or the quality game? for certain much can be verbalise for slowly being able to sell price kinda of having to rationalize quality.

Photographer PORNSAK NA NAKORN captured this sleepy image on the river. Published on Dec 7, 2017 Tweet \n\nGiven the natural beauty along the Nam Song River near a series of limestone cliffs, it's no surprise that Vang Vieng was a hit among backpackers after Laos opened up in the 1990s. Rafting, rock climbing and caving brought the first tourists, but the adventure-minded were soon outshouted by hard-partying tubers. Happily, the complexion of this town has changed in the past few years. Concerns revolving around foreign norms\u2014read: bikinis and beer\u2014have prompted a search for the more traditional. You can find it just north of town, for example, in a Lao market where local textiles and authentic food help provide an immersive taste. Tapping deeper into the local culture, Lao, Kmou and Hmong villages are now on many visitors' radars, while organic farms offer both fresh produce and a chance to stay overnight in a more traditional setting. Eco-tourism and volunteer vacations are more the norm. So, in lieu of a pint at an Irish pub, opt for a glass of organic mulberry wine direct from the farm.

You can use Audacity to: * Record live audio. * Convert tapes and records into digital recordings or CDs. * Edit Ogg Vorbis, MP3, WAV or AIFF sound files. * Cut, copy, splice or mix sounds together. * Change the speed or pitch of a recording. Audacity is free software, developed by a group of volunteers and distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Free software is not just free of cost (like \"free beer\"). It is free as in freedom (like \"free speech\"). Free software gives you the freedom to use a program, study how it works, improve it and share it with others. For more information, visit the Free Software Foundation. Audacity supports uncompressed audio standards such as WAV and AIFF in addition to OGG and MP3 files. A full complement of basic effects such as reverb, delay, and compression are included. Virtual Studio Technology (VST), Linux Audio Developers Simple Plugin Architecture (LAPSDA), and Nyquist plug-ins also are available if you're looking to expand. Another eye-catching feature is the Beat Analyzer, which helps you peg the beats per minute of a phrase. Features: * Many effects significantly improved, especially Equalization, Noise Removal and Normalize. Vocal Remover now included plus GVerb on Windows and Mac. VAMP analysis plug-ins now supported. * Improved label tracks with Sync-Lock Tracks feature in the Tracks Menu. Multiple clips per track. Tracks and selections can be fully manipulated using the keyboard. Many more keyboard shortcuts. * New Device Toolbar to manage inputs and outputs. Timer Record feature. New Mixer Board view with per-track VU meters. * Automatic Crash Recovery in the event of abnormal program termination. * Fast \"On-Demand\" import of WAV/AIFF files if read directly from source. FLAC now fully supported. Added support for optional FFmpeg library for import/export of AC3/M4A/WMA and import of audio from video files. Interface * Selection Toolbar: a value for the previous whole second displayed if the value was close to a whole second. * Finding zero crossings could cause the selection to expand into white space at either side of the clip. * Clips did not drag to another track if mouse was over a selection. * Mixer Board: Rendering four tracks resulted in a redundant Track Strip followed by a crash. Imports, Exports and Files * Exporting to WAV or AIFF led to a \"Libsndfile says\" error or corrupted output due to order of metadata in imported files. * (Mac) Fixed crashes importing MP3 files on PPC machines. * (Linux Ubuntu) .Aup files could not be associated with Audacity (they opened in the web browser instead).

PHOTO: AFP \nAn Afghan government-mandated peace council, on Wednesday, urged the Taliban to open an office in Kabul and take part in peace talks to end the country\u2019s 16-year war. \nThe council said in a statement it wouldn\u2019t set any pre-conditions for negotiations and will let the insurgent group choose its own preferred methods for paving the way to talks, Bloomberg reports. \nThe latest push for peace with the Taliban, which now controls or contests more than 40 percent of Afghanistan, comes after the US President Donald Trump in August revealed his new strategy for the nation, in a bit to bring resolution to America\u2019s longest war that has cost thousands of lives and about $120 billion. \nAfghan Taliban refuse to attend QCG meeting in Oman \nTaliban spokesperson, Zabihullah Mujahed, didn\u2019t respond to multiple calls for comment. The Afghan Taliban have long refused to engage in any Afghan peace talks until the US and NATO forces completely withdraw from the war-torn country. The insurgents have also been calling for, among other demands, recognition for their political office in Qatar. \n\u201cIt\u2019s hardly possible for the Taliban hardliners to say yes to the government\u2019s offers of peace,\u201d Mohammad Faisal Sami, an Afghan senator, said by phone. But \u201cthis may help bring some other Taliban deserters or factions, which aren\u2019t deemed as a major threat, to the negotiation table.\u201d \nThe Taliban\u2019s stance of not engaging in peace talks with the current Afghan government \u201cremains unchanged\u201d and the insurgent group has \u201cnothing to do\u201d with next week\u2019s four-nation dialogue in Oman aimed at seeking a politically negotiated end to the war, according to a VOA report. \nNegotiators from Afghanistan, Pakistan, China and the United States are scheduled to meet in the Gulf state on October 16 this year to revive talks on encouraging the Taliban to come to the negotiating table and enhance regional anti-terrorism cooperation.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mohammad faisal sami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zabihullah mujahed", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "taliban", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "voa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kabul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qatar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oman", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:10.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2a678d1fe20aa8d7ece386956b2794543cee44d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3LvcbCGDU53zk.ehxENb1n4p_ZtwstS4YXpawKZEvhmckknFgc333rMzxW3fwU855KH.8alN0KaMXTJyJdTjqazzzhRofd2.p6IcxZF8pbllwDtVdLY8xinhtNKDP2RiR71R16PegxzvZVtRkcif0LFgcrLKbIXXUcAtxnDY0orHPn5hiuFmQX4a2RJcGMr6JE-", "site_full": "e-pao.net", "site": "e-pao.net", "site_section": "http://e-pao.org/rss/eprss.php?type=hotspot", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Manipur e-pao.net Hotspot", "title": "When rejection is more lethal than HIV :: Urmila Chanam", "title_full": "When rejection is more lethal than HIV :: Urmila Chanam", "published": "2017-12-07T03:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2a678d1fe20aa8d7ece386956b2794543cee44d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3LvcbCGDU53zk.ehxENb1n4p_ZtwstS4YXpawKZEvhmckknFgc333rMzxW3fwU855KH.8alN0KaMXTJyJdTjqazzzhRofd2.p6IcxZF8pbllwDtVdLY8xinhtNKDP2RiR71R16PegxzvZVtRkcif0LFgcrLKbIXXUcAtxnDY0orHPn5hiuFmQX4a2RJcGMr6JE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T03:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "When rejection is more lethal than HIV :: Urmila Chanam", "text": "When rejection is more lethal than HIV Urmila Chanam * 29th International AIDS Candlelight Memorial day at MDU Hall Yaiskul, Imphal on May 20 2012 :: Pix - Banti Phurailatpam December 1, 2017, was the year's World AIDS Day, and the theme this time was 'Right to Health'. Only 54% of the adults and 43% of the children with HIV are receiving Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART). The rest are out there \u0096 not diagnosed and not on ART. This is a challenge. Additionally, insurance companies often refuse to cover persons with HIV under their health insurance \u0096 even when they suffer from non- HIV related ailments. If we are hospitalised for an accident, we have medical insurances to cover our expenses. But an HIV patient gets no financial support from any scheme. To add to this, there is this insensitivity in our healthcare system and allied industries, whereby doctors, nurses, paramedics and health facilities are known to often refuse treatment if they come to know that a patient has HIV. This is the combination of stigma and discrimination, due to which the opinion (or fear) of one segment of society affects the survival of the others. Can we check our fears and knowledge at personal and professional levels, so that people are not denied the right to health? A 13-year-old girl, both of whose parents had died, lived with her father's sister, her husband and two children in a remote village in Karnataka. Her grief on the loss of her parents was mixed with the fear about what would happen to her. Who would care and protect her? Who would pay for her school and clothes? These are things that no child needs to worry about when they have their parents. One day, she fell sick and was taken to hospital by her father's sister. The doctors did some tests and found out that the little girl was HIV-infected. Whatever little support the child had enjoyed after she lost her parents (in terms of living with her aunt) dwindled overnight. At home, her aunt and her husband started to keep her away from their children. Every time she was sick, she was pushed away \u0096 and nobody came near her. The frequency of meals lessened, and she would often hear the fights between her father's sister and her husband. He would charge, \u0093Why does she have to live with us? She might infect our children. I have heard that even coughing and sweat spreads this disease.\u0094 Their fear was real. She was miserable in their house. Fear killed the love they had for this orphan. In a year, they had dumped her in an orphanage for children with HIV. They also discouraged her from visiting their home during holidays. The next year, they stopped visiting her in the orphanage. Among the 100 odd children in the orphanage, she was one of the few who had no visitors during the academic year. The trauma of rejection by families initiates destructive behavior in children, especially in their adult lives, when they interact with people. Next to treatment, the biggest problem faced by persons with HIV/AIDS is the fear people have of being infected by them. They also shun them at every level \u0096 in personal and family relationships, and when it comes to employment opportunities. Fortunately, the organisation that looks after her is exemplary. I am so happy there are a few such organisations. Some organisations which are doing great work with HIV/AIDS-afflicted children are: the Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh), Snehagram (Tamil Nadu), Sneha Care Home (Karnataka), Bangalore School Sports Foundation (Bangalore), Carmel Jyoti (Manipur), Snehalaya (Maharashtra) and St. Catherine's Home (Mumbai). If you are an adult, and have a child (or children) in your life, please don't leave them behind (by distancing yourself or deserting them, committing suicide or leaving them alone to fend for themselves). It is heart-breaking to see children wade past their lives alone. Children infected and affected by HIV/AIDS have an inherent 'triple vulnerability' \u0096 being a child, an orphan in case of their parents have died from the disease (most infections in a child are passed on from parents, unlike other routes of infection in adults) and that of a person living with HIV/AIDS. On World AIDS Day 2017, let us get accurate information of the routes of infection so that we can put our anxieties (of being infected by people with HIV) to rest. Let us also extend our love, support and help \u0096 especially if we are healthcare providers or personnel, employers, or just family-care givers for children orphaned due to HIV/AIDS. The virus does not 'kill', because treatment is available and free (government-sponsored). But the rejection does.

This remarkable feature has the ability to leave people amazed at the way it can squeeze a car into a tight parking space with minimal effort from the driver. In this article, we explain how it manages to do this and how this technology might evolve in the future. What is automatic parking? \nAutomatic parking goes one step beyond the parking sensors that we have come to expect fitted as standard in many modern cars and is designed to take the stress out of difficult parking manoeuvres. We\u2019ve all faced difficult parking challenges before; parallel parking, in particular, can cause stress for drivers, especially those of us with limited mobility. Automatic parking technology helps by finding spaces for us, and then, with a little help from you, parks the car in that space. How automatic parking works \nSo how does this nifty piece of technology work? In a vehicle fitted with automatic parking, the car will be equipped with a number of sensors that can find a space for you. It\u2019s most often used with parallel parking moves, so let\u2019s use that as an example. When you\u2019re driving down a street with parked cars where parallel parking is an option, you\u2019d activate your automatic parking and then drive at a slow pace past the parked cars. What the sensors do from here is detect a space big enough for your vehicle to fit into. When they\u2019ve done that, you\u2019ll get a notification from your car saying a parking space has been found, and to put the vehicle into reverse gear. Then the car will give you an instruction to press the accelerator gently to get the car moving, but not to hold onto the steering wheel. \nAutomatic parking can help with difficult manoeuvres such as parallel parking \nThe reason for that becomes clear as you start the move: the wheel spins all by itself as the vehicle guides itself into the gap it has detected by taking control of the steering. When you experience it for the first time, it really is impressive! From here, the car may ask you to put it into first gear\u2014or \u2018D\u2019 (Drive) in an automatic car\u2014to help it straighten out, much like a real driver would. When the car has finished parking, it will tell you the move is complete. It\u2019s very simple to operate and is particularly helpful for people who might find it hard to move around and look over their shoulders, as is required for parking. Pros and cons \nThis technology could be popular with Motability Scheme customers, precisely because of how simple it makes difficult parking manoeuvres. For people who want to always be in total control, it might be less appealing as it requires a great deal of trust in the car. \nFor somebody who has spent their whole life driving into spaces themselves, it can initially be quite hard to adjust to the car doing it for you. Once you\u2019ve witnessed it working, it really becomes much easier to understand and it could be useful for people with limited mobility as well as people who find it painful to twist into a position to see where they\u2019re parking. What will this look like in the future? \nIt\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see cars able to park themselves without the driver needing to be in the car\u2014that\u2019s something some high-end BMW\u2019s already have. But, for now, the range of cars with automatic parking on the Motability scheme means you might find it easier than you think to get this technology\u2026 but watch this space! \nMotability Scheme customers may find this technology very useful when it is more widely available Other types of parking technology \nParking sensors are now standard on almost all new cars, including a large number of Motability Scheme vehicles. They monitor the area behind your car and beep more frequently as you get closer to an object. \nSummoning is currently a feature in high-end products, this technology is expected to filter down. You can get out and leave your car, and press a button on your key or smartphone to make the vehicle drive into a designated space or garage. Availability in the market and on the Motability Scheme \nPreviously, this sort of technology was the reserve of luxury cars, but that\u2019s no longer the case. Many vehicles on the scheme now offer automatic parking as an option or as standard. Having it as an option means you must pay a bit more to have the tech fitted to your car. In the motoring world, clever technologies tend to filter down to cars of all budgets after some time, and this is also the case with automatic parking. \nModels, such as the Volkswagen Passat, the Ford Focus, and Skoda Superb all have the technology available, but they might call it by a different name. If in doubt, check with your dealer; they\u2019ll know what automatic parking is, and the alternative name will just be that manufacturer\u2019s brand name. Inside the car, all systems will look pretty much the same, almost always being a small button near the gear lever or selector, which usually looks like a \u2018P\u2019 with a steering wheel logo next to it. \nThe Motability Scheme enables you to exchange your mobility allowance for leasing a car, scooter or powered wheelchair.

These days I don't even really read the game texts, I go in straight for the game.\nI wanted High Elves because I wanted an elf paladin on the Ally side, but in terms of design, I like the Void Elves more. They are like a combination of Blood & Night Elves, so I nickname them Blight Elves. I love the hair and the purple skin tons. I always wanted Night Elf colour options on Blood Elves. I guess it's worth a try lobbying for a normal skin ton and blonde hair for Blight Elves and try to pass off as a High Elf. I feel like the Blight Elves are the new favourite child. The racials themselves are insane, plus they have particle and gradient effects on the hair. I think Blizz has really reserved the best of every cool gimmick they have and splurged them on these elves. For once, I don't feel like the Ally got screwed. I was sad we didn't get Nightborne, but it's okay, I am even more excited to have the Velf as my new shiny xmas toy.\n...you don't care about story?

Audacity will not disappoint if you need a piece of software that can record live, convert tapes or cut and mix sounds. This utility features support for importing, processing and exporting WAV, FLAC, AIFF, AU and OGG Vorbis files. Bundled with an array of plugins and effects, this software can help you in regards to audio recording/playback, track mixing and spectrum analysis. The rich list of effects includes noise processing, equalization, bass, high and low pass filters, as well as amplify, fade in and out, normalize, reverse, echo and phaser filters. Additional effects can be added to the program, as it supports plugins. Audacity doesn't stand out for its interface. At first sight one wonders if this program is really going to be that easy to use. In fact, the interface sometimes makes it really hard to work with your tracks, especially when you zoom in on them for a more comfortable editing session. Besides this, I found myself constantly right-clicking on the working area and the tracks too, waiting for some handy context menu to appear but nothing came out. After these few first minutes struggling with the interface, it's time to begin having fun. You can open as many tracks as you want by just dragging and dropping audio files onto the program's interface. Use your mouse to select the fragment you're interested in and begin working with it. You can perform the basic editing actions (cut, copy, paste) or apply effects to it. The zoom tool helps a lot when selecting small areas, as well as the chronometers found at the bottom of the program's window. Obviously, you can use the integrated player to check how your work sounds before saving the project. Audacity features quite a large selection of filters and effects. Each one has its own setting options to adjust it to your liking. But what I loved is the possibility to preview how the filter will look on the audio track. This preview function allows novice users to test each filter before actually using it and also configure it with great accuracy. Changes in Audacity 1.3.12 Imports and Exports: * AAC files could not be exported at 48000 Hz * When importing multiple native file formats using FFmpeg, all files after the first reverted to using the native importer * FFmpeg custom export window too large on 800 x 600 resolution monitors * Projects froze if files imported via On-Demand were no longer available * (Linux) WAV/AIFF exports were corrupted if overwriting an aliased file which had been imported using the command line Labels: * Cutting or deleting a region in the waveform and label track did not move the labels in advance of the cut * Incorrect behavior snapping to labels and boundaries with Snap To enabled * Labels can now be reversed if included with the audio selection using the command line * When using non-English languages, Generate effects truncated the selected region * Mice with high-precision scroll-wheels could cause a crash * Changing recording preferences using the Transport menu did not update the menu in other open projects * (Windows 7) Clicking in a file open or save dialog caused files or folders to disappear from the list, and file filtering was broken Audacity 2.2.1 download tags Audacity 2.2.1 Windows 7 release notes New Release", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "aiff", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:11.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5fb1c3207503b7b18f480d6910c0f5cca93024bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gT.AZYqr_NjcQBnUl52mvatrqAxPCeql3A--", "site_full": "us.battle.net", "site": "battle.net", "site_section": "https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/1011638/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Story Forum - World of Warcraft Forums", "title": "Why Void Elves Make No Sense Over High Elves", "title_full": "Why Void Elves Make No Sense Over High Elves - World of Warcraft Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T18:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.108, "main_image": "/forums/static/images/social-thumbs/wow.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 462, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6552ffabbae8e1f87501306d30150227d16ff536", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gT.AZYqr_NjcQBnUl52mvau1fmLoeO4NOoNAveDxJ8FB", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Kaidran", "published": "2017-12-07T09:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "12/06/2017 02:42 PM Posted by Cantaloupe 12/03/2017 02:23 PM Posted by Vehkael Before Legion came out, the Nightborne were yet another damn Elf race being added to the game for no reason. Now people are crusading to get them added to their faction.\nThe Ren'Dorei will have an ardent fanbase soon enough. Real late to the party on this thread, but it's worth pointing out that the Shal'dorei had almost half an expansion's worth of questing and content. There was a lengthy questline to ingratiate yourself to them and literally save their civilization. It was an entire city with 10,000 years of history, with 2 dungeons and a raid.\nVoid Elves have existed for... maybe a decade, as they apparently showed up after Lor'themar became Regent to Silvermoon.\nIf you think Void Elves are getting even 25% of the lore presence of Nightborne, you are sorely mistaken.\nThe Ren'dorei are a pretty blatant plot hook for a future void expansion and could also have a part to play in Old God stuff this expansion.

There are different sizes available based on the amount of meat you want to smoke in one go. There are smaller ones and then there are smokers that allow you to cook an entire turkey! However, the most important thing about a smoker is the fuel it uses to impart flavor. Here are the four different types of fuels that are popularly used for meat smoking. It is also worthwhile to consider what kind of flavor profile you generally prefer. Electric smoker \nElectric smoker center has some great options if you are looking for an easy to use smoker. Electric smokers allow you to control the temperature. A lot of units are also automated, so you can start smoking the meat and then finish other work. Electric smokers can be a tad bit expensive. Based on the type of model you are buying and the brand you are buying from, replacing parts might be difficult if the brand doesn\u2019t make standalone parts. Wood/ pellet smoker \nThis is probably the most popular type of smoker used for cooking any type of meat. This is because a wood smoker imparts a beautiful flavor to the meat. Not just that, there are so many options to choose from when it comes to the type of wood . This depends on how smoky you want your meat to taste and how strong of a flavor you want to impart to your food. A pellet smoker uses a special system to smoke the meat. Therefore, these smokers tend to be more expensive as compared to other options. The cost of wood or pellets can also be a little steep, so that is something to keep in mind. Charcoal smoker \nNothing beats the flavor of meat smoked with charcoal. Those belonging to team charcoal will swear that the best flavor comes from smoking meat in this appliance. However, lighting a fire with charcoal and maintaining the fire are both quite tedious. The temperature requires constant monitoring. If you are smoking meat for 12-15 hours, it can be a hassle to keep checking the fire and temperature every couple of hours. Charcoal smokers can also be expensive since the cost of charcoal itself is quite high. However, if you put flavor above everything else, this is the smoker you need. Propane smoker \nPropane smokers are only slightly expensive than electric smokers. These are definitely cheaper than wood and charcoal smokers. The thing to be careful about is the amount of fuel you have on hand to power the smoker. It is always advisable to keep an extra supply when you are hosting a barbecue party. However, with a propane smoker, it is easy to control the temperature because it stays consistent. You can start the smoker, adjust the settings and then let it do its job without constant checking. \nSo now that you have all the information necessary, make the right decision so you can host the best barbecue parties in town.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "electric", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:12.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6fc5bc4ec622ccb92bd3a5b4bc60aab516eb86c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTDmPV6aDP7Lz6ad3zgpsGkljJbFsker60J.SnoKkAgpZLcfm2Z45YpRU1w8Bsnj5a326fc2ql7PbaMgM1xAfzs8a.7Ly4WDC3wNUcCUGDTjw--", "site_full": "www.windows7download.com", "site": "windows7download.com", "site_section": "http://www.windows7download.com/rss/software.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Windows 7 download - freeware, shareware - RSS - Windows 7 Download", "title": "Mgosoft PS To PDF Command Line 9.0.1", "title_full": "Mgosoft PS To PDF Command Line 9.0.1", "published": "2017-12-07T10:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SK", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 69905, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6fc5bc4ec622ccb92bd3a5b4bc60aab516eb86c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTDmPV6aDP7Lz6ad3zgpsGkljJbFsker60J.SnoKkAgpZLcfm2Z45YpRU1w8Bsnj5a326fc2ql7PbaMgM1xAfzs8a.7Ly4WDC3wNUcCUGDTjw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Mgosoft PS To PDF Command Line 9.0.1", "text": "Mgosoft PS To PDF Command Line 9.0.1 Windows 7 requirements all system Bookmark Mgosoft PS To PDF Command Line Hyperlink code: Hyperlink for Forum code: Mgosoft PS To PDF Command Line for Windows 7 - Copyright information All Mgosoft PS To PDF Command Line reviews, submitted ratings and written comments become the sole property of Windows 7 download .

This accolade is given to companies from the commercial vehicle industry whose efforts to combine economic success with social responsibility and environmental protection are worthy of recognition and whose sustainable action leads to further growth and prosperity. This year saw 16 award winners across 16 categories. MAN won the award in the truck star category for the MAN eMobility concept for developing and testing fully electric trucks. \nMAN Truck & Bus and the Austrian consortium, Council f\u00fcr nachhaltige Logistik [Council for sustainable logistics \u2013 CNL], have entered into an agreement to jointly test and optimise fully electric trucks. Production of the vehicles will take place at MAN\u2019s site in Steyr, Austria. As early as the start of 2018, nine fully electric MAN distribution trucks will be put through their paces in everyday use. \nProduction of an initial small series is planned from the end of 2018 onwards, while at the start of 2021, MAN will begin series production of electric trucks for urban distribution transport and will thereby make a further significant contribution to reducing emissions and noise in urban centres. \nWhen running on energy produced by regeneration, MAN eTrucks achieve a 100% reduction in their CO 2 pollution. The electrification potential in distribution transport is particularly high in cities as it is here that air pollution control and noise reduction are becoming increasingly important. On the road from \u201clow emission\u201d to \u201cno emission\u201d, transport companies and fleet operators are faced with various challenges that go beyond the actual vehicle. In response to this, MAN Truck & Bus established a specialised consultancy team for transport solutions that are tailored to individual needs and offer maximum economic benefit. In addition to matters regarding the vehicle itself, the consultancy team also deals with questions on infrastructure and energy needs as well as maintenance concepts and fleet design. \nAs part of its eMobility Roadmap, in 2018, MAN will also present to the public a pre-series version of an electric bus (BEV) and will field-test a demo fleet. Series production of a 100% electrically driven city bus will begin at the end of 2019. The technological expertise in the modular eMobility kit from the bus sector will therefore also be available for applications involving eTrucks. In pursuing its eMobility Roadmap, MAN benefits from its position as part of Volkswagen Group, from the synergies within the Group and from the dynamism of its passenger car division. \nThe European Transport Award for Sustainability has been presented every other year for the following year since 2011 by the trade newspaper, Transport, and HUSS-VERLAG publishing house. Among this year\u2019s competition winners were both large groups from the commercial vehicle and supplier industry, as well as typical small and medium-sized enterprises and even start-ups.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european transport award for sustainability", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "volkswagen group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "logistik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "man truck & bus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "man", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "transport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steyr", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:12.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6e7c5ab3d798cefd294aa0afe1ada7f0be8c7f9d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTueMYICVUfcpd9wZczf3pC2I4yX_s1MM7e9DFheNGBXLDsEpB0m0ThTAg_ldIKFx6PbNAWwWXpb7AxoHxki6i8DDHOu46Yf_M-", "site_full": "answers.ea.com", "site": "ea.com", "site_section": "http://answers.ea.com//ea/rss/Community?interaction.style=forum", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "New product topics in Answer HQ", "title": "FACEBOOK ACC.", "title_full": "FACEBOOK ACC.", "published": "2017-12-07T10:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1289, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6e7c5ab3d798cefd294aa0afe1ada7f0be8c7f9d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTueMYICVUfcpd9wZczf3pC2I4yX_s1MM7e9DFheNGBXLDsEpB0m0ThTAg_ldIKFx6PbNAWwWXpb7AxoHxki6i8DDHOu46Yf_M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Determinate31", "published": "2017-12-07T10:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "FACEBOOK ACC.", "text": "Hello.\nI had my account on Simpsons Tapped Out.

It will help you automatically print incoming and outgoing messages with attachments (as well as messages and attachments separately) without even opening them. The plug-in automatically unpacks and prints packed ZIP and RAR attachments, and supports manual and automatic working modes. Program settings necessary for the automatic working mode are intuitively clear and few in number. Messages printed with Print Tools look exactly the same as those printed by the standard means of Microsoft Outlook. But the plug-in makes up for some of its shortcomings. Thus, you have to change the format of an HTML message to RTF or TXT to be able to print the message with the list of attachments, because none of Microsoft Outlook versions adds the list of attachments to the message header in the HTML format. Using Print Tools, you can forget about this problem. Using Microsoft Outlook rules together with the Print Tools plug-in allows you to create a system that will automatically print messages and/or files attached to them. Although Microsoft Outlook has a standard printing rule, you can neither specify (or forbid) specific file types nor print an attachment separately from its message. Print Tools makes it possible to print any message and attachment (as well as Notes, Tasks, etc.) of any format. To start printing, just click the Print Tools button on the Microsoft Outlook toolbar. The program is ready to work right after you install it. Make your work with correspondents easier! Designed for Microsoft Outlook 2013, 2010, 2007, 2003, 2002/XP.

The moment the wife becomes unhappy with her designation as Queen, it means that the marriage cannot be. To have a peaceful and successful home both must realize their roles in it (career wise) and be accepting of it. \nTo ladies, before you get married, you must make sure that your man has a vision that is bigger and in line with yours. This is so that you can find a supporting role to its attainment. There is nothing wrong with a female career. There is nothing wrong in having a married woman being the president of the nation. It will one be expedient if her doing so is in furtherance of her husbands vision.  \n\nHow many women will love marrying a man with no vision? No one! This goes to show one of the important factors to consider before marriage. If you (as a lady) dream to one day be the Governor of The Central Bank, your dream man (spouse) has to envision being the President of the country or of the World Bank. The point is that your husband\u2019s umbrella must be big enough to cover you and your children. This isn\u2019t a limitation to the female gender but a complement. \n\nTo the men, we all are egotistic in nature. We pride ourselves in our ability to feed, shelter and provide for our families. A man loses faith with his ability when his wife seemingly becomes independent of him. A woman has no need of a man if she cannot go to him for solutions to her problem. If she has a 63 million naira contract and she is looking for a financier, she can not go to her 150 thousand a month salaried husband. This makes the man \u201cimpotent\u201d and as such his use \u201cexpired\u201d. Whatever the difference in economy and social class, when marriage occurs, a woman must and should yield her resources to the man and go under him. If she can\u2019t do that, she shouldn\u2019t marry him. \n\nThe fear of financial loss only occurs in instances where the man is less (vision wise) than the woman or when the woman has no faith in the ability or destiny of the man (or is at variance with it). A lady marrying a member of the Royal family in England will have no qualms about surrendering her finance and career to her husband. If a lady falls in love with a \u201cpauper\u201d and believes him to be her husband, she must be willing to (first of all) help him identify his vision and destiny; then (secondly) submit all her resources to help him achieve it. The goal of marriage is not success in career or financial independence but the unity of the couple.  \n\n- E.

A statement signed by Senator Solomon Adeola (Lagos South, APC)\u2019s media adviser, Kayode Odunaro, said  the Senate Committee on Local Content gave the order when it sat with 10 Senators in attendance to look into the huge variations associated with the $16 billion Egina Deep Sea Oil Project. Senator Adeola who is the committee\u2019s chairman was quoted as saying that it is becoming a tradition in NNPC and its associated subsidiaries to treat National Assembly invitations with levity stressing that the Senate Committee will henceforth not deal with lieutenants of these agencies without their heads or cogent  reasons in advance. NAPIMS sent three General Managers as representatives to the committee after it received an invitation three weeks ago for the appearance of the Group General Manager to throw light on submissions made by Total Exploration and Production Nigeria Ltd handling the Egina project. Speaking earlier, Senator Godswill Akpabio, the vice chairman of the Committee and Minority Leader of the Senate said the importance attached to the information likely to be provided led members to turn out in large numbers saying that it is insulting not only to the Nigerian Constitution but also to the office of the GGM for him to disregard the Senate invitation on issues relating to how Nigerians are being shortchanged by foreign companies and their local collaborators. Also contributing Senator Sabi Abdulahi, a member of the committee and spokesman for the Senate said Senate is angry that after 21 days\u2019 notice the GGM refused to appear adding that NAPIMS is in charge of a very critical sector of our economy and should be ready to answer the call of the Senate in its efforts to support federal government in delivering the dividend of democracy.

But many smaller businesses don\u2019t have large cash reserves and they can\u2019t buy a brand new van at the drop of a hat.\n\u201cTherefore, if we\u2019re to ensure that urban Scotland continues to be a great place to do business, then financial help should be offered to firms looking to transition to lower emission vehicles.\u201d\nThe FSB said an \u00a318 million bus scrappage scheme was already in place to help bring in low carbon public transport, adding: \u201cIt would seem fair to have a similar pot available for non-bus vehicle upgrades.\u201d\nAnd it argued for national standards to be introduced to make sure a vehicle that is compliant in Glasgow would also pass in Edinburgh.\nMr Willox added: \u201cMost UK and European low emission zones are phased in over a four-year period \u2013 giving businesses and locals the time to plan and adapt. The Scottish Government must adopt these sorts of sensible lead-in times.\u201d\nGlasgow\u2019s LEZ \u2013 which it is thought will cover much of the city centre \u2013 will come into force on a phased basis by the end of next year, with buses expected to be targeted first.\nMotorists will be fined for flaunting the new rules, but few details of how the scheme will operate and how it will be funded have been released.\nAhead of a Government statement on the issue today, campaigners called for more clarity on the plans.\nFriends of the Earth Scotland welcomed the move but insisted ministers should provide \u201cthe bulk\u201d of the necessary funding to local authorities.\nThe cost of setting up a LEZ in Glasgow was previously estimated at up to \u00a314.9m in year one.\nFriends of the Earth air pollution campaigner Emilia Hanna said ministers should be \u201ccongratulated on making LEZs a priority\u201d, but insisted \u201cpromises will be pie in the sky without the necessary funding\u201d.\nShe added: \u201cThe Scottish Government needs to set out details of how it will fund LEZs. It must provide the bulk of funding for Low Emission Zones and not simply pass the bill onto cash-strapped councils.\u201d\nScottish Conservative shadow environment Donald Cameron said the SNP should take calls for a fund to help small businesses \u201cvery seriously\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cSmall businesses have enough costs and bureaucracy without having to invest even more cash in a new fleet of vehicles.\n\u201cThe SNP has plenty of room in its budget to support ideas like this, and should give this idea proper consideration.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Scottish Greens\u2019 transport spokesman Mark Ruskell MSP condemned the Government\u2019s approach as \u201chaphazard at best\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cSo far, only a tiny proportion of buses have been retrofitted and the government needs to release new finance to allow for these upgrades as soon as possible.\u201d\nA Scottish Government spokesman said: \u201cThe Scottish Government has committed to introducing Low Emission Zones (LEZs) into Scotland\u2019s four biggest cities between 2018 and 2020. We have a clear vision for Scotland\u2019s air quality to be the best in Europe. However, air quality remains a public health issue, particularly for the youngest and oldest in our communities, and especially for those with existing respiratory conditions.\n\u201cEach LEZ must be designed for its city, and those designs are still in development, however, we are committed to providing financial support to implement LEZs in partnership with local authorities. The Finance Secretary will set out the Scottish Government\u2019s draft budget plans to the Scottish Parliament on 14 December.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mark ruskell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "willox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy willox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald cameron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emilia hanna", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "federation of small businesses", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fsb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "snp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scottish greens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aberdeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dundee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scottish parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "msp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glasgow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:13.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a7ff1be237d7b96926cbb922b814237cd619b5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTDmPV6aDP7Lz6ad3zgpsGkljJbFsker63G4DrXJtYSc_r3vrzvDTSbZ0TtzyfDtjaCtIRWWYz3nkHbBUDRv3GXffVgnsOLIcg-", "site_full": "www.windows7download.com", "site": "windows7download.com", "site_section": "http://www.windows7download.com/rss/software.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Windows 7 download - freeware, shareware - RSS - Windows 7 Download", "title": "IBM Notes Print to PDF 2.1", "title_full": "IBM Notes Print to PDF 2.1", "published": "2017-12-07T10:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SK", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 69905, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3a7ff1be237d7b96926cbb922b814237cd619b5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTDmPV6aDP7Lz6ad3zgpsGkljJbFsker63G4DrXJtYSc_r3vrzvDTSbZ0TtzyfDtjaCtIRWWYz3nkHbBUDRv3GXffVgnsOLIcg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "IBM Notes Print to PDF 2.1", "text": "IBM Notes Print to PDF - Windows 7 Download awards IBM Notes Print to PDF 2.1 full description IBM Notes Print to PDF Tool to print Lotus Notes email to PDF is flexible and handy application to operate.

The antivirus is regularly automatically updated and so is always prepared to stop the latest viruses, worms, trojans and malware in general. Heuristic analysis even allows the detection of those viruses which haven\u2019t been fully defined yet. The antivirus uses powerful technology with two scanning motors. On-access protection Every program started and every file opened undergoes an antivirus check. The resident protection reliably blocks attempts to run malware. Depending on the repair settings the defective file is renamed, moved to quarantine or permanently deleted. On-demand scanner It is possible to carry out regular or one-off checks of the entire disk, selected contents or files. Scanning can be planned on regular weekly, daily or hourly cycles but of course it can also be carried out manually according to current needs. High level of virus and spyware detection Thanks to the use of two top of the range scanner motors the antivirus is able to achieve one of the highest detection rates in the world. It is able to detect and stop practically all existing viruses, worms and trojans. Heuristic analysis In addition to traditional scanning methods based on the comparison of the data being checked with a database containing examples of viruses, the antivirus is also able to identify as yet undefined harmful code. Analysis of the structure and behaviour of the start code can with a high degree of probably ascertain if the code contains a virus or spyware. Automatic updates The antivirus is regularly automatically updated. Depending on the settings example viruses are downloaded at regular intervals, also new versions of the software are offered for downloading and installation. In this way the computer is always totally protected. Resistance against attacks The antivirus files of the system are themselves protected against any attempts to change them by unauthorized applications. In this way malware has no chance of putting the antivirus out of action and evading detection.
