At the moment there are more than 20,000 soldiers serving in the AU mission (Amisom). Uganda, which first sent troops to the country in 2007, is the biggest contributor with more than 6,000 soldiers in the force. Kenya, Burundi, Djibouti and Ethiopia are also expected to reduce their numbers by December 31. Pulling out 1,000 soldiers will not be immediately significant but it shows the international backers of Amisom want to see a handover of security to Somali soldiers and police. African countries have been praised for bringing increased stability to Somalia but there is frustration about corruption among their forces and the failure to secure an adequate victory. Efforts to develop Somalia\u2019s national army are gaining ground. The US has already increased its troop numbers in the country to more than 500 and stepped up airstrikes \u2013 boosting its co-operation with the Somali military. But defeating the militant Islamist Al-Shabaab group will not be easy. A massive bomb attack blamed on the al-Qaeda-affiliated militants killed more than 500 people in the capital, Mogadishu, two months ago \u2013 the deadliest in its campaign against various UN-backed governments.

Not only that, the sophomore driver also gave Volvo Polestar racing their first, and soon to be only constructor's title in the series. As the Polestar separates itself from Volvo, this championship is significant for both companies. \nOpening Race \nFollowing the reverse grid format, it was Kevin Gleason who would start on pole with Mehdi Bennani alongside him. Occupying the second row was Tom Chilton and Kris Richard in third and fourth, respectively. The first three would make a clean start but Richard had a slow getaway, allowing John Filippi to take fourth and the rest of the pack bunched up. \nRichard was soon swamped by the Volvos of Bjork, Nicky Catsburg and Yvan Muller. Rob Huff was in the middle of the pack of Volvos while championship contender Mischelisz was closing in on the rear bumper of Catsburg. By the second lap, Bennani made a bold move on the outside of Gleason and made it stick. Chilton did the same move a lap later. \nBy the halfway point, Bennani and Chilton had run away from the field. Gleason was still holding on to third and was coming under intense pressure from Filippi and Bjork. Yvan Muller and Rob Huff were slugging it out for sixth place with the latter keeping close to former champ's rear bumper. Back in front however, the fight for the independent's trophy was heating up. \nChilton was able to close the gap between him and Bennani with just a few laps to go. Despite being team mates, the two repeatedly touched fenders in a bid to be the opening race winner, as well as the independent's champion as both were just half a point away from each other. Chilton eventually succeeded and eventually won the race. Bennani eventually crossed the line in second and over one second adrift from his team mate. Gleason was able to hold off Filippi to take the last podium position. \nMain Race \nStarting on pole for the Main Race was Esteban Guerrieri and was accompanied by Catsburg in the front row. Huff and Bjork meanwhile would occupy the second row. Guerrieri waas determined to drive away from the field as quickly as possible and was helped by the charging Citroen of Huff. Huff made a good launch which saw him passing Catsburg by the first turn. \nAt the middle of the pack, Muller and Bennani came into contact with each other, sending the latter sideways and the hopes of claiming the Independent's Trophy title away. With Huff and Catsburg fighting for second, Guerrieri ran away with the lead. Further back, Richard dove in on the inside of Muller, who suffered damage when he made contact with Bennani. Michelisz on the other hand was hampered by brake problems, leaving him outside of the top five. \nBennani would later retire from the race due to suspension damage. This allowed Chilton to take the title for the Independent's Trophy. Back in front, Catsburg let Bjork ahead to further distance himself from a struggling Michelisz. Huff on the other hand was sitting comfortably of the Volvo. \nThe rest of the race carried through without any changes in the order. Guerrieri would cruise for the victory, with the rookie securing his future in the World Touring Car Championship. Huff was three seconds away and took home second. Rounding up the podium was Bjork, whose third place finish was enough to seal the title.

But while their margins on patient care are slim, they've more than made up for it on Wall Street. Keep reading ... words \nThe analysis: We looked at the financial documents of 84 of the biggest, most dominant not-for-profit hospital systems in the country. They don't all operate on the same fiscal year, so we looked at their latest annual filings. These systems collected $535.5 billion of annual revenue \u2014 a big piece of the entire health care. Data: Axios review of health system financial documents ; Chart: Chris Canipe and Andrew Witherspoon / Axios \nWhat we found: Cumulatively, these hospital systems made $14.4 billion in profit last year from caring for patients, for an operating profit margin of 2.7%. Add in Wall Street investments, stocks, bonds, credit default swaps and accounting gains from mergers and acquisitions, though, and their surpluses rose to $35.7 billion, or a 6.7% total profit margin \u2014 more than double the year before. Those margins aren't gigantic. But modest margins on a large amount of revenue still equal a large amount of profit. Many of these systems operate their own health insurance arms. Their financial status varied from extremely healthy (like Kaiser Permanente) to red ink (Partners HealthCare). Many academic systems, including Northwestern Memorial HealthCare in Chicago and University of Colorado Health, registered some of highest margins and surpluses. \nThe bottom line: Top tax-exempt hospital systems are quite profitable . They are raking in cash from Wall Street, as well as from their rush to merge and acquire competing hospitals and systems. Researchers say all that consolidation often has led to higher prices and higher insurance premiums \u2014 and usually does not lower costs, contrary to hospitals' marketing pitches. \n\"We don't have anything close to what most people would see as a functioning, competitive market in hospital care,\" says Alan Sager, a health policy professor at Boston University who reviewed the analysis. \"Hospitals may do well because they got dominant or because they were lucky in some of their investments.\" \nThe American Hospital Association responded to the analysis with a statement saying hospitals are benefiting from the booming stock market, and they \"need a positive margin to keep pace with advances in medicine and increasing health care needs.\" The lobbying group also faulted Medicaid and Medicare for paying \"less than the cost of care.\" \nThe AHA also said investment income gets reinvested. However, money often goes toward projects that boost revenue . \nA caveat: The analysis highlights the wealthiest hospital systems in the country. But there are many hospitals \u2014 smaller, rural facilities and publicly owned hospitals \u2014 that are struggling more because of dwindling payments, fewer patients and an inability to compete against larger, better-funded systems when negotiating payment rates with commercial insurers. \n\"Some systems are doing really well in this country.

As a result, the number of Japanese restaurants in the area has grown, leading to more and more people having interest in Japanese food. The new Century Plaza Sukhumvit Store will meet this local need by offering a menu that includes a \"donburi\" rice bowl and a \"rice set\" menu, in addition to Nagasaki Champon.\n\n  Image2: Ringer Hut Century Plaza Sukhumvit Store Area Map \n          With the opening of this store, Ringer Hut now has a total of 16 stores in 6 countries: 5 in the U.S. (including 1 ROKKAKU HAMAKATSU); 5 in Thailand (including 1 Tonkatsu HAMAKATSU), 2 each in Hong Kong and Indonesia, and 1 each in Taiwan and Cambodia. The latest store is operated by Champion Foods Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Bangkok, Thailand; Representative: Fumio Fukuhara), a subsidiary founded in 2010 to do business in Thailand for Ringer Hut Co., Ltd.

Honda has restructured its under-performing Formula One operations after the split from McLaren, with Yusuke Hasegawa to stand down as head of the Japanese company's F1 project at the end of the year.\nHonda, starting a new partnership with Red Bull-owned Toro Rosso from January, said in a statement on Thursday that Hasegawa's position would be split into two separate functions.\nToyoharu Tanabe, an experienced Formula One veteran who worked as race engineer to Austrian Gerhard Berger at McLaren in the early 1990s, had been appointed as F1 technical director.\nTanabe, who was also chief engineer to Britain's Jenson Button at BAR and Honda Racing between 2003 and 2007, will run operations at the racetrack and in testing.\nAn operating officer, yet to be named, will take charge of research and development at Sakura in Japan while Hasegawa remains executive chief engineer.\n\"By separating these areas of responsibility, we will evolve our structure so that both the development team and racing/testing team can assume their respective responsibilities more speedily,\" said Honda's brand and communications head Katsuhide Moriyama.\nHonda and McLaren split after the 2017 season that ended last month, bringing down the curtain on three painful years that saw the former world champions suffer their worst ever slump.\nMcLaren, who had a dominant partnership with Honda in the late 1980s and early 1990s, last won a race in 2012 and this year finished ninth of the 10 teams with just 30 points -- 638 fewer than champions Mercedes.\nTheir time together was beset with poor reliability and a lack of performance from a Honda engine struggling to compete with rivals.\nMcLaren, who have Spain's double world champion Fernando Alonso along with Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne as their drivers, will have Renault power next season. Toro Rosso have New Zealander Brendon Hartley and France's Pierre Gasly.

replacement schemes in Australian faces\r\n\r\nMassive changes and dislocations can take place\r\nwithout the consent of the people, and sometimes\r\nin direct opposition to it. Plague immigration and\r\nmulticulturalism are recent examples of that\r\nthesis. When politicians hang out with\r\nbillionaires, they tend to feel inferior and\r\nsomehow impoverished. Panic sets in, and they seek\r\nways to get into the big money. Mass immigration\r\nis a quick solution. Between elections the sham\r\ndemocracy continues, with policy reversals on all\r\nthe pre-election promises, as the media drones\r\nsoothe anxieties the people developed from losing\r\ntheir nation to a globalist mass immigration led\r\ninvasion.\r\n\r\nQuoting the gibbering Unsustainable Population Minister: \"It's not only about unearned real estate profits...\"\r\n\r\nWhen a third world nation's main export is its\r\nsurplus third world flesh, that nation is in big\r\ntrouble. Why import that trouble into Australia?\r\nWhich comes first - mental retardation, or\r\nmulticulturalism? Was drooling mass-idiocy the\r\nresult of a deliberate globalist plan, or the\r\nresult of inefficient dissemination of nationalist\r\ninformation? The end result is the same - Aussies\r\nget screwed. An enormous surplus population of\r\nthird world misery will come to thee also, my\r\nawful little multicultural drones. Did you think\r\nyour arses were covered? It's a grim thought, that\r\nAustralia is a nation of lemmings and spineless\r\njellyfish.\r\n\r\nAussies should understand plague immigration as a fight for their own survival or extinction\r\n\r\nAustralians should understand that all the\r\nglobalist \"reforms\" and \"liberalizations\" such as\r\nthe GST and mass immigration, they now carry as\r\nunrelenting burdens, were imposed to benefit\r\nbillionaires - not to benefit Australian workers.\r\nNative-born Australians were encouraged to take\r\npride in their culture and heritage. They liked to\r\nthink of their nation as a community sharing\r\ncommon characteristics and aspirations. But that\r\nstood in the way of globalist theft of national\r\nassets. In the place of the White Australia policy\r\nis the \"Yellow Australia Policy\" a discriminatory\r\npolicy that selects migrants on the basis of them\r\nbeing Asian. It is much more \"racist\" than the\r\nWhite Australia Policy.\r\n\r\nBecause life is too short: End plague immigration!\r\n\r\nWhile stories of water shortages, degraded\r\ninfrastructure and social violence abound, few of\r\nthe public figures who comment on them acknowledge\r\nthe role of population growth in creating these\r\nproblems and making them harder to overcome. It's\r\nclear that the sheeple make stupid choices and\r\nfreely vote for quisling political parties that\r\ninsult them and take away their freedom and\r\ndignity. This is a very real problem and exposes a\r\ndeep flaw of mass democracy. Anglophone Aussies\r\nare now finding themselves in conflict with\r\nimmigrants who express deep resentments at this\r\nhost nation for failing to \"embrace\" them and\r\ntheir funny ethnic ways. Plague immigration has\r\nbrought us such stuff as this.\r\n\r\nNo more taxpayer-funded amnesty for ethnic invaders\r\n\r\nThe nutritional value of imported human waste is\r\nzero. Why convert Australia into a sewer for the\r\nthird world's overflow? If you are determined to\r\ncontract ethnic syphilis, then export your body,\r\nplease don't import filth onto the rest of us.\r\nPlague immigration guarantees homelessness and\r\npoverty. It's not good enough for our quislings to\r\nsweep this under the carpet or brush it away by\r\nclaiming that it's the price of saving the third\r\nworld. It's a Ponzi scheme that is being saved. It\r\nis a putrid fact that the Liberal Party and the\r\nLabor Party both prefer to bail-out and support\r\nspeculators and property crime ahead of the\r\npoorest citizens, when the results of massive\r\neconomic criminality begin to hit the economy and\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nI propose that mass immigrationists be severely punished\r\n\r\nNo country is naturally multicultural - it is\r\nalways imposed with a level of social violence. To\r\nwhom do the hundreds of ethnic groups and\r\ncommunities owe allegiance? It may take a violent\r\ncrisis to find the answer. If I hear one more\r\ndrooling moron bleat and gibber about how plague\r\nimmigration has \"given us a vibrant economy full\r\nof colour and variety\" I will gut the lunatic\r\nmyself - with a rusty fishing knife. Not\r\nunderstanding the true motives behind globalism\r\nand mass immigration, Australians now \"celebrate\"\r\nthe glories of globalist fascism, urban\r\nconsolidation, cultural diversity, unemployment,\r\ntwisted economics, and government-sanctioned land\r\ngrabs.\r\n\r\nThe typical multicultural stooge is some sort of gay butt-sucking parasite\r\n\r\nIt is time to focus on the limits of Australian\r\npopulation growth from ecological and social\r\nviewpoints, and to promote policies that will lead\r\nto stabilization of Australia's population. A\r\nsustainable population depends on a renewable\r\nresource base. The psychopathology of plague\r\nimmigration addicts manifests in bizarre ways:\r\nOften we see them display emotional cycles of\r\ndesperation, pleading, and overt threat.\r\nMulticulturalism is obviously bad for their\r\ndisturbed minds. The dedicated multicultural\r\ncock-gobbler or globalist fornicator, is bonded to\r\nplague immigration by the sticky glue of\r\npsychopathological perversion. Deportation or\r\nexecution is the proper way to deal with foreign\r\nagitators and chaos merchants.\r\n\r\nSigning a multicultural contract with Satan\r\n\r\nGlobalists and their quislings run wild in\r\nAustralia, hiding under the cover provided by\r\nmedia drones chanting globalist propaganda. These\r\nprofessionals will assist you in disposing of your\r\nnation and your share in its assets. The tender\r\nlove of a globalist moron for its precious\r\nmulticulturalism is incredibly touching - isn't\r\nit? Just the sight of a fawning imbecile\r\nswallowing its dose of globalist ideology is both\r\ndepressing and irritating. Then later, you need to\r\nvomit. As a direct consequence of plague\r\nimmigration, Aussies are losing access to nature,\r\njobs, housing, medical services, hospital services\r\nand much more. Only the parasitic elites have easy\r\naccess to resources these days. How is this a good\r\nthing?\r\n\r\nWhen a government begins selling the nation's real estate to foreigners\r\n\r\nThe globalist mass media \"three wise monkeys\"\r\nmotto: See no population problem! Hear no\r\npopulation problem! Speak no population problem!\r\nMass immigration suckhole monkeys lie for money\r\nand influence. Too bad about Australians. You can\r\nidentify agents of globalism - people wanting to\r\n\"change the world\" with mass immigration and\r\ncultural diversity. Working for billionaires, the\r\nglobalists tell us we are to be debt-burdened\r\nhuman resources and tenants - but never citizens.\r\nPoliticians and economists miss the point.\r\nCramming as many people into the country as it\r\nwill hold, is no way for people to lead\r\nfulfilling, prosperous lives. Especially when more\r\npeople means less prosperity and lower standards\r\nof living.\r\n\r\nOur heritage and history is being eradicated and bulldozed to please hungry property developers\r\n\r\nThe end is near for Australia as a good place to\r\nlive and work, thanks to bulk immigration. Of\r\ncourse, the major \"jobs\" going in the third world\r\nfuture will be perpetual \"job-seeking\" or forced\r\n\"volunteer\" labour. Elevate the wealthy! Create a\r\nglobal level playing field! Deplete your\r\nresources! Plunder! Kill! Loot! Invade! Spoon-feed\r\nyour plague landlords! Work for less than nothing!\r\nBecome aspirational! Stop! Go! Save! Spend! Run!\r\nJump! Breed! Consume! Die! The traditional\r\npolitical hypocrisies are bipartisan, and that\r\nsure isn't democracy. It is more like the\r\nStalinist globalism that gave us plague\r\nimmigration and its \"reform\" agendas. Our dirtbag\r\nleaders are more criminal than negligent.\r\n\r\nThe social environment broken by a plague immigration cargo-cult\r\n\r\nPushing Australians into poverty makes a lot of\r\nsense to the mass immigration industry and\r\ncargo-cultist politicians, because anything that\r\ndisempowers Australians can only assist the\r\nproject to turn Australia into a third world\r\npolyglot cesspit. No single person or entity can\r\nstop the globalist political mafia that has\r\nevolved unchecked in Australia. Only a united,\r\ndetermined and righteously angry Australian public\r\ncan stop it. More human locusts than ever, cover\r\nthe earth with urbanization, highways, and other\r\nactivities. This reduces available land resources.\r\nCropland is a vital resource, with more than 99.7\r\npercent of human food calories coming from the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe multicultural gutting of Australian culture and identity\r\n\r\nI want the full attention of all you pathetic\r\nmulticultural lemmings out there. You lemmings\r\nneed to know that your idiocy is contributing to a\r\nforeign invasion of Australia. I'm inflexible and\r\nintolerant towards morons. It's one of my faults.\r\nAustralian multicultural universities radiate a\r\nstrong subliminal message to Aussies. \"This is not\r\nyour place anymore - it is a globalist institution\r\nand we serve foreign clientele.\" Since most\r\nAussies are too poor for uni, they make way for\r\naliens. We don't need plague immigration. The\r\nhealth of our country does not depend on it, nor\r\ndoes the vitality of business, nor the welfare of\r\nthe average person. On the contrary, it is\r\ndestructive, it is damaging us all.\r\n\r\nPolitical puppets of property developers find imaginative and clever ways to \"justify\" plague immigration\r\n\r\nAround the world, globalist media drones bleat the\r\nsame bullshit promoting mass immigration and\r\ncultural diversity. The fact that this is\r\norganized by globalist billionaires has failed to\r\nturn on the lights in the dim-bulb mentalities of\r\nmost people. Globalist billionaires plan to make\r\nAustralia \"culturally diverse\" or like the former\r\nJugoslavia - a collection of mutually antagonistic\r\ncultures united in name only. The subhuman\r\nresources are always replaceable with imported\r\nscab labour. After our elected quislings and their\r\nblood-sucking billionaire mates have gang-raped\r\nthis country, how will the starving polyglot\r\nhordes live among the ruins? Probably as stupid\r\nover-breeding ethnic locusts to the bitter end.\r\n\r\nThe cancerous outgrowth of a cultural diversity growth-fetish\r\n\r\nWe have been fed enough of this shit - it's time\r\nfor Australia to withdraw from the 1951 and 1967\r\nrefugee convention. The world has changed and\r\napplying the refugee convention in today's world\r\nhas proved to be corrupt, flawed and unworkable.\r\nThe bipartisan plague immigration policies have\r\nmoved strongly in the \"progressive\" direction -\r\nwhere \"progressive\" is defined as conforming to\r\nthe billionaire friendly views of the cultural\r\nelites while ignoring the views of most\r\nAustralians. Population growth is only compatible\r\nwith a rising standard of living when a nation is\r\nstill not overpopulated, or can call upon\r\ntechnological progress to offset the disadvantages\r\nof overpopulation. Technology now aggravates\r\nresource overload.\r\n\r\nIt's much easier to build \"Stack and Pack\" kennels for the sheeple, and supermarkets to feed them their slop\r\n\r\nBy the time scientists began to worry out loud\r\nabout what to do \"if\" the world \"eventually\" were\r\nto become overloaded and overpopulated, it already\r\nwas. Growth and progress committed mankind to\r\nliving beyond Earth's sustainable carrying\r\ncapacity. Multicultural guilt geeks morbidly\r\nruminate and rave about the historic guilt of\r\ntheir society, usually for the purpose of claiming\r\nmoral superiority. They want others to do\r\nsomething about it - more plague immigration,\r\ntypically. During the 1980s, armies of\r\ngovernment-subsidized Asiacrat think-tanks,\r\nincluding economic, cultural and academic groups,\r\nsprang up, promoting Australia's integration into\r\nAsia. The contempt politicians have for the\r\nAustralian people is staggering.\r\n\r\nNot all of us have offered our arses to the gods of multiculturalism\r\n\r\nBatteries of psychologists are ready to apply the\r\nstern principles of economic \"science\" to those\r\nrecalcitrant Aussies who strangely refused to\r\nbecome wealthy under globalist plague immigration,\r\nand \"chose\" unemployment and homelessness instead.\r\nWith population growth, we cannot ever hope to\r\ncure mass unemployment, because the dynamic of\r\nmodern industry is toward ever more machine labour\r\nreplacing human labour. Technology won't stop, and\r\nit naturally makes production ever more efficient.\r\nOnly three things are infinite: globalist greed,\r\npolitical corruption, and human stupidity.\r\nAustralia is a stupid fly caught in the globalist\r\nspider web, and will soon enough be nothing more\r\nthan a dry husk memorializing multicultural\r\nmadness.\r\n\r\nIndigenous people universally reject the hypocrisy and arbitrary rules of multiculturalism\r\n\r\n\"Embracing\" plague immigration was how Australia\r\ngot into all this trouble, stopping plague\r\nimmigration is how Australia can begin to climb\r\nout of it. Just give up this infantile enthusiasm\r\nfor plague immigration and real estate Ponzi\r\nschemes. Well-bribed quisling politicians have\r\nhanded Australians over to international parasites\r\nsuch as Jewish billionaires to be plundered and\r\ngutted. This accords with a rapid transition to a\r\nthird world Globalist-Stalinist control system.\r\nMillions of resentful third world immigrants will\r\nresult in consequences destructive to the current\r\ninhabitants of this country and its environment.\r\nThe supposed benign effects of cultural diversity\r\nand brute-force immigration are pure\r\nconfabulation.\r\n\r\nSo many globalist quislings, so little time\r\n\r\nPolitical movements of all stripes support\r\nunsustainable population growth. The Left because\r\nthey are destructively insane, and the Right\r\nbecause they are destructively greedy. Population\r\ngrowth reduces per capita wealth, and can reduce\r\ntotal wealth. Plague immigration and population\r\nare both up - living costs are UP! Not making life\r\ncheaper, but completely unaffordable. The greedy\r\nverbal droolings of \"business\" parasites are\r\nself-serving and short-sighted to say the least.\r\nOur worthless politicians tell us that they won't\r\ndeliver good government, but they will spend our\r\nmoney on fireworks, sports spectaculars, and\r\nimported scab labour. The little Aussie suckers\r\nnever get tired of being ashamed of themselves.\r\n\r\nPlague immigration hugely exacerbates any housing crisis: Good news for property parasites\r\n\r\nWe have lots of local parasites who feed on plague\r\nimmigration like leeches, and a nice little earner\r\nit is for them too. But why should Australians\r\ntolerate foreign enclaves growing within their own\r\ncities just to enrich racketeers? What an economic\r\ndownturn means: Our quisling leaders bail out the\r\nparasite elites, who are then bloated with our\r\ndebt contracts and collateral. The other citizens?\r\nOops! The money ran out - we can't afford anything\r\nfor them. Sorry! There is a strange kind of\r\nhysteria where people feel threatened that they\r\nwill die if Australia stops importing floods of\r\nscab labour from the third world. As an addiction,\r\nthis pathology seems more desperate than most.\r\n\r\nThe parasitic globalist ideologies laid bare\r\n\r\nThis quisling government's globalist \"reforms\" are\r\nstrangely always for the worse. Given the severe,\r\nprolonged, unsustainable and escalating levels of\r\nsocial chaos and economic suffering under\r\nglobalism, outbreaks of civil unrest are\r\ninevitable. It's too late for niceness. There\r\nisn't time left to be nice. We're at war with our\r\nglobalist politicians. If you don't feel like\r\nfighting, then just sit down, have a biscuit and a\r\ncup of tea and wait for them to come and get you.\r\nBecause they will. Our ruling elites, rather than\r\ncomprehending the population crisis, remain\r\nfixated on their priorities of enriching\r\nthemselves, building monuments, waging wars, and\r\ndrawing sufficient tribute from the peasants to\r\nsupport their opulent lifestyles.\r\n\r\nNow, my little sheeple, please pay attention. There is no such thing as \"sustainable growth\"\r\n\r\nI dislike the fact that Australia offers its open\r\narse to the world's economic rapists. Nobody\r\nadmires used-up old crack whores. People need to\r\nunderstand the burdensome costs of plague\r\nimmigration and globalism they will be forced to\r\ncarry. To quisling politicians and media drones,\r\nto arrive at globalist utopia, you cram the\r\nmaximum number of breeding subhumans into all\r\naccessible areas. That they might live and die\r\nmiserably, hardly matters in this \"vibrant\" quest\r\nfor unearned profit. Our elected quislings are\r\njust arsewipes for globalists who would destroy\r\nour nation. Don't accept their lies any more. We\r\nmust become the resistance or opposition. We must\r\nfight for our nation or we will lose everything\r\nand end up as slaves or worse.\r\n\r\nThe wealthy globalists can run off to other countries, but most Aussies cannot escape the mess the globalists leave behind\r\n\r\nScab labour mobility (with capital and resource\r\nmobility) is a significant source of plague\r\nimmigration and an intrinsic feature of globalist\r\nracketeering. This is suspect from a moral point\r\nof view since it destroys communities and\r\nheritage. The flesh-eating green slime, or\r\nshape-shifting aliens from the nether regions, are\r\nonly encountered in horror stories, but\r\noverpopulation and plague immigration are\r\ndestroying us in the here and now. The opportunity\r\ncost of inaction is too high. Aussies don't know\r\nthe full extent of Australia's natural resources\r\nand yet their living standards get worse each\r\nyear, while they are amongst the most highly taxed\r\npeople in the world. Aussies are quickly heading\r\ntowards third world nation status.\r\n\r\nThe economic pie may expand a little, but if the number of people who share it grows much faster, the slices get much smaller\r\n\r\nPlague immigration and the lunacy of\r\nmulticulturalism are sure ways to destroy a\r\nnation, but the political left, who saw their\r\nhopes of world domination sink with the Soviet\r\nUnion, seized hold of that cultural diversity\r\nclaptrap. Investment banking is a disgrace:\r\nGlobalism unleashed financial parasites and Ponzi\r\nschemes upon our society. The financial services\r\nindustry must be a servant of the economy and the\r\nsociety - not a self-perpetuating, blood-sucking\r\nvampire. As humans climbed the so-called ladder of\r\nprogress, they kicked each rung to pieces reaching\r\nfor the next. They have run out of rungs, and the\r\none holding them up is cracking beneath their\r\nweight. If it gives way, there's nothing to break\r\nthe fall.\r\n\r\nPushing imported ethnic diversity offers absolutely no benefit to Australia\r\n\r\nUnder globalist dictates, Australia is importing\r\nall those characteristics that make a country an\r\neconomic basket case and a third world pesthole.\r\nOur criminal \"leaders\" push wage restraint and\r\nprice rises as a solution for this assault.\r\nWeak-minded fools clinging to false charity and\r\nfalse humanitarianism are just as destructive as\r\nthe globalist psychopaths who promote plague\r\nimmigration in anticipation of unearned profit.\r\nThese individuals are working for the same\r\ncatastrophe. I suggest that the case against mass\r\nimmigration is stronger than the rest of us\r\nrealize - and it's a stronger case than the\r\ngibbering globalist ratbags would wish to debate.\r\n\r\nAussies are an easy kill for globalism\r\n\r\nNow that Aussies are snared and entangled in Ponzi\r\nschemes and real estate debt bubbles, they want\r\nlower interest rates. They may want debt to have a\r\nlower price, but do they really want more debt?\r\nPlague immigration has baited this debt-trap. To\r\nturn viciously against their own kind, while\r\n\"embracing\" alien introjects, is the multicultural\r\nstyle of quislings and traitors. This frenzied\r\nhatred for their own people is boosted by guilt,\r\ngreed for unearned profit and fear of being\r\nexposed. The globalist mass media periodically\r\ngenerate pro-population growth scare campaigns. We\r\nare \"xenophobic racists\" if we object to plague\r\nimmigration, and then there is the \"skills\r\nshortages\" scam, and the bogus \"aging population\"\r\nscare!\r\n\r\nNo matter how often the immigrationist dogma is debunked, it always rises from its grave like a mindless zombie\r\n\r\nJust like all parasites and cancer, political\r\npsychopaths and property pimps only care about\r\ntheir own greed. Other Aussies are only here until\r\nthey can be completely displaced by imported scab\r\nlabour and breeding third world locusts. As rapid\r\npopulation growth and urbanization in poor\r\ndeveloping countries will jeopardize their food\r\nsecurity, result in high unemployment, and create\r\npolitical instability, then we should boost\r\nsupport for international family planning\r\nassistance. Morbid politically correct quislings\r\njust demonstrate that treason never takes a\r\nholiday. Their disastrous globalism only produces\r\nenslavement to a malignant multicultural\r\nphilosophy that rewards wealthy parasites.\r\n\r\nThe ugly economics of plague immigration\r\n\r\nFar from ignoring racial differences in the search\r\nfor harmony, multiculturalism actually seeks to\r\nemphasize and preserve them. Anyone who upsets\r\nthis happy little applecart will be attacking the\r\nblack Ponzi scheme heart of the establishment.\r\nWhen brute-force immigration leads to Australian\r\nsuburbs becoming distinctly monocultural or\r\nmonoracial and alien to the mainstream culture,\r\nthat is colonization - not immigration. It is a\r\ngenerally negative phenomenon for Australia\r\noverall. New diseases enter Australia. TB and\r\nHepatitis B from Asia are a huge problem. We see\r\n1,000 deaths per annum from Hepatitis B and rates\r\nof TB contact in inner Sydney schools of 25%. The\r\ngovernment cannot provide the necessary screening\r\nprocedures.\r\n\r\nPeople don't know themselves under multiculturalism - except as obedient lickspittles of aliens\r\n\r\nYears after the globalist financial crisis, it's\r\nclear that none of the underlying property rackets\r\nand financial Ponzi schemes have been banned. On\r\nthe contrary, there is a savage return to plague\r\nimmigration and real estate racketeering. Soon\r\nenough, the imported hordes become welfare\r\nrecipients squeezing out offspring, making the\r\nnext generation of ethnic cuckoos to envy, resent\r\nand undermine Australians. Being conquered by the\r\ndross of the third world is a dehumanizing\r\nexperience. When our globalist lackeys insist on\r\nplague immigration into Australia, urban\r\nconsolidation and trouble become inevitable. These\r\ncorrupt arrangements must be brought to an end and\r\nthe power of the cult of toxic immigration must be\r\nbroken.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "labor party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal party", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "soviet union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:42.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "53f25fb1d09987fbecdc2d6c53a542f7b5c7112d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWZ5Qwe35OYZIMOsW6fut9dFEfao0KOtyO9vz_rSNN2QDJFPZDIyYnlFYHCdumUwE-", "site_full": "www.blowoutforums.com", "site": "blowoutforums.com", "site_section": "https://www.blowoutforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=7", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "FOOTBALL - Blowout Cards Forums", "title": "How many Jimmy G rookie cards are out there?", "title_full": "How many Jimmy G rookie cards are out there?

That fixed it.\nWhen I said earlier that there are no other DHCP servers beside the USG, I meant the clients I could log-in, check and configure. Unfortunately there are also few internet gateways for IoT devices in the LAN, locked up by their vendors, and the baddie could be one of them. In the coming days I will spend some time with Wireshark.\nThe confusing part is that the only change I made in the LAN was replacing a couple of D-Link switches with a pair of ' UniFi Switch 8', three weeks ago. All was fine until the last weekend when the DHCP problems started showing. Anyway..\nThank you very much for your time and help,\nMomchil\nView solution in original post", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:42.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3c0213140523a22e93c9e29205f7d8e5e87e5ca1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsKxcltYSq3lRjmEedNjhRMK.oBgjMfZMjjR13htoZiFkpvgMyX54Joy1YW_euY4NgUFimhsur1X7OSUyJ7t.SnAs_qfSFbXMkAA--", "site_full": "community.ubnt.com", "site": "ubnt.com", "site_section": "https://community.ubnt.com/t5/UniFi/ct-p/UniFi", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "UniFi - Ubiquiti Networks Community", "title": "Solved: Wrong DG by DHCP", "title_full": "Solved: Wrong DG by DHCP - Ubiquiti Networks Community", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6846, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "22ff075b14b983e792e2eb52a006a4f735f267b6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsKxcltYSq3lRjmEedNjhRMK.oBgjMfZMjjR13htoZiFkpvgMyX54Joy1YW_euY4NgUFimhsur1X7OSUyJ7t.SnAtpywLPpbNSt3JMnP2UzPfH", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "momchilp", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "The .251 address is offline.\nIf you look at the attached screenshot you will see that I have deliberately excluded it from the DHCP range of USG.\nThe cable modem LAN port is connected only to the WAN port of USG.

In the coming days I will spend some time with Wireshark.\nThe confusing part is that the only change I made in the LAN was replacing a couple of D-Link switches with a pair of ' UniFi Switch 8', three weeks ago. All was fine until the last weekend when the DHCP problems started showing.

But at nearly every turn, automakers have opposed the new rules that have made these advances possible. Today, strong standards to improve vehicles are under attack, and automakers face a choice.

These arguments have been used against advances like seat belts, air bags, fuel economy improvements and pollution controls. \n\u201cAuto industry executives have claimed repeatedly that new rules would destroy the industry,\u201d Cooke said. \u201cThey\u2019re still here today. Policymakers and the press simply can\u2019t take these claims at face value.\u201d \nThis year, the Trump administration has re-opened federal vehicle efficiency standards, a remarkably successful policy that has improved efficiency for vehicles from small cars to big SUVs and pickup trucks. The auto industry is lobbying the administration to weaken the rules, deploying their now-predictable playbook of scare tactics and misinformation. \n\u201cAmerica\u2019s automakers thrive when they\u2019re innovating,\u201d said Margo Oge, the former director of the EPA\u2019s Office of Transportation and Air Quality. \u201cEmissions regulations have historically spurred innovation, and the industry has always beat their own cost and performance targets in complying. Working towards the 2025 standards, the U.S. auto industry has come roaring back in profitability and sales. Today, Americans have more choices than ever, and the safest and cleanest cars in history. The new technologies are creating high paying jobs and making the industry a leader again, globally. Automakers must stop trying to shift us into reverse.\u201d \n\u201c Time for a U-Turn \u201d shows that, despite their historic claims, automakers can innovate to meet health, safety and environmental standards that have delivered real benefits to America\u2019s drivers. Today, automakers are meeting or even exceeding the standards they helped to design in 2010, and drivers have saved nearly $50 billion at the pump as a result. \n\u201cIt\u2019s time for auto manufacturers to keep the promises they made,\u201d said former California state Sen. Fran Pavley, who authored legislation that established the first-ever global warming pollution standards for cars and trucks in the U.S. and provided a model for federal emissions rules. \u201cThey fought hard to stop standards that would benefit consumers and the climate, but when push came to shove, they innovated and are meeting the requirements. Automakers should continue investing in technology, not hiding behind public relations strategies and lobbyists. Drivers want to be able to buy vehicles that pollute less and protect our health. We can\u2019t afford to go back on the progress we\u2019ve made.\u201d \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dave cooke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fran pavley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cooke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margo oge", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ucs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epa\u2019s office of transportation and air quality", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:43.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7cd415bc53f3a478c1b6767c04d129f44881405e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Fsl59LiHyHLe_huI1WvSwCKCuWCsjKWHCPFkCzruaSeWR9bx1aMHb_cOVSZlifJKPsS.ACJK97w--", "site_full": "www.travbuddy.com", "site": "travbuddy.com", "site_section": "http://www.travbuddy.com/forums/viewforum.php?id=9", "site_categories": ["travel"], "section_title": "Asia - North East &amp; South East - Travel Forums - TravBuddy ", "title": "Travelling to Thailand and Vietnam", "title_full": "Travelling to Thailand and Vietnam - Travel Forums - TravBuddy", "published": "2017-11-26T15:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 50616, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7cd415bc53f3a478c1b6767c04d129f44881405e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Fsl59LiHyHLe_huI1WvSwCKCuWCsjKWHCPFkCzruaSeWR9bx1aMHb_cOVSZlifJKPsS.ACJK97w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bennn123", "published": "2017-11-26T15:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "Travelling to Thailand and Vietnam", "text": "Hi Guys,\nJust need a bit of advice as its my first time travelling.

Contrary to what most people think, Thailand is actually one of the safest places to travel alone as a tourist within SEA countries. Vietnam, on the other hand, is a little less so. When I say safe, I'm referring to active crime: Thai people aren't known to be as confrontational, so the main things to watch out for are scams and cons. For Vietnam, the same can happen as well but there are also incidents of snatch thieves on motorcycles, so take extra care of your valuables when walking near roads. As a rule of thumb, always practice safe traveling habits, never be afraid to say no to any ridiculous deals (they will try to rip if you off if you look lost and can be persistent about it).\nTo answer your question, it won't be worth it to book your holiday through a travel agent in your own country especially since you'll be there for 30 days each and it'll be really costly.\nJust do a bit of research beforehand and figure out which parts of both countries you want to visit and plan your tours depending on the location (example if you're in Thailand, arrive at Bangkok first then make your travel arrangements if you're heading out of the city). If you're in main cities, it'll be pretty easy to navigate yourself around as long as you get a local sim card and have done your homework.

steps does it take to actually watch a channel?\nExample: Using cable tv. turn on cable box and tv. 2 buttons. then scroll thru channels. Done in under seconds.\nOh its terribly complicated.\nFirst I have to turn on the TV. Then the Firestick. 2 buttons. THEN I have to rest for fluids and some simple carbs to get ready for part 2.\nNext I scroll down, two taps, to SLING and hit ok. This brings up the Sling App and it will display channels and what is on them. NOW, if youre not too tired yet, if you are winded a break is ok, but then you scroll to the channel youd like to see and hit OK. That channel is now playing.

Since the incident she's been very tearful. It's so sad to see. It's aged her overnight. It's a travesty to see her so frail,\" Mrs Howard said. \nMrs Howard said her mother was walking on a straight and wide part of Sackmore Lane in Marnhull where she would have been visible to drivers. \nMrs Howard added her mother often walked the lane and other people in the village regularly walked it. \n\"She could hear the vehicle and she thought in her mind 'it's not going to stop' and there is a junction ahead so they weren't slowing down for that either,\" said Mrs Howard. \nMrs Palmer was hit by the car from behind and was thrown on to her back \u2013 the vehicle did not stop, the family said. \n\"She was on the side of the road for ten minutes screaming. It's lucky nothing else hit her,\" Mrs Howard added. \nAn elderly female driver stopped to help Mrs Palmer but then drove up the lane to turn around and come back. \nThinking the driver had left her there, Mrs Palmer walked alone back to her house and phoned her family who took her straight to hospital. \n\"She was probably only gone for five minutes, but for my mum, it felt like a lot longer,\" said Mrs Howard. \nMrs Howard said as her mother was hit from behind and in shock she was not sure what kind of vehicle hit her but believed it to be a silver or grey car or small van. \nA statement from Dorset Police said: \"Dorset Police received a report at 5.18pm on Wednesday, November 29, of a collision involving a pedestrian and a vehicle in Sackmore Lane in Marnhull. It was reported that the collision occurred at around 10.45am. \n\"It was reported that the pedestrian, a woman aged in her 70s, was initially able to make her way home but was later taken to hospital with injuries to her wrist and shoulder. \nThe spokesperson added officers were continuing to make enquiries into the incident no arrests had been made. \nIf you have any information about the incident which may help police with their enquiries call 101 and quote incident number 29:310.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "howard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catherine palmer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "debra howard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrs howard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrs palmer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dorset police", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "marnhull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sackmore lane", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:44.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0910cd777eefe7fbfbe48fdb59386dee639608e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS8qOi0.csoDjYYjoqXSukzU-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0910cd777eefe7fbfbe48fdb59386dee639608e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS8qOi0.csoDjYYjoqXSukzU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gautham8", "published": "2017-12-07T11:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "#include<stdio.h>\r\nvoid push(int ar,int top,int n);\r\nvoid pop(int ar,int top,int n);\r\nvoid display(int ar,int top,int n);\r\nvoid main()\r\n{\r\n    int top=-1,n,ar[100],t;\r\n    char ch;\r\n    printf(\"Enter the maximum size of the stack (lees than 100) : \");\r\n    scanf(\"%d\",&n);\r\n    while(ch='y'||ch='Y')\r\n    {\r\n        printf(\"Enter your choice : \");\r\n        scanf(\"%d\",&t);\r\n        switch(t)\r\n        {\r\n        case 1:\r\n            push(ar,top,n);\r\n            break;\r\n        case 2:\r\n           pop(ar,top,n);\r\n           break;\r\n        case 3:\r\n           display(ar,top,n);;\r\n           break;\r\n        default:\r\n            printf(\"Invalid\");\r\n        }\r\n        printf(\"Do you want to continue ?
