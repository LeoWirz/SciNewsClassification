Staff Photo by Matt Stone prev next comments Guerschon Yabusele hit his third 3-pointer as a Celtic last night, and on his way back down the floor celebrated by shooting an imaginary arrow, and following up the motion with a so-called dab, covering his face with the inside of his right arm.\nThat the big rookie forward had the opportunity to try out a new celebration, or that Shane Larkin again played crunch time minutes, and Daniel Theis out of necessity led the team with 11 rebounds, speaks to what the Celtics have been able to do with their depth this season.\nJaylen Brown missed last night\u2019s game with a contact lens-related eye infection, Marcus Morris also sat out because of recurring knee soreness, and once again Brad Stevens had to go deep into his bullpen in the Celtics\u2019 97-90 win over Dallas.\nThe Celtics, building a fresh streak, have won their last four games and six of their last seven.\n\u201cThem being very professional and staying very focused, those guys are working harder than any of us every day because they\u2019re in the gym, they\u2019re getting extra shots, extra conditioning,\u201d Al Horford said of the reserves, with 11 players reaching the floor last night. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see them get rewarded.\n\u201cGuerschon was great, his energy was great. Shane, very impressive, came out aggressive, and then defensively he had some big plays for us. Happy to see the bench guys get some minutes.\u201d\nAnd on a horrid shooting night when a win meant overcoming a 41.4-percent shooting performance, not to mention ratcheting up their defense following a porous first half, the Celtics again needed a strong finishing kick from their closer, Kyrie Irving.\nThe Celtics guard scored nine of his 23 points in the last 6:46 of the game, a familiar ending for anyone who has watched Irving throughout his All-Star career.\nMavs coach Rick Carlisle saw Irving do something similar on Nov.\u200920, when the Celts won in Dallas in overtime. Irving followed up a five-point fourth by scoring 10 of the C\u2019s 14 points in overtime, including their first six of the extra period.\nSomething similar happened last night after Harrison Barnes, with a tough 15-footer over a fully extended Jayson Tatum, tied the score at 85-85 with 4:31 left.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have an exact recollection of it,\u201d said Carlisle. \u201cIrving made some amazing plays, which he always does.\u201d\nThe Celtics responded to Barnes\u2019 jumper with a 12-2 run, including three drives from Irving \u2014 a dizzying push off the fast break, another quick drive for a three-point play with the Mavs again caught on their heels, and a banking one-handed floater.\nAll of it was scored in traffic, of course.\nThese late displays by Irving, which are every bit as overpowering as the fourth quarter performances turned in by Isaiah Thomas last season, are having one undesired effect: They are labeling the Celtics as a second-half team.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to necessarily just be a second-half team,\u201d said Irving. \u201cBut some of our first halves haven\u2019t been the best, and we understand that. Teams just come in and just hit us right away, which we\u2019ve come to expect. And we always try to keep it within distance, especially if we\u2019re not particularly playing well on both ends of the floor.\n\u201cIn the second half we just have to raise our level. Otherwise teams are going to kick our butts,\u201d he said.\nLast night, in addition to Irving coming through on a night when the overall offensive picture was murky at best, the Celtics put this one away defensively.\nAfter spotting Dallas 57 points on 46.2 percent 3-point shooting in the first half, the Celts limited the Mavs to 33 second half points on 31.8 percent shooting, including 20 percent (3-for-15) from downtown.\n\u201cThey were playing really well the first half and I don\u2019t think they were feeling us, and we turned our intensity up,\u201d said Horford. \u201cWe needed to do more, make them a little more uncomfortable, and once we started to do that, it worked.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://embed.sendtonews.com/player3/embedcode.js?fk=KG5SCeOG&cid=4407&offsetx=0&offsety=0&floatwidth=400&floatposition=bottom-right"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kyrie irving", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mark murphy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "devin harris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel theis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rick carlisle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaylen brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "horford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcus morris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt stone credit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carlisle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j.j. barea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salah mejri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dirk nowitzki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guerschon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt stone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al horford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdel nader", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad stevens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dennis smith jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jayson tatum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barnes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shane larkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harrison barnes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yogi ferrell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isaiah thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin chapman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guerschon yabusele", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irving", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terry rozier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin bacon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mavericks", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "celtics", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "celtic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mavs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "celts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston celtics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irving", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas mavericks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt stone boston celtics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston 12/06/17) boston celtics", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "garden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "td garden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:52:58.031+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a38e21d0d8044d4359ad6a9f833a60150b39762c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.VtKPztcQBEny8iz.lAFSsskZ955XDC73xDjIOIvTg29tzeDiJlv7nvhV_7ciECIl9tByzxb3KTIZaQ8z0MJgSvRQeluyq2Ja.0w1hHRHpCyp9TwZGBBYDtiiqtXlSB9xrflXXe3qNDPpPNWp1zv9zetwKUtMsliU-", "site_full": "www.globalenergyworld.com", "site": "globalenergyworld.com", "site_section": "http://www.globalenergyworld.com/rss/index.asp", "site_categories": ["business", "green_solutions"], "section_title": "GlobalEnergyWorld.com: Be the first to know", "title": "Wartsila Electrical and Automation Joint Venture in China Now Fully Operational", "title_full": "Wartsila Electrical and Automation Joint Venture in China Now Fully Operational", "published": "2017-12-07T10:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.globalenergyworld.com/data_news/ID31687_600.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a38e21d0d8044d4359ad6a9f833a60150b39762c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.VtKPztcQBEny8iz.lAFSsskZ955XDC73xDjIOIvTg29tzeDiJlv7nvhV_7ciECIl9tByzxb3KTIZaQ8z0MJgSvRQeluyq2Ja.0w1hHRHpCyp9TwZGBBYDtiiqtXlSB9xrflXXe3qNDPpPNWp1zv9zetwKUtMsliU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "Wartsila Electrical and Automation Joint Venture in China Now Fully Operational", "text": "click to enlarge \nThe technology group W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 has announced the opening of CSSC Wartsila Electrical & Automation (Shanghai) Co.

A total of 42 containers of imported fruit from China were destroyed because they did not attach a health insurance letter from their home country during inspection at the Container Terminal Surabaya. (ANTARA PHOTO/Syaiful Arif) Jakarta, Dec 6 (Antara) - The Quarantine Office and Police here on Wednesday seized one thousand kilograms of fruits and 300 kilograms of potatoes imported illegally from the neighboring country, Malaysia. Some 1,053 kilograms of fresh fruits were seized by the Tarakan Wilker Quarantine Office in the outermost areas of Sebatik Island, North Kalimantan province, after the importer failed to show the permit and the \"phytosanitary certificate\" from the Malaysian authority. \"Following a tipoff from the people on the illegal import of Malaysia`s fresh fruits into our country, we directly raided Lalosalo port in North Sebatik subdistrict,\" Banun Harpini, the Agriculture Ministry`s head of quarantine office, noted in her written statement received by Antara in Jakarta on Wednesday. The Sebatik quarantine officers found some people moving the fruits from a long boat to a pickup truck. During the probe, the quarantine officers found 12 types of fresh fruits, including apples, oranges, pears, grapes, longans, and papayas. The officers seized the imported fruits, in accordance with the Law No.16 year 1992 on Quarantine of Animals, Fish, and Plants, along with the Agriculture Minister`s Regulation No.42 Year 2012 on Quarantine Measures of Fresh Fruits Distribution to Indonesia, as well as the Minister`s Regulation No.55 Year 2016 on Supervision of Fresh Food Distribution to Indonesia. Harpini noted that the quarantine office has stepped up its efforts to crack down the smuggling of some strategic commodities, such as rice, corn, sugar, onions, spices, and meats. Some smuggling-prone areas include the east coastline of Sumatra Island, and the border areas of Kalimantan, Papua, and East Nusa Tenggara provinces. Meanwhile, the West Kalimantan Police also foiled the smuggling of 300 kilograms of potatoes from Malaysia during the search in Flamboyan market, Pontianak. The police arrested a suspect, with initial Su, with 30 sacks of potatoes, Police Sen. Comm. Mahyudi Nazriansyah, the director of special crime unit said in the West Kalimantan`s capital city, Pontianak, remarked on Wednesday. Nazriansyah explained that the suspect was captured when he was distributing the illegal potatoes to some dealers at the market on Tuesday night. \"The potatoes were purchased at the Entikong border regions, Sanggau district,\" he revealed, adding that the suspect would be charged under the article 31 of the Law No.16 Year 1992 on the Quarantine of Animals, Fishes, and Plants. Before the capture, the Chief of West Kalimantan Police, Brig.Gen. Pol. Didi Haryono has targeted \"zero\" illegal trade in the province. Hence, Haryono called on the people to stay alert and follow the country`s regulation before purchasing products from the dealers. On a different occasion, the quarantine office chairwoman, Harpini, revealed that the illegal trade of fruits and other products would threaten the nation`s food security. The illegal foods would also serve as a new instrument of bio-terrorism, which could hurt the food safety in Indonesia, she emphasized.

This version of the W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 HYTug has received an Approval-in-Principle recognition by the China Classification Society (CCS). \nThe W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 HYTug emphasises environmental sustainability, operational efficiency, and lower fuel consumption than is possible with conventional tug designs. The design is based upon W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4\u2019s \u2018first-of-its-kind\u2019 fully integrated hybrid power module. This combines engines, an energy storage system using batteries, and power electronics optimised to work together through a newly developed energy management system (EMS). It marks a new frontier in marine hybrid propulsion.   Blockchain Applications in the Energy Sector \nSince they typically operate in or close to harbours and populated areas, tugs are particularly affected by environmental considerations, and the need for regulatory compliance is an increasing concern for tug owners and operators worldwide. When operating in \u2018green\u2019 mode, it is unlikely that there will be any visible smoke from the W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 HYTug since the load is being picked-up by the batteries. At the same time, the noise level of the tug will be notably reduced. \n\u201cW\u00e4rtsil\u00e4\u2019s strong support for China\u2019s marine sector is again highlighted with this HYTug design that has been aimed specifically at meeting the needs of this market. In developing the design, ensuring compliance with the increasingly stringent environmental requirements in China was a major focus point,\u201d says Riku-Pekka H\u00e4gg, Vice President, Ship Design, W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Marine Solutions. \nThe W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 HYTug provides numerous customer benefits through increased operational efficiency and flexibility, resulting in lower fuel consumption, reduced emissions, and improved vessel performance. The design is available in three different hull sizes, namely a 28m harbour tug with a 50t bollard pull, a 29.5m harbour tug with a 75t bollard pull, and a 35m escort tug with a 75t bollard pull. A bollard pull range of 40 to 90t can be covered with the appropriate W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 equipment modules. The propulsion configuration is such that each design comes with the option to select either diesel mechanical hybrid, or diesel electric hybrid propulsion. \nThe W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 HYTug with CCS Approval-in-Principle is to be announced at the Marintec conference and exhibition being held in Shanghai from December 5 to 8.

This must be set as a target. There must be a task force to safeguard every investment that comes into our country,\" he said at a cabinet meeting here on Wednesday. Widodo hoped the target of economic growth set at 5.4 percent for next year would be achieved. \"I am optimistic it will be achieved if we can preserve the momentum of economic growth by continuously improving the ease of business and investment,\" he stated. He added that 2018 would be a political year, and there would be a lot of strategic agendas in the year, including the Asian Games and the IMF-World Bank annual meeting. \"In connection with this, I appeal to all cabinet ministers and heads of state institutions to be more focused in their work to meet the targets that we have set. Do not allow the political year to disrupt our concentration. This is important,\" he remarked. Widodo also called on his ministers and heads of state institutions to really assure that all the programs they have made would be monitored and controlled, so that they would run well. He also called for maintaining the economic stability of price, finance, and balance of payment stability. \"Regarding price stability, I call for a close inflation monitoring. We must be able to control it,\" he revealed. He noted that attention must be given to several regions that are prone to natural disasters due to climate change and extreme weather. \"This will affect price stability,\" he told ministers attending the meeting. He added that the government would start implementing the cash-for-work labor-intensive programs in the ministries of village development, public works, transportation, fisheries and maritime affairs, and others. \"I wish that by early January, we will see it is already underway. We hope the program will increase public buying power, especially in villages,\" he concluded.

Marshal Hadi Tjahjanto was presented by President Joko Widodo as TNI Commander to replace General Gatot Nurmantyo who retired. (ANTARA FOTO/Muhammad Adimaja) Jakarta (ANTARA News) - The candidate of Indonesia Military commander Marshal Hadi Tjahjanto has explained five threats to Indonesia`s security and defense. \"The first challenge is the new world order due to the rise of several new economically developed countries, such as China, Russia, India, and Brazil,\" Tjahjanto said here on Wednesday. Marshal delivered the statement during the fit and proper test held by Indonesia House of Representatives at Commission I on Wednesday. Tjahjanto stated that the world order has become a uni-multi polar system that leads to power shifting. The power shifting has changed the intensity of global security, he added. Other factors, such as ideologies, religions, ethnicity, and economic conditions, have also affected the global security. The conventional military efforts will be an obsolete defense effort when asymmetric threats, proxy wars, and cyber attacks occur. The second threat, according to Tjahjanto, is terror attack, which has potentially become a tool for the third party to enter a territory. The war that occurred in Syria and Iraq has proven that terrorism could generate proxy and hybrid wars. \"The terrorist groups can spread ideologies faster using social media and other internet facilities,\" he explained. The third threat is cyber war, which can attack a country digitally through the internet. The cyber attack is as dangerous as any common weapon that can be developed to digitally attack any country. Meanwhile, the rise of China as a superpower country, which has developed its weaponry and economy condition, becomes the fourth threat. China may expand its power to South China Sea, through the development of military base in the waters, Tjahjanto revealed.

The Financial Service Authority (OJK) has urged representative offices of foreign banks in Indonesia to increase their contribution to the domestic economy by extending more credits to government and private infrastructure projects. The amount of credits extended by the foreign banks grew by 20 percent to Rp72 trillion in the year ended Oct 31, 2017, Executive Chief of OJK Banking Supervision Heru Kristiyana said here on Wednesday. \"The credits were channeled by head offices through their representative offices. The credits increased significantly,\" he stated. However, the representative offices of foreign banks should increase the amount of credits in view of the improving economic condition in the country, coupled with positive sentiments of the global economy, he noted. \"They should support the distribution of more productive credits. As we can look at bank business plans (RBB) in 2018, the amount of credits could grow 13 percent,\" he remarked. Kristiyana also called on the representative offices of foreign banks to improve the quality of their human resources in Indonesia through the exchange of information and the use of foreign workers. He pledged to issue a regulation to increase the supervision of the representative offices` compliance with the regulation on the banking industry in Indonesia.

kills her later \nIn a shocking case, a 16-year-old Haryana boy abducted a five-year-old for ransom but later killed the girl by drowning her in bath tub. \nThe shocking case was cracked and the boy was apprehended after the police traced the ransom call to house that was rented to his brother-in-law by the girl\u2019s father. \nAmbala Superintendent of Police (SP) Abhishek Jorwal said that the boy also did not show any remorse on being apprehended. \nDuring questioning, he told us that he had watched a movie after which he decided to hatch a plan to make easy money. The boy was working on his laptop when the police reached the house. \nThe 16-year-old had hid the body in a water cooler after drowning her in the water tub, the SP said. The boy was alone at home as his brother-in-law, who worked at a shop owned by the girl\u2019s father, along with his family had gone to Uttar Pradesh, he said. \nThe officer said that the boy lured the girl to his house last evening when she was playing outside her residence.

It also found that 67% of Muslims want their children to study Arabic, and 56% think it should be taught in public schools. A 2016 UK poll showed that 43% of British Muslims \u201cbelieved that parts of the Islamic legal system should replace British law while only 22 per cent opposed the idea\u201d. Another poll from 2016 found that 23% of all Muslims supported the introduction of sharia law in some areas of Britain, 39% agreed that \u201cwives should always obey their husbands,\u201d and 52% of all British Muslims believe that homosexuality should be illegal. French President Emmanuel Macron blamed France, not Islam, for the increased radicalization, which he said should lead France to \u201cquestion itself.\u201d According to Macron, then, the parallel Islamic societies of France, have nothing to do with Islam. They are the fault of the French republic. Did the French republic impose sharia and the subjugation of women in the suburbs, described by one female survivor as \u201chell\u201d? Was the French republic behind the recent distribution of leaflets stipulating \u201cif you meet a Jew, kill him\u201d? \nA French intellectual, Christian Moliner, recently suggested that France should establish a Muslim state-within-a-state that adheres to sharia law, inside the borders of France, to avoid a civil war. Warning against refusing to deal with the problems of Islamism in Europe because of political correctness, he stated: \n\u201cOut of the fear of appearing Islamophobic, to satisfy this bustling fringe of Muslims, governments are ready to accept the spread of radical practices throughout the country\u2026. [some] territories are outside the control of the Republic. The police can come only in force and for limited durations\u2026 We can never convert the 30% of Muslims who demand the introduction of sharia law to the merits of our democracy and secularism. We are now allowing segregation to take place that does not say its name.\u201d \nMoliner\u2019s solution? \n\u201c\u2026 Establish a dual system of law in France\u2026 one territory, one government, but two peoples: the French with the usual laws and Muslims with Qur\u2019anic status (but only for those who choose it)\u2026 The latter will have the right to vote\u2026 but they will apply Sharia in everyday life, to regulate matrimonial laws (which will legalize polygamy) and inheritance\u2026 They will no longer apply to French judges for disputes between Muslims\u2026 conflicts between Christians and believers will remain the responsibility of ordinary courts\u2026\u201d \nMoliner\u2019s proposal represents a total surrender to political Islam and is of course outrageous, especially considering that Muslims only comprise a little more than five percent of the French population. What he suggests, however, merely formalizes the status quo that already exists \u2014 and not only in France \u2014 even if it abandons reform-minded Muslims and eventually, with their collapsing demography, the non-Muslims there. \nIn France, the no-go zones with their Islamization and Islamic law, sharia, and most noticeably the subjugation of women, has already spread from the suburbs ( banlieues ) to the cities themselves. As Gatestone\u2019s Yves Mamou described : \n\u201c\u2026 no-go zones are no longer relegated to the suburbs, where migrants and Muslims have usually been concentrated. No-go zones, through mass migration, have been emerging in the heart of Paris, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Marseille, Grenoble, Avignon \u2014 districts \u2018privatized\u2019 here and there by a mix of drug traffickers, Salafist zealots and Islamic youth gangs. The main victims are women. They are \u2014 both Muslim and non-Muslim \u2014 sexually harassed; some are sexually assaulted\u201d. \nLast year, French TV aired a documentary about women disappearing from public view in certain areas, where parallel Islamic societies had taken hold . The program named Sevran in the district of Seine-Saint Denis \u2014 a suburb of Paris described by French political scientist Gilles Kepel as \u201cthe capital of French Islam\u201d. There are 1.4 million people living in the district of Seine-Saint-Denis. More than 600,000 of them are Muslims. The French postal service recently said that it will no longer supply its Chronopost delivery service to Seine-Saint-Denis \u2014 the danger to their delivery drivers is too high. Last year, 51 of its delivery drivers were reportedly attacked while doing their rounds. \nRiot police muster in the northern Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, France. (Photo by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images) \nIn France, a poll conducted by Institut Montaigne this summer found that 29% of French Muslims found sharia to be more important to them than French laws. It also found that 67% of Muslims want their children to study Arabic and 56% think it should be taught in public schools. \nA 2016 UK poll, apparently the largest poll ever done on the subject in the UK, showed that 43% of British Muslims \u201cbelieved that parts of the Islamic legal system should replace British law while only 22 per cent opposed the idea\u201d. A different poll, also from 2016, found that nearly a quarter (23%) of all Muslims supported the introduction of sharia law in some areas of Britain, and 39% agreed that \u201cwives should always obey their husbands\u201d, compared with 5% of the country as a whole. Nearly a third (31%) thought it was acceptable for a British Muslim man to have more than one wife, compared with 8% of the wider population. According to the same poll, 52% of all British Muslims believe that homosexuality should be illegal. \nAccording to a 2014 study of Moroccan and Turkish Muslims in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and Sweden, an average of almost 60% of the Muslims polled agreed that Muslims should return to the roots of Islam; 75% thought there is only one interpretation of the Koran possible and 65 % said that Sharia is more important to them than the laws of the country in which they lived. The specific numbers for Germany were that 47% of Muslims believe Sharia is more important than German law. In Sweden , 52% of Muslims believe that Sharia is more important than Swedish law. \nAs the polls show, there already are \u201ctwo peoples\u201d in France and large parts of Europe, who wish to live according to completely different standards, as Moliner suggests . Politicians persist in ignoring these facts or downplaying them. So why be shocked at the suggestion of a \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d for France? How do these politicians, who do not even acknowledge the problems, propose to tackle the fact that large percentages of their population would rather live under sharia law? They do not propose anything. They pretend that this information does not exist. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, is an example of such immunity to facts: \u201cRadicalization has taken hold because the French Republic has resigned,\u201d Macron said recently about the Islamization of the French suburbs. Macron blamed France, not Islam, for the increased radicalization, which he said should lead France to \u201cquestion itself\u201d. Macron noted that, \u201cWe allowed, in too many cities, too many districts, representatives of a distortion of a religion, which are full of hate and disenfranchisement to provide solutions that the Republic no longer gives.\u201d \nAccording to Macron, then, the parallel Islamic societies of France, have nothing to do with Islam. They are the fault of the French republic. Did the French republic impose Sharia and the subjugation of women in the suburbs, described by one female survivor as \u201chell\u201d? Was the French republic behind the recent distribution of leaflets stipulating \u201cif you meet a Jew, kill him\u201d? Did the French republic force the mother of Mohammed Merah, the man who killed a little Jewish girl at school by shooting her in the head, while screaming \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d, to say that \u201cthe prophet permits the killing of Jewish children\u201d? \nFrance, as well as the rest of Europe, is \u2014 wittingly or unwittingly \u2014 heading towards the \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d outlined by Moliner, whether it wants it or not. That fact, however, does not appear particularly to bother the political establishment.

The name \u201cMesopotamia\u201d is made up of two Greek words meaning \u201cland between the rivers\u201d. The title is quite fitting since Mesopotamia is located between two rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates.  Also, Mesopotamia was split into different regions. The natural resources found in the region as well as the geography of each area affected the way people developed and lived.\r\n\r\nNorthern Mesopotamia was full of hills and plains. Due to a great amount of rain, and the flowing f rivers and streams, the land was quite fertile. The early settlers were farmers who used the resources such as timber, metals and stone, form the nearby mountains.\r\n\r\nSouthern Mesopotamia was made up of wet, marshy areas and flat, wide, barren plains. Cities developed along the rivers which flowed through the region. The early settlers of Southern Mesopotamia irrigated the land along the rivers in order to grow their crops. And because of the lack of natural resources, contact with neighboring lands was important.\r\n\r\nClimate:\r\n\r\nThe climate was hot and arid mixed with seasonal rain and flooding. The climate was a challenging and unbearable. The people later learned how to control and manipulate the flooding of the rivers which as a result made the soil more fertile.

Regardless of whether you or someone is doing a job for free, you should never think \"worst case scenario is that they got bad pics and didn't have to pay for them.\" Nobody should take that approach.\nLaugh all you want... That doesn't change reality.\nIf the OP acts professionally like an adult, then the women is really only out her time, and the chance of seeing unflattering pictures of herself. Seeing as she is the one asking the OP to take them, the chances of her being forever traumatized by his work is likely pretty low. This isn't a once-in-a-lifetime situation, so don't try to make it out like it is.\nI know a lot of people like to think that the act of taking a picture is some hugely responsible undertaking, but really, it's just taking a picture.\nDon't act like you know what it's like to have a debilitating disability that will progressively get worse. You don't, and you don't know how it affects the way she puts herself out to the rest of the world. I didn't say it was likely to traumatize her, but that it's a possibility. Regardless, I still think it utterly stupid to have the mindset of \"hey, well if I just F this up, at least she didn't pay for it and she can go elsewhere.\nBe better than to pass off that kind of advice. And yes, some photography, especially when only done for yourself, isn't some huge undertaking. When doing it for someone else, especially in certain situations like this, I think it should be taken very seriously. Well, I guess there are those out there who probably walk through life giving half effort on just about everything.\nI'm not sure how to interpret your messages in line with my original question, but in any case: I do take this very seriously. Hence, in fact, that original question. I do realise how this person is putting herself out there, so I do not want to F this up and will give it my utter best. I simply wanted to get some input from more experienced forum members, for which I am thankful by the way.\n-- hide signature -- http://xinchaobi.weebly.com\nYeah, I wasn't ever insinuating that you don't/aren't taking it seriously. And never assumed or thought you would F it up. Was just making the point that you, as well as anyone else in this position should take it seriously, do your best work, and make sure you understand her goals. If you're confident enough to undertake the project, I'm sure that you'll do great.
