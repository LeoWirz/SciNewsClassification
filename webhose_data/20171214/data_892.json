Babatope, in a statement he personally signed said the South-South stakeholders were being unfair to the South-West, whose turn, according to him, it was to produce the next PDP national chairman. \nHe also accused caretaker chairman, Ahmed Makarfi of working for Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike out of greed and ambition. Babatope said, \u201cWe (the Yoruba) will never be servile to anyone at all. And most importantly, we will never compromise on the position of the National Chairman of our great party. \n\u201cIt is our turn! And this much must be respected. Anything less than this is outright unacceptable. This is why Makarfi must recuse himself from the composition of all committees of the convention. \n\u201cMakarfi is not honest. He is working for Wike. That is the absolute truth.\u201cThe crass insistence and the insulting protestation of Governor Nyesom Wike that the South-South is the zone providing succour to the PDP is rather crude and insensitive. And it is not true. Right from the formation of the party, the Yoruba people have been consistent in their devotion and loyalty to the party. And they have been very supportive in financial fillip to the party.\u201cBut Wike is not really the one to blame. The fault solely lies with Senator Ahmed Makarfi who is blinded by personal ambition and apparent greed that could not make him think clearly and selflessly about the issue at hand.\u201cIt is Makarfi who has deliberately mangled and distorted the micro-zoning tradition of our great party which has given the PDP well over 16 years of inclusive and all embracing accommodating nature. \n\u201cNow the very fundamental fabric and dominating principle of the party is torn asunder. We are no longer at ease.\u201cThe pronouncement of the South-South Stakeholders is not only provocative, it is divisive, skewed, untidy, and a blatant slide into tribal political arrangement. Do they think the good people of Oduduwa land will just sit down and take it? They are dead wrong.\u201d \nSource: Punch", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ebenezer babatope", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmed makarfi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wike", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "babatope", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "makarfi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uche secondus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyesom wike", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pdp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "board of trustees of the peoples democratic party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rivers state", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oduduwa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south-west", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:19.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "956914ae33d47ebcde51dbd2bcfc71247dc136e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.rZxEMSci6mQbElRh1OAqI5f9vsssiCtxpmuCmrM6.xjd_DpZEIqQXNmYnkvlryw0ynmAQTPW3TLKeymxGqo1dYUz9JiOmgSCO5WSKsQ6i6PZN4tgsi2hE2lve7_8ypzA-", "site_full": "www.stockhouse.com", "site": "stockhouse.com", "site_section": "http://www.stockhouse.com/companies/bullboard/v.wlf/wolfden-resources-corporation", "site_categories": ["religion", "sports", "football", "catholicism"], "section_title": "WOLFDEN RESOURCES CORPORATION ( V.WLF ) stock message board and forum - Bullboard Discussion - Stockhouse Community ", "title": "WOLFDEN RESOURCES CORPORATION ( V.WLF ) stock message board and forum - Bullboard Discussion - Stockhouse Community", "title_full": "WOLFDEN RESOURCES CORPORATION ( V.WLF ) stock message board and forum - Bullboard Discussion - Stockhouse Community", "published": "2017-12-05T16:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.stockhouse.com/stockhouse/images/stockhouse-logo-og.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 21479, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "956914ae33d47ebcde51dbd2bcfc71247dc136e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.rZxEMSci6mQbElRh1OAqI5f9vsssiCtxpmuCmrM6.xjd_DpZEIqQXNmYnkvlryw0ynmAQTPW3TLKeymxGqo1dYUz9JiOmgSCO5WSKsQ6i6PZN4tgsi2hE2lve7_8ypzA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Goldnboy1", "published": "2017-12-05T16:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "WOLFDEN RESOURCES CORPORATION ( V.WLF ) stock message board and forum - Bullboard Discussion - Stockhouse Community", "text": "Pure Spec - Deal on the horizon?? Based on a November 30 article published by the Northern Miner, as well as information that can be located on the website and in the corporate presentation. Osisko Metals (OM.v) has taken a liking to the Bathurst Zinc Mining Camp and is looking to consolidate the area.\nOM is obviously apart of the Osisko group of accelorator companies. Their goal is to create a mining camp out of Bathurst that uses a central processor to service multiple small scale mine sites. OM is very well backed and carries a market cap that is double that of WLF.\nWhy this matters for WLF is Tetegouche. Tetegouche contains Orvan Brook, Canoe Landing, and Armstong A. Three historic deposits with potential to host much more than is currently defined. Tetegouche perfectly suits OM's needs to acquire additional stake in the Bathurst camp. The Tetegouche property also resides on the boundary of several OM Bathurst camp claims. This would make acquiring them a no brainer for OM in my mind.\nGiven that WLF seems to be putting significant focus on the Pickett Mountain Project in Maine. I think we could be in for a deal on Tetegouche sooner than later. If I was running this company I would be looking to make a deal with Osisko Metals.\nAlso of note, anyone agree that Pickett Mountain is a better property than any undeveloped deposit in the Bathurst camp?? Yet we are trading at half the market cap of OM?\nDo your DD, WLF still has a lot of catching up to do to its peers!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:19.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6590ff2aa0ee0732c74d9539be8be7c9b11814ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pS6UTRlu.pf8qBK50IVMpKFWG2VO8HyO_", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/tv/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/tv/ - Television &amp; Film - 4chan", "title": "Fuck.

Born in 1895, he came of age, of prominence when baseball needed him most, following the scandal of the White Sox in 1919. He played from 1914 until 1925, beginning life as a pitcher. Along with Ty Cobb, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson, Walter Johnson, he was one of the first five players elected to the Hall of Fame in 1936. When the Boston Red Sox traded him to the New York Yankees in 1920, allegedly, the \u2018Curse\u2019 began. \nPerhaps his greatest contribution to humanity was allowing himself to be turned into a human guinea pig, being one of the first people to be treated with both radiation and chemo after his 1946 diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. His cooperation with his physicians made him the subject of contemporary studies and articles. Even though he died less than two years after beginning treatment, his courageously set an example for those suffering from cancer. The first step in the modern treatment of cancer, we don\u2019t even know the millions of lives, now saved, just by his courage. \nMaybe there is a reason, no matter who discusses baseball, for always considering George Herman Ruth, a man who grew up on the wrong side of the tracks in Baltimore, and perhaps never really grew up, as the greatest \u2013 ever. Let\u2019s face it, Henry Louis Aaron is far greater, as a player, and perhaps as a person. Ted Williams turned hitting into a science. Barry Bonds has the most home runs, but also has a history of steroid use. No one even doubts the greatness of Shoeless Joe Jackson. \nAs far as greatness, Ted Williams gave up his prime playing years to serve our country in both World War II and Korea. We truly don\u2019t know what he could have accomplished, even if many writers and fans have speculated. Williams was a hot-shot fighter jock, on a par with John Glenn, his wingman. Glenn even said Williams was a better pilot than he and the greatest pilot he\u2019d ever seen. That\u2019s not exactly a shabby complement coming from the likes of John Glenn. \n\u201c\u2026 Captain Williams arrived in Korea in February 1953, where he often flew as wingman to John Glenn, who would garner greater fame later in life as an astronaut and United States Senator. \u201cTed may have batted .400 for the Red Sox, but he hit a thousand for the U.S. Marines,\u201d Glenn said of Williams in Korea, during which he flew 39 combat missions, was struck by enemy fire three times and was awarded three air medals. In fact, on Feb. 16, 1953, Williams narrowly escaped death, crash landing his F9F Panther, which was fully engulfed in flames, after a 35-plane air raid on North Korea \u2026.\u201d \nHank Aaron is heroic in his own way, quietly standing up for civil rights, and dealing with threats and prejudice, never losing his cool. He is beloved in the South by many of us who came of age watching his quiet greatness. When one tries, vainly to compare Barry Bonds, it is impossible. Bonds is a shallow and superficial and cheating brat. Shoeless Joe is basically a \u2018hometown\u2019 hero. Even when you understand how he lived, and what was basically indentured servitude of the textile mills of South Carolina, as a person, he cannot compare to Williams or Aaron.

Sure, beer mugs are great, gift certificates are awesome and books about ales and lagers are thoughtful, but the gift all beer lovers want is beer.\nNow, Santa Norm will help you decide what beers are gift-worthy brews. Here\u2019s a six-pack of beers worthy of being wrapped and put under the tree, or in a the stocking hung with care over the fireplace.\nAnchor Brewing Company\u2019s Our Special Ale\nAnchor Brewing Company has been brewing the Our Special Ale (often referred to as Anchor Christmas) for decades. Each year, the recipe is slightly different, but it is usually one of the tastiest options for winter warmers. You can get a six-pack, but a really special way is to pick up a magnum \u2013 the 1.5 liter bottle will look impressive under the tree and is a perfect size to share with friends and family.\nBoston Beer Company\u2019s Samuel Adams Utopias\nThis is perhaps the most unique beer in the world \u2013 it\u2019s a still beer (no carbonation) and a blend of different vintages of beers aged in barrels dating back to 1993. It has flavors of cognac, port, wine, bourbon and maple. This year\u2019s version comes in at 28 percent alcohol by volume. At $200, it\u2019s a pricey gift, but one that will be appreciated.\nPort Brewing Company\u2019s Santa\u2019s Little Helper\nMy beer tastes are greatly affected by the weather outside \u2013 lighter beers during warm weather and dark and heavy beers during the winter. Santa\u2019s Little Helper is a definitely a perfect fit for a cold snowy day. This imperial stout comes in at 10.5 percent ABV, and features strong cocoa and roasted-coffee like flavors. It\u2019s a must-have.\nSt. Bernardus Christmas Ale\nI don\u2019t have many holiday traditions, but one I do have is to drink a bottle of the St. Bernadus Christmas Ale every Christmas Eve. St. Bernardus is a personal favorite brewery from Belgium and this is my favorite beer from them. A quad, the St. Bernardus Christmas Ale is a big beer at 10 percent ABV. It\u2019s spicy, yeasty and fruity and phenomenal.\nThe Spencer Brewery\u2019s Holiday Trappist Ale\nBrewed by the monks at St. Joseph\u2019s Abbey in Spencer, the Holiday Trappist Ale is one of the finest winter seasonals you\u2019ll ever find. This is a 9 percent ABV Belgian strong dark ale with light spiciness and a warming boozy finish. This is almost a meal upon itself.\nTroegs Brewing Company\u2019s Mad Elf Grand Cru\nTroegs\u2019 Mad Elf is one of my favorite beers. Mad Elf Grand Cru is like the original on overdrive. It\u2019s brewed with wildflower honey, lots of Balaton cherries and Demerara sugar, as well as spicy Belgian yeast. At 11 percent ABV, this is a perfect after-dinner sipper.\nNorman Miller is a staff writer for the MetroWest Daily News, a sister paper of the T&G.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "norman miller", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "samuel adams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa claus", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "metrowest daily news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dunkin' donuts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spencer brewery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anchor brewing company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "t&g", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston beer company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. bernardus christmas ale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "special ale anchor brewing company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "troegs brewing company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "port brewing company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa norm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holiday trappist ale", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "santa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. bernardus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. joseph\u2019s abbey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spencer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balaton", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:20.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6590ff2aa0ee0732c74d9539be8be7c9b11814ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pS6UTRlu.pf8qBK50IVMpKFWG2VO8HyO_", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/tv/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/tv/ - Television &amp; Film - 4chan", "title": "Fuck.
