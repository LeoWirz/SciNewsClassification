The EGM was eventually cancelled. \nBY TATIRA ZWINOIRA \nAddressing those present at the EGM yesterday in Harare, CFI Holdings Ltd non-executive director, Shingirai Zinyemba said the purpose of EGM was to fire the last remaining board members connected to the National Social Security Authority (NSSA). \n\u201cMost of the previous NSSA/Zimre-led board of CFI Holdings was dismissed and the remnants of that tarnished group had to be dealt with. Today\u2019s proposed EGM was to fire the remaining NSSA/Zimre-related board members. Ephraim Chawoneka and Douglas Mamvura were asked to resign from their directorships in CFI Holdings Ltd by shareholders and when they refused to do so, this EGM was called on November 8,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThese two conflicted directors sent in their letters of resignation last night [Tuesday]. In any event, shareholders were asked to attend the meeting and vote in favour of firing these two directors. Over 52% of proxies submitted as of Monday December 4, 2017 were in favour of this motion to fire the two directors from the board.\u201d \nZinyemba said the voting reflected the sentiment of the majority shareholders, who feel aggrieved and will continue to pursue legal action on the alleged fraudulent activities that destroyed shareholder value. \n\u201cNext week\u2019s proposed EGM to remove Hamish Rudland from the board will carry the same fate for him,\u201d he said. \nZinyemba said CFI would be making necessary announcements on a new board and qualified management team in the near future. \n\u201cBe in no doubt that this group of shareholders is the controlling and major shareholder bloc of CFI Holdings Ltd and will deliver on its promise to all shareholders a successful future for the company,\u201d Zinyemba said. \nPresent at the meeting was Messina Investments owner British tycoon, Nicholas van Hoogstraten who was the architect behind the ouster of board members linked to NSSA. \nVan Hoogstraten through Messina owns a 20% stake in CFI Holdings and got support from a substantial number of CFI Holdings Ltd shareholders to control over 50% to push out NSSA-linked board members.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "douglas mamvura", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ephra", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ephraim chawoneka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "van hoogstraten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zinyemba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamish rudland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "messina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shingirai zinyemba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicholas van hoogstraten", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cfi holdings", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cfi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "egm", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "national social security authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cfi holdings ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nssa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "messina investments", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "harare", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:17.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0ad699abceb2de9e997aaf49ba8e5c5c61d5110b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOq5KLyKKsGFwI.FUOsrDh9uIzKWbDC40JgLOJxHIbgsqn28a6XT8v89YGX2M1KY6_4OSP6.K.Y49u_aXqlhj5y0Txs6DKzCFURN34NLDX92oQ--", "site_full": "snailinthecity.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://snailinthecity.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Snail in the City", "title": "Cit\u00e9-Jardin Kapelleveld: Avant Garde housing in shades of grey", "title_full": "Cit\u00e9-Jardin Kapelleveld: Avant Garde housing in shades of grey", "published": "2017-12-07T12:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0ad699abceb2de9e997aaf49ba8e5c5c61d5110b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOq5KLyKKsGFwI.FUOsrDh9uIzKWbDC40JgLOJxHIbgsqn28a6XT8v89YGX2M1KY6_4OSP6.K.Y49u_aXqlhj5y0Txs6DKzCFURN34NLDX92oQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Andreas B (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "Cit\u00e9-Jardin Kapelleveld: Avant Garde housing in shades of grey", "text": "\n\nThe garden village Kapelleveld at Woluwe-Saint-Lambert near Brussels is an example of a modernist interpretation of the garden city model, here translated into a garden suburb or suburban garden village. The housing is mostly modernist, with a small section in a traditionalist style. The housing with the flat roofs and the dark roof trim is similar to that seen in La Cit\u00e9Moderne , another modernist garden village near Brussels. \n\n\nOf the three tree-lined avenues two remain. The central avenue has a tram and the southern avenue has a garden-like central reservation. The northern avenue was never replanted after WW2. Cars and parking now dominate the edges. As this avenue was intended as a major thoroughfare the dimensions can handle present-day traffic. \n\n\nIn the 1950s some blocks of terraced housing were added along the Avenue Albert Dumont. This housing by Paul Posno (right) is similar in size to the original housing (left), but much less detailed. Also the block is treated less sculptural and the proportions are much less harmonious -the blocks are evidently not designed with asset of harmonious proportions in mind. The Avenue Albert Dumont was named after an architect of French origin who is well known for designing many villas and cottages, especially on the Belgian coast. He was also one of the promotors of the Garden City Movement in Belgium. \n\n\nThe original housing was arranged along kinged streets that ran off the avenues at a right angle. The side walls form the entrances to the residential streets. This way of separating street along function is common in New Objectivity housing in the Benelux and Germany. \n\n\nThe kinked street marries the ideal of short view creating a sense of place which fits nicely with Sitte-esque design theory and the Unwinesque elaboration of it. Apart from this the garden village at Kappelleveld has no typical features of the Garden City Movement aesthetic. \n\n\nThe blocks of terraced housing are sculptural compositions with a strong cubist aesthetic. The short chimneys at the corners of the main blocks are used in a decorative way to break the flatness of the roofline which is emphasised by the black wooden trim. The staggering of the building line is very effective and creates a pleasant flow along the street. \n\n\nAnother type is basically a modernist semidetached house with protruding sections at the corners, reminiscent of standing bays. In places this type has been linked to form row housing (left). The design plays with verticality and horizontality with the narrow high windows at either end and low and wide windows in the middle. \n\n\nThe standard type with the low chimneys all have rendered facades. The colour can vary from off white, via light grey (on the left) to dark grey (on the right at the front). The wooden trim is always painted black to unify the sculptural blocks in the streetscape. \n\n\nAll housing has a front garden. In true garden village style these gardens were edged by a hedge. Here privet was used. All gardens were made uniform by using a similar green edge. Sadly the hedges have bene removed in places, or have bene replaced by hedges made from a different plant species (mostly beech and box). At the end of the streets the orange clay tile roofs of the intermediate section are just visible. \n\n\nThe southwestern section of the garden village was designed in a mixed style with pitched roofs covered in clay tiles above cubist blocks. The result is an Avant Garde marriage of the traditional and the modern. All the facades are rendered, with wooden trim in black and white. The chimneys are practical and not used as a decorative device. The bays and dormers are used in that way however. \n\n\nThe intermediate housing has flat dormers with a protruding roof directly above the window frames. Al woodwork of the doors and windows is painted white, as well as the underside of the eaves (right). The front of the box gutter is painted black. The awnings above the front doors are treated similarly.   \n\n\nThe contrast between these two sections is remarkable. This makes that the garden village Kapelleveld is defined as three neighbourhoods by the architectural expression of the buildings. The central core is modernist, sculptural and cubist, the southwestern section is Avant Garde mix of traditional and modern and the southeastern section is traditionalist with a sculptural treatment of the facades in brick.

This year, the deficit is expected to reach $1,8 billion, nearly half of the $4 billion 2017 budget. Last year the deficit was $1,4 billion. \nThe deficit has largely been financed by borrowing from the domestic market, thereby crowding out funding to the private sector. \nThe uncontrolled spending has seen the budget deficit as a percentage of GDP rising to 8,7% last year from 1,2% in 2014. The budget deficit as a percentage of GDP is projected to lower to 8,4% this year \nThe rising domestic debt has also led to the increase in the public and publicly guaranteed debt is projected to end the year at $13,12 billion, accelerating to $14 billion next year, $14,6 billion in 2019 and $14,8 billion in 2020. \nThe country\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated to exceed the statutory limit of 70%. \nSection 11(2) of the Public Debt Management Act requires that the total outstanding public and publicly guaranteed debt as a ratio of GDP should not exceed 70% at the end of any fiscal year, with Treasury warning in the 2018 Budget Strategy paper the threshold would be surpassed \u201cin view of the current borrowing trends from the domestic market\u201d. \nThe debt-to-GDP ratio was 70% last year and is projected to quicken to 78% in 2017 and then 81% in 2018 before tapering off to 78% and 74% in 2019 and 2020 respectively. \nOther than turning to the domestic market for funding, Treasury has also raided central bank\u2019s coffers, with the bank\u2019s lending to the State exceeding the 20% threshold stipulated by the Reserve Bank Act after reaching 27% in 2016. \nAnalysts say Chinamasa has to restore confidence by laying a strong foundation for the economy. Economist Clive Mphambela said Chinamasa has to address the pervasive issue of restoring the integrity of the multi-currency system by speedily revoking the bond note so that \u201cwe revert to the clarity and stability that was assured under proper dollarisation rules\u201d. \nHe said Chinamasa has to clear the air on government\u2019s strategy for funding the projected deficits in a sustainable way. \n\u201cHe must tell the nation the measures he will put in place to restore fiscal discipline on the part of Government,\u201d Mphambela said. He said the country required a clear roadmap in re-engagement which \u201cbrings back Zimbabwe into the community of nations\u201d which help the economy \u201cto deal with the external debt issues in a sustainable way\u201d. \nMnangagwa has promised reforms in the civil service, saying the business as usual approach is long gone. \nAn analyst said Chinamasa has to come up with coherent reform proposals for the civil service. \n\u201cWe must get a sense of government\u2019s policy on the retirement of seniors from the civil service and the re-engineering of the remaining workforce to drive efficiency and productivity in the government,\u201d the analyst said. \nHe said government has to walk the talk on reforming State-owned enterprises and how it will re-engineer State owned enterprises for them to start \u201ccontributing to the new economic trajectory of the country\u201d.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mnangagwa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mugabe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clive mphambela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emmerson mnangagwa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chinamasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mphambela", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reserve bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "treasury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "budget strategy", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:17.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "330816dfd2d1934031468856bee625faf9ad8ed9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsK7iP6WLFJ8J7d7T4OcNuh_yiLpUTljSAMUQYfdziY85oUF_Xb_MsrDEkM4O0mMLkEl._4b69VvhcO4ymYzp9n8mUeTdGfDz6pGNg44ZcARnlvR_7FgwQKMA-", "site_full": "community.netgear.com", "site": "netgear.com", "site_section": "https://community.netgear.com/t5/Arlo-Baby/bd-p/en-arlo-baby", "site_categories": ["computer_networking", "tech"], "section_title": "Arlo Baby - NETGEAR Communities", "title": "Arlo Baby software flawed for baby monitoring", "title_full": "Arlo Baby software flawed for baby monitoring - NETGEAR Communities", "published": "2017-07-10T19:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 23, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3476, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7a078e3997db051f6a243458fbbaaec36397d212", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsK7iP6WLFJ8J7d7T4OcNuh_yiLpUTljSAMUQYfdziY85oUF_Xb_MsrDEkM4O0mMLkEl._4b69VvhcO4ymYzp9n8mUeTdGfDz6pGNg44ZcARnleRw0Vp37ONV3ZEVQmyJ69A--", "ord_in_thread": 23, "author": "JamesC", "published": "2017-12-06T08:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I completely agree!\nI have called support this week about the following 3 issues.\n The live stream stops randomly and leaves a frozen image displayed on the screen WITHOUT notifying me that the connection was lost. NETGEAR have advised that the live steam will stop after 30mins (I get that, I\u2019ve seen it happen, not sure where they mention that pre-sale but anyway THIS is something different). This issue occurs regularly, sometimes even every 10mins or less.\nSAFTEY ISSUE: I\u2019m under the FALSE impression that I\u2019m monitoring my child when I\u2019m not. How do I know if I\u2019m looking at my baby laying still and happy OR if I\u2019m just looking at a frozen screen? As the Audio will continue it can easily go unnoticed. How dangerous!\n When I initially push the LIVE button to commence streaming it immediately displays an image HOWEVER it is often NOT the live stream but rather a random still image from a previous stream. Sometimes this is obviously occurring e.g., the image is in daylight but its currently night, but other times I wouldn\u2019t know if it is a still image of 1am that I\u2019m still viewing at 2am. It gives no indication that it has failed.\nSAFTEY ISSUE: Again, ARLO is giving me FALSE understanding that I\u2019m monitoring may baby when I\u2019m not. Has my baby rolled himself onto his face and can\u2019t breathe? How would I know?\nand to top it off\n The option for continuous audio does not work. It drops out REGULARY. Isn\u2019t this the ENTIRE reason we brought a monitor?\nSAFTER ISSUE: I\u2019m asleep or downstairs relying on the Continuous Audio to alert me to when my baby needs me, when he is crying or maybe even chocking but because the audio has turned off (disconnected) I have no idea he needs me. I\u2019m not alerted! I\u2019m not stirred from my sleep! ONCE AGAIN IM UNDER A FALSE IMPRESSION THAT IM MONITORING MY BABY WHEN IM NOT!\nAfter a LONG discussion with support where they eliminated the basics such as distance to Wi-Fi, Internet connection (spend, bandwidth, provider), Modem, viewing devices, updates etc. ATTENTION JamesC ) as the cause they CONFIRMED that these are ALL known issues and that there would be a firmware update available to magically fix it ALL!\nSo, last night I received and email from support to say the update is ready to go with details on how to complete it and what to do if the update didn\u2019t appear (h another anticipated issue by NETGEAR). Surprise surprise !!! Even after following all the instructions including Turning WiFi off, Camera Off, logging out and In, Completing resets and deleting and re adding the device the update is still NOT displaying as available.\nI\u2019ve replied to let them know.\nIF YOU HAVE AN ARLO BABY - I hope you read this so that you are aware that you may not be monitoring your child as you think you are. NETGEAR advised me they are aware of the issues YET nowhere can I find where they have made this information (a warning) readily available to users of Arlo. They don\u2019t seem to be too concerned about the safety of your child. Yes, you can contact NETGEAR yourself but what about the poor parents of a high-risk child. They won\u2019t know on that first night of use that the above issues occur. To me it seems like a tragedy in waiting.\nIF YOU HAVNT PURCHASED AN ARLO BABY YET I recommend you DONT. The current faults in the Arlo means you may not be monitoring your baby when you think you are. My experience is that these issue occur constantly, EVERYNIGHT, EVERY DAY USE, SOMETIMES EVERY 5 to 10 MINUTES. Sometimes I have to close and reopen the APP 10 times before it starts the live streaming correctly\u2026\u2026and then 2 mins later its frozen again, or the Audio has stopped AGAIN. To me its unsafe. It doesn\u2019t preform as intended and gives you a false sense of security.\nThis has been and infuriating, time consuming and scary experience as a new mum.

Though the purpose was to \u201cratify a number of votes the board has taken lately,\u201d said Board President Michael Gonzalez, a procedural glitch prevented any formal action from taking place. But it wasn\u2019t as if nothing happened. \u201cThis place was the sweat of everybody,\u201d said critical community member Kathleen Morales. \u201cNobody got a penny. They didn\u2019t take anything. What happened?\u201d \nA historic political and cultural center of the Latino community, La Casa has been celebrated for bringing music, food, and educational programs to the city\u2019s Eastside. But long-term, well-documented financial troubles have crippled the center, a castle-like 26,000-square-foot converted warehouse on Montecito Street. \nFor two years, Ed St. George, prolific student housing developer, has emerged at La Casa, causing both relief and consternation. He plans to buy half of the building for about $1 million to \u201ckeep the doors open,\u201d he said. The other half would become Casa Redevelopment Company, which St. George would manage, court files state. Proponents of the plan stress the entity would remain under La Casa\u2019s control. The deal would help the nonprofit pay back its nearly $1 million debt; it must be finalized in bankruptcy court in February. The bankruptcy judge thinks this \u201cdeal is great,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cEverybody gets paid.\u201d By Paul Wellman (file) Ed St. George \nRaising an objection has been founding member Tommy Costello, who owns the mortgage note and has previously expressed an unwillingness to sell it. St. George said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d For his part, Costello questioned the validity of Thursday\u2019s meeting, the pending sale, new boardmembers, and St. George\u2019s involvement. \u201cIs it a good deal for La Casa?\u201d he wrote on a document he disseminated copies of at the meeting. Another meeting is expected to be held in the coming weeks. \nThe new boardmembers include Mark Martinez, Luis Villegas, and Gary Colmenar, all of whom St. George said he met through his philanthropic work in the community. \u201cThey are all Hispanic, still very close to their culture, very successful,\u201d St. George said. \u201cThey understand how to run a business \u2026. We have some really great ideas. It involves livening up the neighborhood and vitalizing it but also have businesses in there that work in conjunction with La Casa.

Panathinaikos will travel to Kaunas with the aim of getting the away win in what is perhaps the Greens\u2019 most dangerous game until the end of the first phase of the EuroLeague. \nThe Greens and the Reds are in excellent form, they are high in the standings and they have started to flirt with the home court advantage despite the fact that only a third of the regular season of the EuroLeague has elapsed. \nZalgiris \u2013 Panathinaikos \nFrom Panathinaikos\u2019s game in Kaunas, there is value in two player bets. In the H2H between Ulanovas and Singleton, we\u2019re going with the American scoring 2 points more than the Lithuanian forward. Singleton has a higher ceiling than Ulanovas, who rarely scores double digits. In the H2H between Jankunas and Gist, we\u2019re going against the excellent form Panathinaikos\u2019s player is in, as he is bound to have a bad game too. The Lithuanian, on the other side, is showing consistency, especially in home games, picking up this season where he left off in the last. \nBamberg \u2013 CSKA Moscow \nIn Germany, CSKA Moscow are the big favorites for the win, while Trinchieri\u2019s team want to repeat what they achieved last season when they beat Dimitrios Itouins\u2019s team at home. The 1,20 of the away win will be hard to break and so it can be included on a combo with similar payoffs. From the player bets, the 1,85 on De Colo to be the top scorer sounds good, while for those who are after big payoffs, Hickman\u2019s 6,50 in the same category has some chances. \nBarcelona \u2013 Fenerbahce \nBarcelona cannot afford another defeat at home and their motivation might be higher than Zelimir Obradovic \u2019s Fenerbahce. In any case, the 1,80 for a home win is worth it. The Blaugrana are in tenth place in the standings, with only 4 wins in 10 games, a disappointing record for the club\u2019s standard and ambition. On the other side, Fenerbahce are in the top four with 7 wins, just one less than top spot cohabitants, CSKA Moscow and Olympiacos . A win for Barcelona seems like their only option, even this early in the season. \nOlympiacos \u2013 Real Madrid \nVassilis Spanoulis is back and will be part of the squad for the game against Real Madrid at the Peace and Friendship Stadium. The Reds are in good shape, overcoming any obstacle they find in their way, either at home or away, and as a result, they are in first place together with CSKA Moscow. Real are behind in the standings after some consecutive bad results that are attributed to the many injuries that have plagued Pablo Laso\u2019s team. Despite this, their quality is granted and the game in the Peace and Friendship Stadium will be a derby that may very well be decided in the end. Both the home court as well as Real\u2019s injuries may play a key role in the outcome of the game and if we\u2019re going to choose a bet, then the home win would be a priority. \nPicks \nH2H Ulanovas (+1,5) \u2013 Singleton 2 / @1,75 H2H Jankunas \u2013 Gist (+1,5) 1 / @1,75 Olympiacos \u2013 Real Madrid 1 / @1,55 Barcelona \u2013 Fenerbahce 1 / @1,80 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lefteris moutis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hickman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singleton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luka doncic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vassilis spanoulis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de colo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pablo laso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jankunas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trinchieri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimitrios itouins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zelimir obradovic", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "turkish airlines", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "fenerbahce  barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "real madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "panathinaikos  from panathinaikos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cska moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "panathinaikos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fenerbahce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zalgiris", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ulanovas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "friendship stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaunas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bamberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:17.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1197cc45fab4f39b16120097fada68c383f70314", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_dlGaiyHn9kDUa_u6LiPoacx9EhguERruduwRn.rLi8pF1JeT3oVkFUTXBkimsy_OGDrDjkfMxE9LVxpX6E4O0", "site_full": "www.aldeer.com", "site": "aldeer.com", "site_section": "http://www.aldeer.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=postlist&Board=18", "site_categories": ["hunting_shooting", "sports"], "section_title": "AL Squirrel, Rabbit, Trapping, and Varmits - Aldeer", "title": "Albino squirrel?", "title_full": "Albino squirrel? - Aldeer", "published": "2017-12-06T08:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.05, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "563942bd28d8261f1c8d4e698feee911f30cf3cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_dlGaiyHn9kDUa_u6LiPoacx9EhguERruduwRn.rLi8pF1JeT3oVkFUTXBkimsy_OGDrDjkfMxEz8TWJO.dIgLDgMZGluYRTPfN_ppy2T7mw--", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "gman", "published": "2017-12-06T10:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "There was one at burningtree country club in decatur a couple years ago.

Dermatophytes cause fungal infections on head and feet, for instance, trichophyton and microsporum. Yeasts cause infections at the genital area, mouth area and esophagus. Example of yeast fungi includes candida and pityrosporum. Molds are responsible for infection in internal organs that results in systemic mycoses, for example, aspergillus. Systemic mycoses lead to the spread of fungi via bloodstream to other organs, causing multiple organ failure. Report Overview and TOC: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/mycoses-market.html Mycoses are caused due to weakened immune systems, i.e., immunocompromised state that includes patients with HIV/AIDS and patients being treated with corticosteroids for a prolonged period. Other causes include poorly controlled diabetes, being overweight, and any sort of contact with contaminated items such as clothes, towel, etc. Tests used to diagnose mycoses include a general physical examination of the body, complete blood count, skin biopsy, flow cytometry and immunophenotyping. Request brochure: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag... Based on treatment, the mycoses market can be segmented as follows: Photodynamic therapy: The therapy uses laser light and a drug to destroy the fungal cancer cells Radiation therapy: The therapy uses high-energy X-rays or radiation to prevent the fungal cells from spreading Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy stops the growth of fungal cells with the aid of various drugs, either by preventing the cells from dividing or by killing the cells Targeted therapy: The therapy identifies the affected cells without harming normal cells Drug medication: Antifungal medications such as amphotericin B, fluconazole, caspofungin, and itraconazole are used for the treatment of mycoses Based on geography, the mycoses market can be segmented into four major regions: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Rest of the World (RoW). Out of these regions, North America holds a leading position in the mycoses market followed by Europe. According to National Institutes of Health, mycoses affect approximately 200,000 people in the U.S. every year. The major factors which are driving the growth of the market in these regions are increasing prevalence of AIDS/HIV across the North American region, leading to weakened immune systems of individuals and constantly growing awareness about mycoses. Asia Pacific is also expected to be one of the promising markets for the growth of mycoses market due to faster developing rate of Asia Pacific countries. For Specific and Customized requirements@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag... The advantageous factors which would accelerate the growth of the market in Asia Pacific are presence of large population base in countries such as China, Japan, and India, prevalence of numerous diabetes patients and, population\u2019s changing lifestyle and environmental conditions. Furthermore, various tax benefits and favorable reimbursement policies in developing nations are most likely to augment the growth of mycoses market. Various pharmaceutical companies are coming up with novel therapeutic treatments for mycoses. Some of the top players operating in mycoses market for mycoses therapeutic development are Bayer AG, Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories Limited, Helix BioMedix, Inc., Merck & Co., Inc., Pfizer, Inc., Nuvo Research, Inc., Moberg Derma AB, Novabiotics Ltd, Pacgen Biopharmaceuticals Corporation, Quinnova Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Xel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and others.

Thursday, December 7 2017 1:50 AM EST 2017-12-07 06:50:35 GMT Updated: Thursday, December 7 2017 11:01 AM EST 2017-12-07 16:01:08 GMT \nIn recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Trump was seen as siding with Israel's hard-line government which says it will not give up any part of the city. \nBy CATHERINE LUCEYAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump's move to recognize the divided city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital may have triggered a worldwide chorus of critics but the president had his ears closely tuned to his supporters at home. \nFor Trump, the proclamation was an important way to make good on a pledge to his political base, which includes evangelical Christians and pro-Israel Republicans eager for such a move. \n\"While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver,\" the president declared Wednesday in announcing his decision. \"Today, I am delivering.\" \nThose were words to savor for a president who's been frustrated to see a number of key campaign pledges stalled or slowed - sometimes by a bitterly divided Congress, some by larger national or international concerns. \nRepealing the Obama era health care law is a promise unfulfilled, much to Trump's frustration. Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box - although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action. \n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" \nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. \nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" \nTrump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \n\"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\" Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The composites were used for the adsorption of methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) in aqueous solution. The results indicated that MIL-100(Fe) and GO formed a sandwich-like structure, and the crystal structure of MIL-100(Fe) was reserved in the composites. The attachment of GO layers to the MIL-100(Fe) decreased the surface area from 1690 to 1602 m 2 /g, and pore volume from 0.996 to 0.770 cm 3 /g when 5% ( w / w ) GO was added, due to the coating of MIL-100(Fe) by GO sheets. The addition of 5% ( w / w ) GO increased the adsorption capacity for MB (from 1019 to 1231 mg/g) and MO (from 667 to 1189 mg/g). The composites showed a better thermal stability than MIL-100(Fe); the decomposition temperature increased from 280 to 350 \u00b0C. The addition of GO improved the properties of MIL-100(Fe) as an adsorbent for MO/MB from aqueous solution.\n\n\nfrom #MedicinebyAlexandrosSfakianakis via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2jnNJpJ\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:18.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c2816761cc357e68ea47cf02e9d6a5f04b42b724", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPSCauKeKWmt0vulDz86AJl9gArolzwVT1ouTISg4sakPclJgSuar8wuKAU1ZbomRO187xIbSncnX7pv9bET_sszb1inhL2MWcA--", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com", "site": "tripadvisor.com", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g293915-i3686-o20-Thailand.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Thailand Forum, Travel Discussion for Thailand - TripAdvisor", "title": "Taxi to/from DMK Bangkok airport - Thailand", "title_full": "Taxi to/from DMK Bangkok airport - Thailand Forum - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-07T02:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 189, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a0387c825e20dbb4a67d8fa342796bd010c0eeee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPSCauKeKWmt0vulDz86AJl9gArolzwVT1ouTISg4sakPclJgSuar8wuKAU1ZbomRO187xIbSncnX7pv9bET_sszaLzAkLCgvlXhI631vXdCV", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "bill2p", "published": "2017-12-07T04:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "It\u2019s relatively difficult to get to the BTS from Khao San, so Ray\u2019s comment above is off the mark.

A new report from the activity tracking app Strava illustrates how more people are doing just that to get to work. \nadvertisement [Image: courtesy Strava] Today, the company released its annual Year In Sport report, a behavioral analysis of its users\u2019 activities, like running and biking. The main takeaway? 2017 saw large increases in commuters who are opting to walk, run, or cycle to work. In 2016, 4.5 million people used Strava to track commutes; in 2017 that number increased to 5.8 million. Strava users worldwide logged 86 million commutes in 2017, up from 68 million in 2016. Based on the distance users traveled by foot or by bike\u20131.24 billion miles, as logged by the app\u2013these commuters offset 1 billion pounds of carbon from entering the atmosphere. That\u2019s the equivalent of removing 96,000 passenger cars from the road, based on the EPA estimate of a typical passenger car emitting 4.7 metric tons of carbon annually.\nAnd it\u2019s not just cyclists who are commuting. According to the report, people running to work increased by a huge 43% this year, with London leading the way for run-commuting followed by Amsterdam, Paris, and New York City.\n[Image: courtesy Strava] While urban cycling and walking are on the rise in the United States, there\u2019s still plenty of room to grow, from building more pedestrian and bike infrastructure to  changing the culture of urban cycling . Strava itself is collaborating with city planners through its Metro platform , which shares anonymous commuting data with cities and states. More than half of all activity logged in the app is related to commuting rather than recreation or exercise, which is helping some urban designers better understand real-time travel behavior\u2013an essential proof point for new infrastructure investment and policy.\nSo riders and runners, keep logging those commute miles. It will lead to better health in the short run\u2013and in the long run, it might help reshape our cities to become more sustainable.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

Dorothea Ames Maloney died on Sunday, Nov. 26, 2017, after living a rich and productive life as a true blessing to innumerable people. \nShe was born on Sept. 10, 1926, to Violet and Ray Ames in Buffalo, N.Y. After graduating from Bennett High School in Buffalo, she attended Bethany College, Bethany, W.Va., graduating with a degree in psychology and music. \nShe married Charles Cram, now deceased, and they were blessed with two wonderful daughters, Becky and Valerie. \nDorothea was a wonderful soprano soloist and performed in church choirs and other venues for many years, until she entered Drew Theological Seminary in Madison in 1975 to pursue a master of divinity degree. After completing her studies, which included a year at the Urban Theology Unit in Sheffield, England, she received a master of divinity degree in 1979, and was ordained a United Methodist pastor, serving Christ United Methodist Church and Carlton Hills United Methodist Church in East Rutherford. \nIn 1978, she married Gerald Maloney, who shared her ministry as a minister\u2019s spouse for the next 39 years. They moved in 1982 to Columbus, Ohio, where Dorothea was appointed pastor of the Thurman Avenue United Methodist Church and served for eight years, until she retired in 1990. \nAfter one year of retirement, she was invited to join the staff of Bexley United Methodist Church in Columbus, as associate pastor for congregational care, where she served for the next 25 years with great joy and loving care. \nAll her life, she was a blessing, a joy and a peaceful presence to all who knew her and have loved her so much. Words cannot express how greatly she will be missed by her family and friends. \nShe was predeceased by her parents; by her brother, Ray Ames; and son Michael Maloney. She is survived by her husband, Gerald Maloney; daughters Valerie and Becky Cram; stepsons, Murray (Lori) Maloney and Matthew (Yana) Maloney; her grandchildren, Jackie, Sydney, Alex and David; daughter-in-law Becky Maloney; cousin Virjean Klahn; and her niece Laurie (Michael Bennett) Ames and their children, Alison (Kevin) Hoster and Matthew Bennett, and nephew, Ralph (Shelley) Ames. \nThere will be a private family entombment, followed by a memorial service at 11 a.m. this Saturday, Dec. 9, at Bexley United Methodist Church, Columbus, Ohio, with the Rev. Becky Piatt officiating. Arrangements are by the Schoedinger Midtown Chapel, 229 East State St, in Columbus. To share memories and offer condolences, please visit http://www.schoedinger.com/ . \nGifts in Dorothea\u2019s memory may be made to the Trustees Fund of Bexley United Methodist Church, which she loved and served passionately, at 2657 East Broad St., Columbus, Ohio, 43209. \n\u201cNone knew her but loved her, nor named her but in praise,\u201d her family observed.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dorothea ames maloney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virjean klahn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorothea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gerald maloney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "becky maloney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "becky cram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shelley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin) hoster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew bennett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "becky piatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles cram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "becky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maloney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael bennett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "violet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ames", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ray ames", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael maloney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laurie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valerie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lori", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "drew theological seminary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thurman avenue united methodist church", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bexley united methodist church", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united methodist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bennett high school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "urban theology unit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trustees fund of bexley united methodist church", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bethany college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christ united methodist church and carlton hills united methodist church", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "madison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east broad st.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.y", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sheffield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east rutherford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "w.va.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bethany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffalo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:18.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c2816761cc357e68ea47cf02e9d6a5f04b42b724", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPSCauKeKWmt0vulDz86AJl9gArolzwVT1ouTISg4sakPclJgSuar8wuKAU1ZbomRO187xIbSncnX7pv9bET_sszb1inhL2MWcA--", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com", "site": "tripadvisor.com", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g293915-i3686-o20-Thailand.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Thailand Forum, Travel Discussion for Thailand - TripAdvisor", "title": "Taxi to/from DMK Bangkok airport - Thailand", "title_full": "Taxi to/from DMK Bangkok airport - Thailand Forum - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-07T02:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 189, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "98813e5d1df7bca3c11dbe3a0807c70299f52d34", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPSCauKeKWmt0vulDz86AJl9gArolzwVT1ouTISg4sakPclJgSuar8wuKAU1ZbomRO187xIbSncnX7pv9bET_sszaLzAkLCgvlY1WlRAarhKd", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "travelkat88", "published": "2017-12-07T09:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Friday late afternoon/early evening, the roads will be very busy so the journey could take quite a long while - hard to say just how long because if it rains. . .

This is a prospective, cross-sectional, study in a university-affiliated, tertiary-care hospital. We recruited 151 children with CP (mean age 6.11 years, SD 3.42, range 3\u201318yr). The Eating and Drinking Ability Classification System (EDACS) and the dysphagia scales of Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), Swallow Function Scales (SFS), and Food Intake Level Scale (FILS) were used. The Communication Function Classification System (CFCS) and Viking Speech Scale (VSS) were employed to classify communication function and speech intelligibility, respectively. The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) with the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GFMCS) and the Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) level were also assessed. Spearman correlation analysis to investigate the associations between measures and univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to identify significant factors were used. Median GMFCS level of participants was III (interquartile range II\u2013IV). Significant dysphagia based on EDACS level III\u2013V was noted in 23 children (15.2%). There were strong to very strong relationships between the EDACS level with the dysphagia scales. The EDACS presented strong associations with MACS, CFCS, and VSS, a moderate association with GMFCS level, and a moderate to strong association with each domain of the PEDI. In multivariate analysis, poor functioning in EDACS were associated with poor functioning in gross motor and communication functions.\n\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2BQLJh9", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "spearman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ja young choi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yu-ra goh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seon ah kim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "research in developmental disabilities", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pediatric evaluation of disability inventory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pedi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jieun park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eun sook park", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:18.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d1ce7c4f80492d431e3296e197f719aeb2b144aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3Ebkq4DFLEvOJI5E7mCIwYR76_0DvGra7cnpNNVoyu3yAjarqrKQWzVGNVx518nQ0DLc8O1tI0EDwH8S5rDxm6NYz1JFzMXKbMRCShjKJaMe.45Ohza0Tqp0ACeXx2Oc", "site_full": "operationdisclosure.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://operationdisclosure.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Operation Disclosure", "title": "(Movie) Quantum Gravity Research -- What is Reality?", "title_full": "(Movie) Quantum Gravity Research -- What is Reality?", "published": "2017-12-07T12:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d1ce7c4f80492d431e3296e197f719aeb2b144aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3Ebkq4DFLEvOJI5E7mCIwYR76_0DvGra7cnpNNVoyu3yAjarqrKQWzVGNVx518nQ0DLc8O1tI0EDwH8S5rDxm6NYz1JFzMXKbMRCShjKJaMe.45Ohza0Tqp0ACeXx2Oc", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Terra Zetzz (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "(Movie) Quantum Gravity Research -- What is Reality?", "text": "\n\nPublished on Mar 4, 2017 \n\nPLEASE NOTE: Please note this fundraising project is now closed so you cannot make any donations at this time.

SAN FRANCISCO (PRWEB) December 07, 2017 Swarmify, Inc. has filed a lawsuit against Cloudflare, Inc. alleging misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of contract, and six other claims with the United States District Court in the Northern District of California (CASE NO. 3:17-cv-06957). The lawsuit was filed by Skiermont Derby LLP who is representing Swarmify in this matter. In 2013, Swarmify was founded to solve the persistent problems of video buffering and streaming failures. Court documents allege a new streaming product, Cloudflare Stream, contains trade secrets, intellectual property, and proprietary techniques disclosed under NDA to Cloudflare during the course of acquisition and partnership discussions in 2016 and 2017. CEO and Co-Founder of Swarmify, Nathan Barnett, says his team developed the video acceleration solution to offer audiences an 80 percent reduction in buffering and instant load speed. He says their unique approach and intellectual property for video delivery makes Swarmify the most effective product for streaming the highest quality video on the market. \u201cEveryone at Swarmify has an incredibly high regard for the team and proprietary solutions that Cloudflare has brought to bear on web security,\u201d Barnett said. \u201cIt is important that we ensure our innovations and intellectual property for video acceleration receive that same respect in return. When someone infringes on our IP, we have a responsibility to our customers, investors, and employees to protect the fruits of their time, energy, and resources.\u201d Swarmify has accelerated more than 500 million streams in the past two years. The solution was recently utilized to ensure news of fast-moving wildfires in the State of California was delivered seamlessly to residents and stakeholders across the globe. Following the launch of Cloudflare\u2019s streaming solution on Sept. 27 of this year, Swarmify retained Skiermont Derby LLP, a boutique firm representing plaintiffs in high stakes intellectual property disputes. The court filing alleges that Cloudflare disclosed proprietary techniques on the Cloudflare blog as well as implementing these techniques in the Cloudflare Stream product. The lawsuit also requests a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent continued use of Swarmify Technology and Confidential Information by Cloudflare. \u201cIt takes a tremendous amount of time and money to develop something like this,\u201d Barnett said. \u201cIt is important that in the course of another company\u2019s growth and success, that it doesn\u2019t come at the expense of the rights of the next generation technology companies. I know our teams share many similar values and beliefs about the importance of the Internet to enabling innovation. My hope is that we will be able to find common ground on this issue as well so that we can all move forward with the important work both of our companies are doing.\u201d About Swarmify, Inc.:Swarmify is based in Florida, and was founded to solve the complicated issue of making streaming video fail-proof.

He assured them that they would get their dues next week. He clarified that they were expecting the remainder of their Caf Champions League prize money next week after which they would pay the players,\u201d a close source said. \nCaps United earned themselves a staggering $550 000 after defying odds stacked against them to reach the lucrative group stage of the African Champions League for the first time and were paid half of the money. \nHowever, the balance had not yet been disbursed since the conclusion of the tournament on November 4 in Morocco, where Wydad Casablanca clinched the prestigious trophy after edging Egyptian giants Al Ahly 1-0. \nWith the two teams having drawn 1-1 on October 28 in Alexandria, it meant the Moroccan giants lifted the trophy on a 2-1 aggregate victory. \nThe Harare giants are also expected to tie down several of their players whose contracts will run out on December 31. Yadah FC are understood to be targeting some Caps United players ahead of the next term. Last season they managed to lure defender Dennis Dauda into their ranks. \nHowever, a number of players from across Africa, including Zambia, are keen to join Caps United with the Zambian players, headlined by Kabwe Warriors captain Munga Chilembe, expected in the country for assessment by the technical team in the first week of January. \nOther Zambian players that have shown interest to join Caps United are goalkeeper Reegan Simango, who has been in Zimbabwe training with the Green Machine for almost a month, and the pair of strikers Jason Sunzu and Peter Tando, who turn out for Kongola Blades. \nAfter a good run in the Champions League, where they went as far as the group stage, Caps United exported a number of their talents and have become a source for players, especially for bigger leagues on the continent. \nCaps United dumped out five-time African champions TP Mazembe from the tournament in the first round. \nIn the group stage, they made their presence felt with famous wins over former African champions Zamalek and Algerian side USM Alger in Harare. \nThose that have since left for greener pastures are Ronald Chitiyo, Abbas Amidu and Ronald Pfumbidzai. \nChitiyo is now playing in Tunisia, while Amidu and Pfumbidzai are playing in Egypt and South Africa respectively, whereas striker John Zhuwawo is leaving to join South African Premiership side Ajax Cape Town after impressing during a three-day trial assessment period. \nCaps United finished the season on fifth position with 58 points, three behind fourth-placed Chicken Inn.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abbas amidu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter tando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason sunzu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john zhuwawo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "munga chilembe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cuthbert chitima", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reegan simango", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amidu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pfumbidzai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronald chitiyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronald pfumbidzai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dennis dauda", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "caps united", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "zamalek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usm alger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ajax cape town", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "green machine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caf champions league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yadah fc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kabwe warriors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "castle lager premier soccer league", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "harare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wydad casablanca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morocco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kongola blades", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zambia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexandria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tunisia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:18.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e5241919901e5a4e64709a53bc729992c2facc65", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.rZxEMSci6mQbElRh1OAqI5f9vsssiCtxpmuCmrM6.xmRqOihBvflP5Tm4LmlPwJDpKbrm1ptn3f7psK27iTk711d5mzjknpVF3JBToOC5UA--", "site_full": "www.stockhouse.com", "site": "stockhouse.com", "site_section": "http://www.stockhouse.com/companies/bullboard/t.exe/extendicare-inc", "site_categories": ["religion", "sports", "football", "catholicism"], "section_title": "EXTENDICARE INC ( T.EXE ) stock message board and forum -

Forecast to 2025", "text": "Press release from: Future Market Insights PR Agency: Future Market Insights Social media platforms refer to the interaction among the people that involves creation, sharing and exchange of information and ideas in virtual networks and communities. However, use of these social media tools for marketing pharma content is still debatable. The rationale behind this is that the regulatory teams of several pharma companies demand the preventionof comments or sharing features resulting in only a one way interaction,which in turn deprives theessence of social media marketing. However, with the impact of these tools, there is an increased adoption rate of these platforms for strategic decisions. Efforts of pharma sector to leverage the benefits of social media tools to widen their customer base, strengthen customer relationship and enhance brand performance further fuels the usage of social media pharma and healthcare marketing. Other major aspects favorable for pharma sector are building investor relations, corporate communication and customer service at the corporate level. The involvement of regulatory authorities in drafting and issuing guidance for use of interactive media for drugs and biologics proves to be instrumental in deciding the importance of social media marketing in pharma industry. For instance,in second week of January 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a guidance draft for industry that needs to fulfill the regulatory requirements for post marketing submissions of interactive promotional media for animal and human drugs and biologics. Through this draft, the US-FDA provided clarity on working with bloggers and content creators to disseminate branded information. Read Report Overview: www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/pharma-and-healthcar... Incorporation of consumer feedback and their experiences would prove decisive for the companies in the course of novel drug development and other crucial strategy building. Hence social media involvements are further expected to increase product sales in the near future. For instance, Novartis has initiated the use of social media platforms to enhance the sales of its over-the-counter drugs such as Comtrax, Bufferin and Orofar. Another illustration for the use of these social media platforms is by Johnson & Johnson that uses these platforms for crisis management during recall of its products. It has used these social media platforms for apologizing to the consumers for irregularities found in its manufacturing plant by U.S. FDA. It is company\u2019s mode of being personally, emotionally and socially in touch with its clients. The pharma and healthcare social media market can be analyzed by the extent of use of social media platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, etc. by pharma industries along with benefit and risk ratio analysis of these tools in healthcare. In addition, impact or effect of these tools on healthcare stakeholders such as hospitals, patients/consumers, healthcare professionals and biotechnology companies coupled with a geographical landscape focusing on the popularity of these tools also can be provided. The geographical landscape includes the analysis of four major regions namely North America, Asia-Pacific, Europe and RoW. Request to view Sample Report: www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-403 The major factors favoring the growth of the market are increased expenditure by pharmaceutical companies for online advertising along with increasing adoption rates of online marketing tools by the consumers. As per few research studies in the year 2012, the overall pharmaceutical and healthcare spending increased nearly by 45 percent year-on-year to approximately USD 1.1billion of which 6 percent represented online advertising costs. This revenue is generated through paid advertisements and subscriptions from various electronic devices and unique IP addresses. On the other hand, the disadvantages and risk factors of these platforms such as privacy and security in question along with improper content validation are some of the issues that might pose the challenge for the growth of the market. Some of the companies engaged in use of social media are Johnson & Johnson, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Inc., Novartis and Bayer AG.

This is a prospective, cross-sectional, study in a university-affiliated, tertiary-care hospital. We recruited 151 children with CP (mean age 6.11 years, SD 3.42, range 3\u201318yr). The Eating and Drinking Ability Classification System (EDACS) and the dysphagia scales of Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), Swallow Function Scales (SFS), and Food Intake Level Scale (FILS) were used. The Communication Function Classification System (CFCS) and Viking Speech Scale (VSS) were employed to classify communication function and speech intelligibility, respectively. The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) with the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GFMCS) and the Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) level were also assessed. Spearman correlation analysis to investigate the associations between measures and univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to identify significant factors were used. Median GMFCS level of participants was III (interquartile range II\u2013IV). Significant dysphagia based on EDACS level III\u2013V was noted in 23 children (15.2%). There were strong to very strong relationships between the EDACS level with the dysphagia scales. The EDACS presented strong associations with MACS, CFCS, and VSS, a moderate association with GMFCS level, and a moderate to strong association with each domain of the PEDI. In multivariate analysis, poor functioning in EDACS were associated with poor functioning in gross motor and communication functions.\n\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2BQLJh9", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "spearman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ja young choi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yu-ra goh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seon ah kim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pedi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jieun park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eun sook park", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:19.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e0ecb7f9f30cf17a225bbb5a55df62fe5e5a05f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC_FbjDoEVzxvPkChCZu95ijVbAT5HHEYTay9yW12zyG6WIvRFVlDbK6fLrJFRsg8ZdGhc_a_7BM9", "site_full": "www.newsday.co.zw", "site": "newsday.co.zw", "site_section": "https://www.newsday.co.zw/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NewsDay Zimbabwe", "title": "Bangladesh, SL, Zim series confirmed", "title_full": "Bangladesh, SL, Zim series confirmed", "published": "2017-12-07T07:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ZW", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cricket2.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 74625, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0e0ecb7f9f30cf17a225bbb5a55df62fe5e5a05f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC_FbjDoEVzxvPkChCZu95ijVbAT5HHEYTay9yW12zyG6WIvRFVlDbK6fLrJFRsg8ZdGhc_a_7BM9", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsday", "published": "2017-12-07T07:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "Bangladesh, SL, Zim series confirmed", "text": "Bangladesh, SL, Zim series confirmed - December 7, 2017 \nDHAKA \u2014 Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) cricket operations committee chairman Akram Khan has informed that the one-day international tri-nation series with Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe will be hosted in between the Sri Lanka series, which is not usually seen in international cricket. \nBdcrictime \nBangladesh have a busy schedule starting from January.

Barnett, Mellissa Prunty, Sara Rosenblum\nBackgroundDemands for the production of legible handwriting produced in a timely manner increase as children progress through school. Despite the considerable number of children faced with handwriting difficulties, there is no quick and practical tool to assess legibility in this population.AimThe aim of this study was to develop the Handwriting Legibility Scale (HLS) and to establish the scale's reliability and validity.MethodsThe HLS is a non-language dependent scale which assesses global legibility, based on five criteria applied to samples of 'free writing'. Content validity, inter-rater reliability and internal consistency were initially examined using scripts from 20 children aged 8\u201314 years. Construct validity was established by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of data from 150 school children aged 9\u201314 years, with an additional examination of gender effects. Discriminant validity of the HLS score was examined in 29 children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) and 29 typically developing (TD) children.ResultsThe results indicated high internal consistency (\u03b1=0.92). The inter-rater reliability was acceptable but indicates the need to refine the scoring instructions. PCA of the five components revealed a one factor solution explaining 61% of the variance. In the discriminant analysis, 86.2% of the children with DCD and 89.7% of the TD children were correctly classified to their groups based on the total HLS score.ConclusionsThe overall findings suggest that the HLS may be a useful tool to identify poor handwriting legibility, with application across different languages and writing scripts.\n\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2k1PQ1U", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anna l. barnett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mellissa prunty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sara rosenblum backgrounddemands", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "research in developmental disabilities", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dcd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "principal component analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pca", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:19.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cad62b52c6e60952a095ec54afef4f0941a08536", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC_FbjDoEVzxvPkChCZu95ijfS7fzT3SBlujbWLElhqfSdgSpU05h8qJ4Wfy03cUO2g--", "site_full": "www.newsday.co.zw", "site": "newsday.co.zw", "site_section": "https://www.newsday.co.zw/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NewsDay Zimbabwe", "title": "\u2018We can spin the decks, too\u2019 \u2014 Noma that Girl", "title_full": "\u2018We can spin the decks, too\u2019 \u2014 Noma that Girl", "published": "2017-12-07T07:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ZW", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Sharon-Sibindi-e1512588000931.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 74625, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cad62b52c6e60952a095ec54afef4f0941a08536", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC_FbjDoEVzxvPkChCZu95ijfS7fzT3SBlujbWLElhqfSdgSpU05h8qJ4Wfy03cUO2g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsday", "published": "2017-12-07T07:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "\u2018We can spin the decks, too\u2019 \u2014 Noma that Girl", "text": "\u2018We can spin the decks, too\u2019 \u2014 Noma that Girl - December 7, 2017 \nLEADING Bulawayo female DJ Nomagugu Hanyane has exhibited exceptional music prowess by distinguishing herself through a unique versatility that has seen her excelling in the male-dominated \u201cdeejaying\u201d field. \nBy Sharon Sibindi \nHanyane (NH), who goes by the name DJ Noma that Girl when spinning the decks, spoke to NewsDay Life and Style Reporter Sharon Sibindi (ND) about her life and experiences as a female disc jockey. Below are excerpts from the interview. \nND: Tell us a bit about yourself and how you ventured into the DJs\u2019 circuit? \nNH: My name is Nomagugu Hanyane. I am the first born in a family of three. I am a disc jockey by profession. I joined the arts industry in April 2014 through DJs Hangout by Mark Vusani, where upcoming DJs showcase their talents, mix and mingle with well-known DJs, so I had to take part in it. Since then, I have been spinning the decks. \nND: How long have you been a DJ and what is the muse behind it? \nNH: It has been three years now. I have always loved music and I saw this as the only platform for me to express my love for music. I am able to showcase what I have and let people enjoy. \nND: What have been some of your memorable experiences? \nNH: Every time I play outside Bulawayo, I feel wow! My most memorable shows have been in Gwanda, Harare and Masvingo. I enjoy it, as it brings me out of this world and I get to see how most people are surprised when they see a female spinning the decks better than their male counterparts. This drives them insane (in a good way) and, yeah, we can spin the decks, too. So I enjoy it when people appreciate my talent. It is just amazing. \nND: Is the industry kind to female DJs? What has been your story? \nNH: I have faced challenges like being sidelined, not taken seriously, as a female DJ. Another thing is that promoters tend to take advantage of female DJs. They do not appreciate us and think everyone can be a DJ. Sometimes they prefer the cheapest options rather than best. People do not know that cheap is expensive, you get what you paid for, so that\u2019s another problem. \nThe passion that I have is not about the money, money is a bonus, but we are not taken seriously. \nND: What projects are you currently involved in? \nNH: This year, I have not been involved in many projects but in 2018, I am planning to release some material. That is what I am working on, and people should watch out for some collaborations too. \nND: What would you also want your fans to know about you? \nNH: I am a town planner by qualification. I studied at Bulawayo Polytechnic College. That is what I do and I think a lot of people do not know this about me. I am a bad ass when it comes to FIFA (play station game). Yeah, I am a hard gamer. I dare any guy to come and challenge me. \nND: Can you tell us about that lucky guy in your life? \nNH: I am in a relationship but I keep my private life away from my public life. I do not mix my work and private life. My partner has been very supportive to me and he is my number one supporter alongside my family. He is very proud of what I do. So I always make time for the things that are important to me. \nND: Is this about your natural talent or an acquired skill? \nNH: In the beginning, deejaying was very challenging, especially in my genre, which is hip-hop. A few people play that and there is a lot of beat matching, key matching and tempo. In the beginning, I used to practise quite a lot. Now I am working on being creative and doing things that are outside the box, mixing acapellas, putting together songs people think cannot go along together. \nND: Tell us about your family, are they in any way involved in what you do? \nNH: My family has been so supportive since the day I told them this is what I want to try and venture in. They told me to go for it and they were the first people to buy me a controller. They believed in me. They even trust me enough to go out at night to work and return home safely. It is a trust thing, which I really appreciate because many families would not accept that for a girl child. \nND: Thank you so much Noma for your time. \nNH: You are welcome.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "noma", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dj nomagug", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sharon sibindi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark vusani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanyane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharon sibindi  hanyane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nomagugu hanyane", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "noma", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bulawayo polytechnic college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dj noma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newsday life", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fifa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "masvingo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bulawayo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gwanda", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:19.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4581d10971df55063b1b648a286556c737c28b1d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwpfpRw.8wzF9ehGIH9IrJvqxgmIeBD_U3UOVUzPYLjtOJn.y0uGHnTAhPmCEK9VxZTiIX4Kvmy1w--", "site_full": "forums.moneysavingexpert.com", "site": "moneysavingexpert.com", "site_section": "http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/forumdisplay.php?f=72", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Competitions Time - MoneySavingExpert.com Forums", "title": "A: 12/12 Dragon Jones (Twitter) (Opens 01/12)", "title_full": "A: 12/12 Dragon Jones (Twitter) (Opens 01/12) - MoneySavingExpert.com Forums", "published": "2017-11-29T18:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2270, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6266ff6c858a6e659708cb629e53b25cc67f4713", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwpfpRw.8wzF9ehGIH9IrJvqxgmIeBD_U3UOVUzPYLjtOJn.y0uGHnTAhPmCEK9VxYkq7.7x5Wol0OnmYqCf1FUS89K06Ef2sI-", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "fizzyhelen", "published": "2017-12-04T12:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Day 4\nFor a chance to win this amazing Sony A600 mirrorless camera bundle follow @ Jessops and tweet me before 7pm to tell me you\u0092ve done it using # 12DaysOfJones & # 12DaysOfJonesDAY4 .

A new artiste must sound new, bring that element of surprise that people (will) ask (for) the name behind the production.\u201d \nThe producer said a lot of gospel musicians had a tendency of embracing different genres on a single album and was working against them. \n\u201cNew gospel musicians do not have a genre to be identified with. On the same album, you will find a sungura song, then a South African house song, a soft rock Hill Songs\u2019 style, a reggae song and then a Naija groove song among others,\u201d he said. He said he usually advised musicians who recorded with his stable to settle for a style with which they would be identified with, so that they could develop their brand. \n\u201cTrying to please everybody by trying everything on a single album is not it. Look at dancehall artistes and yesteryear legends like Mechanic Manyeruke\u2026 When a song starts, you know who it is, but most albums these days sound like a DJ\u2019s party play list.\u201d \nMukundu, however, acknowledged that there were some external forces crippling the music industry and these included the current economic challenges in the country that had fuelled the rise in piracy and the subsequent closure of music shops and recording companies.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mono", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mukundu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "clive", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "winstone antonio  mukundu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "monolio studios", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "harare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:20.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9f66619ad9478572b45d245553049e14368984a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC_FbjDoEVzxvPkChCZu95ig5L7xjjRkQ3t86erX3_joIoWlBI7fMBUw.F1FtALTbgEdiu8ytWkob", "site_full": "www.newsday.co.zw", "site": "newsday.co.zw", "site_section": "https://www.newsday.co.zw/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NewsDay Zimbabwe", "title": "Vivo, Engen in share exchange deal", "title_full": "Vivo, Engen in share exchange deal", "published": "2017-12-07T07:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ZW", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Engen-Holdings-Pty-Limited-copy.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 74625, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9f66619ad9478572b45d245553049e14368984a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC_FbjDoEVzxvPkChCZu95ig5L7xjjRkQ3t86erX3_joIoWlBI7fMBUw.F1FtALTbgEdiu8ytWkob", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsday", "published": "2017-12-07T07:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Vivo, Engen in share exchange deal", "text": "Vivo, Engen in share exchange deal - December 7, 2017 \nVivo Energy Holding B.V.

December 7, 2017 \nFinance minister Patrick Chinamasa has a delicate balancing act to perform today when he presents the national budget, as he has to choose between populism and pragmatism. \nFor decades now, successive Zanu PF Finance ministers have chosen to sacrifice pragmatism at the altar of sanctimony and this has had disastrous consequences for the Zimbabwean economy. \nChinamasa has been portrayed as somewhat of a maverick, who went against his former boss, Robert Mugabe\u2019s wishes and twice he got his fingers burnt, but now he has the perfect chance to show who he really is. \nAs somewhat of a reformer, Chinamasa argued twice against bonuses and called for the cutting of allowances for civil servants among a host of reforms and we wait to see if he is that brave to make similar proposals. \nThe new administration only has eight months to impress and the question is whether they will throw caution to the wind and implement reforms or they will be too scared to rock the boat. \nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has for long been portrayed as someone who has an ear for business and he and his Finance minister have a chance to show this when the budget is announced. \nThe budgetary problems facing Zimbabwe are not new, they relate to the growing budget deficit, an unhealthy appetite for government spending and the suicidal dependence on Treasury Bills. \nThe civil service wage bill is also unsustainable and there is need for the government to act on this, no matter how unpopular. \nThus, Chinamasa will have to walk a tightrope, where he is likely to be criticised no matter what he does. \nIf he chooses austerity, cuts bonuses and allowances and fires ghost workers, this government could be shortlived and faces the ignominy of defeat at the next elections. \nOn the other hand, if he chooses populism, pays bonuses and does not implement any changes, then he will have a happy civil service, but tinkering on the brink and it will also show the world that Zimbabwe is not serious about economic reforms. \nIt is an unenviable task, but one that must be done nonetheless. \nIt will be the biggest signpost of this administration\u2019s policy directive and it is one that potential investors will be eyeing very closely. \nThus, Chinamasa must know that Zimbabweans and the world are watching closely and this could determine the country\u2019s immediate future.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "patrick chin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "chinamasa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "emmerson mnangagwa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert mugabe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "treasury bills", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zanu pf finance", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:20.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b76534173cd8396b7e65b8bddc4bd3297aef7cac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC_FbjDoEVzxvPkChCZu95iifXPSlqb9r.js046EaTyr3MvWeUHIO61Dt1yP1M2jr1XddJuUS3tcg", "site_full": "www.newsday.co.zw", "site": "newsday.co.zw", "site_section": "https://www.newsday.co.zw/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NewsDay Zimbabwe", "title": "Mudehwe vows to revive his game in 2018", "title_full": "Mudehwe vows to revive his game in 2018", "published": "2017-12-07T06:23:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ZW", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/football-e1510515777265.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 74625, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b76534173cd8396b7e65b8bddc4bd3297aef7cac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC_FbjDoEVzxvPkChCZu95iifXPSlqb9r.js046EaTyr3MvWeUHIO61Dt1yP1M2jr1XddJuUS3tcg", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsday", "published": "2017-12-07T06:23:00.000+02:00", "title": "Mudehwe vows to revive his game in 2018", "text": "Mudehwe vows to revive his game in 2018 -

However, I believe brighter days are ahead for me at FC Platinum,\u201d Mudehwe said. \n\u201cFC Platinum is my home. I will stay put. I am satisfied with everything here. \n\u201cI am happy that we wrote our own new piece of history by becoming the first team outside of Harare and Bulawayo to win the league title.

On that day, an entire nation conspired to run away from Satan in order to seek refuge in and surrender its soul to Lucifer. By Patson Dzamara \nAfter enduring 37 years under the morbid rule of Robert Mugabe, Zimbabweans from all walks of life converged demanding him to step down as their President. It was surreal and unprecedented. For the first time since the attainment of independence, Zimbabweans were able to freely express themselves in unison. \nA coincidence of agendas \nThe path towards this momentous Saturday was littered with curious landmarks which most people overlooked while raptured in euphoria. Anyone who dared to highlight the landmarks was labelled an anti-progress agent. I was not spared that label because between Satan and Lucifer, I chose none. The nation was ready to cross over. Nothing else mattered and nothing was allowed to stand in its way. \nWhat most people failed to pick was the fact that actions which culminated in the happenings of that Saturday were not emanating from the same premise. There were two agendas at play and one agenda used the other as a means to an end. \nAs far as the national sentiment or agenda was concerned, Mugabe in all his forms had to go. Sly power mongers in the form of army generals, Emmerson Mnangagwa and his crew saw that as an opportunity to augment their political and factional agenda. \nThey steered the nation towards a precarious and fallacious conclusion that once Mugabe the person is removed, then a new Zimbabwe would have been birthed. \nGullible and desperate for change, Zimbabweans believed and rallied behind these power-hungry desperados and their warped narrative. Consumed with a burning desire for a new Zimbabwe and paying less attention to what was really happening, Zimbabweans essentially joined their voice to that of this power-intoxicated bunch in a spirited fight to remove Mugabe. \nErroneously and na\u00efvely, Zimbabweans thought that whatever was happening was being done for them. Very few actually perceived that they were aiding a power manoeuvre which had nothing or little to do with them. Most had concluded that the moment they patiently waited for was finally delivered to them on a silver platter. \nSurprisingly and regrettably, not many questioned why all of a sudden the chief cornerstones which had sustained Mugabe\u2019s grip on power had suddenly turned against him. Not only that, not many deciphered the critical difference between the people\u2019s agenda and the defence forces agenda. The people\u2019s agenda was motivated by a desire to gain freedom from dictatorship while the army generals\u2019 agenda was motivated by a desire to gain power for themselves and their friends. \nBut again, all that didn\u2019t matter to many for as long Mugabe was removed. In fact, anyone who dared to pose such pertinent questions was told that we had to take one step at a time and that Rome was not built in a day. \nThe rise of false hope and illusions \nOn November 21, Mugabe eventually gave in to the pressure and he resigned. His resignation was welcomed with massive celebrations. This was the moment most Zimbabweans had fervently yearned and waited for. \nWhen the news broke, I was driving past the Parliament Building and the commotion caught my attention. There were many people who were waiting for the impeachment outcome in Itai Dzamara Square (Africa Unity Square). I too joined the wild celebrations, but sadly, a few minutes into the celebrations I broke down and wept like a baby when I remembered my brother Itai. I retreated and spent that entire night in bed while almost everyone was celebrating. \nIf it is anything worth to be classified under hope, then it was false hope. To many, that was it. A new Zimbabwe had been delivered to them through the \u201chelp\u201d of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF). \nThe most painful experience I endured in all this was being told \u201chappy new Zimbabwe\u201d by my fellow countrymen. I even attended prayer sessions where some excitable pastors told people to praise God for a new Zimbabwe. Something in me kept on impressing that it was not yet a new Zimbabwe and I always made it a point to register that whenever I had an opportunity to do so privately or publicly. \nSeveral of my friends in the Diaspora asked me whether I thought it was the right time for them to return home and my answer was always an emphatic no. I was adamant that removing Mugabe the person did not mean an automatic death of Mugabe the system. It was just a moment of false hope and illusions. \nThe emergence of pseudo heroes \nWhile the bizarre happenings unfolded, an extremely flagrant precedent was set. Some very strange pseudo heroes emerged. The army generals, soldiers, war veterans and Mnangagwa emerged as heroes. In fact, ZDF Commander General Constantino Chiwenga earned himself a sexy nickname in the process. Some started calling him General Bae. \nFor successfully wresting power in an unorthodox and unconstitutional manner from Mugabe, these individuals became heroes. \nFor as long they removed Mugabe, nobody seemed to care about any other aspect. To many, they were/are heroes who brought freedom, but I repeated that Zimbabwe had been called upon to make an impossible choice between Satan and Lucifer. \nI am still wondering how posing for photos with soldiers or in front of tankers was decoded as a sign of freedom by my fellow countrymen. The excitement of the moment blinkered most from what was really happening. \nI shudder to conclude that very few knew what had hit us at that point. That was the beginning of an undesirable journey towards a military State, of course, with the aid of a meticulously positioned soundtrack from Military Touch Movement. That gifted voice also rode on the tide, and yes, most concluded he is the man of the moment. \nThe epic entrance and branding of Mnangagwa \nAfter Mugabe\u2019s resignation, Zanu PF installed Mnangagwa as its leader. It was a quick transition from Satan to Lucifer or from fire to fire. Mnangagwa returned from exile to an anticipating nation. On November 25 he was inaugurated as the new President of Zimbabwe. \nMnangagwa told Zimbabweans what he knew they wanted to hear and that did the job. That speech caused most fencesitters to incline towards him. Even his critics gave him a thumbs-up. It was an epic entrance. \nAs soon as Mnangagwa\u2019s presidency began, a massive branding exercise was set in motion. He seems to have invested in agenda-setting and gatekeepers, especially on social media. They have been working overtime to brand him, including creating falsehoods and it\u2019s working as evidenced by the number of people getting hooked and hoodwinked. \nLucifer is being projected as God \u2013 a man of principle, discipline, and action notwithstanding his compromised past and present. Anyone who dares to speak anything against him is trolled and many have succumbed. Indeed, if not careful, people will end up thinking that Lucifer is God. \nAfter all the cosmetics and the romance of new-found artificial love, our own Mnangagwa was flying high. He had been presented as a Messiah and even those who were initially indifferent were now willing to give him a chance. \nJust like the Lucifer in the Bible, we knew it was a matter of time before his glorious fall. Fortunately, for some of us who have been projecting that curve much to the dismay of most of our countrymen, vindication came early. Mnangagwa then announced his Cabinet. Everyone was looking forward to see what the Cabinet would look like. \nHe appointed a weird Cabinet made up of the same old, clueless and tired faces who helped Mugabe to run Zimbabwe down. He did that despite the fact that Zimbabweans\u2019 hunger for change had forced them to give him the benefit of the doubt even though he really doesn\u2019t deserve it. \nBy appointing an uninspiring Cabinet of failures and thieves, Mnangagwa has quickly climbed down from the artificially inflated Messiah pedestal to the Lucifer pedestal. \nMnangagwa\u2019s Cabinet has only three women and no single youth. Perhaps he appointed this Cabinet due to the limited timeframe before the 2018 elections. The timeframe narrative is valid, but that still doesn\u2019t undo the damage. It will take a lot more for Mnangagwa to undo the damage done by this move and return to anything approaching his earlier popularity. \nGoing forward, it is too early to write Mnangagwa off. This own goal has just trimmed him back to his actual size. He has a lot to prove and he has an election to win in 2018. He will do anything to retain power. \nThe opposition has been serendipitously given a new lease of life and it must be utilised. More work has to be done. Aluta continua.

The cyber bill, which most of us expected would be fast tracked after the creation of the Cyber Security ministry didn\u2019t take place; there is actually nothing of value that the short lived ministry produced. \nIn a lot of ways we take this as a joke, because we always find amusement whenever a cyber crime happens, like when someone illegally leaks the nudes of someone else, whether out of revenge or hate. \nWhen it comes to cyber laws, many people simply see it as the harsh and overreaching hand of the government to quash people\u2019s freedoms online. It\u2019s not just about coming up with laws to arrest people who act against them but it is also about educating people of their behaviour online as it may have a negative impact on other people. \nThe person who started with the social media post about Delta Bulawayo hiring might have done that in jest, trying to be funny at a time when a lot of people were expecting an instant turnaround to the economy following the ascension of President Emmerson Mnangagwa into the highest political office in Zimbabwe. But that\u2019s not how it was perceived, as a lot of people showed up looking for jobs that were non-existent. \nThere is need for more stringent laws to govern online activities. \nThere are a lot of opportunities that people can get from using the internet, from ecommerce businesses to advertisement; the internet has changed almost everything about how we live our lives. It has also changed us in negative ways and that is a cause for concern.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "emmerson mnangagwa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert mugabe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frampol africa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ict", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "delta bulawayo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:20.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "451e9045a1384c31b59bff2530d43ca71ebf0d3a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC_FbjDoEVzxvPkChCZu95iiSKOR5RUZXtzKNFjmBTNRXRw04yz3W4nHLFckH5EjP4pj.1VuCPBAG", "site_full": "www.newsday.co.zw", "site": "newsday.co.zw", "site_section": "https://www.newsday.co.zw/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NewsDay Zimbabwe", "title": "Your spouse is your assignment", "title_full": "Your spouse is your assignment", "published": "2017-12-07T06:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ZW", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Kilton-Moyo-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 74625, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "451e9045a1384c31b59bff2530d43ca71ebf0d3a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC_FbjDoEVzxvPkChCZu95iiSKOR5RUZXtzKNFjmBTNRXRw04yz3W4nHLFckH5EjP4pj.1VuCPBAG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsday", "published": "2017-12-07T06:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "Your spouse is your assignment", "text": "Your spouse is your assignment - December 7, 2017 \nI do not have to define what an assignment is. I believe that all of us do understand what this is all about. Students are given assignments every day during the school term and even when they close schools and are on holiday they get assignments for them to do. \nBy KILTON MOYO \nEvery student wanting to pass or do well in any subject area, must diligently do their assignments. \nLife is also an assignment and has assignments and all those who want to do well in life and enjoy it must do the assignments. One of the biggest daily assignment for everyone married is their spouse. \nYour spouse is not only your assignment but your number one assignment. You ignore this assignment, you miss everything there is in marriage and infact you shoot your own foot. \nUnfortunately many of us have poorly and clumsily attended to our assignments over the years and it\u2019s now hard even to do corrections and all we want is divorce or we have just given up and we are settling for misery. That is sad. What am I saying? \nDo your work concerning your spouse \nBeloved, your spouse is your work and your responsibility. To be lazy on your spouse is dangerous and suicidal at the same time. \nYou do not work on your spouse by trying to control them, trying to change them, or being violent and instilling fear in them. That is stupid and is not work, but destruction. \nYou work on your spouse by loving them unconditionally and above all things on earth. There is no human being who should take the place of your spouse. You work on your spouse by building confidence in them so they can be who God intended them to be. \nThe problem is that you want them to be who you want and not what their Creator wants. Understand that you are not married to that person to turn them into your goblin or anything you want, but to help them become the complete product God intended right from the begin. \nYour work is to produce from your spouse or in your spouse the woman or man of God. Your work is to bring the best out of your spouse. Bring out all the good out of him or her. Your spouse is your work and not that of your parents, pastor, church or friends. \nYou will not find a ready-made spouse \nThere are those of us who live in utopia, where we think we will find a perfect spouse. This is a deception that will break your heart. \nInfact, it is the thinking of lazy and impatient people. No one is ready-made out there. Everyone is work and somebody must help them out. \nThe role of a spouse is to learn from their spouse. It is to encourage their spouse to be the best and to delearn some habits that might be against love. \nYou see, you have a challenge when your spouse is unteachable and thinks that they know it all. You have a challenge when you spouse takes offence when corrected or taught. \nInfact, such a man or woman is still a child and not yet ready for marriage. Beloved, in marriage you will teach and train each other. We come into it from different backgrounds, with different experiences. These must be modified to fit into our love, romance and vision. \nThere is no one who can help you reform except your spouse, who will do it in love. This is never an overnight thing. It\u2019s a process. I know that most of us refuse to learn so we can promote our love and we want to force things and hide behind a finger, claiming it\u2019s our culture or tradition. \nLet me be clear to you that your culture will persecute your love. After all, without sounding harsh, our African culture is so unromantic. \nThere are two issues here. Do your duty of working on your spouse and also do your duty of being teachable and wanting to learn. Your marriage is unique from any other and so do it the best you choose and enjoy it. \nWork on yourself \nAnyone doing an assignment anywhere, will first prepare themselves and be ready to sit down and work. They research and gather the right information and order their facts well, so they can just flow as they do their work. \nThis is the same with your spouse. Work on yourself first. Be the best spouse yourself. Invest in you. Read books about husbands or wives. Read the bible and learn from God what a husband is and what a wife is. \nYou will never help anyone change if you have not changed yourself. Change starts with you. Ignorant spouses are violent and abusive. I have always said that marriage suffers from serious ignorance. Build yourself up. You are a husband and you want to lead your wife and family please empower yourself. \nJust being in the office of a husband is not enough without wisdom, understanding and knowledge. My disappointment is that most of us would seek information about anything else except our marriages and families. This is deception of the highest order. To do your assignment empower yourself. \nBeloved, you all have a duty to do towards yourself and your spouse. Do not run away from your assignment. That is failure. Work on it, get information. Get knowledge. Ask and find out. Do the duty of a spouse and not of a devil. Give love freely. Be patient and kind to your spouse all the time. Do not give orders but suggest with love. \nI am looking forward to spouses who are really committed to enjoying marriage the most beautiful human relationship and I want to live my life walking with such and helping as many as I can to enjoy. \nLet me say this, you are fooling yourself when you think you can enjoy your marriage carrying yourself the way of your traditions or cultures, instead of the way of love and God. \nHuman cultures know nothing about marriage and love. Learn marriage from God who created it. \nIt is the festive season where you are partying, please do it as families. We are also available to talk to you at your parties. \nKilton Moyo is creator of Fruitful Marriages, a renewal and enrichment programme and is pastor, counsellor and author of Marriage Fitness.

Internet and data increased contribution to total revenue by 0,3%. \nMobile money services registered the highest increase (4,9%) in contribution to total revenue to record 18% from the 13,1% contribution recorded in the previous quarter. This is attributable to the increase in mobile money transactions given the current cash shortages,\u201d Potraz said. \nDespite the growth, Potraz said investment by mobile operators declined by 37,2% to $31 690 543 from $50 489 313 recorded in the previous quarter.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "potraz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "telecel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "postal and telecommunications regulatory authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "econet zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:20.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eb8751bc49126585fa80346dfc893c4e0aa03a8f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC_FbjDoEVzxvPkChCZu95ijN.Br5nwR.ElY5P8v.S5w42hWM0LUQx4TxAWcs2XXOdCYRy_RTpFj_VAlqaBjnAGVXzAq8g1b9bw--", "site_full": "www.newsday.co.zw", "site": "newsday.co.zw", "site_section": "https://www.newsday.co.zw/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NewsDay Zimbabwe", "title": "NRZ sues its Bulawayo tenants over $126k rental arrears", "title_full": "NRZ sues its Bulawayo tenants over $126k rental arrears", "published": "2017-12-07T06:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ZW", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/NRZ1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 74625, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb8751bc49126585fa80346dfc893c4e0aa03a8f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC_FbjDoEVzxvPkChCZu95ijN.Br5nwR.ElY5P8v.S5w42hWM0LUQx4TxAWcs2XXOdCYRy_RTpFj_VAlqaBjnAGVXzAq8g1b9bw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsday", "published": "2017-12-07T06:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "NRZ sues its Bulawayo tenants over $126k rental arrears", "text": "NRZ sues its Bulawayo tenants over $126k rental arrears - December 7, 2017 \nNATIONAL Railways of Zimbabwe\u2019s (NRZ) Contributory Pensions Fund is suing Bulawayo firm Coloursell Distributors (PVT) Limited and a local medical doctor over rental arrears and damages. \nBY SILAS NKALA \nThe pension fund filed summons at the Bulawayo High Court on December 4 demanding payment of $126 102,18 owed in rentals and damages.

Boat maintenance by itself may already be too much of an expense, so you don\u2019t want to spend any more than is necessary on fuelling one of your many sea outings. So how exactly can this be done? Check out this list of some helpful fuel saving tips that you can use:\nGet rid of all the extras weighing down your boat. Similar to cars, an extra-heavy boat will require more fuel to run. Although it pays to be prepared in case of emergencies or extended cruises, there\u2019s also such a thing as carrying too much unwanted items on board. Inspect all the storage spaces on your boat. Get rid of those heavy books about cruising, keep your stock canned goods to a minimum, and make sure that you only have the recommended one tackle box, spare parts, ropes, and tools. Don\u2019t weigh the boat down with sports equipment, cookware, fancy deck chairs or heavy fishing gear if you know that you won\u2019t need them. \nCheck your boat\u2019s bottom! Newbie owners of private yachts for sale may not be aware that even just one short sea outing may cause an accumulation of marine gunk at the bottom of the boat. Weeds, barnacles, scum, and similar elements from the ocean add weight and affects fuel efficiency. After cleaning the bottom of the boat, you may want to apply a layer of anti-fouling paint on the hull to prevent plant growth.\nBe aware of the amount of fuel your boat is burning. Calculating the fuel consumption for cars is pretty straightforward. But when it comes to boats, there are a few more elements factored in, including the more unpredictable sea conditions. Fuel consumption in boats is usually measured in gallons per hour \u2013 while taking in other factors like drag, wide-open throttle, and cruising speed. When you\u2019re aware of the factors affecting the fuel consumption of your boat, you will better learn how to save up on gas.\nFuel up early in the day. Fill up the tank early in the day when the ground is still cold, and fuel is denser, so that you can get the best value for your money.\nLastly, regular engine tune-ups, cruising at a leisurely speed, travelling to closer destinations, running with the wind, and avoiding high-rolling seas are the other ways for you to save on boat fuel.\nMajesty Yachts is one of the best yacht brands in the market today.

This is compounded by the need for them to pay for drugs since the hospitals do not have these in stock and they rely on giving these poor pensioners prescriptions so that they can go and buy the drugs from pharmacies. This further compounds their problem since they do not have the money,\u201d he said. \nThe senator said as a traditional leader, he had handled a lot of cases of the elderly who ended up approaching chiefs for assistance to buy drugs. \n\u201cWe end up buying those drugs for them and paying for their children\u2019s school fees. The chiefs will have become the ministry by default. We urge the relevant Ministry of Health to have a fund that helps the aged as well as the provision of free health care with adequate medication being provided,\u201d he said. \nCharumbira said the Ministry of Health should also do away with the requirement that the elderly should pay cash upfront for treatment. \n\u201cThe urban population is lucky that it can use plastic money. The same cannot be said about the rural elderly because they cannot afford to pay even a dollar to have their maize processed into mealie-meal.

I was with my assistants when it was 6-0 and (we were) looking at each other thinking \u2018Wow how did that happen?\u2019 \n\u201cEven when it was 3-0, 4-0, 5-0 they still played football, they still had their moments, still had scoring situations. \n\u201cWe had to play exactly the level we played to beat them. Then because of the development of the game, it was a higher result. \n\u201cIt is one of the better ones (performances). I don\u2019t care (if it is the best), I can easily enjoy a game like this without thinking about when did I see a game like this already.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "klopp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "philippe coutinho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roberto firmino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antonio conte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jurgen klopp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohamed salah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sadio mane", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "juventus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liverpool", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bayern munich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "real madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "psg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelsea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spartak moscow", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:20.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4901a58e58bf22a6e59e6870f36de15d14eb783a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3Ebkq4DFLEvNDCtQAc2ELOqqwGUo3CoQtyseDYtPUZynf3pYmXiJ1RRglu2i04_Zrl9S6cb5iQycd100E7n_i3njgWPZtGXkjCpaUkhlRwFI1GBl_nGOfOj9NubQC8YIUffNX.VSVPo-", "site_full": "otorhinolaryngologysfakianakisal.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://otorhinolaryngologysfakianakisal.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "OtorhinolaryngologySfakianakis", "title": "Development of the Handwriting Legibility Scale (HLS): A preliminary examination of Reliability and Validity", "title_full": "Development of the Handwriting Legibility Scale (HLS): A preliminary examination of Reliability and Validity", "published": "2017-12-07T12:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4901a58e58bf22a6e59e6870f36de15d14eb783a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3Ebkq4DFLEvNDCtQAc2ELOqqwGUo3CoQtyseDYtPUZynf3pYmXiJ1RRglu2i04_Zrl9S6cb5iQycd100E7n_i3njgWPZtGXkjCpaUkhlRwFI1GBl_nGOfOj9NubQC8YIUffNX.VSVPo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "\u0391\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a3\u03c6\u03b1\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "Development of the Handwriting Legibility Scale (HLS): A preliminary examination of Reliability and Validity", "text": "\nPublication date: January 2018\nSource: Research in Developmental Disabilities, Volume 72\nAuthor(s): Anna L. Barnett, Mellissa Prunty, Sara Rosenblum\nBackgroundDemands for the production of legible handwriting produced in a timely manner increase as children progress through school. Despite the considerable number of children faced with handwriting difficulties, there is no quick and practical tool to assess legibility in this population.AimThe aim of this study was to develop the Handwriting Legibility Scale (HLS) and to establish the scale's reliability and validity.MethodsThe HLS is a non-language dependent scale which assesses global legibility, based on five criteria applied to samples of 'free writing'. Content validity, inter-rater reliability and internal consistency were initially examined using scripts from 20 children aged 8\u201314 years. Construct validity was established by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of data from 150 school children aged 9\u201314 years, with an additional examination of gender effects. Discriminant validity of the HLS score was examined in 29 children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) and 29 typically developing (TD) children.ResultsThe results indicated high internal consistency (\u03b1=0.92). The inter-rater reliability was acceptable but indicates the need to refine the scoring instructions. PCA of the five components revealed a one factor solution explaining 61% of the variance. In the discriminant analysis, 86.2% of the children with DCD and 89.7% of the TD children were correctly classified to their groups based on the total HLS score.ConclusionsThe overall findings suggest that the HLS may be a useful tool to identify poor handwriting legibility, with application across different languages and writing scripts.\n\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2k1PQ1U", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anna l. barnett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mellissa prunty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sara rosenblum backgrounddemands", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dcd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "principal component analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pca", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:20.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a06e87c5a8f996f5003b9001280cf97aa0d524e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWAPZhkyjxb.8nSjVsSLOUPZEXllwGcnJjBTAmVZDCTrQv7qinDuQs3Wpbhp8QBmbx3uakY.D_jw_tWnnLSc.6g.MslL40MOk3sxlnxum_FSxBqh8aRvZB1kKXZS6CXSWvFIE36Yqaq_b2iVroECI9fQ--", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-stationery-craft/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Stationery &amp; Craft - Buy Stationery &amp; Craft at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "A2 Size Cutting Mat A2 (45cmx60cm) Thickness: 3mm -Tikar memotong", "title_full": "A2 Size Cutting Mat A2 (45cmx60cm) Thickness: 3mm -Tikar memotong | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-03-24T10:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.357, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e95f777d0599b3e6bb74a6ed2c4f61413fd0d08a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWAPZhkyjxb.8nSjVsSLOUPZEXllwGcnJjBTAmVZDCTrQv7qinDuQs3Wpbhp8QBmbx3uakY.D_jw_tWnnLSc.6g.MslL40MOk3sxlnxum_FSxBqh8aRvZB1kKXZS6CXSWvFIE36Yqaq_ZuvLj9ZkV4qcCrDhWlFpiV", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Lazada Customer", "published": "2017-11-28T18:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "Like it", "text": "Fast delivery.
