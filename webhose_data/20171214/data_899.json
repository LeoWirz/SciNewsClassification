The +/-1,100 kV (1.1 million volts) UHVDC transformer, developed and manufactured in close collaboration with State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), has successfully passed a series of type tests, paving the way for the implementation of the Changji-Guquan UHVDC link, which will transmit power from the Xinjiang region in the Northwest, to Anhui province in eastern China. \nChangji-Guquan, the world\u2019s first +/-1,100 kV UHVDC link will set a new world record in terms of voltage level, transmission capacity and distance. It will be capable of transporting 12,000 megawatts of electricity \u2013 the equivalent of 12 large power plants and 50 percent more than the +/- 800 kV UHVDC links currently in operation. Transmission distance will be extended from around 2,000 kilometers (km) to over 3,000 km, enabling the integration and transmission of remote renewables on a much larger scale. \nWhen fully operational this UHVDC link will be able to feed eight 500 kV and two 1,000 kV AC lines \u2013 delivering power equivalent to twice the average annual power consumption of Switzerland. ABB\u2019s latest breakthrough also makes it possible to connect +/-1,100 kV DC with 750 kV UHVAC links for the first time. In addition to the transformer, ABB has also developed and successfully tested a range of other key +/-1,100 kV components, including converter valves, bushings and DC circuit breakers. \n\u201cIn addition to transporting more power across longer distances with lower losses, this breakthrough will enable the interconnection of AC and DC grids and support the future linking of regions and countries.\u201d said Claudio Facchin, president of ABB\u2019s Power Grids division. \u201cIt reinforces our pioneering technology leadership in HVDC transmission and reaffirms our close collaboration with SGCC, as we enable a stronger, smarter and greener grid\u201d. \n\u201cThe Changji-Guquan +/-1,100kV project is a major technical step-up making it the world\u2019s highest DC voltage. The transformer is a key element of this link and we are pleased that the first of these landmark transformers have passed critical tests and exceeded expectations. I would like to congratulate the teams from ABB and SGCC on this successful achievement\u201d said Mr. Liu ZeHong, Executive Vice President, SGCC. \nChina has major consumption centers in the east, while a significant amount of its energy resources are in the west and northwest. The expansive geography and increasing demand have prompted the build-up of ultrahigh voltage links to increase transmission capacity while minimizing losses. \nABB pioneered HVDC technology more than 60 years ago and is the global market leader with over 110 HVDC projects, representing a total installed capacity of more than 120,000 megawatts \u2013 around half of the world\u2019s installed base. UHVDC transmission is an advancement of HVDC and represents the biggest capacity and efficiency leap in over two decades. In 2010 ABB supported SGCC with the Xiangjiaba-Shanghai project, the world\u2019s first +/- 800 kV UHVDC link to go into commercial operation. \nABB (ABBN: SIX Swiss Ex) is a pioneering technology leader in electrification products, robotics and motion, industrial automation and power grids, serving customers in utilities, industry and transport & infrastructure globally. Continuing more than a 125-year history of innovation, ABB today is writing the future of industrial digitalization and driving the Energy and Fourth Industrial Revolutions. ABB operates in more than 100 countries with about 136,000 employees. www.abb.com. \nContact: Media Relations, media.relations@ch.abb.com, +41 43 317 71 11 \nFollow ABB on social media: Facebook | LinkedIn | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube Categories Uncategorized", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "decemb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liu zehong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "changji-guquan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "claudio facchin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "abb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state grid corporation of china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "energy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "power grids", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "zurich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northwest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xiangjiaba-shanghai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anhui", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xinjiang", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:46.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0ca12d131d1d46bcef853eab62b3fca0559b8745", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTc.7SKN1VLlHGbZyMLjgeVL4e75CBsEaSHb6x4wvGbAMX5ZLiAy2Gwlcs4V78yMvUjxwG19Dnvag--", "site_full": "mforum.cari.com.my", "site": "cari.com.my", "site_section": "https://mforum.cari.com.my/forum.php?mod=forumdisplay&fid=154", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Isu Semasa -

I'm anxious to find out when he returns.\"\nAbang Johari is on a five-day study tour in China.\nPKR Sarawak chief Baru Bian said Zahid had issued a legitimate warning, but said the slogans accurately reflect the people\u2019s sentiments in the two Bornean states.\nBaru however noted the \"warning\" came as the 14th general election is looming and it was a calculated move to suppress the swelling of dissatisfaction against the federal government.\n\"Wrongly handled, it may backfire against BN,\" he said. \u2013 December 6, 2017.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:47.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0988b74622ac26129433a1a17709c52ecd70ba75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQXv5tBQViA4ofGJ.X5.ryg1xB3_qTY2BituIy9y6UyM0F2abfF7bP_kc8d0Vu5UHJSWhjcsR0MlmrfuTZpdA50nHy1MHuJuk6PfMWmhd9RfQmCL0N4zICf85bj.v4l7emtCfAYjlDYbl9Gqfi61NRb", "site_full": "commsbusiness.co.uk", "site": "commsbusiness.co.uk", "site_section": "http://commsbusiness.co.uk/feed/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Comms Business", "title": "Is the Channel Ideally Placed to Deliver The Intelligent Cloud?

Distributors \nInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS) has vastly expanded in the past couple of years, Gartner reports an $11 billion increase in spending on cloud system infrastructure services in the past year alone. While many end user organisations still perceive IaaS as a colossal move from what is considered a \u2018traditional IT infrastructure setup\u2019, Apay Obang-Oyway, Director Cloud and Software, UK&I at Ingram Micro, suggests that IaaS is central to realising the intelligent future of the cloud, and the channel is ideally placed to deliver it. \nApay explains: \u201cWhile SaaS provides a great deal of simplicity to business users due to its \u2018all-or-nothing\u2019 approach, in contrast, IaaS is the bridge between business and IT, where both the IT department and the business as a whole can appreciate the significant benefits of cloud, especially its scalability. For business users, they receive the reduced pricing and experience the capabilities of the cloud, while the IT department enjoys data centres with the possibility of an adaptable and accessible infrastructure on demand.\u201d \nAccording to market research from Vanson Bourne, commissioned by Ingram Micro Cloud, 68 per cent of enterprise and mid-market cloud end users feel it is necessary for cloud resellers to offer 24/7 continuous customer support on top of the cloud platform. In addition to this statistic, an overwhelming majority (86 per cent) of cloud resellers polled say that their organisation also manages cloud services for their clients once they have sold them the platform. With these figures in mind, the channel has already begun to realise that establishing relationships with end users is vital to protecting future profitability. \nApay continues: \u201cIaaS is the future of cloud, and the channel has so many opportunities available to protect future profitability in this space. Confidence in selling IaaS in the channel is growing, as is understanding the potential for innovation and growth that the infrastructure can bring. The rise of next generation technologies, such as artificial intelligence, autonomous cars, and robots, will be key in helping to bring about such growth. The most recent innovations through cloud were all built on IaaS, not SaaS.

If a cloud partner provides a quality service, that will have a larger positive impact for all other cloud partners.

Kashyap said here: \u201cMy film is set in Uttar Pradesh, the state I come from. So, the casteism that you see in the film is as real as it looks. This is the reality of that society.\u201cWhen we talk about casteism, we only project how the higher caste is discriminating against the lower caste. But in reality, reverse casteism also exists. There are people from the lower caste holding the higher position in administration and years after, take revenge with the higher caste people who once discriminated against them.\u201d Was it intentional to bring politics alive in a film which is essentially about boxing?\u201cI am making a sports movie about boxing. Through the film, I am showing the real condition of the sport of boxing and the social background of the players who are coming to play it. So, the various layers of the narration are basically revolving around that,\u201d said Kashyap, known for movies like \u201cBlack Friday\u201d, \u201cGangs of Wassepur\u201d and \u201cUgly\u201d. As the protagonist set out on his journey to achieve his dream to be a national champion, the film unfolds the reality of the flawed infrastructure in the country\u2019s sports scene that does not allow India to make a global mark in athletics.\u201cThat is the question that I want to ask \u2014 We celebrate cricket internationally, but not a sport like boxing\u2026 A boxing champion is never celebrated like a cricket champion, why,\u201d asked Kashyap. Being a film director who also produced movies like \u201cQueen\u201d, \u201cUdaan\u201d, \u201cShahid\u201d, \u201cLunchbox\u201d and \u201cMasaan\u201d, Kashyap has collaborated with filmmaker Aanand L. Rai for \u201cMukkabaaz\u201d. Was there any creative conflict?\u201cI always believe that a film director makes a good film producer because he understands the perspective of a storyteller better. When it comes to me and Aanand, therefore, we bonded so well.\u201cThe collaboration happened over a cup of tea. He wanted me to read the script of \u2018Maanmarziyaan\u2019, for directing it. I loved the script and I said I will direct it, but first I want to work on this film (\u2018Mukkabaaz\u2019). So then we decided to do both the films,\u201d said Kashyap. Well-versed with world cinema, Kashyap is a popular name in the international film festival circuit. It is interesting how his stories have a very local flavour of the middle-class society of developing India. Explaining that, he said: \u201cSee, it\u2019s simple. I as an audience watch films that give me an insight of the local culture of a country and a community. I watch a film that has an interesting story.\u201cHonestly, when I look at a story, I do not think about if it has the potential to travel globally. If it does, great, if not, it\u2019s okay.

PICTURE BY STEPHEN DAVISON Kyle White Published: 06:00 Thursday 07 December 2017 \nVauxhall International North West 200 record-breaker Alastair Seeley has teamed up with British Supersport outfit EHA Racing for the famous road race next May. \nSeeley, who extended his haul of Triangle wins to an unprecedented 21 victories this year, will compete on a Yamaha R6 in both Supersport races as the Carrick man targets a five-timer in 2018. \nThe 38-year-old, who has been linked with a return to the Tyco BMW team for the Superbike and Superstock events at the North West, is unable to threaten Phillip McCallen\u2019s 1992 record of five wins in a day, although the two-time British champion is targeting five triumphs over both race days next year. \n\u201cBecause of some of the circumstances at this year\u2019s races, I want to improve,\u201d said Seeley, who was denied victory in the feature NW200 Superbike race by fellow Carrickfergus man Glenn Irwin this year. \n\u201cI am extra motivated for next year, very determined and focused to show there is a reason why I am the record holder at the North West.\u201d \nOn his deal to compete for the EHA Racing team, Seeley said he was feeling confident of continuing his winning streak in the Supersport class. \n\u201cRacing against the EHA team in the Supersport championship this year, I saw how fast their bikes were and how professional the team is,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIt is the class I\u2019ve enjoyed the most wins in at the North West and the bikes suit my style and stature. I\u2019ll be back in the British Supersport championship next season so I should be dialled in coming to Portrush. It is also nice to be involved with another team that has a strong local connection with the event.\u201d \nEHA Racing is run by former NW200 competitor Edward Allingham and he delighted to have Seeley. \n\u201cIt is really exciting to shake hands on the deal and it would be good to show people what we can do.

Furthermore, calmodulin (calcium binding protein) and calpain (calcium-dependent protease) are the effectors of the calcium-induced neuronal cell damage ( Sun and Windebank, 1996). Administration of ethosuximide (T type channel calcium channel blocker) and gabapentin (an antagonist of calcium channels containing \u03b12\u03b4 subunit) reduces paclitaxel and vincristine-evoked neuropathic pain (Xiao et al., 2007 and Flatters and Bennett, 2004). Paclitaxel is well known to increase the expression level of \u03b12\u03b4-1 mRNA in the selleck dorsal \nspinal cord (Xiao et al., 2007, Gauchan et al., 2009a, Gauchan et al., 2009b and Gauchan et al., 2009c). Accordingly, it is proposed that \u03b12\u03b4-1 subunit in the spinal dorsal horn and DRG is a main site of inhibitory action of gabapentin on paclitaxel-induced allodynia (Matsumoto et al., 2006). Siau and Bennett (2006) have demonstrated the attenuation of vincristine and paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain with drugs that decrease extracellular and intracellular calcium levels that included Selleck Adriamycin quin-2 and EGTA (membrane impermeable calcium chelators that preferentially chelate extracellular calcium with consequent decrease in calcium influx) along with TMB-8 (membrane permeable agent and attenuate calcium-induced intracellular rise in calcium). Both vincristine and paclitaxel affect calcium movement by acting on mitochondria membrane (Tari et al., 1986 and Kidd et al., 2002). Paclitaxel-evoked neuropathic pain is associated with an increased number of swollen, vacuolated mitochondria with severely disrupted cristae in sensory primary afferent axons (Flatters and \nBennett, 2006). Mitochondria have large buffering capacity and hence, play a key role in intracellular calcium homeostasis. Impaired all mitochondrial calcium uptake or increased leakage of mitochondrial calcium may be responsible for increased propagation of calcium signals and thus, calcium-dependent processes in vincristine and paclitaxel-induced pain. It is in contrast to suramin-induced pain in which the entry of extracellular calcium is more important as compared to intracellular release of calcium in inducing neuropathy indicating the difference in pathogeneic mechanisms depending on the type of anti-cancer agent.

While some had completely defaulted, others are owing sizeable balance of the money. \nThe investigation further revealed that 32,305 houses were captured by the Committee on the Sale of Government Properties while 24,345 were eventually sold to beneficiaries. \nHowever, civil servants in some government agencies notably OHSCF and the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) have allegedly turned the policy into a shoddy business with the aim of defrauding the federal government. \nICPC also found out that some public servants and government agencies were concealing government properties and collecting rent on same without the consent of the federal government, which allegedly flouts the intent of the policy that primarily focuses on divesting government\u2019s interest from providing housing for its employees. \nFurther discovery by ICPC has shown that staff in OHSCF allocated some of the houses to undeserving beneficiaries who were not public servants at the time of the exercise and some of the properties are yet to be allocated. \nThe investigation has so far yielded fruitful result with the recovery of N18, 031,000 from some civil servants and a host of companies including Montgomery & Campbell Ltd and SICCONS, which has been paid into the coffers of the government. ICPC assures Nigerians that anyone found guilty of contravening the law would be charged to court upon conclusion of the investigation.  \nEnjoy Reading and Share This Story ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "olusegun obansanjo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "icpc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "office of the head of civil service of the federation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montgomery & campbell ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal housing authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal capital territory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fha", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ohcsf", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:48.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "92db08ab07215c12aa03f5db604d51b2c3ec3b72", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqa1FEjeW2baoziLEWcOYh3gZPPuzba.O_u6oL8tf8PTw4sW0L0KC3qcCaTThWJ0lZlk4maDS3VaqDYWzT075O8wJ0X7ZL7.mbDBtNQhfD_GL9VWfS.q2NNiu68s2Krhe9T_ugAC4Vhhy2bB2sdujxm", "site_full": "bizpr.us", "site": "bizpr.us", "site_section": "http://feeds2.feedburner.com/Bizprco", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BizPR.co", "title": "Operating Room Management Market Manufacturers, Current & Upcoming Trends, Analysis 2022", "title_full": "Operating Room Management Market Manufacturers, Current & Upcoming Trends, Analysis 2022", "published": "2017-12-07T12:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://bizpr.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/TMR-5.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "92db08ab07215c12aa03f5db604d51b2c3ec3b72", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqa1FEjeW2baoziLEWcOYh3gZPPuzba.O_u6oL8tf8PTw4sW0L0KC3qcCaTThWJ0lZlk4maDS3VaqDYWzT075O8wJ0X7ZL7.mbDBtNQhfD_GL9VWfS.q2NNiu68s2Krhe9T_ugAC4Vhhy2bB2sdujxm", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sagarj2", "published": "2017-12-07T12:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "Operating Room Management Market Manufacturers, Current & Upcoming Trends, Analysis 2022", "text": "December 7, 2017 Business & Professional Services Press Release No comments In the present times, there is an increased emphasis in the hospitals on controlling costs, to increase the overall efficiency of the operating rooms and offer world class infrastructure in the operating rooms.

BREAKING DOWN 'Public Sector Net Borrowing' \nPublic sector net borrowing is equal to the UK government's expenditures minus its total receipts. If this number is positive, the country is running a fiscal deficit ; a negative number represents a fiscal surplus. The figures are not seasonally adjusted or adjusted for inflation . \nBritain's Office of National Statistics issues an estimate of the public sector net borrowing each month. This statistic is often used by forex traders to determine the fundamental health of the British economy and currency. \nThe British government has run a budget deficit in most months in recent years, though post-crisis austerity policies have caused its net debt to fall from a peak above \u00a32.3 trillion (or 146% of GDP) in 2010 to less than \u00a32.1 trillion (102%) in the third quarter of 2017. In the campaign for the June 2017 general election, all major parties advocated decreasing public sector net borrowing.

a rise of 11 per cent.\nBut over the same period, the number of homeowners has slumped, while social housing is at a record low.\nAccording to the survey, the percentage of households who rent privately has grown from five per cent in 1999 to 15 per cent last year.\nTwo-fifths of people who are not already on the property ladder think they will never get a foot on the first rung, largely because of the decline in house building and tougher mortgage rules.\nHouse prices in Scotland have also continued to rise and the average of \u00a3149,185, an increase of almost five per cent from the previous year.\nREAD MORE: Herald View -

The apology received mostly applause and a few vocal jeers by the public attendees. \nIn his statement, he said: \n\u201cI apologize to Council, I take responsibility for the accusations that I was accused of doing, and I apologize to (my fellow Council members) for, I guess, some of the bloggers on social media that decided to put you guys in the midst of my business and everybody\u2019s past is their own so whatever I\u2019ve done, you guys shouldn\u2019t be caught in the middle because that had nothing to do with you guys. So as I always tell the kids I work with, take responsibility for your actions, and I will do that. I apologize to my family, friends and supporters and I appreciate the Lorain Police for doing their job. I don\u2019t expect them to do anything but their job and if I offended anyone I apologize. So thank you.\u201d \nAccording to the police report, when police arrived Saturday morning, Arroyo, smelled of alcohol, and claimed he was run over by the person in the house on Jenee Drive, Alberto Calo, and wanted to confront him. Officers reportedly offered to park Arroyo\u2019s vehicle in a safe place and give him a ride home, but Arroyo insisted that he didn\u2019t want to leave. \nCalo, Arroyo\u2019s friend, told police they were celebrating Arroyo\u2019s Dec. 2 birthday at Diso\u2019s Bistro on Oberlin Avenue when Arroyo allegedly became heavily intoxicated and wanted to drive home. Calo took Arroyo\u2019s keys to prevent him from driving, and Arroyo then jumped on the hood of Calo\u2019s car in an effort to get his keys back, the report said. Calo told police he had to drag Arroyo away from the front of his car so he wouldn\u2019t get run over and Arroyo got road rash on his legs. Calo then handed the keys to Arroyo\u2019s wife and left, the report said. Arroyo later showed up at Calo\u2019s front door trying to get him to come outside, but Calo wanted him to leave, the report said. The councilman later reportedly showed the injury to police as proof he was run over. \nBecause of his alleged lack of cooperation and refusal to leave, police told Arroyo he was under arrest for disorderly conduct, the report said. \nArroyo was put in handcuffs but allegedly pulled away from the officerfs when they brought over to the police cruiser, the report said. Arroyo allegedly refused to get in the car, so the two officers forced him inside, but Arroyo allegedly began kicking the windows of the police cruiser, the report said. \nOn the way inside the jail, the report said, Arroyo tried to run while in handcuffs but was quickly caught and taken into the jail, where he repeatedly kicked the cell door and refused to cooperate. He was later released from jail about 11 a.m. Saturday. \nBarry Kniceley, a resident of 31st Street in the ward Arroyo represents, witnessed Arroyo\u2019s statement at the meeting and said he thought the apology was more than adequate. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a personal thing, he doesn\u2019t really owe anybody anything other than the fact that he abused some of his privileges,\u201d He said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to get on his hands and knees to beg for forgiveness.\u201d \nKniceley also hopes Arroyo learns from his mistakes after this weekend.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "d-6th ward", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angel arroyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arroyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jenee drive", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alberto calo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kniceley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barry kniceley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lorain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diso\u2019s bistro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jenee drive", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oberlin avenue", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:49.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "19cf9eedc06ad1b04a2df938ef17c872a2dd0dbe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWZ5Qwe35OYZIMOsW6fut9dFEfao0KOtyO9vz_rSNN2QDJFPZDIyYnbhuWKyl5hFk-", "site_full": "www.blowoutforums.com", "site": "blowoutforums.com", "site_section": "https://www.blowoutforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=30", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "FOOTBALL BUY/SELL/TRADE -

Image credit: Claudia Stocker VividBiology. Abderrahmane Kaidi, MRC New Investigator and Senior Lecturer; Alice Sherrard, PhD student. \nBRISTOL,   University of Bristol research has revealed how cells rebuild their nucleus and organise their genome when they divide \u2013 a discovery which could have major implications for understanding cancer and degeneration. \nWhen cells divide, they need to rebuild their nucleus and organise their genome. New collaborative research from the University of Bristol demonstrates how cells achieve this through the unexpected deployment of filamentous actin (F-actin) to the nucleus. \nThe research, published online in Nature Cell Biology , provides the first evidence that actin polymerisation in the nucleus helps in reshaping the nucleus and reorganising the genome after cell division (mitosis). \nIn mammals, including humans, the cell nucleus packages and protects the genome. When human cells divide, the nucleus is dissembled to allow segregation of the chromosomes. Once chromosome segregation is complete, new cells need to re-build their nucleus and organise their genome. This process, although essential for life, was poorly understood. \nAlice Sherrard co-first author of this study and a PhD student with Dr Abderrahmane Kaidi, developed and implemented complementary and interdisciplinary methods to visualise nuclear structure and genome organisation after cells division. In so doing, Alice revealed that disruption of the formation of F-actin results in cells failing to expand their nuclear volume as well as their inability to de-compact their genome. Because of these defects, cells become inefficient in retrieving genetic information encoded in their DNA; thus, they divide slower. \nPrincipal investigator Dr Abderrahmane Kaidi , a specialist in cancer biology at the University of Bristol\u2019s School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, says this discovery advances our fundamental knowledge of genome regulation in space and time, and could have major implications in understanding cancer and degeneration. \n\u201cThis research highlights the importance of the spatiotemporal control of genome organisation for normal cells function, and we continue to define the principals that regulate these processes and their impact on cancer and degeneration,\u201d said Dr Kaidi. \nFurther information \nThis collaborative study is funded by Human Frontiers Science Program, Medical Research Council and Wellcome Trust; and benefited greatly from the Bristol Wolfson Bioimaging (Biomedical Sciences), and the Bristol Electron Microscopy Unit (Chemistry). \nSOURCE: University of Bristol \nMEDIA CONTACT", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaidi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alice sherrard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abderrahmane kaidi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "claudia stocker", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of bristol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nature cell biology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medical research council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of bristol media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "human frontiers science program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bristol wolfson bioimaging (biomedical sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wellcome trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of bristol\u2019s school of cellular", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bristol electron microscopy unit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bristol", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:50.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2ff36adf96861d7742bf588f43c9c02b2f55caad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8lgm.tFNxx3lTFBrxof0y_.cjVF78zwyocylNRLegFyA--", "site_full": "www.aqarcity.com", "site": "aqarcity.com", "site_section": "http://www.aqarcity.com/f60.html", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "\u0639\u0642\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0646", "title": "\u0641\u0631\u0635\u0647 \u0627\u0645\u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u062e\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0648 \u0628\u0633\u0639\u0631 \u062e\u064a\u0627\u0644\u0649", "title_full": "\u0641\u0631\u0635\u0647 \u0627\u0645\u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u062e\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0648 \u0628\u0633\u0639\u0631 \u062e\u064a\u0627\u0644\u0649", "published": "2017-12-07T20:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.25, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 25464, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2ff36adf96861d7742bf588f43c9c02b2f55caad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8lgm.tFNxx3lTFBrxof0y_.cjVF78zwyocylNRLegFyA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mshafik1", "published": "2017-12-07T20:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "\u0641\u0631\u0635\u0647 \u0627\u0645\u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u062e\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0648 \u0628\u0633\u0639\u0631 \u062e\u064a\u0627\u0644\u0649", "text": "## The most powerful offers in Dubai ###\n** For Arab and foreign investors on the occasion *\n** The Emirates national day to our brothers God sustains their pride and glory and keen their country *\n** Villas with a deduction of 150 thousand dirhams and delivery of 2018\n4 rooms and 5 rooms and 6 rooms\n** Apartments delivery 2018 with a discount of 1% in the city of Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Boulevard and the Dubai Water Canal\n** Villas ready for delivery at prices starting from 2 million 650 thousand dirhams special discount (3-4-5-6) rooms\n** Apartments ready to receive immediately and some within two months and until the second quarter 2018 more than the area of Dubai with a very special discount\n(Studio -

He grew out his hair and his beard and wore the shortened trousers required by the extremists. He forced himself to witness the beheadings and stonings, so he could hear killers call out the names of the condemned and their supposed crimes. \nBy night, anonymously from his darkened room, Mosul Eye told the world what was happening. If caught, he too would be executed. \nBut after more than three years, his double life has grown too heavy to bear. He misses his name. \nHis secrets consume him, sap energy he\u2019d rather use for his doctoral dissertation and for helping Mosul rebuild. In conversations with The Associated Press, he agonized over how to end the anonymity that plagues him. He made his decision. \nMosul Eye is Omar Mohammed, historian, scholar, blogger. He is 31. \nThe revelation of his identity is for his thousands of readers and followers, for all his volunteers in Mosul who have been inspired by a man they have never seen. But above all, it is for the brother who died in the final battle and for his grieving mother. \n\u201cI can\u2019t be anonymous anymore. This is to say that I defeated ISIS. You can see me now, and you can know me now,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \nMohammed first posted about the Islamic State group under his own Facebook account, in the first few days after its fighters swept into Mosul, but a friend told him he risked being killed. So in those first days he made himself a promise: trust no one, document everything. \nA newly minted teacher with a reputation for secular ideas, he had lost his university job. \nHe found another calling. \n\u201cMy job as a historian requires an unbiased approach which I am going to adhere to and keep my personal opinion to myself,\u201d he wrote on that first day, June 18, 2014. \nMosul Eye became one of the outside world\u2019s main sources of news about the Islamic State fighters, their atrocities and their transformation of the city into a grotesque shadow of itself. \nDuring Friday sermons, Mohammed feigned enthusiasm. He collected propaganda to post online later. He drank tea at the hospital, fishing for information. \nMuch of what he collected went on the blog. Other details he kept in his computer, for fear of giving away his identity. Someday, he promised, he would write history with them. \nThe most sensitive details initially came from two old friends: a doctor and a high school dropout who had joined an Islamic State intelligence unit. \nMohammed\u2019s information sometimes included photos of the fighters and commanders, complete with biographies surreptitiously pieced together during the course of his normal life \u2014 that of an out-of-work scholar living at home. \n\u201cI used the two characters, the two personalities to serve each other,\u201d he said. He expanded into a Facebook page and a Twitter feed to parcel out information at a time when little news was escaping. \nIntelligence agencies made contact as well and he rebuffed them. \n\u201cI am not a spy or a journalist,\u201d he would say. \u201cI tell them this: If you want the information, it\u2019s published and it\u2019s public for free. Take it.\u201d \nIn March 2015, his catalogue of horrors got to him. \n\u201cI was super ready to die,\u201d Mohammed said. \u201cI was so tired of worrying about myself, my family, my brothers. I am not alive to worry, but I am alive to live this life. I thought: I am done.\u201d \nHe cut his hair short, shaved his beard and pulled on a bright red sweater. His closest friend joined him. \nThey drove to the banks of the Tigris blasting forbidden music. They shared a carafe of tea. Heedless of people picnicking nearby, Mohammed lit a cigarette\u2014 banned by IS. Somehow, incredibly, he wasn\u2019t caught. \n\u201cAt that moment I felt like I was given a new life.\u201d \nHe resumed what he had taken to calling his duty. He grew out his hair and beard, put the shortened trousers back on. \nHe tested out different voices, Christian, Muslim. Sometimes he indicated he was gone, other times that he was still in the city. \nFinally, after leaving Mosul a thousand times in his mind, he decided it was time to get out. \n\u201cI think I deserve life, deserve to be alive.\u201d \nA smuggler agreed to sneak him out for $1,000. Mohammed left the next day, the contents of his computer transferred overnight to a hard-drive that he packed with him. \nNo one gave him a second look during the two days and some 500 kilometres (300 miles) it took to reach Turkey. \nOnce there, Mosul Eye kept at it: via WhatsApp and Viber, from Facebook messages and long conversations with friends and relatives who had contacts within IS. From hundreds of kilometres away, his life remained consumed by events back home. \nBy mid-2016, deaths were piling up faster than he could record. The Islamic State group was on a hunt for traitors and the airstrikes were taking an increasing toll on everyone. His records grew haphazard, and he turned to Twitter to document the atrocities. In February 2017, he received asylum in Europe. \nOnly after his elder brother Ahmed was killed in a mortar strike and IS was gone from the city did Mohammed reveal his secret to a younger brother \u2014 who greeted the news with a shock of pride and happiness. His sibling spoke on condition of anonymity from his refuge in Iraq because he was fearful for his life. \n\u201cPeople in Mosul had lost hope and confidence in politicians, in everything,\u201d his brother said. Mosul Eye \u201cmanaged to show that it\u2019s possible to change the situation in the city and bring it back to life.\u201d Join the conversation Sign in to comment (not connected to your Insider Club login).
