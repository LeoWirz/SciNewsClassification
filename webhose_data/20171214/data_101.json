No other console has attained these many sales in such a short amount of time, not even the Playstation PS4. A Nintendo Switch experience centre. Reuters. \nAt the rate, Nintendo's Switch is being sold it may soon overtake PS4's lifetime sales of 5.5 million units in Japan claims a report by gamingbolt. \nThe early gaming library of Switch was quite Japan-centric like Yakuza 0, Persona 5, Tales of Berseria , and Final Fantasy 15, and this, in turn, spurned a massive amount of sales, said the report. \nThe Switch is a portable console that also plugs into the TV. Think of it like a tablet with a TV dock and dedicated controllers.The tablet portion of the console features a 6.2-inch capacitive touch-screen with an HD resolution (1280x720). You get 32GB of onboard storage, which is expandable via microSD card, a battery that Nintendo claims will give you between 2.5 hours to 6.5 hours of continuous gaming. \nEarlier last year, Nintendo was sued by hardware maker Gamevice who claimed the Joy-Con controller design was too similar to its own products. Gamevice also claimed that Nintendo's designs infringe on their patents.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gamevice", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nintendo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "yakuza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berseria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joy-con", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:15:47.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a553bb53be03376632c75dfa5b789c14a13417a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMlxgxZF9fwmq77tvt4Ptc78Smi5Te05MlHw2macxs07VeoxSbsDWF5aLf56VqvxyW2Yw2CaGMdGCOtVovROPx3OegnyRtnUPwXW8ZcPCoaYo0UmcxJzcgwGVipGdK2Z7l.tuuw_0s_NVA", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "[MechWarrior/BATTLETECH] THURSDAY (DEC-07) OOSIK END-OF-YEAR BASH!

We want online payments to be smooth and without any delay. Therefore, ICICI Bank has been roped in as a banker for e-NAM,\" the official told PTI. \nICICI Bank will enable BHIM (Bharat Interface for Money) and Unified Payments Interface (UPI) on the e-NAM portal for making cashless payments, the official added. The effort is to provide seamless experience for making online payment of trade and services undertaken on the e-NAM platform. \nAt present, 470 mandis across 14 states are live and 90 commodities are being traded on e-NAM platform, which was launched in April 2016. The target is to connect 585 mandis with e-NAM by March 2018. \nIn the first phase, farmers are trading agri-produce via e-NAM portal within a mandi though the government's aim is to allow e-trading between mandis within the state and later between mandis of two states. \nThe e-NAM model aims at revolutionising agri markets by ensuring better price discovery, bringing in transparency and competition to enable farmers to get improved remuneration for their produce moving towards 'One Nation, One Market'. \nPublished Date: Dec 07, 2017 02:23 pm | Updated Date: Dec 07, 2017 02:30 pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "icici bank", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "agriculture ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bharat interface for money", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "upi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:15:47.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "415a4764ee4347d9ceea811e55b2f6207215c979", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6_8ATcbWgqoFEoFP0QO28OnjEntiYOUhnrUqtqBiTLB4Iq0pT9kUbrlbJMhZNmKSYo2hwxG_iC9Anmt7Uj_eIPZmGrdwXTCUNxoIdgMvbbR5vvM6BgzuLbplVgKBUHNGKA4MwV2H1_Lc", "site_full": "community.babycenter.com", "site": "babycenter.com", "site_section": "http://community.babycenter.com/groups/a20785/got-twins?scid=Android_MPBT_Referral&pg=3", "site_categories": ["pregnancy", "family_and_parenting"], "section_title": "Got Twins? - Page 3 - BabyCenter", "title": "How did having Twins effect your relationship?

I think it will definitely test you as a couple. My husband have been together 6 years as well before we had our twins. We traveled, partied we were free with the only responsibility of each other. So when the twins arrived we were definitely hit with the reality that everything including us a a couple & individually. We were so sleep deprived that made us so moody & aggravated with each other that we would take things out on each other. I would feel so much resentment towards my husband because he would go to work & I'd stay home with the twins. I would so angry at him because je would take a break from the chaos at home dealing with 2 screaming newborns & he would get adult interaction even though he would be working. Then he would come home & help with the twins & be tired. The 1st to 4 months were hell. You're going to hate each other, you're going to curse at each other you're going to want to leave each other. I'm here to say, its all normal. It wouldnt be normal if you don't feel that way. It gets very real to the point you don't even realize you can ever get so mad at someone you love so much. Limits will be tested. I thought the same thing, we're going to be closer together because of these 2 little bundle of joy but it gets very real. I'm not here to scare you, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. The bottom line is we're humans & things will affect us in defferent ways. Try to get as much sleep & rest as you can, trust me it goes a long way. Be around family & friends as much as possible it helps especially when you go through postpartum it affects your mood as well. Try to come up with a shcedule where you & your husband can work together. For instancr my husband would stay up with them at night since he would come home late from work & let me sleep, & then I would take them during the day & let him sleep in & it help us a lot as a couple. Don't take what other says personal, you're going to be new at this but you're in together. Be each others team mate, be each others support system & work together & keep on loving each other. I promis you it gets easier & its worth it & when you come out of tbe first few months which are the hardest, you will feel closer to each other. Don't give up on each other & go out as a family.

Thank you!\nNever saw the option to fly in to Sihanoukville from Kuala Lumpur as we were going to be in either Kuala Lumpur or Singapore before cambodia. This makes the route a lot easier. :D\nConsidering that, should we add another destination to our itinerary? e.g Kampot or kep? maybe even rabbit Island? Would Rabbit island be best as a day trip or a place to stay the night?\nMy rough idea of the itinerary is this right now:\n1) 3 days, Sihanoukville\n2) 3-4 days Kampot, Kep, Rabbit island (Koh Tonsay)\n3) 2 days Phnom Penh\n4) 4-5 days Siem reap and Koh Ker\nIs this disproportioned? Would you do anything different?\nRegarding the day trip you did to Koh Ker BaldricandBaddles, how did you organize that? Was it a private tour with a tour company? Or was it just a driver for a day that brought to the places but maybe didn't even know much about them? If so, are there local guides to show you around and tell about the history and anything like that in English?\nWe will most likely stay in a hostel so maybe we strike lucky and find some people that will share the cost but it's not the end of the world if we have to stretch our pockets for such a trip because I'm sure it'll be worth it.\nThank you again!\n/Patrik\nOne destination mentioned in this post 1 Kuala Lumpur Wilayah Persekutuan, Malaysia", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:15:47.036+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a553bb53be03376632c75dfa5b789c14a13417a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMlxgxZF9fwmq77tvt4Ptc78Smi5Te05MlHw2macxs07VeoxSbsDWF5aLf56VqvxyW2Yw2CaGMdGCOtVovROPx3OegnyRtnUPwXW8ZcPCoaYo0UmcxJzcgwGVipGdK2Z7l.tuuw_0s_NVA", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "[MechWarrior/BATTLETECH] THURSDAY (DEC-07) OOSIK END-OF-YEAR BASH!

Dec, 07 2017 14:21:56 IST \nSydney : Suspended all-rounder Ben Stokes was included on Thursday in England's squad for their one-day series against Australia, with coach Trevor Bayliss bracing for \"a circus\" if he is cleared to play. \nStokes is currently banned from international cricket while British authorities probe his alleged involvement in a late-night fight outside a Bristol nightclub, and it remained in doubt whether he would play. File image of England's suspended all-rounder Ben Stokes. AFP \nBatsman Alex Hales, who was caught up in the same fracas, was also named in the 16-man squad for the five-game series, starting in Melbourne on 14 January. \nSelectors said in a statement they were advised to name their strongest squad, and picked the pair accordingly. \n\"Both Alex Hales and Ben Stokes are included, though their involvement remains subject to any relevant legal or disciplinary developments in relation to the incident in Bristol in September,\" they said. \nBayliss admitted Stokes' potential appearance in Australia could be a distraction for the team. \n\"Whenever he comes back that's going to be a bit of a circus for sure,\" he told reporters after England lost the second Test in Adelaide on Wednesday. \n\"Whether it's any more of a circus than it's already been, it's hard to say. If it happens, let's just get on with it and take it on the chin.\" \nHe added, \"We've got to adjust to that at some stage.\" \nNew Zealand-born Stokes did not travel to Australia with the rest of the squad for the Ashes Test series, and has missed the first two in Brisbane and Adelaide, with England losing both. \nBut speculation that he is preparing for a dramatic call-up was fuelled by his decision to sign with New Zealand provincial side Canterbury as their overseas player in late November. \nIn his first limited overs match for his birth province against Otago, he was bowled for two. \nHe did better against Auckland on Wednesday, hitting 34 from 41 deliveries as he shakes off the rust. \nNo idea \nStokes could yet return mid-series to the Ashes if police decide not to charge him. \nBritish detectives late last month passed a file to the Crown Prosecution Service for a decision, but there has been no word since. \n\"I've got absolutely no idea. Still waiting for the police report,\" said Bayliss when asked if he expected Stokes to play in the Ashes. \nThe England Cricket Board said in their statement Thursday that once they receive formal confirmation on whether Stokes has been charged or not, they would meet within 48 hours to decide the next step. \nHales, an opener who has not played any professional cricket since the September nightclub incident, learned this week that he will face no criminal charges, opening the door for his trip to Australia. \nIn addition to Stokes and Hales, Kent batsman Sam Billings and Durham seamer Mark Wood were added to the squad that beat the Windies 4-0 in the one-day series held in England at the end of the British summer. \n\"With around 18 months to the start of the 2019 World Cup, our ODI side continues to make solid progress with series wins over the Windies and South Africa last summer and a semi-final berth in the Champions Trophy,\" said selector James Whitaker. \n\"The forthcoming series against Australia presents another significant opportunity for this group to showcase their skills and talent against a quality side away from home.\" \nEngland one-day squad : Eoin

"text": "Tweet \nNew Delhi: As the pre-budget consultations of stakeholders begin with the Finance Minister before the mega announcement next month, it comes as no surprise that India Inc again wants to draw the government\u2019s attention to high rates of tax on corporate incomes. And wants corporation tax lowered. This appeal comes just when the United States has pledged to reduce tax on corporate earnings to 20 percent and the UK is already following the lower tax practice. \nThis piece in The Statesman says the US senate has passed a bill which will slash corporation tax from 39 percent to 20 percent, nearly halving the levy. \nShould India then remain an outlier in the global landscape where corporation tax rates are progressively coming down to encourage local manufacturing? Or should we be asking ourselves whether there needs to be another \u201cgiveaway\u201d to the rich by the government, especially since India\u2019s high rates of corporation tax also subsume a host of incentives which substantially bring down the effective rate at which companies pay tax on income? \nLast year Prime Minister Narendra Modi had referred to this very phenomenon, when he compared concessions given to the poor and India Inc by saying the former is called \u2018subsidy\u2019 while the latter is termed as \u2018concession\u2019. Should the debate then be the quantum of subsidies which the government is willing to provide to the country\u2019s farmers, other economically backward people versus the concessions it is willing to offer to mega corporates? \nSome numbers first. Taxes that corporations pay account for more than a fourth of the government\u2019s total tax receipts in a year. In 2016-17, these collections accounted for almost 29 percent of the total tax receipts while Budget estimates for the current fiscal peg it at a little over 28 percent. That means close to 30 paise of every rupee the government earns from various taxes comes from the payments companies make for doing business. Budget estimates of corporation tax collections in FY18 stand at Rs 5.39 lakh crore versus revised estimates of Rs 4.94 lakh crore in FY17. Total tax revenue as per Budget estimates for the current fiscal is Rs 19.11 lakh crore versus Rs 17.03 lakh crore in FY17. Representational image. Reuters. \nNow, the subsidy math. India spends the largest amount on food subsidy which is estimates at Rs 1.45 lakh crore in the current fiscal as per Budget estimates, the highest in the last four years. Interest subsidies \u2013 the money the government spends for loans to farmers, housing for the poor, higher education and other social sector activities \u2013 is estimated to rise by over 23 percent this fiscal at Rs 23,204 crore so that total outgo on subsidies for the current fiscal is Rs 2.72 lakh crore versus Rs 2.6 lakh crore. That\u2019s an increase of over 4.6 percent. \nSo what this math shows is that while keeping corporation tax rates high, the government is mopping up more revenue than last year and is also simultaneously spending more on providing subsidy to the needy compared to last fiscal. Which means the \u2018either or\u2019 debate over corporation tax and subsidies is skewed. While the government\u2019s stated intention is to move away from certain subsidies and also do away with corporate exemptions, it may perhaps look at offering a lower tax regime to companies to ease their burden of doing business. \nLeading business chamber, the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII), has said in its pre-budget memorandum to the FM that reduction in corporation tax rate to 18 percent, including all surcharges and cess, would help India emerge as an attractive business destination and create jobs. According to direct tax experts, the headline rate for corporation tax is 35 percent which becomes 25 percent after a host of exemptions for companies with a turnover of upto Rs 50 crore. But remains more or less near the 30 percent mark for larger companies. What CII has sought is a substantial reduction. \nAnother apex business chamber, Ficci, has referred to the FM\u2019s earlier roadmap of bringing down corporate tax rates to 25 percent saying this promised has not yet been implemented across the board. The chamber stressed on the need to consider the impact of the Dividend Distribution Tax and the Buyback Tax, saying \u201cTogether with the basic corporate income tax, this pushes India\u2019s overall tax rate for companies well beyond 40 percent, which is quite high.\u201d \nGirish Vanvari , Partner and Head of Tax at KPMG, pointed out that government\u2019s tax collection should anyway be higher on account of GST. \u201cWith demonetisation and GST tax collections should go up eventually. This could create headroom for lowering corporation tax rates \u2013 which is the need of the hour in order to remain competitive in a world where tax rates are coming down\u201d. \nBut of course, the tax revenue bounty may not come in this fiscal and this alone may tie the government\u2019s hands. As this piece in Business Line says lower rate may be extended to companies with a turnover of Rs 100 crore while larger enterprises continue to be taxed at the highest slab. \nAs this piece in Business Standard explains, an overwhelming 80 percent of the total corporation tax revenue comes from large firms, which means the fiscal math will get affected if the government were to slash the rate by five percentage points, as per the industry\u2019s demand. Remember, each percentage point cut in corporation tax rate takes away Rs 17000-18000 crore revenue from the government\u2019s coffers. \nAll said and done, any cuts in corporation tax may happen only if GST collections are robust this year and the next. \nPublished Date: Dec 07, 2017 02:17 pm | Updated Date: Dec 07, 2017 02:19 pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Instant tea is a soluble type of tea powder that is either roasted or grounded in form. It has recently gained popularity over the traditional style of consuming tea as it is easier and quicker to prepare.

Its an old strategy thats used by Floor traders.\nWhat do you guys think about this strategy?\nCredit goes to Akuma99\nSnake-Eye Trading Method\nThis method applies the same techniques used by the professional Floor Traders and is based around what a 5 minute bar is indicating at any given time.\nChart Set Up\nSet up and refer to these three charts only, no others:\n5 minute bar chart:\nSet with a 8 period simple moving average set at \u0093low\u0094 and 10 period simple moving average set \u0093high\u0094 \u0096 configured with bars. This is the main chart used to look for trade set-ups.\n15 minute bar chart:\nConfigured the same as 5 minute. This chart is mainly used to determine trend direction and is not to trade from.\nMoving Averages\nThese are used to assist with determining the strength, weakness or neutrality of the market and which direction to play it.\nWhen the price is trading above the 10 moving average line on the 5-minute chart, with at least one full price bar having closed above and sitting on top of the line, this indicates strength, signaling potential upside and possibly a long trade forming.\nWhen the price is trading below the 8 moving average line on the 5-minute chart, with at least one full price bar having closed below and fully formed below the line, this indicates weakness, signaling potential downside and possibly a short trade forming.\nWhenever the price bars trade above the 10 moving average line or below the 8 moving average line on the 15-minute chart, this is a stronger confirmation of direction than when on the 5-minute chart.\nTrend Direction\nIt is important to know this at all times, as you must always trade in the direction of the trend, never against it. Trend direction is mainly determined by reference to the 15-minute bar chart and where the price bars are trading in reference to the 8 and 10 moving averages, as previously\nexplained.\nThe direction in which the moving average lines are pointing on both the 5-minute and15-minute charts is a good visual reference for determining trend direction. There may be an obvious trend direction established for the day, but short-term trend changes will inevitably occur and will be indicated by changes in the direction the moving average lines form, either pointing up, down or sideways.\nAnother indicator is that whenever the moving average lines on the 5- minute and 15-minute charts start to narrow, coming closer together; this often signals a change in direction is about to occur. This is generally followed by them widening again to form what looks like the shape of a\nmouth, prior to the change.\nThe Set-Up\nTo recognize a good set-up, you must first develop a \u0093feel\u0094 for the market and the market flow.\nGo back to basics and literally forget all you have learned. Cast aside all of your indicators and simply watch the 5-minute bars, their behavior, formations and patterns.\nFurther training is required to accurately and consistently recognize the correct set-ups. However, the principal of the method relies on the current 5-minute bar\u0092s inability to take out the previous bar (or bars) high for a \u0093short\u0094 set-up and inability to take out a low in the case of a \u0093long\u0094 set\u0096up.\nWith experience and a high degree of concentration in watching the price activity during the formation of the current 5-minute bar, the immediate, short-term direction of the market can be determined with an uncanny accuracy.\nBy observing and counting the number of times the current price bar pushes in it\u0092s attempt to take out the high or low of the previous bar (or bars), can provide a clue as to who is in control the buyers or the sellers.\nFor example, if the price bar ticker pushes and pushes upwards at the top of the bar, failing to get any higher and is unable to take out the immediate, previous highs and then closes, it signals that it has hit resistance at this level and that the buyers are drying up and losing control. If the buyers have dried up, then the path of least resistance is down, as the sellers have now taken over control. This is a time to sell, as prices and the market are going down.\nThe same holds true when the price bar ticker pushes and pushes downwards at the bottom of the bar, failing to break through and getting support, indicating no more sellers, so the price is likely to reverse and go up. This is a time to buy as the market reverses; gains strength and prices start to immediately increase\nThe ratio of buyers to sellers is what determines the market direction at any given time. If you see a possible set-up forming, never take your eyes off the bar, or you will miss the message it is giving you you must watch it very closely. As soon as you have made the decision that it is a set-up, don\u0092t hesitate, don\u0092t wait, get in and take the trade.\nLong Set\u0096Up\nTo take a long trade (buy), the price bars must be trading above the 10 moving average line on the 5-minute chart, which indicates strength. At least one price bar must be fully formed, closed and sitting above on top of the line to allow a conservative trade \u0096 2 bars for a more conservative trade.\nShort Set-Up\nTo take a short trade (sell), the price bars must be trading below the 8 oving average line on the 5-minute bar chart, which indicates weakness. At least one price bar must be fully formed, closed and sitting below the line to allow a conservative trade \u0096 2 bars for a more conservative trade.\nStop Loss\nAs soon as a trade is entered into, immediately place a stop loss order for whatever amount suits your personal risk tolerance. The method allows at least 2 points. This is very important for peace of mind and to limit your downside risk.\nOnce your trade is a few points profitable, it may be possible to move your stop to breakeven, but care should be taken to avoid being stopped out too soon and possibly causing you to miss a good run.\nExiting the Trade\nThis can vary and is often determined by each individual\u0092s personal experience, financial circumstances and risk tolerance. As a relatively inexperienced, student trader a conservative approach is to take 2, 3 or 4 points and button down a profit when it is there, even though the trade may go on to produce more points. You can never lose by taking a profit and in the early stages of trading; taking regular, small profits will build confidence. Experience and improved confidence will then allow you to stay in for the longer term and greater rewards.\nCongestion (choppy, chop)\nChop is a very difficult market to trade and should be avoided as soon as you realize it is in this phase. Never trade a choppy market. Whenever the price bars trade in a channel between the 8 and 10 moving averages,\nwithout seriously penetrating or staying above or below them, then the market is choppy. The price bars traverse up and down between or a little beyond the two moving averages.\nInevitably congestion follows trend and trend follows congestion, so whenever the market has gone into congestion, just be patient, sit it out and wait for the next trend breakout, it often provides a good move.\nIf you don\u0092t change today \u0096 your tomorrows will be like your yesterdays.\nGolden Rules\n\u0095 Never trade on a day when Greenspan is talking, or any major news, without lots of practice till you learn how to trade that volatility.\n\u0095 Forget all that you have learned from seminars and books \u0096 scrap all of your indicators and do not look at 1 or 3 min charts.\n\u0095 Never trade against the trend. \u0094The trend\u0092s your friend\u0094, so only trade with it.\n\u0095 Never trade in a choppy market - congestion.\n\u0095 Always place a stop loss order (Use a trailing stop loss).\n\u0095 Never try to pick tops and bottoms \u0096 let the market tell you where it wants to go.\n\u0095 Don\u0092t overtrade, 1\u00963 good trades per day is enough.\n\u0095 Don\u0092t be greedy.\n\u0095 Don\u0092t have any distractions, TV, telephone, people etc. while you are trading.\n\u0095 Manage your money \u0096 take all profits out of your trading account at the end of each month. This way your trading account does not grow too large and may just prevent you from taking impulsive, foolish trades due to over- confidence.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:15:48.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "efec69d78df3647ca37dbdc86bdbad5d1e55e5a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.4bjr.GKg00VMX1R0PDf65IezWwBpMfPcVFgDzqx1utDEtoDU.f5FW0OrD6iUHM1VJxgssoBMHx_lLvek_j29ZadGYGLFX3Lo-", "site_full": "wawoodworking.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://wawoodworking.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Blog Woodworking Plans", "title": "diy wood shelf with hooks", "title_full": "diy wood shelf with hooks", "published": "2017-12-07T10:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/KFyEiqhYa0zKAkk6yQviPAwTmROuoCNCpYP5hYEock0y7sjhF_ShZUeh1Qa1w8wmaMHko07QwEesQ2hSQr9FRsbkjlShpPGpqiGC8EoiyXGoF1R-IttL_NY8RCzIFutsRbWyJXOfHRvgSJKTLNBPNE2SMRG8APA=w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "efec69d78df3647ca37dbdc86bdbad5d1e55e5a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.4bjr.GKg00VMX1R0PDf65IezWwBpMfPcVFgDzqx1utDEtoDU.f5FW0OrD6iUHM1VJxgssoBMHx_lLvek_j29ZadGYGLFX3Lo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "wawa (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "diy wood shelf with hooks", "text": "diy wood shelf with hooks   00.11 diy wood shelf with hooks Entryway shelf + hooks; anything can you explain how you put the shelf together and what you used. nails, wood adding hooks to a simple diy shelf turns it.

The 6-foot, 21", "text": "MILWAUKEE -- Golden State forward David Lee is making his presence felt and giving a team with many weapons another dimension. His play of late has reached All-Star calibre, Warriors coach Mark Jackson insisted after watching Lee lead Golden State to its 10th consecutive win Tuesday night, the Warriors longest streak since the 1975-76 season and one short of the franchise record of 11 wins in a row during the 1971-72 campaign. Fresh off of being named the Western Conference Player of the Week, Lee dominated around the basket, scoring 22 points on 10-of-12 shooting and grabbing 18 rebounds to spark the Warriors to a 101-80 win over the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday night. \"Ive said all along that (Stephen) Curry is an All-Star, theres no question about that. But the way that David Lee has played the last 15 ball games, hes an All-Star,\" Jackson said. \"He has separated himself.\" Lee hit his first nine shots from the field and recorded his 21st double-double of the season. \"Im trying to be more aggressive and I think our team needs me to be more aggressive in the paint,\" Lee said. \"We have so many guys that are good jump shooters, we need somebody around the rim thats going to attack the basket. Its all about taking what the defence gives us. Most importantly, I think our team is playing more consistent basketball.\" Curry contributed 15 points for the Warriors despite connecting on just 5 of 18 shots. Klay Thompson also scored 15 points, on 6-of-18 shooting. \"Were not built offensively, were built defensively,\" Jackson said. \"You can have off nights offensively and still win ball games. We defended at a high level and when you do that good things happen.\" Golden State centre Andrew Bogut, who had 12 rebounds and eight points, said he and Lee stress the importance of rebounding each time they take the court. Golden State outrebounded Milwaukee 54 to 37. \"We set a goal, David and myself, to win the rebound battle,\" Bogut said. The Warriors played their sixth game of a seven-city road trip that concludes Wednesday night in Brooklyn. Golden State is trying to become the first team in NBA history to go undefeated on a road trip of seven or more games. \"Its this close so were going to chase history,\" Jackson said. \"My guys have paid the price and Im incredibly proud of them.\" Golden State led by just two at the half against the Bucks, who have the NBAs worst record. The Warriors broke open the game with a 23-7 run to start the third quarter, highlighted by a step-back 3-pointer from the corner by Curry. Later in the quarter, Curry hit an acrobatic reverse layup while being fouled, extending Golden States lead to 19. The Warriors led 79-68 heading into the fourth. A 3 by O.J. Mayo cut Golden States margin to eight to start the fourth, but the Warriors quickly built the lead back to double digits and cruised to victory. The Warriors led by as many as 22 late in the fourth. Ersan Ilyasova had 20 points and Brandon Knight 18 for the Bucks. \"(The Warriors) have a lot of weapons and can beat you in a number of ways,\" Bucks coach Larry Drew said. \"I thought we did some good things, but we didnt do it for the duration of the game. We had too many breakdowns, too many lapses and our margin for error is very small.\" Drew said he implored his team to play with high energy to start the second half, to no avail. \"We came out and were flat-lined. They got on a good run and we just couldnt overcome the deficit,\" Drew said. Energetic play needs to be a team goal, Knight said. \"It has to be all five guys that are on the court,\" he said. \"We have to have everybody playing with as much energy as we can.\" Milwaukee grabbed a 30-28 lead after the first quarter, sparked by Knights 10 points. Golden State opened the second quarter on a 10-0 run and went on to a 50-48 lead at the half. Golden State shot 55 per cent from the field in the half, despite connecting on only 4 of 14 3-point attempts. Knight had 13 first-half points for the Bucks and Ilyasova added 12. NOTES: Ilyasova sank his first 3-point attempt of the game. He entered having misfired on 20 consecutive 3s. . Bogut, a No. 1 overall pick of the Bucks in 2005, played his first game in Milwaukee since a March 2012 trade that sent him to Golden State. ... Drew said peace returned to the locker room following a dustup between teammates Larry Sanders and Gary Neal after Saturdays blowout loss at Phoenix. \"Were back in love with one another. Its a very emotional game and tempers do flare,\" Drew said. \"The most important thing is that there is no snowball effect. We make it an isolated incident.\" .

Turner, a 27-year-old native of Kamloops, British Columbia will be entering his sixth year in the NLL after spending the previous two campaigns with the Rush. The 6-foot, 210-pound lefty has recorded 81 career NLL points while playing with Edmonton, Philadelphia, Minnesota and San Jose. \"The Swarm organization is excited to once again welcome Alex Turner to Saint Paul,\" said Swarm Owner and Governor John Arlotta. &quoot;From his first stint at The Hive we have always liked Alex, and have seen him evolve as a player over the years. We expect him to add even more depth to our left-hand side, and believe he is ready to challenge for a roster spot within our forward corps. There should be some great competition on that left side come training camp.\" Turner is returning to the Swarm organization after playing one game with Minnesota in 2010, before being signed by the Wings the following season. During his single season in Philadelphia, Turner posted a career-high 39 points.

Several regions have already drawn up schemes and in January will start charging firms according to the amount of air, water and even noise pollution they produce. \nBut Hebei, a major source of hazardous and politically embarrassing emissions drifting across China\u2019s capital Beijing, is under heavy pressure to clean up and will levy higher rates of tax than other regions. \nAccording to draft regulations now being discussed by local lawmakers, firms in the cities of Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Langfang and Dingzhou will be charged as much as 6 yuan (Dh3.34; $0.91) for each unit of air pollution and 7 yuan for each unit of water pollution they produce, the local government said. \nThe highest permissible rate stands at 12 yuan and 14 yuan respectively, according to the law passed last year. \nCities and counties directly bordering Beijing will be forced to pay even higher rates, with major air pollutants like sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides charged at 9.6 yuan per unit. Major water pollutants like ammonium nitrate will be levied at 11.2 yuan per unit. \nUnits are calculated based on coefficients that assign weights to different pollution sources. A single unit is the equivalent of 16.7 kilograms of carbon monoxide or 0.95 kilograms of sulphur dioxide. \nNeighbouring Shanxi province, China\u2019s biggest coal producing region, also said this week that it would introduce an environmental protection tax starting from Jan. 1, 2018, with polluters paying 1.8 yuan per unit of air pollution and 2.1 yuan per unit of water pollution. \nThe province said it expected the new tax to raise 1.9 billion yuan next year, with the figure likely to decline steadily as firms gradually cut their emissions. \n\u2014Reuters", "highlightText": "",

A wide variety of products are offered by these vendors, ranging from cables to capacitors to transformers. Often, the vendors offer customized solutions in order to gain new demands. The report identifies Siemens AG, ABB Ltd., Hitachi Ltd., General Electric Co., Toshiba Corporation, Prysmian SpA, TransGrid Solutions Inc., ATCO Electric Ltd., and Abengoa S.A. as some of the most prominent companies currently operating in the global HVDC transmission system market.\nAs per the evaluations of the FMI report, a revenue of US$6,000 mn was generated by the market for high voltage direct current transmission system in 2016, which was in itself an increase of 7.7% in comparison to 2015. The report has estimated that over the forecast period of 2016 to 2026, the demand for HDVC transmission system will increment at a CAGR of 8.8% and the final valuation by 2026 would be US$14,400 mn. Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Nexans, NR Electric, American Semiconductor, HVDC Technologies, and LSIS are some of the other notable players identified by the report.\nRequest for Sample @ https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-1209 \nSome of the key factors augmenting the demand in the global HDVC transmission system market are: increasing demand for cost-effective solutions for long distance power transmission, decommissioning of nuclear and coal power plants, liberalization in the energy policies in Europe, and integration of VSC technology across grids enable system security. On the other hand, rise in the cost of components that affects the number of grid installations, requirement of high initial investment in grid infrastructure, need of uniformity in the standards of HDVC transmission equipment and systems, and controlling congestion and instability in HVDC systems are a few obstructions holding the prosperity of the global high voltage direct current transmission system market.\nNevertheless, the vendors operating in this market will gain new opportunities from favorable government policies, particularly for offshore wind transmission projects, emergence of hybrid HVDC circuit breaker, shift towards offshore renewable energy generation, and recent technological advances in HVDC transmission system.\nRequest for Table of Contents @ https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/toc/rep-gb-1209 \nBased on system component, the FMI report segments the global HVDC transmission system market into solutions and services. The solutions segment is further sub-segmented into AC and DC harmonic filters, converters, DC lines, circuit breakers, and others. Technology-wise, the market has been bifurcated into LCC, VSC, and others. On the basis of deployment, the market for HVDC transmission system has been classified into overhead, underground, subsea, and combination. Based on power rating, the market has been segmented into below 1,000 MWs, 1001 to 2000 MWs, and 2,001 MWs and above.\nGeographically, the report takes stock of the potential of high voltage direct current transmission system market in the regions of North America, Latin America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific except Japan (APEJ), and the Middle East and Africa (MEA) and in the country of Japan. While North America is highly lucrative region and Europe will continue to pose widespread opportunities owing to increasing number of grid connections, the APEJ region is expected to turn highly lucrative on the back of the emerging economies of India and China.\nReport Overview @ https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/high-voltage-direct-current-hvdc-transmission-systems-market ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "atco electric ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siemens ag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fmi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vsc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prysmian spa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lcc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nr electric", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american semiconductor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "transgrid solutions inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lsis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "general electric co.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toshiba corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hitachi ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitsubishi electric corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abengoa s.a.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abb ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eastern europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "latin america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:15:50.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aa4376ca0bb41893133dddb911898b4c373360d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpMfouZbcTsqM3wju51VzJTB2wboWgHjp95EOtpc_cJlidmm6A4vt8f6oGhDkwocfeuDcdkTM.0P_ENjLaCES0", "site_full": "onehallyu.com", "site": "onehallyu.com", "site_section": "https://onehallyu.com/tags/forums/nogizaka46/", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "nogizaka46 -

warns Rohingya refugee crisis a \u2018grave security risk\u2019 ICG warns December 7, 2017 \nRefugees may \u2018shift to cross-border attacks\u2019 using Bangladesh as a base for recruitment and training \u2014 study \nYANGON: Prolonged displacement of Rohingya refugees in squalid Bangladeshi camps poses a \u201cgrave security risk\u201d, conflict analysts ICG warned Thursday, raising the spectre of militants recruiting among the displaced and launching cross-border attacks on Myanmar. \nRaids by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on August 25 sparked the vicious Myanmar army response which has forced more than 620,000 Rohingya to flee Rakhine state for Bangladesh. \nARSA \u201cappears determined to regroup and remain relevant\u201d and may draw on desperate Rohingya refugees languishing in camps for future operations, the ICG International Crisis Group said in the report. \nThe group may \u201cshift to cross-border attacks\u201d using Bangladesh as a base for recruitment and training, the study said, cautioning the risk of an ever-deepening cycle of violence is all too real. \n\u201cSuch attacks would have profoundly negative consequences,\u201d straining Myanmar-Bangladesh relations and worsening contempt for the Rohingya \u201cthat would further diminish prospects of an eventual refugee return\u201d. \nGlobal outcry over the refugee crisis, one of the worst in recent history, has triggered a hyper-defensive response inside the country, where anti-Rohingya attitudes have hardened since ARSA\u2019s emergence. \nMyanmar does not recognise the Rohingya as a distinct ethnic group eligible for citizenship, instead calling them \u201cBengali\u201d, suggesting they are illegal immigrants. \nIn another serious looming risk, ICG warned that Rohingya\u2019s plight has become a \u201ccause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre of the Muslim world\u201d with Al Qaida, Daesh and other global jihadi groups calling for attacks on Myanmar. \nMyanmar\u2019s military has repeatedly used the terror threat to justify its campaign in northern Rakhine state. \nARSA has distanced itself from any wider global cause for jihad, saying it is only fighting to protect Rohingya rights. \nInternational pressure is ratcheting up on Myanmar. \nThis week the UN rights chief said Myanmar\u2019s crackdown on the Rohingya showed possible \u201celements of genocide\u201d, as calls for the safe and sustainable repatriation of refugees grows. \nMyanmar refutes any wrongdoing saying it was forced into a defensive action by ARSA attacks. \nIt has agreed with Bangladesh to start repatriation of \u201celigible\u201d refugees within a few months. \nBut there are widespread doubts over how many Rohingya can prove they are entitled to return to Rakhine, or want to go back to areas riddled with communal mistrust and where their villages were razed. \nChina, a key strategic ally of Myanmar, is pitching itself as an arbiter in the crisis, and has repeatedly urged the international community to take a soft line on Myanmar. \nBut pressure is mounting in the West \u2014 particularly Washington \u2014 to reimpose targeted sanctions on Myanmar military figures. \nSanctions were slowly rolled back in recent years as reward for democratic gains after decades of outright junta rule. \nThe ICG study said any fresh sanctions would backfire by isolating Myanmar and calcifying hatred towards the Rohingya. \n\u2014 AFP", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name":

warns Rohingya refugee crisis a \u2018grave security risk\u2019 ICG warns December 7, 2017 \nRefugees may \u2018shift to cross-border attacks\u2019 using Bangladesh as a base for recruitment and training \u2014 study \nYANGON: Prolonged displacement of Rohingya refugees in squalid Bangladeshi camps poses a \u201cgrave security risk\u201d, conflict analysts ICG warned Thursday, raising the spectre of militants recruiting among the displaced and launching cross-border attacks on Myanmar. \nRaids by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on August 25 sparked the vicious Myanmar army response which has forced more than 620,000 Rohingya to flee Rakhine state for Bangladesh. \nARSA \u201cappears determined to regroup and remain relevant\u201d and may draw on desperate Rohingya refugees languishing in camps for future operations, the ICG International Crisis Group said in the report. \nThe group may \u201cshift to cross-border attacks\u201d using Bangladesh as a base for recruitment and training, the study said, cautioning the risk of an ever-deepening cycle of violence is all too real. \n\u201cSuch attacks would have profoundly negative consequences,\u201d straining Myanmar-Bangladesh relations and worsening contempt for the Rohingya \u201cthat would further diminish prospects of an eventual refugee return\u201d. \nGlobal outcry over the refugee crisis, one of the worst in recent history, has triggered a hyper-defensive response inside the country, where anti-Rohingya attitudes have hardened since ARSA\u2019s emergence. \nMyanmar does not recognise the Rohingya as a distinct ethnic group eligible for citizenship, instead calling them \u201cBengali\u201d, suggesting they are illegal immigrants. \nIn another serious looming risk, ICG warned that Rohingya\u2019s plight has become a \u201ccause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre of the Muslim world\u201d with Al Qaida, Daesh and other global jihadi groups calling for attacks on Myanmar. \nMyanmar\u2019s military has repeatedly used the terror threat to justify its campaign in northern Rakhine state. \nARSA has distanced itself from any wider global cause for jihad, saying it is only fighting to protect Rohingya rights. \nInternational pressure is ratcheting up on Myanmar. \nThis week the UN rights chief said Myanmar\u2019s crackdown on the Rohingya showed possible \u201celements of genocide\u201d, as calls for the safe and sustainable repatriation of refugees grows. \nMyanmar refutes any wrongdoing saying it was forced into a defensive action by ARSA attacks. \nIt has agreed with Bangladesh to start repatriation of \u201celigible\u201d refugees within a few months. \nBut there are widespread doubts over how many Rohingya can prove they are entitled to return to Rakhine, or want to go back to areas riddled with communal mistrust and where their villages were razed. \nChina, a key strategic ally of Myanmar, is pitching itself as an arbiter in the crisis, and has repeatedly urged the international community to take a soft line on Myanmar. \nBut pressure is mounting in the West \u2014 particularly Washington \u2014 to reimpose targeted sanctions on Myanmar military figures. \nSanctions were slowly rolled back in recent years as reward for democratic gains after decades of outright junta rule. \nThe ICG study said any fresh sanctions would backfire by isolating Myanmar and calcifying hatred towards the Rohingya. \n\u2014 AFP", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name":
