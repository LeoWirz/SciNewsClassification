He is one of the lawyers representing the Michigan public officials and residents challenging the law. \nCharney said that compares to just three percent of the white population. \nThe lawsuit charges that \"there is no question that Michigan's emergency manager laws have disproportionately impacted communities composed of African-descended populations,\" and that state officials \"would not have adopted PA 436 had it been likely to apply equally to majority-white communities.\" \nCharney said the law disempowers black communities by subjecting them to the rule of an unelected emergency manager. \n\"You're basically taking away residents of particular cities ability to elect their government,\" said Charney. \n\"For a concrete example of why unaccountable governmental officials can do real damage,\" Charney said. \"You have to look no further than the city of Flint.\" \nIn a previous case, the federal courts dismissed all but one challenge to Michigan's emergency manager law, allowing only the race discrimination claim to go forward. \nA spokesperson for Governor Rick Snyder, who is a named plaintiff, said he does not comment on litigation.

After its push for maritime linkages across the Indian Ocean, including naval exercises and port projects, and for the enhancement of regional connectivity through the Belt and Road Initiative, China seems to be ready to ramp up business ties across South Asia. China already has an FTA with Pakistan, and is exploring or negotiating FTAs with Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal.  The negotiations with the Maldives took about three years and were completed in September this year; it was ratified overnight by Parliament in Male. The agreement is expected to be signed this week, during President Abdulla Yameen\u2019s first state visit to China. While New Delhi has made no public statement, it has reportedly made its displeasure known, particularly on the speed and stealth with which the negotiations were completed. However, apart from the actual FTA, the rapid growth in China-Maldives ties has not been hidden from anyone. This is driven by massive infrastructure projects, including the development of Hulhule island and the \u201cFriendship\u201d bridge connecting it to Male. Apart from investments of $1 billion, Chinese companies are exploring tourism prospects in the Maldives, leases to resort islands, and reclamation projects. While this can be seen as a natural outcome of the Maldives\u2019 development plans, there are reasons for India to worry. The Yameen government also said this week that it is not satisfied with the working of the FTA with India. That statement, made by the Fisheries Minister at a press conference in Colombo, is likely to be discussed in detail between New Delhi and Male. Second, the manner in which the FTA was rushed through Parliament in a matter of minutes at midnight, with opposition members complaining they had not received enough notice, suggests a haste that would naturally worry India. The move also shows that the Yameen government is not inclined to pay much heed to international concerns over internal unrest. One reason for Mr. Yameen keeping India out of the loop on the FTA talks may be New Delhi\u2019s new policy of engaging with the Maldivian opposition, especially former President Mohammad Nasheed. The biggest worry for India is that the FTA will draw the Maldives more closely into China\u2019s security net. Although Mr. Yameen has categorically stated that the Maldives will remain a \u201cdemilitarised zone\u201d, there are concerns that the PLA-Navy might be looking for a military base in the islands linked to projects in Djibouti, Gwadar and Hambantota. The docking of three Chinese naval warships in Male harbour in August, the first such \u201cgoodwill visit\u201d, was significant in this respect. China\u2019s growing presence in the Indian Ocean presents a challenge to India as it looks to define its place in the U.S.-led \u201cIndo-Pacific\u201d realignment.

You must be ready to finance it whether the business is small or big. The common way of getting a financial help is through the bank but they will ask you for a personal guarantee. The bank uses this so that they can take the assets when you can no longer pay the money back. However, you can go for No personal guarantee business loans Utah .\n\nIn the case where you are operating a small business, it may be challenging to have assets. This is the reason why most small businesses owners do not seek loans from firms that require assets as security. There are many advantages that come with this category of loans, people tend to go for such forms of financing to ensure they do not risk their property.\n\nOne of the benefits of is that you will not lose your property. As much as you are trying to make your enterprise to flourish, it might not be a good idea to use assets for securing the loan. Remember that business that has just been established face a lot of problems and it is likely that paying the creditors will not as smooth as many people think. When your assets are not used in any way you can be sure that they always are yours and no one will claim their ownership.\n\nThe banks have set certain procedures for getting loans. All of them must be followed step by step. At times those steps can take much longer than the enterprise may withstand. If the enterprise is already at its worst it will not be able to hold for longer more so when people have to come and see if the assets first. This is an important procedure since they have to ensure the property listed exists and it is worth the amount in question.\n\nIn cases where a no personal guarantee is not needed, there is no time wasted since the money you asked is processed very fast. This ensures that no aspect of your company is derailed and hence the enterprise can easily be salvaged.\n\nAnother advantage is that the value of the property is maintained. In most cases when the property 9is being evaluated, it will be given a value that is less than what is worth. This means the loss on your part. When your creditor does not require any of your property, you can be sure that all the value is maintained.\n\nAll creditors will have demands from the debtors. It is the duty of all the people who want to be funded to have the requirements observed. If the property is not used in obtaining a loan, you will be asked to give the creditor different collateral. Do your research just to be sure what will be asked for.\n\nIn conclusion, patience is key when in need of a loan. It is advisable to be keen on what the set conditions are before applying and you should not give up at all if at all they do not meet your expectations. In addition, it is important to have the assets maintained instead of giving them away to creditors.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nCheck out eaglecapital.org for details about the benefits of taking out no personal guarantee business loans Utah firms offer, today.

Alex Brandon AP Photo Franken faces fresh accusations, weighing his future By ANDREW TAYLOR Associated Press December 07, 2017 03:00 AM UPDATED 1 MINUTE AGO WASHINGTON \nMinnesota Democrat Al Franken, facing fresh allegations of sexual misconduct and vanishing support from fellow Democrats, appears to be on the brink of resigning from the Senate. \nFranken scheduled an announcement for Thursday, though his office tweeted Wednesday evening that he had not made \"a final decision\" on resigning. \nBut a majority of the Senate's Democrats called on the two-term lawmaker to quit after a woman emerged Wednesday morning saying he forcibly tried to kiss her in 2006. Hours later, another woman said Franken inappropriately squeezed \"a handful of flesh\" on her waist while posing for a photo with her in 2009. That brought the number of women alleging misconduct by Franken to at least eight. \nFranken, the former comedian who made his name on \"Saturday Night Live,\" faces a chorus of calls to step aside, and Democratic senators said they expected their liberal colleague to resign.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \n\"Enough is enough,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. \"We need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is OK, none of it is acceptable, and we, as elected leaders, should absolutely be held to a higher standard.\" \nGillibrand was the first to call for Franken's resignation on Wednesday, but a torrent of Democrats quickly followed. \n\"I'm shocked and appalled by Sen. Franken's behavior,\" said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state. \"It's clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time. It's time for him to step aside.\" \nThough the writing appeared to be on the wall, Franken's departure was not certain. A tweet posted Wednesday evening on Franken's Twitter account said: \"Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate.\" \nLate in the day, Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York added his voice. \n\"I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately,\" Schumer said. \nThe resignation demands came in rapid succession even though Franken on Wednesday vehemently denied the new accusation that came from a former Democratic congressional aide, who said he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006. \nThe woman, who was not identified, told Politico that Franken pursued her after her boss had left and she was collecting her belongings. She said that she ducked to avoid his lips and that Franken told her: \"It's my right as an entertainer.\" \nFranken, in a statement, said the idea he would claim such conduct as a right was \"preposterous.\" \nBut it was soon clear that his position had become untenable. \nFellow Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who spoke to Franken, wrote on Twitter, \"I am confident he will make the right decision.\" \nThe pressure only mounted Tuesday, when Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., resigned after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. Rep Ruben Kihuen, D-Nev., faces pressure to resign as well over allegations reported by Buzzfeed that he repeatedly propositioned a former campaign worker. \nWhile Franken apparently is departing, Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore could be arriving, if he prevails in a Dec. 12 special election. Multiple women have accused the 70-year-old Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were teens and he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s. If Moore is elected, it could create a political nightmare for Republicans, who have promised an ethics probe. \nA national conversation about sexual harassment has intensified this fall after the heavily publicized case of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of many acts of sexual misconduct, including rape, by actresses and other women. Just on Wednesday, Time magazine named as its person of the year the \"silence breakers\" \u2014 women who have come forward on sexual harassment. \nPunishment has been swift for leaders in entertainment, media and sports while members of Congress have tried to survive the onslaught of allegations. \nFranken already faced a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into previous claims by several other women that he groped them or sought to forcibly kiss them. \nThe allegations began in mid-November when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan. \nOther allegations followed, including a woman who says Franken put his hand on her buttocks as they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Two women told the Huffington Post that Franken squeezed their buttocks at political events during his first campaign for the Senate in 2008. A fourth woman, an Army veteran, alleged Franken cupped her breast during a photo on a USO tour in 2003. \nFranken has apologized for his behavior but has also disputed some of the allegations.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "al franken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "franken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirsten gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leeann tweeden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john conyers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "politico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew taylor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruben kihuen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy klobuchar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buzzfeed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patty murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuck schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey weinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex brandon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schumer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate ethics committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota state fair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huffington post", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-minn.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-nev.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-mich.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington  minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:34.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "02cc4fcc0b2eab16b5d1a3468eb525a9602d8548", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1rsZ0bXhcl2iPmCZSHWhZNl", "site_full": "nigeria.shafaqna.com", "site": "shafaqna.com", "site_section": "http://nigeria.shafaqna.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nigeria News (News Reader) |", "title": "Any attempt to swear in parallel president is treason \u2013 Kenyan Attorney General", "title_full": "Any attempt to swear in parallel president is treason \u2013 Kenyan Attorney General", "published": "2017-12-07T11:10:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5727, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "02cc4fcc0b2eab16b5d1a3468eb525a9602d8548", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1rsZ0bXhcl2iPmCZSHWhZNl", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "Any attempt to swear in parallel president is treason \u2013 Kenyan Attorney General", "text": "18 hours ago Any attempt to swear in parallel president is treason \u2013 Kenyan Attorney General Kenya\u2019s Attorney-General Githu Muigai said on Thursday that any attempt to hold a parallel swearing in of a president would amount to treason.

Killing off a break for Hillsdale College.", "text": "Stateside's conversation with reporter Adam Harris. Michigan's Hillsdale College Credit eandersk / FLICKR - HTTP://J.MP/1SPGCL0 \nA small Michigan college took center stage on the Senate floor for a hot moment in the debate that led up to the passing of the Senate GOP plan to revamp America's tax code. \nDemocrats zeroed in on an amendment that would have handed a special tax break to conservative Hillsdale College, which does not accept any federal funds. \nThe provision was written by Pennsylvanian Republican Senator Pat Toomey. It exempted any school that doesn't accept federal funding from a 1.4 percent tax on investment income from university endowments. \nHere's Senator Toomey responding to queries from Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden: \nNow, over to Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill: \nAnd, in the end, the so-called Hillsdale Carve-Out was stripped from the tax bill. To help us understand the events that led to this outcome, reporter Adam Harris joined Stateside today. He wrote a piece for The Chronicle of Higher Education titled, \"The Brief Life and Undignified Death of the 'Hillsdale Carve-Out.'\" \nRead Harris' piece here , listen to Stateside's full conversation above, or read highlights from the beginning of the conversation below. \nOn whether Senator Toomey's provision was \"a very limited provision written for a very special person,\" as Senator McCaskill said \n\u201cWell, the argument from Senator Toomey\u2019s office, as you heard, was essentially that any college that met these requirements, which was not accepting Title IV funds, would be eligible for this special exemption. Now, there are no other colleges that would have reached the threshold at that point. Later in the debate, you know, Senate Republicans amended the threshold for this excise tax on college endowments to schools that had $500,000 in endowment per student. So, ultimately, Hillsdale College wouldn\u2019t even have reached that threshold. So, at a certain point, it became a moot point.\" \nOn why this small provision became a big fighting point for Democrats \n\u201cSenator Chuck Schumer actually argued that it was kind of exemplar of the entire debate \u2013 that all of this was kind of happening in secret and they were finding out at the last minute, and it seemed to only affect a very small percentage of people. Essentially, Senate Democrats were arguing that this was indicative of a large issue with the entire tax bill.\u201d \nListen to the full conversation above. \n(Subscribe to the Stateside podcast on

It also alleges that the company didn't do enough to fix the problem. \nWolverine Worldwide, 3M Corporation and Waste Management Inc. were all named in the suit for their involvement in the groundwater contamination. \nThe ground water in several Kent County communities is testing positive for per- and polyflouralkyl substances -- or PFAS. \nSharon Almonrode is with the Miller Law Firm, one of the firms who filed the suit. \nAlmonrode believes a class action suit is best for the people affected by the contamination. \n\u201cWhen you have them sue in a class action, it enables them, it empowers them as a collective to take on the large corporation,\u201d Almonrode said. \nAlmonrode says Wolverine had several opportunities in the past to help remediate the issue. \n\u201cAs early as 1999, they received a letter from 3M that suggested that these chemicals could be toxic,\u201d Almonrode said. \nWolverine makes shoes and boots under brands including Hush Puppies and Merrell. No one from the company was immediately available for comment. \nWolverine has been supplying bottled water to homes in the Department of Environmental Quality\u2019s testing zones. For homes that test high enough for PFAS, the company has been giving whole home filtration systems.

Everything has been peaceful as it should be. From the outset, we have assured the people that their safety and security is paramount, so, we just put in place measures to ensure that their property and lives are protected,\u201d he said. \n\n\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "william yaw owusu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akuapem north", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nana afua nketia obuo ii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adu panyin ii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akuapem asona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nana kesse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kwadwo kesse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "okuapemhemaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "odehyie kwasi akuffo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baamuhene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dennis agyapong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "odehyie akuffo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kwasi akuffo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oseadeyo addo dankwah iii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nana osim kwatia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nana afari bampoe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asonahene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "omanhene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nana kwasi omenako ii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akuapem gyaasehene nana yaw afari bampoe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "akuapem traditional area", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sakyebea royal family", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "citi fm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "accra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eastern region", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akropong akuapem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baamuhene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akropong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:37.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "86c8aad7a68d1fc2ab5a91d54916a597b1f13184", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRCF6LKuCKbBqverp3jZYO2kd768TrgiRQxW9OCdc6j5nFscVrI5tdsXxdTLWAON0yOP3qrr2m0F1ZvvM6UXT6ZJ_qgNuq76iv4f3UnWWY4_edXCzVer9VBQMm5C3ppeFc-", "site_full": "factfrench6marceline.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://factfrench6marceline.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "What You Had To Know About Your Time With Wine \u2013 factfrench6marceline's blog", "title": "What You Had To Know About Your Time With Wine", "title_full": "What You Had To Know About Your Time With Wine", "published": "2017-12-07T11:23:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "86c8aad7a68d1fc2ab5a91d54916a597b1f13184", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRCF6LKuCKbBqverp3jZYO2kd768TrgiRQxW9OCdc6j5nFscVrI5tdsXxdTLWAON0yOP3qrr2m0F1ZvvM6UXT6ZJ_qgNuq76iv4f3UnWWY4_edXCzVer9VBQMm5C3ppeFc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "factfrench6marceline", "published": "2017-12-07T11:23:00.000+02:00", "title": "What You Had To Know About Your Time With Wine", "text": "Wine is an amazing beverage that people around the world enjoy. Be it Italy with their fabulous vintages or France with their fruity blends, few countries don\u2019t enjoy wine from time to time. Want to know more about enjoying wine? Read below to learn as much as you can quickly.\nSimply because a bottle of wine is more expensive than another does not mean that it is necessarily better. You don\u2019t have to buy the most expensive bottles of wine that you find. Try wine at all different price levels. You may like something better that is less expensive than what you usually buy.\n\nA good tip if you\u2019re interested in learning more about wine is to go to as many wine tastings as you can. Wine tastings are great because they allow you to try out all kinds of wine which will help you figure out what you like and what you don\u2019t like.\nPurchase the Magnum bottles in the store, which are a bit larger, giving you the best bang for your buck. These wines will generally run for about 10 or 15 dollars, and will last a little bit longer for the price.

While many grocery stores and even some convenient stores carry wine, they do not have the staff on hand who really understand wine. If you shop with professionals, you will have a better chance of finding the wine you want and gaining valuable information in the process.\nWhen dining out, don\u2019t be afraid to ask your server if there is a wine expert in the house!

Tell them what you are having and give them a general price range, and you should find yourself with a great bottle to go with the meal.\nYou should always store your wine while it is resting on the side. This is because it keeps the wine in contact with the cork. When the cork of a wine gets dry, it may cause a gap that allows air into the bottle, which may cause your wine to spoil.\nWhen you are hunting for that great price on a great selection, the discount bottles will be just what you are looking for. The various venues will lower the price for whatever reason and place the same, expensive bottle on the racks for a discounted price. Keep an eye open and you might spot an amazing deal on an amazing flavor.\n\nConsider keeping a journal to record the kinds of wines you enjoy and distaste. This helps you keep track of all the wines that you love and the ones that you don\u2019t, which will help you prepare your palette. Carry around a pad and pencil at all times just to be safe.\nWhen it comes to stocking your wine cellar, avoid filling it with cases upon cases of your favorite wines. Over time, your tastes will change so be sure that your cellar is full of variety so that you\u2019ll always have a bottle that you are currently in the mood for.\nWhen tasting wine, you should avoid distractions as much as possible. Keep in please click the up coming website page that the presence of a strong smell in the room might influence how you perceive the aroma of the wine you are tasting. The temperature of the room and of the bottle you are tasting will also influence your impressions.\nNever hesitate to advise your sommelier of your spending limits. Many people think that this is inappropriate or embarrassing, but he or she is actually well-versed in the selection process based upon price. Allow a little leeway in the recommendation, but don\u2019t break the bank over a non-existent social norm.\nSake is an often overlooked type of wine that warrants further investigation.

David Zalubowski AP Photo Scientists call on US to allow research on pot meds for pets By ANDREW SELSKY Associated Press December 07, 2017 02:58 AM UPDATED 2 MINUTES AGO BEND, Ore. \nDr. Byron Maas surveys a supply of marijuana products for dogs that lines a shelf in his veterinary clinic. They're selling well. \n\"The 'Up and Moving' is for joints and for pain,\" he explains. \"The 'Calm and Quiet' is for real anxious dogs, to take away that anxiety.\" \nPeople anxious to relieve suffering in their pets are increasingly turning to oils and powders that contain CBDs, a non-psychoactive component of marijuana. But there's little data on whether they work, or if they have harmful side effects. \nThat's because Washington has been standing in the way of clinical trials, veterinarians and researchers say. Now, a push is underway to have barriers removed, so both pets and people can benefit.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \nThose barriers have had more than just a chilling effect. \nWhen the federal Drug Enforcement Administration announced last year that even marijuana extracts with CBD and little or no THC - marijuana's intoxicating component - are an illegal Schedule 1 drug, the University of Pennsylvania halted its clinical trials. Colorado State University is pushing ahead. \nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned companies that sell marijuana products online and via pet shops and animal hospitals that they're violating laws by offering \"unapproved new animal drugs.\" The FDA threatened legal action. \nBut, seeing potential benefits of CBDs, the American Veterinary Medical Association's policy-making body said last summer it wants the DEA to declassify marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug \"to facilitate research opportunities for veterinary and human medical uses.\" It asked the board of the national veterinarians' organization to investigate working with other stakeholders toward that goal. The board is awaiting a recommendation from two group councils. \n\"The concern our membership has is worry about people extrapolating their own dosages, looking to medicate their pets outside the realm of the medical professional,\" Board Chairman Michael Whitehair said in a telephone interview. \"This is an important reason for us to continue the research.\" \nUtah Sen. Orrin Hatch, a conservative Republican, became an unlikely champion of this push when he introduced a bill in September that would open the path for more clinical research. While Hatch said he opposes recreational marijuana use, he wants marijuana-based drugs, regulated by the FDA, produced for people with disorders. \n\"We lack the science to support use of medical marijuana products like CBD oils, not because researchers are unwilling to do the work, but because of bureaucratic red tape and over-regulation,\" Hatch said. \nDawn Boothe, of Auburn University's College of Veterinary Medicine, is waiting for federal approval to begin a study of marijuana's effects on dogs with epilepsy. The classification of marijuana products containing CBD as a Schedule 1 drug, the same category as heroin and LSD, creates a \"major, major, major, terrible roadblock\" for researchers, Boothe said in a phone interview. \nResearchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine were studying CBDs' effects on dogs with osteoarthritis and pruritis, or itchiness, until the DEA released its policy statement. \n\"The ambiguity in this process has really brought us to a screeching halt,\" said Michael DiGregorio, director of the university's clinical trials center. \"It is research that needs to be done, because there are a lot of CBD products out there.\" \nWhen it clarified that marijuana CBD extracts are Schedule 1 drugs, the DEA said it was assigning a code number to those substances to better track them and to comply with international drug control treaties. \nDiGregorio complained that researchers seeking federal approval to study CBD products are told to provide certain data, but that data isn't normally available until the study is done. \n\"If you don't have the data, you can't get the registration to do the work,\" he said. \nOn a recent morning, Maas took a break from seeing four-legged patients in the Bend Veterinary Clinic. A stethoscope dangling from his neck over green scrubs, Maas said his clients have reported CBDs help relieve pain, arthritis, anxiety, loss of appetite, epilepsy and inflammation in their pets. \n\"Unfortunately there's not a lot of research out there, especially on animals, on CBD compounds,\" Maas said. \"The research is really necessary to help us understand how to actually use these compounds on our pets.\" \nVeterinarian Janet Ladyga of the Blue Sky Veterinary Clinic, also in Bend, said she doesn't recommend marijuana products because of the unknowns. \n\"We don't have a lot of evidence right now, so we don't know the toxicity or the safety profile ... and we don't have any good evidence to show either if it's safe or efficacious,\" she said. \nThe study at Colorado State University aims to provide some data. The roughly two dozen dogs in the arthritis study and the 30 in the epilepsy tests are given either CBD oil or a placebo. For the arthritis study, activity monitors are attached to the animals' collars, to determine if they're more mobile when they're taking CBD. \nPrincipal investigator Stephanie McGrath said she hopes the results will be a stepping stone for longer and more diverse studies, and that they provide useful information for human medicine. \n\"Every medication we're taking has been given to a dog first,\" the University of Pennsylvania's DiGregorio noted. \nMeanwhile, Boothe said she had everything ready to start her study in January, and was waiting for a green light from federal officials. \n\"I don't know what's taking so long,\" she said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "luke byerly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robbie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dawn boothe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew selsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janet ladyga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "byerly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "byron maas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael whitehair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael digregorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephanie mcgrath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orrin hatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digregorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david zalubowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boothe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "american veterinary medical association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blue sky veterinary clinic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auburn university's college of veterinary medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of pennsylvania school of veterinary medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drug enforcement administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado state university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:38.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "20eb3080bb5ca0aa25eba3495cee22ed5ca7f5bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFo8ckeWmH8y__8r1z1sUMfvHfkctC0_BcGe0D9EySPIY7aPJi386Gs.p0VeW5FmdFwzcjxSx73cib1N9HsYAm0J", "site_full": "gamesupdateblog.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://gamesupdateblog.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Games Update Blog", "title": "Google Alert - games", "title_full": "Google Alert - games", "published": "2017-12-07T11:23:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "20eb3080bb5ca0aa25eba3495cee22ed5ca7f5bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFo8ckeWmH8y__8r1z1sUMfvHfkctC0_BcGe0D9EySPIY7aPJi386Gs.p0VeW5FmdFwzcjxSx73cib1N9HsYAm0J", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "James (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:23:00.000+02:00", "title": "Google Alert - games", "text": "games As-it-happens update \u22c5 December 7, 2017 NEWS N.

Irwin. \" Another Wrinkle in the RFS: The Small Refinery Exemption  224,   6,  //farmdocdaily.illinois.edu/2017/12/another-wrinkle-in-rfs-small-refinery-exemption.html 2017 has been a busy year for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). In July, the D.C. Circuit rejected EPA's interpretation of its general waiver authority ( farmdoc daily , August 9, 2017 ; August 18, 2017 ). In September, EPA issued a Notice of Data Availability that sought comment and data exploring further avenues to reduce the portions of the advanced mandate ( farmdoc daily , October 5, 2017 ; October 12, 2017 ; October 19, 2017 ). A week ago, EPA finalized the RFS volume obligations that maintained the statutory mandates in line with its proposed rule ( EPA News Release, Nov. 30, 2017 ). On November 22, 2017, EPA also denied requests from petitioning interests to change the point of obligation for compliance with the RFS mandates ( EPA Response, Nov. 22, 2017 ). Finally, a recent court decision by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ( Sinclair Wyoming Refining Co. v. U.S. E.P.A , Aug. 15, 2017 ) may add yet another wrinkle to administration of the RFS. In that decision, a federal court concluded that EPA's denial of a waiver for small refineries was improper. This article reviews the small refinery issue and its potential implications for the RFS standards. Legal Discussion When Congress created the RFS in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-58 ) it included a temporary exemption for small refineries from the mandate through 2011. Small refineries were defined as those with less than 75,000 barrels of crude oil throughput in a calendar year. The revised and expanded version of the RFS created in 2007 did not alter this exemption ( P.L. 110-140 ). In 2011, EPA extended the blanket exemption through 2013 in response to demands from Congress for a reassessment of the impacts on small refineries ( 40 CFR Part 80, Regulation of Fuels and Fuel Additives: 2012 Renewable Fuel Standards; Final Rule , at 1340). In addition to the blanket waiver through 2013, the statute also provided authority to EPA to grant an extension of the exemption to any small refinery. An exemption was to be based upon petition and due to \"disproportionate economic hardship\" to the refinery ( 7 U.S.C. \u00a77545 (o)(9) ). Sinclair petitioned EPA to extend the exemption for its two small refineries in Wyoming but EPA denied the petition. It was this denial that the Tenth Circuit Appellate Court reviewed. The decision making process includes the Department of Energy (DOE), specifically DOE evaluates the impacts on small refineries and provides recommendations to EPA ( Sinclair Wyoming Refining v. EPA ). DOE's analysis includes a scoring matrix for assessing the impacts, which includes measurements related to the viability of the refinery under the RFS mandates. EPA focused its conclusion for denying the petitions on the viability aspect of the DOE assessment. EPA rejected DOE's recommendations and concluded that Sinclair did not meet the \"disproportionate economic hardship\" requirement. EPA's decision rested on a conclusion that it was necessary for a small refinery to demonstrate that complying with the RFS threatened the long-term viability of the refinery. In other words, to grant an extension a refinery would have to prove to EPA that the RFS mandate threatened its long-term survival. The court concluded that EPA improperly interpreted the requirement. The court concluded that EPA's view was too narrow an interpretation of the statute and that it created too high of a hurdle. The court held that making viability of the refinery a necessary component for exemption went beyond the statute's requirement of disproportionate economic hardship ( Sinclair Wyoming Refining v. EPA ). On its own, the Tenth Circuit decision appears minor. It requires EPA to make use of a more reasonable standard for extending exemptions for small refineries from the RFS mandate. The bigger question may be the extent to which EPA can make use of the authority and court decision. In the 2010 regulation implementing the RFS renewable volume obligations (RVO) for the 2011 calendar year, EPA provided the formula for calculating the yearly volume requirements ( 40 CFR, Regulation of Fuels and Fuel Additives: 2011 Renewable Fuel Standards; Final Rule (Dec. 9, 2010)). The RVO calculation includes an estimation of the amount to be produced by small, exempted refineries. Thus, known or expected exemptions are to be taken into account in setting the obligations and would effectively shift some of the obligation to larger refineries. EPA explained, however, that if any small refineries are granted an extension after the annual rulemaking is finalized, \"the parties in question would be exempted but we would not intend to modify the applicable percentage standards\" for the remaining non-exempt refineries (Id., at 76804). EPA goes on to add that the RFS is best implemented with a single annual standard and not be revised periodically based upon waivers. More to the point, in its discussion of small refineries, EPA writes that it does \"not intend to revise the 2011 standards applicable to other obligated parties to require that they make up for volumes that will not be attained by the exempt refineries\" (Id., at 76805). In the 2017 RVO final rule, EPA noted that it had not approved any exemptions for 2017 and had calculated the volumes without any adjustments for exempted volumes ( 40 CFR, part 80, Renewable Fuel Standard Program: Standards for 2017 and Biomass-Based Diesel Volume for 2018 (Dec. 12, 2016)). EPA added that if it approves any exemptions after the final rule, those amounts \"will not be reflected in the percentage standards that apply to all gasoline or diesel produced or imported in 2017\" (Id., at 89800). EPA noted that this adheres to the 2011 final rule that it will not revise the requirements for non-exempt obligated parties. Combined with its treatment of exemption extensions after the final rule, the Tenth Circuit decision may provide a backdoor method by which EPA could reduce the mandate without using waiver authority. Given EPA's persistent efforts to expand its waiver authority, this possibility may be more than mere speculation. Now that the final obligations have been established, if EPA grants exemption extensions to small refineries the obligations for those small refineries would effectively disappear from the RFS mandate. Depending on how EPA uses its authority, exempting small refineries could have large implications for the RFS and RINs markets. These implications are discussed in further detail below. Analysis of Expanded Exemptions The impact of expanding the number of small refinery exemptions for the RFS depends on the number and capacity of small refineries. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) conducts an annual survey of U.S. refineries and publishes the results in the Annual Refinery Report . Figure 1 presents the capacity of all U.S. crude oil refineries operating on January 1, 2017, ranked from smallest to largest in terms of capacity (thousands of barrels per day). According to this survey, there is a total of 133 operating refineries in the U.S. with an aggregate capacity of 18.314 million barrels per day. Of the 133 refineries, 54 have a capacity less than the 75,000 barrel per day threshold defined by the RFS as a small refinery. The total capacity of the 54 \"small\" refineries is 1.81 million barrels per day, or 9.9 percent of capacity for all operating refineries. For perspective, a 75,000 barrel per day refinery has an annual capacity of 1.15 billion gallons and the annual capacity of all small refineries is 27.756 billion gallons. Now consider a scenario where the EPA issues a blanket exemption for all small refineries in 2018. If capacity tracks gasoline and diesel consumption, the blanket exemption would remove from RFS compliance approximately 10 percent of total petroleum gasoline and diesel consumption in 2018. Since the fractional mandates have already been established in the final rulemaking for 2018, applying the previous EPA logic of \"not intend[ing] to modify the applicable percentage standards,\" this would effectively reduce all of the volumetric mandates because the base for applying the fixed percentage standard would be lowered. The precise impact on final obligated volumes is complicated and depends on how the exemptions impact the physical consumption of ethanol and biomass-based diesel. The simplest assumption is no change from EPA projections, which seems reasonable for ethanol but less so for biomass-based diesel, due to the differing market competitiveness of the two biofuels. The net impact for RFS compliance purposes would be a reduction of obligated petroleum gasoline and diesel consumption from the 180.74 billion gallons estimated in the recent final rulemaking for 2018 to 161.64 billion gallons, a drop of 19.6 billion gallons. Table 1 compares 2018 volume and percentage standards under the final EPA rulemaking and an alternative scenario where a blanket exemption is given to all small refineries. As outlined above, we assume no change in physical market consumption of gasoline, diesel, ethanol, or biomass-based diesel from EPA assumptions for the final rulemaking under the alternative scenario. Changing these assumptions will not alter the basic thrust of the results. The reduction in the volume mandates under the blanket exemption scenario is by construction a bit less than 11 percent. This translates into a 2.09 billion gallon reduction in the total RFS mandate, a 0.47 billion gallon reduction in the advanced mandate, a 1.63 billion gallon reduction in the (implied) conventional ethanol mandate, a 230 million gallon reduction in the biomass-based diesel mandate, and a 31 million gallon reduction in the cellulosic mandate. All of these reductions are non-trivial, particularly when considered in light of recent controversies about reducing the mandate levels by smaller amounts. All of the mandate reductions under the blanket exemption scenario would be negative for RINs prices, but the 1.63 billion gallon reduction in the conventional ethanol mandate, from 15.0 to 13.37 billion gallons, would be especially consequential. As several previous farmdoc daily articles (e.g., December 4, 2015 ) have highlighted, when the conventional ethanol mandate is below the E10 blend wall, D6 ethanol RINs tend to trade for only a few cents because the blending margin on ethanol generally is positive. However, when the conventional ethanol mandate is above the E10 blend wall the valuation of D6 ethanol RINs changes completely. The reason is that the gap between the blend wall and the mandate has to filled by a higher-ordered non-ethanol biofuel, and to date, that has been almost exclusively biomass-based diesel. This implies biomass-based diesel is the \"marginal\" gallon for filling the conventional mandate, and consequently, D6 ethanol RINs are of equivalent value to D4 biomass-based diesel RINs. Essentially, this is what happened in early 2013 when D6 ethanol RINs prices exploded from a few cents to almost $1.50 per gallon. Returning to Table 1, a blanket exemption would reverse the pattern in recent years of the conventional mandate exceeding the E10 blend wall. There is always some uncertainty in estimating the E10 blend wall but a reasonable estimate for 2018 is 14.3 billion gallons. Under a blanket exemption, the conventional ethanol mandate would be almost a billion gallons below this estimate of the blend wall. Since ethanol blending margins are currently positive the implication is that D6 ethanol RINs would return to pre-2013 levels of only a few cents, a huge change from recent levels in the $0.80 - $0.90 range. It is also interesting to consider that it would not take a full blanket exemption to push the conventional ethanol mandate below 14.3 billion gallons. A total of only 8.5 billion gallons of small refinery exemptions would drop the conventional mandate to 14.3 billion gallons for 2018. Exempting the 33 smallest refineries would be sufficient to exclude the 8.5 billion gallons in 2018. Finally, please note that the actual RINs market reaction to a blanket small refinery exemption could be smaller than projected here due to uncertainty about how these exemptions would affect the calculation of future RFS obligations for non-exempted refineries. Implications A seemingly obscure provision of the RFS that allows the EPA to exempt small refineries in the U.S. from RFS compliance could have surprisingly large impacts on mandate levels and RINs prices in 2018. Small refineries are defined by the RFS as those with a daily processing capacity of 75,000 barrels or smaller. A blanket exemption of all small refineries would remove about 10 percent of total refining capacity from RFS obligations. The EPA has previously signaled that it would not adjust the percentage standards for any exemptions issued after a final annual rulemaking. Since the 2018 percentage standards have been finalized, this could effectively provide a backdoor procedure for reducing all of the 2018 RFS volume mandates without waiving the requirements. The reduction in the conventional ethanol mandate could be large enough to push the mandate below the E10 blend wall, which could potentially drive D6 ethanol RINs prices back down to the pre-2013 level of just a few cents per gallon. Whether the EPA will take this backdoor remains to be seen, but it is also likely a move that it could make only once. Given how strictly courts have viewed EPA's authority under the RFS, it is difficult to conclude that the EPA could use this method repeatedly to lower the mandates. A blanket small refinery exemption in 2018 would likely be a one-time move that the computation of future standards would have to take into account. After 2018, we expect that the mandate obligations of exempted small refineries would be shifted to non-exempted refineries.
