,with the clear understanding they create hyperinflation , to print illegally money as much as necessary to see in last attempt if they can send their societies in irrational exuberance and sell them all the over evaluated shares the rich hold today. The main politicians and central bankers in USA, UK , DE , FR are with some 30 % approval vs 50 % disapproval or are afraid to take posts in DE as capital holders and scientist rule behind them to steal money with inflation for the coming recession. In USA and EU there is by some trillion illegally printed money already and by some another trillion in safes from QE . That is equal to M1 for USA and money may multiply to M2 so some 20 to 100 % hyperinflation is expected by now , while money will start to multiply with inflation as when money devaluate it is nice to have loans. Now USA EU people hold in safes nearly twice the liquid money in FED , ECB and their banks so the people are the real central bank in this situation. With 2 , 3 % inflation people will prefer soon to spend the money from safes not lose the inflation and this will accelerate suddenly and sharp the inflation. FED and ECB should be careful not reckless in such circumstances. The organized crime of rich USA and EU will print first just enough to steal your money but latter will cover by some 2 trillions in health , 2 trillions in pensions and 2 trillions housing losses so here later printing is expected as well. The high sovereign, private bonds and debts and currency reserves will be devaluated . When the currency reserves are over soon the USD and EUR will decline in currency crisis, similar to the pound. The shares are supported with illegally printed money for some year by now so the devaluation of the dollar and EUR and pound will continue and inflation will follow soon so follow alone price basket. What will follow in the economy of USA and EU is similar scenario to the end of Solviet union with change of economic system with strong inflation that leads to disruption of economy. Ask the mentioned by me policymakers in other posts and FED and ECB , UK the raised here questions as who is behind them to be so unpopular, is the only choice they have right now to inflate the USA , EU , UK economies substantially to see if irrational exuberance is possible when growth , profits data are falsified and social indicators as inequality , demography, obesity, social support and many othershow clear deep crisis in western societies the same questions for USA, DE, FR, UK, IT , ES premiers. Ask if money are printed illegally and provided straight to USA , EU , UK banks to bail them out and buy shares to prop the prices on people account ? . . . currency crises for bubble\u2026 with the illegally printed money to prop the share market for a bubble fed provided a lot of liquidity on the market that is kept in jars. That liquid money reduce the price of the dollar and create avalanche effects of returned currency reserves. Last one two months fed continues to printing money to intervene on stock exchange , but also spends the currency reserves hold by the commercial and fed banks to hold the price of dollar stable for a while. The criminal policy of ECB is similar. There is also increase in inflation in US and EU for this reason though the growth is manipulated data to stop outflow of deposits in EU seen in Target 2 loans among eu countries with this bluff , while usa Is bluffing growth for stock exchange bubble correlated news. When the truth is revealed the money from the jars that may be by trillion for eu and usa only from the quantitative easing will be added as liquidity to new illegally printed money straight donated to banks by you public to create inflation. This policy usually ends with hyperinflation as currency crises as social costs cannot be postponed and money will be printed to cover them. Follow eu , uk for similar story not to be happening there for printed money for a bubble that create inflation and reduce currency on your account. . Ask them until when they will endanger the health of my family for the facts I reveal that endangers their financial markets forever. My family was moderately poisoned these days to scare me not to write here. \n\n\nAsk the questions raised in the hyperinflation text the persons mentioned in the next text \nGe0rg1 \u2026The scientists and the capital put themselves in the shoes of the politicians to control them. on weak policymakers to be used for economic catastrophe. Ask the mentioned persons until when they will endanger the health of my family for the facts I reveal that endangers their financial markets forever. My family was moderately poisoned these days to scare me not to write here. They paly with version of fake strong economic growth for share bubble to cheat you , I present version with a lot of illegally printed money and waisted currency reserves and waisted EU deposits you pay for and they poison me to scare me. Look behind unpopular policymakers in these difficult times. USA strives with share bubble to steal the money of USA citizens, EU will steal EU deposits that will cover EU bank losses and the deposits of Draghi friends taken away to be refinanced. EU leaving deposits cannot be covered by ECB printed money or the trillion or more redistributed with TARGET 2 and may be stolen by USA. So look for the centers of power for the coming events as USA and for EU France , Germany and UK. If policymakers are responsible in front of people , behind them are scientist and behind scientists capital. You see the record low policymakers support in many cases for persons as Trump , Christine Lagarde , May , Macron , Merkel , Draghi and all ECB governors, Yellen , Powell and all FED governors , Carney , Junker , Moscovici and all EU commissioners. Sometimes these low popular politicians may be influenced with legal cases and other means as Lagarde or Trump. So raise these questions in front of knowledgeable scientists as Krugman , Obstfeld , Rogoff ,Tibshirani , Stiglitz , Tirole , Deaton , Blundell , Thaler , Guillen ,Schauble, Kretshmer , Falk, Shiller , Bernanke ,Summers , Romer , all Bruegel . Ask them for economic data in EU , UK and USA if they think that are correct as economic growth , inflation , profits , currency reserves , deposits. Ask them if money are printed in USA , EU , UK illegally to finance share bubbles and if they are not the minds behind these low support politicians , what they expect to happen in the economy to be appointed so unpopular politicians and if they are controlled with unfair means. If deposits leave EU hidden when USA banks open and on Friday as you see EUR rate last days , but next days ECB will change this pattern in a bluff that is not successful. Raise these questions to all mentioned up people publicly for court to preserve democracy , economy and follow carefully for abuse of law and democracy. Ask all company managers that participated in USA 7 trillion buyback if they are in collision and USA banks , nasdaq companies if they are aware for FED illegally printed money.

Grimes voted no Aulisio\u2019s appointment, and Scavo voted no on Thomas\u2019 appointment. \nThe leadership shakeup follows a race during which voters elected Alisha Marmo, along with Wilk, Aulisio and Thomas \u2014 a former district principal and teacher who came to a secret settlement with the district after his firing in March and subsequent resignation in July. \n\u201cNo matter what the composition of the board, I\u2019m still going to fight for the taxpayer, and I may have to fight harder now,\u201d Scavo said after the meeting. \u201cThose that ran with (Christopher Cesare) Thomas on his ticket have formed the majority.\u201d \nThomas expressed a regret about the election. \n\u201cIf we could have found somebody to run against (Scavo), we would have,\u201d said Thomas. \nScavo said he believes Thomas has a vendetta against Superintendent John Rushefski for his role in Thomas\u2019 termination investigation and hopes the rest of the new majority doesn\u2019t share it. \nFor her part, Wilk does not envision a majority-minority dynamic among board members, although both she and Aulisio said the board needs to earn back the trust of the teachers after the previously board had \u201canimosity\u201d against the educators. \nThe board plans to meet at 7 p.m. Dec. 14 to appoint a school director to replace longtime board President Deborah DeSando. \nContact the writer:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "publi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gretchen wintermantel", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john rushefski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick aulisio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grimes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deborah desando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher cesare thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher cesare) thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julie grimes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scavo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joan wilk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aulisio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frank scavo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alisha marmo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "megan mccabe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "forge school board", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:44.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "78e4c80b2099b76421f73071b8192fe75102b47a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRNhnIlBAq2YjeTEb2NkW67zGjeXSesYBWamGQQrm6MxyoTfmxOoDLoQfleh3WqSADtPl3iAmRO.xPosITEHaj5u1oAXR1BKDM-", "site_full": "olympic.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://olympic.craigslist.org/search/ppp?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist olympic pen | personals search", "title": "nice rack or puffy nips wanted - m4w (pa)", "title_full": "nice rack or puffy nips wanted - m4w (pa)", "published": "2017-12-07T09:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "78e4c80b2099b76421f73071b8192fe75102b47a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRNhnIlBAq2YjeTEb2NkW67zGjeXSesYBWamGQQrm6MxyoTfmxOoDLoQfleh3WqSADtPl3iAmRO.xPosITEHaj5u1oAXR1BKDM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "nice rack or puffy nips wanted - m4w (pa)", "text": "favorite this post nice rack or puffy nips wanted - m4w (pa) hide this posting unhide   do you have a nice rack or puffy nips and bills to pay I want to get them wet and sticky thats it.That is my gig I like that not after a relationship just a fetish void I need to get filled.

Similarly, member of the ruling party raised slogans against Centre in their respective seats. \nWhile the Congress accused both the State and Centre of being apathetic towards the plight of Odisha people, the BJP blamed BJD-led State government for not providing required evidence to Centre on the matter. \n\u201cBoth the Central and Odisha government have failed to protect the interest of people of the State. While constitutional guidelines allow a tribunal to resolve water dispute between two States, the Centre has refused to constitute the same citing baseless reasons. This is one of the biggest violations of law. Being the protector, the Centre has acted as a killer,\u201d Leader of Opposition Narasingha Mishra said. \nThe BJP demanded the State to provide detailed report on Mahanadi matter again. \n\u201cThe BJD government was indulged in doing politics over the Mahanadi issue by shedding crocodile tears and was trying to stay away from the main issue as it failed to provide detailed report on the river dispute to Centre based on which the Centre filed affidavit in the Supreme Court,\u201d BJP MLA Pradeep Purohit said. \nWe had demanded the State government should issue a White Paper on Mahanadi water, but it failed as it lacks proper data and they were exposed yesterday in the Supreme Court. To suppress the matter, they created ruckus in the House today. I strongly condemn it. Now, real face of the BJD has been exposed in the apex court, he added. \nThe ruling BJD too blasted the Centre for ignoring Odisha\u2019s interest. \u201cThe Centre\u2019s betrayal has come to the fore when it moved Supreme Court with affidavit stating that it would not constitute the tribunal, Government chief whip Amar Satpathy said. \nWhen a State applies for a tribunal, the Centre is bound to constitute the same under the Inter State River Water (ISRW) Disputes Act, 1956. But it paid little heed to it. Protesting it, almost all members of the House today expressed resentment, he added. \nThe Centre on Wednesday filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court accusing Odisha of not adducing evidence in support of its case. In the affidavit, the Centre alleged the State government of not submitting any data till date.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pradeep purohit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "odisha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amar satpathy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narasingha mishra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "odisha assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "inter state river water", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mahanadi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "odisha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chhattisgarh", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:44.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3932add7b094ab32a0bd3845a88b00ae745d7842", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RkeXyWwa2NebdwDnoZzVQqIPOAqF97r3Or7uTVKw7xI.0G27P2Hti3iL85q.c69iv7V11a3d5.bRbNhSz72zzBrEemQHKgwYnvk2LT2jL_ubmRqbZYkAmCZDhsaLLMeKfAJBYcQ4llkzaq2Gbf4.jcc-", "site_full": "www.marketwatch.com", "site": "marketwatch.com", "site_section": "http://www.marketwatch.com/rss/topstories", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "MarketWatch.com -

\nSINGAPORE \u2014 Singapore authorities revoked the citizenship of a man who allegedly belonged to a major syndicate which rigged football matches around the world. \nThe 43-year-old man, who was not officially identified, was an \u201cactive and trusted member of an international match-fixing syndicate which was created in and took root in Singapore,\u201d the Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement on Thursday. \n\u201cWhile a Singapore citizen, the individual conspired with his syndicate members to fix football matches in various countries through corruption of officials and players.\u201d \nThe man was also accused of traveling for \u201cmajor global match-fixing activities,\u201d and moving money used as bribes into and out of Singapore. \nBecause of his involvement in match-fixing, the man was arrested and detained without trial before being released, the statement said. For now, he was under police supervision. \nThe ministry did not give further details on the countries where matches were fixed. But it said witnesses were afraid of testifying against him and other syndicate members in court. \nLocal media identified the man as Gaye Alassane, who originated from Mali and used to play in the local S-League. \n\u201cYes, I did those things, but everybody make mistakes, no? I thought I paid for mine already. I don\u2019t know what to say now,\u201d The Straits Times quoted Alassane as saying. \nHe has 21 days to refer his case to a citizenship committee of inquiry.

You can visit this domain if you want to install Reimage Repair, Reimage for Mac, Reimage for Android and similar software. \nBesides, it may start showing up within your web browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc.) right after installing a questionable free download, which is filled with optional components, such as add-ons, extensions, plugins, toolbars [1] . \nUnfortunately, bundling [2] , a term used to describe optional software hidden in free software, has been still very popular and we can predict that it will definitely be used as one of distribution means in 2018. \nThe main problem related to it is that people are not clearly warned about specific components that can be downloaded to their computers in a bundle with free programs. Once they are installed, commercial add-ons, extensions, and similar components are embedded in web browsers, and they start causing commercial pop-up ads. \nSuch pieces of software tend to connect to various ad networks and load third-party advertisements from there. What adware causes ReimagePlus.com pop-up ads, it is still unknown, but if you don't want to see them, you should remove the ad-supported program from your computer. Nevertheless, it's obvious that these alerts try to promote a program that can help you to fix your computer. It's called Reimage. \nSo, after sorting out why people see ReimagePlus.com ads on their computers, we should also mention redirects to this domain. They may interrupt you after clicking one of these ads while browsing the web. As we have already mentioned, this website is fully legitimate. It is used to promote Reimage Repair or its technical support. \nIf you need help, you can use its service without any fears. In addition to ReimagePlus.com redirects, you may start seeing its pop-up alerts informing about various risks to your computer. If you can see such notification while browsing, you should think about your computer's performance. Is it low? Could it be filled with bad registry entries [3] ? Screenshot of the official Reimage website - ReimagePlus.com. An example of ReimagePlus.com ad. Such ads are not dangerous - they advertise Reimage software, which is a powerful malware removal program and also a PC optimizer. \u21e6 \u21e8 Slide 1 of 2 \nKeep in mind that Reimage is the tool that can help you improve your computer's speed and performance. Even more, you can call for its professional technicians and get assistance regarding various computer problems that bother you. \nAgain, remember that you are not obliged to use the software if you do not want to. We have also noticed that users often ask \u201cis Reimage Plus a virus\u201d just because they do not know the real purpose of the program or how to uninstall it from their computers. No, the program is not a virus. \nIf you can't remove the PC optimization software, you probably can't find its components on your system. No worries! At the end of this post, you can find a comprehensive explanation on what files and programs have to be removed in order to completely uninstall ReimageRepair from the system. \nWe have also noticed that users are interested in how to get rid of ReimagePlus, so we provided a tutorial on how to remove annoying pop-up ads by uninstalling ad-supported programs. We kindly invite you to use \u201cHow to remove pop-up ads?\u201d tutorial that we prepared. Reasons why people receive ads promoting Reimage \nAs already mentioned, ReimagePlus.com is an official website of legitimate Windows repair software, so it cannot hijack [4] anything. Its ads are caused by third party browser add-ons and extensions that have been widely promoted in a bundle with free software. \nHowever, we must point out that the software developer must have slowed down its product's advertising campaigns because we receive much less complaints about these ads today. \nAs you probably heard, browser add-ons and ad-supported programs are usually disseminated alongside other freeware and shareware. Therefore, every time you install a download manager, media player, PDF creator or any other free program, you may download a bunch of other programs. \nSome of them are harmless, others are quite aggressive, including Discount Buddy , Search Safer , VeriBrowse , and many others. Fortunately, freeware [5] distributors often give us a chance to opt out such unwanted components; however, for that, they require to pay much more attention to the freeware's installation process than the users are used to dedicate. \nIt's a must to select Advanced or Custom installation option and check every check box carefully. Otherwise, you may skip the list of 'optional components' and unconsciously agree to install the whole list of apps. Frequently asked questions about Reimage Plus \nQuestion. What is Reimage Plus? Why do I see its ads on my computer screen? \nAnswer. Reimage is a legitimate computer repair software.

your surroundings. No one desires residing in a bare land where there is odd silence and no sign of life. Vegetation complements the beauty of your area and they are an indication of life. When they shed their leaves during the dry season, you will remember the phases of life and later growth teaches you that nourishment follows starvation. There are numerous benefits of forests ranging from pure air to tranquility, and silence, which are ideal for contemplation. To learn more about Hoosier national forest trails , read this article. The scenery is covered with vegetation of different species, hills, plateaus, knoll, waterfalls, caves, and ridges. The land takes different forms and has differing altitudes to give you a list of activities that you can uphold. A few animals reside in the perfect views; thus, attracting travelers and boosting tourism. Depending on the nature of the land, the primary activities vary, but farming is common in the northern sides. Forests have enriched soils that extend to a large portion of land. The soils have poor water retaining capacity and will give plants the right amount of water for growth. Drainage is unheard of, and you can harvest the water in ponds for use during the dry seasons. Some areas have clay soils and molders; thus, brick manufacturers use the same in their daily encounters. National forests have invigorating spells such as winter, summer, autumn, and spring. There is a wide distinction in these times of the year and they almost follow a definite calendar. These areas are less populated, and the amounts of contaminants in the environment are not enough to cause a change in seasons. The extremity of a season depends on the rate of interference with polar air. In winter, air collides with polar conditions and the longer the collision, the colder the period. Local climates are affected by a variety of factors with the common being terrains, soil types, latitude, and lakes. Movement of polar air affects the weather. There is a wide range of temperature levels throughout the year, but January is the coldest month. Period between the freezing times and highest times vary and depends exclusively on the nature of a forest. Although the temperatures vary gradually or drastically, you will still feel comfortable residing in the neighborhood. The sun is up at the better part of the day, which enhances the comfort. One appalling trait in the forested parts is the rough storms. Normally, winds are gentle and will sway vegetation smoothly from side to side. During the rainy periods, other harsh conditions such as rough storms, hailstones, strong winds, and thunderstorms emerge and destroy property as well as vegetation. It is, thus, important to construct a building and grow your wheat and corn at a distance from the forests. The traits are unpredictable and many are taking advantage of the changes for their financial gain. Activities such as agriculture and tourism play an important role in the economy. The national forests also allow for recreational activities such as hiking, bike riding, and horse racing. There are other career opportunities such as assessment of public utilities, law enforcement, organizing events, and insuring.

Olivia is a professional 'fixer' who makes problems go away before anyone even knows they exist. For the moneyed, the powerful and even the President, Olivia is a legend in her field. Her spectacular success is mostly due to her unbreakable rule of always trust your gut. No matter how careful you are, when you do damage control for a living, you're bound to cause some damage to your own life. She and her crew eat, sleep, live and breathe crisis. Each week, as the team races against the clock to defuse intriguing new problems before they become full-blown disasters, they also have to deal with their own personal issues. They may call themselves 'gladiators in suits', but little by little, Olivia and her crew begin to reveal the chinks in their armor.

BriefingWire.com , 12/07/2017 - The global marine seismic equipment and acquisition market demonstrates a highly consolidated competitive landscape, finds a new research study by Transparency Market Research (TMR). In 2015, nearly 90% of the whole market was acquired by the top six players, namely, CGG, PGS, TGS, Polarcus DMCC, Fugro N.V., and SeaBird Exploration PLC. \nThe slowdown in the demand from the main end user of marine seismic equipment and acquisition, that is, the oil and gas industry is expected to intensify the competition within this market substantially in the near future, states the report. \nAs per TMR\u2019s estimations, the global marine seismic equipment market presented an opportunity worth US$0.36 bn in 2015. Expanding at a CAGR of 4.50% during the period from 2016 to 2024, the market is expected to cross US$0.53 bn mark by the end of the forecast period. Over the same period of time, the global market for marine seismic acquisition is estimated to rise from US$3.5 bn in 2015 to US$5.6 bn by 2024, increasing at a CAGR of 5.30%.

Mellow \nConvicted former state Senate Democratic Leader Robert J. Mellow has his $246,123 annual pension back for good. \nPending state House and Senate bills would close the legal loophole that allowed Mellow to get it back, but passing the bills won\u2019t strip his state pension again, state officials said Wednesday. \nState Rep. Scott Petri, R-178, Bucks, the House bill\u2019s chief sponsor, was not surprised by a state pension board\u2019s decision to restore Mellow\u2019s pension. \n\u201cI\u2019m just so sick of it,\u201d Petri said Wednesday in a telephone interview from Harrisburg. \u201cIt\u2019s not even the first time. The list goes on and on, and these are only the high-profile cases.\u201d \nThe State Employees\u2019 Retirement System board voted 6-5 to restore Mellow\u2019s pension. The system stripped away the pension shortly after his 2012 guilty plea to a federal felony conspiracy charge. \nAttempts to reach Mellow, 74, of Archbald, were unsuccessful. Under their divorce decree, Mellow will get $138,958 a year of the pension and his ex-wife, Diane, will get $107,165 a year, according to the pension board order. \nThe House passed Petri\u2019s bill amending the state public pension forfeiture law by a 190-1 vote on May 8, with all the legislators representing Lackawanna, Luzerne, Wayne, Susquehanna, Wyoming, Pike and Monroe counties voting in favor. The House sent the bill to the Senate where it remains pending in the finance committee. Sen. John Blake, the committee\u2019s Democratic chairman, succeeded Mellow, who supported his successful 2010 Senate bid. \nBlake, also a Senate Judiciary Committee member, voted for a similar Senate bill in that committee, which passed it April 26 by a 12-0 vote. \nJennifer Kocher, a spokeswoman for Republicans, who hold an overwhelming majority in the Senate, said the full Senate likely will vote on the bill next year. \nThe House also passed Petri\u2019s bill 188-2 in May 2016, but it died in the Senate Judiciary Committee when the 2015-2016 legislative session ended. \nBlake pointed out everything that led up to the case happened before he took office in December 2010, and said legislators cannot change the law retroactively. The pension amount reflects Mellow\u2019s 40 years of service and long time in leadership, he said. \nBlake said he knows the ruling will upset citizens. \n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to distance myself\u201d from Mellow, a lifelong friend, he said, also pointing to his vote for reform. \u201cIt is what it is. I know people will react viscerally, but they should consider the context, consider his career and his contributions to the system.\u201d \nMellow pleaded guilty in May 2012, to felony conspiracy for using his Senate staff members for his political campaign work on state time and for filing a false tax return that saved him about $16,000 in federal taxes. A federal judge sentenced him to 16 months in prison, to pay a $40,000 fine and a $100 special assessment, and to repay the $79,806.17 that his use of Senate staffers for political work cost state taxpayers. \nMr. Mellow also had to pay the IRS $31,748 in unpaid taxes, penalties and interest for underreporting his income on the 2008 sale of the building that housed his Blakely Senate office. He served 14 months with two months off for good behavior and was released March 2014. \nLast year, he released a self-published book, \u201cUsed, Abused & Forgotten, Bob Mellow: A Targeted Senator.\u201d In it, he called the federal charges he pleaded guilty to \u201cbogus\u201d and \u201cfrivolous\u201d and portrays himself as a \u201cpure victim\u201d of prosecutors and media out to get him. \nPetri, R-178, Bucks, and Blake, D-22, Archbald, said the bills, if passed into law, could not retroactively strip a pension because that would violate Mellow\u2019s constitutional rights, but would mean anyone convicted of a felony \u2014 like Mellow \u2014 in any court would have to forfeit his or her state pension. \nScranton attorney Sal Cognetti, Mellow\u2019s lawyer, argued the federal conspiracy charge was not on the list of crimes that the state public pension forfeiture law says requires giving up a pension. \nThe pension board\u2019s majority opinion likened Mellow\u2019s conviction to the state crime of theft by deception, but that crime required Mellow to \u201cactually obtain money and property of the Senate.\u201d The federal conspiracy count did not charge the former senator with getting money or property, the board said. \nA dissenting minority opinion said the ruling undermines the law\u2019s deterrent effect. \nThe ruling, issued Nov. 6, came a few weeks shy of the fifth anniversary of Mellow\u2019s sentencing. \n\u201cThe decision is awful and it\u2019s going to set off a negative impact,\u201d said Eric Epstein, coordinator of Rock the Capital, a Harrisburg-based watchdog group. \u201cBob Mellow was not just another corrupt politician. Bob Mellow was the Babe Ruth of corrupt politicians. ... We had to pay him when he was in office, we had to pay (to lodge him) when he was in prison and we have to pay him now that he\u2019s retired.\u201d \nContact the writer: bkrawczeniuk@timesshamrock.com; 570-348-9147; @BorysBlogTT on Twitter Recent Scranton News", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bill", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "robert j. mellow", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "petri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john blake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer kocher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mellow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monroe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric epstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wayne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott petri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sal cognetti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pike", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob mellow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diane", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "democratic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blakely senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate judiciary committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "luzerne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wyoming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "archbald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lackawanna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scranton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harrisburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "susquehanna", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:45.024+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5eb82c1dc863cfa5d9cd7f58ea9a7fdc3cdea526", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpHgdsGe9rnrkE.1mMrXnqXgIRhoFjttddeJxefSf746y6xh23uXM0PDxlIgspd1UU1IWw44rFukzsB_pRWwoEfY9DsIjeg6kcB2djBIxoDr9ZQt2IIkp.lEj4o_ghKJgiLx2LVLH1agvUwOSL5EFWy0rKXaTtZqhU97NL8zO3mxg--", "site_full": "thetimes-tribune.com", "site": "thetimes-tribune.com", "site_section": "http://thetimes-tribune.com/cmlink/spotlight-stories-from-thetimes-tribune-com-1.12911", "site_categories": ["media", "business", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Spotlight stories from thetimes-tribune.com", "title": "Clarks Summit council approves quality-of-life ordinance, 2018 budget without tax increase", "title_full": "Clarks Summit council approves quality-of-life ordinance, 2018 budget without tax increase", "published": "2017-12-07T07:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.thetimes-tribune.com/images/icons/icon_app_medium_tt.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81259, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5eb82c1dc863cfa5d9cd7f58ea9a7fdc3cdea526", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpHgdsGe9rnrkE.1mMrXnqXgIRhoFjttddeJxefSf746y6xh23uXM0PDxlIgspd1UU1IWw44rFukzsB_pRWwoEfY9DsIjeg6kcB2djBIxoDr9ZQt2IIkp.lEj4o_ghKJgiLx2LVLH1agvUwOSL5EFWy0rKXaTtZqhU97NL8zO3mxg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CLAYTON OVER, STAFF WRITER", "published": "2017-12-07T07:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Clarks Summit council approves quality-of-life ordinance, 2018 budget without tax increase", "text": "  CLAYTON OVER, STAFF WRITER   \nCLARKS SUMMIT \u2014 Borough council unanimously approved a quality-of-life ordinance that will enable borough officials and police to write tickets for property violations spanning height of weeds and grass to pet waste. \nThe new ordinance is designed to speed up enforcement of existing regulations and be a tool to deal with habitual offenders, Borough Manager Virginia Kehoe previously said. Before the ordinance passed, borough officials had to send a letter giving a property owner 10 days to deal with an infraction and if it isn\u2019t resolved in that time, they\u2019d have to file a citation with a magistrate. \nThe ordinance passed Wednesday carried a minor change from the draft version. Officials struck a line mandating animal owners to pick up pet waste daily, but borough officials \u201cwant to see the waste removed often, but on the individual\u2019s personal property, we are not requiring it to be every day,\u201d Kehoe said in an email. Other provisions in the ordinance include capping the height of weeds and grass at 10 inches and prohibiting interior furniture or appliances to be placed outside. \nA violation will carry a fine of $25 for the first infraction in 12 months\u2019 time, $50 for the second and $100 for a third under the new ordinance. Fines increase $100 cumulatively for subsequent offenses. \nThe ordinance drew some criticism at the meeting. Borough resident Kathy Roth pointed out the borough\u2019s population is growing older and the legislation could negatively affect elderly residents. \n\u201cAs people grow older, it\u2019s harder for them financially to assume the burden of taxes and the upkeep of their properties,\u201d Roth said. \u201cThis makes it possible for a disgruntled neighbor to target an individual or family and make remarks or complaints and this person or other family can be unduly penalized.\u201d \nCouncilman Patrick Williams defended the ordinance Wednesday night. He acknowledged that there are a lot of senior citizens in the area, but there is also housing and help available for anyone who is struggling. The law is not meant to single anyone out, he said. \n\u201cIf your property is maintained, no one is going to target you or bother you,\u201d Williams said. \nThe ordinance passed by a vote of 6-0. Councilman Vince Cruciani was absent Wednesday night. \nIn other business: \nn Council unanimously approved the 2018 budget with no tax or rate increases. \nn Council passed a resolution prohibiting mini-casinos within borough limits. \nn Council passed a resolution creating a police chaplain position. The chaplain is a volunteer post and unpaid, borough Mayor Herman Johnson said. He and borough police Chief Christopher Yarns will work with a Scranton police chaplain to determine possible candidates for the job and conduct interviews before recommending someone for council\u2019s approval, Johnson said. A chaplain would be a benefit for both borough police and people they help, Johnson said. \n\u201cIt will provide comfort and guidance to our officers, but also to victims,\u201d Johnson said. \nContact the writer: cover@timesshamrock.com; 570-348-9100 x5363; @ClaytonOver on Twitter Recent crimes and emergencies", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gretchen wintermantel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "clayton", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "publi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "virginia kehoe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kehoe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kathy roth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher yarns", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vince cruciani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herman johnson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "scranton", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:46.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "70c8b9eac3c6a643cca6982a8c3f5bfae5aadd12", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZeQ6FfIkhdBbgvIBJME0ntCdEouwFAIcDCwIhM3ee5kd12YEY6hqa39Akpu8e60Xj10mYZtsH9vZNvRFF8L3EzeVLzoK.i0.o-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money", "title": "Amelia Maverick: #Blockstream and Core supporters don't agree with the #Bitcoin White Paper, so why do they still keep the #Bitcoin name?", "title_full": "Amelia Maverick: #Blockstream and Core supporters don't agree with the #Bitcoin White Paper, so why do they still keep the #Bitcoin name? : btc", "published": "2017-12-07T08:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "45d36303dc4747f6be624a23d2504b382023b372", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZeQ6FfIkhdBbgvIBJME0ntCdEouwFAIcDCwIhM3ee5kd12YEY6hqa39Akpu8e60Xj10mYZtsH9vZNvRFF8L3Eze.xILWfJIezMTr5jZHj_FLWFEBzwng2K", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "_ExtraHash", "published": "2017-12-07T16:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Probably, yes.

Credit: Courtesy An Elvis Presley set prev next comments The CD lover on your list wants two things: One of these deluxe packages and the time to enjoy them. There\u2019s nothing like sneaking away Christmas morning and spending an hour poring over liner notes and listening to fresh tunes. We have five choices for rock superfans and neophytes trying to get into a new favorite.\n \u201cA Boy From Tupelo: The Complete 1953-1955 Recordings,\u201d Elvis Presley The boy had it from the beginning. The very beginning. Hearing an 18-year-old Elvis croon and cry through \u201cMy Happiness,\u201d recorded at Sun Studios in 1953, reveals he had the charm, coy charisma and talent way back when. From \u201cMy Happiness\u201d to a newly discovered, 1955 recording of \u201cI Forgot to Remember to Forget,\u201d this three-CD box is the most comprehensive collection of early Elvis recordings ever assembled. One revelation: Elvis began as a nervous wreck full of magnetic energy: His take on Chuck Berry\u2019s \u201cMaybellene\u201d rumbles with jitters and fire.\n\u201cSavage Young Du ,\u201d Hu sker Du . Could it be that Husker Du actually got worse as it went along? Could critical favorites such as \u201cNew Day Rising\u201d and \u201cFlip Your Wig\u201d actually represent a fall off from the band\u2019s early \u201980s demos? Nah, it\u2019s just the early stuff was awesome, too. These 69 recordings (47 released for the first time) roar with the fury of \u201980s suburbia. Honestly, the demo of \u201cDo You Remember?\u201d equals their best work. The demo also seems quaint in comparison to the trio\u2019s increasingly speed-obsessed songs. Later in the set, you\u2019ll find a handful of 30-second songs that come as brilliant bursts of anguish: \u201cPunch Drunk,\u201d \u201cBricklayer\u201d and a live version of the sonic hand grenade \u201cYou\u2019re Naive.\u201d\n\u201cTrouble No More: The Bootleg Series Vol. 13, 1979-1981,\u201d Bob Dylan The latest installment in the Bootleg Series could be the most controversial. Does the start of Dylan\u2019s \u201clost in the woods\u201d period merit seven CDs of 100 previously unreleased live and studio tracks? It certainly does. The maestro\u2019s move toward gospel over three albums saw him digging into deeply personal material and putting on joyful, wild concerts. Go straight to the passionate gospel of \u201cI Will Love Him\u201d (a song he only performed live twice) and an outtake of \u201cShot of Love\u201d in which organist Carl Pickhardt seems to find salvation mid-solo.\n\u201cListen Without Prejudice/MTV Unplugged Deluxe,\u201d George Michael Stocking-stuffer-sized but bursting with musts for Michael fans, this two-disc set combines the singer\u2019s boldest album with a dynamic acoustic concert. If you quit him after \u201cFaith,\u201d tsk tsk. \u201cPrejudice\u201d equals Michael\u2019s signature release in terms of passion, personality and bare honesty. The MTV session features heartbreaking tenderness (Bonnie Raitt\u2019s \u201cI Can\u2019t Make You Love Me\u201d) and fun, funky jams (\u201cStar People\u201d). But the treasure is the new single \u201cFantasy.\u201d A Nile Rodgers production, the dance floor groove should have been Michael\u2019s comeback track.

12/7/17 5:53 PM \nWARSAW, Poland \u2014 Poland\u2019s prime minister resigned Thursday and will be replaced by Finance Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, as the conservative ruling party took the risk of trading a popular leader for a former international banker who seemed better-suited to representing Poland to critics outside the country. \nThe reshuffling came after weeks of speculation that Prime Minister Beata Szydlo might be replaced, even though her government is popular with many Poles and the economy is booming. \nSzydlo resigned during a meeting of the ruling Law and Justice party in Warsaw, party spokeswoman Beata Mazurek said. The party leadership wants Szydlo to serve in another senior government position, Mazurek said without elaborating. \nDeputy Foreign Minister Jan Dziedziczak suggested Szydlo will be the deputy prime minister, a post Morawiecki held in her government. \nGovernment critics interpreted the leadership change as primarily an attempt to divert attention from a vote scheduled for Friday on laws that would give the ruling party significant power over Poland\u2019s judicial system. \nParty leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski is widely seen as the real power behind the government, and it\u2019s not clear if Morawiecki will seek to set an independent course or if he would also largely follow the direction Kaczynski sets, as Szydlo did. \nSome analysts think Kaczynski wanted Szydlo to step down because she was unable to manage government infighting. They said Kaczynski respects Morawiecki, a party newcomer, but does not see him as a threat. \nThe state news agency PAP reported that lawmakers will vote Tuesday on Morawiecki and his Cabinet. Approval is expected given the ruling party\u2019s majority in parliament. \nWhile Szydlo\u2019s 2-year-old government is riding high in opinion polls, Morawiecki has overseen its economic development. Poland now enjoys record low unemployment of around 7 percent, growing wages and growth of over 4 percent per year. \nStill, the country\u2019s international image has suffered dramatically since Law and Justice assumed power, mostly over new laws that have eroded the independence of the judicial branch. \nThe government also drew criticism from abroad following an Independence Day march last month that was organized by far-right groups. It drew an estimated 60,000 participants, including some who carried banners and signs with white supremacist messages. \nSome government members praised the march. The interior minister called it a \u201cbeautiful sight,\u201d although Poland\u2019s president denounced it unequivocally. \nSome see Morawiecki, a former international banker who speaks foreign languages, as better placed than Szydlo to defend the country in dealings with European partners who believe democracy is eroding in Poland. \nHe is expected to reassure financial markets, given that he is regarded as business friendly, especially by the standards of the others in the Law and Justice party. \nSzydlo, a coal miner\u2019s daughter and the mother of a priest, has wide support among conservatives. Many party supporters said in recent days they didn\u2019t want her to resign. \nShe thanked her supporters in a tweet Thursday night. \n\u201cThese two years were an amazing time for me, and serving Poland and Poles an honor,\u201d she wrote. \nEarlier Thursday, Szydlo and her Cabinet easily survived a no-confidence vote in parliament called by the opposition centrist Civic Platform party, which accuses the government of harming Poland with laws that it says are anti-democratic. \nTwo bills are set for a final vote in parliament Friday that would give the government greater control of the judicial system. The bills have been criticized by the European Union and others as an anti-democratic threat to Poland\u2019s rule of law.
