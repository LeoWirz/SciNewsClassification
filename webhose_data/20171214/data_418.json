by one of the suspects sending a text message from a boat, prosecutors believe. \nDaphne Caruana Galizia\u2019s car was blown up as she drove from her home on the island on 16 October. \nThe assassination sparked outrage in Malta and among many journalists and politicians in Europe and worldwide, who view it as an attack on free speech. \nThree men, two of them brothers, were charged with her murder on Tuesday . \nSeven other men were released on bail. \nPolice sources said it was suspected that George Degiorgio sent the text after getting a signal from his brother Alfred, who they think acted as a lookout. \nA boat has been impounded and the sources say mobile phones have been recovered from the sea in Valletta harbour. \nVincent Muscat, 55, George Degiorgio, 54, and Alfred Degiorgio, 52, all deny murder. \nThey were also charged with manufacturing the bomb which killed the journalist, taking part in organised crime, as well as possessing explosives. \nCaruana Galizia\u2019s family have released a statement saying that she was not investigating any of the 10 men arrested. \nWitnesses to her murder describe seeing two explosions coming from her car and the vehicle skidding down the road, before ending up on fire in a field. \nHer son, Matthew Caruana Galizia, said he found his mother\u2019s body in pieces. \nEvidence suggests the bomb was placed in her rented car while it was parked in an alley outside her house. \nThe journalist\u2019s articles probed issues such as government officials named in the Panama Papers leaks, Malta\u2019s reputation as a tax haven, and links with Libya. \nMalta\u2019s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, often a target of Caruana Galizia\u2019s articles, vowed no stone would be left unturned in finding the killers and has offered a \u20ac1m (\u00a3890,000) reward to bring her killers to justice. \nA group of EU lawmakers who went to Malta on a fact-finding mission last week said there was a perception of impunity on the island. \nThe head of the delegation, Ana Gomes, said the murder was aimed at instilling fear in everyone, especially those involved in investigating and prosecuting cases of money laundering and corruption.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "caruana galizia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caruana

Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as Israeli capital By - 7th December 2017 \nWorld leaders have rushed to condemn President Trump\u2019s decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, with many fearing the move will lead to violent clashes. \nPresidents and prime ministers from across the globe warned Mr Trump against moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem . \nSome think the decision could lead to a third Intifada \u2013 the ending of Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza \u2013 and the kiss-of-death for the peace process. \nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May said in a statement: We disagree with the US decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem and recognise Jerusalem as the Israeli capital before a final status agreement. \n:: Trump not averse to dangerous gamble in Israel \nOur position on the status of Jerusalem is clear and long-standing: it should be determined in a negotiated settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and Jerusalem should ultimately be the shared capital of the Israeli and Palestinian states. \nFrance\u2019s president Emmanuel Macron told reporters: This decision is a regrettable decision that France does not approve of and goes against international law and all the resolutions of the UN Security Council. \nPresident Trump however, has insisted his decision is simply recognition of reality and the right thing to do. \nOverturning decades of US policy, Mr Trump declared: Israel is a sovereign nation with the right like every other sovereign nation to determine its own capital. \nAcknowledging this as a fact is a necessary condition for achieving peace. \nChanges around the sensitive city of Jerusalem \u2013 a holy site for Muslims, Jews and Christians \u2013 risk scuppering the fledgling Arab-Israeli peace agreement brokered by Mr Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner. \nThe President\u2019s declaration was met with anger from the Arab world. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas rejected the US move, calling Jerusalem the eternal capital of the state of Palestine. \nIslamist group Hamas said the decision opened the gates of hell on US interests in the Middle East. \nIran warned it would provoke Muslims and lead to an increase in radical, angry and violent behaviour. \nTurkey called it irresponsible while Egypt\u2019s foreign ministry also rejected the US President\u2019s declaration. \nThe decision has been largely welcomed in Israel, which has long considered Jerusalem to be its capital, after it annexed the Old City in 1967. \nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, praised America\u2019s courageous and just decision and said it was a historic day. \nFollowing the decision, American government personal have been warned to avoid The Old City and the West Bank until further notice. \nAn updated Worldwide Caution has also been issued to US citizens abroad, advising them to be alert to the possibility of political unrest, violence, demonstrations, and criminal activities.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"},

It requires a lot of patience and, most importantly, taking up the right steps to weight loss is highly essential. \nElse, if you go by some random procedure instead of losing weight, you will end up in gaining a few extra kilos. \nAgain, when it comes to weight loss, it should be a healthy one. Skipping your meals or excess of exercises should be avoided. \nHence, if you are looking at losing weight and fit in your best dresses, then there are certain tricks that will definitely help you. \nFollowing a few of these steps will certainly help you in losing weight in a healthy way in two weeks. \nListed here are a few of them. Take a look. 1. Add More Of Fibre-rich Foods: \nWhether it is soluble of insoluble fibre, both are equally good if you want to lose weight. Foods that are rich in soluble fibre aid in better digestion and insoluble fibre helps in keeping one full for a long period of time. This in turn prevents you from craving for food and consuming of junk snacks. Brown rice, oatmeals, quinoa and buckwheat are a few of the best known fibre-rich foods. 2. Reduce Your Carbohydrate Intake: \nCarbohydrates are loaded with calories. Also, the foods rich in calories have very less or no nutrients in them. So, consuming carbohydrate-rich foods would only add to lots of calories in your diet. More of calories means gaining excess body weight too. \nSo, if you really want to lose weight quickly, then it is important to reduce carbohydrate intake and replace it with healthy fibre-rich foods. 3. Avocado: \nAvocado is one of the best fruits that one can include in their daily diet. Avocado contains good fat and fibre, which help in regulating the cholesterol level. Rich in antioxidants, adding avocado in your diet helps to maintain body weight. 4. Olive Oil: \nOlive oil contains omega-3 fats, which are a source of good fats. Using olive oil for your daily cooking helps if you are looking at losing weight. \nAlso, one could consume a tablespoon of olive oil on a daily basis, as this helps in keeping one full and decreases your desire to eat and this helps in losing weight. 5. Nuts: \nThere is nothing better than nuts when it comes to snacks. Nuts like almonds and walnuts are rich in omega-3 fatty acids or what is known as good fats. Whenever you feel hungry, consuming a handful of nuts not just helps in satiating your hunger but also aids in weight loss. 6. Avoid Carbonated Drinks: \nCarbonated drinks are filled with calories, excess sugar and additional flavours. Due to all these factors drinking too much of carbonated drinks can lead to weight gain. Hence, avoiding carbonated drinks totally is a must if you are looking at losing weight. 7. Avoid Potato Chips: \nPotato chips are high in calorie content and bad cholesterol level which only adds to weight gain. Avoiding deep-fried potato chips is highly essential if you want to lose weight, as this helps in cutting down on the calorie intake. 8. Healthy Snacks: \nIn between your meals, it is important that you munch on some snacks. One should not stay empty stomach for long, as this causes stomach acidity and gas formation. Roasted or baked chickpeas, peanut butter and apple, or nuts like almonds and walnuts are a few of the healthy snacks that you can include. 9. Eating Slowly & Smaller Portions: \nOne of the best ways to eat and not gain weight is by consuming smaller portions. It takes your brain about 20 minutes to understand that you are full. So, when you eat slowly and smaller portions, you end up eating less or just the required amount. This helps to prevent weight gain. 10 Drinking Plenty Of Water: \nIt is important to drink plenty of water to keep your body hydrated. Sometimes, when your body lacks in water, you get a feeling that you are hungry. You then end up eating food, but you actually fail to understand that you are actually thirsty and not hungry. 11. Lemon Juice + Water: \nIf you are looking at losing weight quickly, then lemon water would be actually helpful. Lemon is low in calories that helps to burn fat and detoxify your body. All that you need to do is crush the lemon juice in a glass of warm water and drink this first thing in the morning. It helps. 12. Exercises: \nApart from having a healthy diet, regular exercise is a must. When it comes to exercise, it is not just about hitting the gym but in doing small things like walking for at least 30 minutes every day and instead of taking the elevator, it is always recommended to take the stairs. 13. Ideal Breakfast: \nAdd two tablespoons of ground flax seeds to a small bowl of fat-free yogurt or skimmed milk, add one teaspoon of honey, one banana and you could also add 2-3 raspberries and strawberries. \nAlso, instead of flax seeds, one could add half a cup of oats. This breakfast can be followed for better weight loss. 14. Ideal Lunch: \nYour lunch should comprise of food that is low in calories and fat. A meal comprising of lean meat, leafy greens, legumes, whole grains and boiled potatoes helps in making an ideal lunch if you are looking at losing weight. 15. Ideal Dinner: \nDinner should always be light and healthy that will help you in sustaining through the night. Vegetable or chicken soup, salads, baked chicken with mushrooms and sweet potatoes can be consumed for dinner. This helps in keeping you full and, at the same time, helps one to lose weight as well.

In patients with obesity the diagnosis of asthma is often based on symptoms, but without objective measurements. Nevertheless, obesity-associated asthma is recognized as a distinct asthma phenotype. Therefore, this study explores lung function and symptoms in asthma patients with and without obesity. Methods The Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity (NEO) study is a population-based cohort study with 6671 participants (aged 45\u201365 years) of whom 472 had asthma. Of this latter group, linear regression analysis was used to examine differences in lung function and symptoms between asthma patients with ( n \u2009=\u2009248) and without obesity ( n \u2009=\u2009224), and between asthma patients with and without increased Fe NO . Analyses were adjusted for confounders. Results Asthma patients with obesity had lower predicted FEV 1 and FVC values than patients without obesity [adjusted mean difference (MD) -3.3% predicted, 95% CI -6.5, \u22120.2; adjusted MD \u22125.0% predicted, 95% CI -7.8, \u22122.1]. The prevalence of symptoms was higher in patients with obesity. Asthma patients with obesity and with increased Fe NO had lower FEV 1 and FEV 1 /FVC values compared with those with low Fe NO (adjusted MD \u22126.9% predicted, 95% CI -11.7, \u22122.0; \u22122.4%, 95% CI -4.6, \u22120.2). Conclusion Asthma patients with obesity had lower FEV 1 and FVC values than patients without obesity. This suggests that patients with obesity have restrictive lung function changes, rather than obstructive changes. Asthma patients with obesity and increased Fe NO showed more obstructive changes. Fe NO might help to identify patients with eosinophilic inflammation-driven asthma, whereas patients with low Fe NO might have an obesity-associated asthma phenotype in which symptoms are partly caused by the obesity. Keywords Asthma Obesity Fe NO Symptoms Lung function Background Asthma and obesity are common conditions with an increasing prevalence. It is estimated that, in 2014, worldwide more than 600 million adults had obesity [ 1 ]. In the general population, the prevalence of asthma ranges from 1 to 8% [ 2 ]. Epidemiological studies have shown that obesity itself has a significant impact on respiratory function [ 3 ] and some studies have suggested that obesity is also a risk factor to develop asthma [ 3 \u2013 5 ]. Body mass index (BMI) has been shown to have little effect on spirometry results, while the expiratory reserve volume and functional residual capacity are reduced in people with obesity compared with people with normal weight [ 6 ]. Results regarding the relation between obesity and hyperresponsiveness are conflicting, with some indicating no relationship and others showing that BMI is associated with hyperresponsiveness [ 6 ]. Patients with and without obesity with a diagnosis of asthma differ in symptom severity, airway inflammation, age of asthma onset, sex, and treatment responsiveness. The Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines identify obesity-associated asthma as a distinct asthma phenotype [ 2 , 7 ]. Nevertheless, asthma patients with obesity also represent a heterogeneous patient group regarding airway inflammation, symptoms and asthma control [ 8 ]. Obesity-associated asthma does not necessarily involve the classical type 2 T helper (Th2)-driven inflammatory process; also, it is suggested that the group of asthma patients with obesity is composed of patients with a Th2 inflammation-driven asthma and other patients who are mainly symptomatic as a result of their increased body weight without evidence of Th2-driven airway inflammation [ 9 ]. Indeed, especially in patients with morbid obesity and a diagnosis of asthma, airway inflammation was not detected in bronchial biopsies [ 10 ]. The detection of airway inflammation is important, as patients with increased eosinophilic inflammation should be treated differently than patients without evidence of eosinophilic inflammation. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (Fe NO ) has a diagnostic accuracy similar to blood eosinophils in identifying sputum eosinophilia in adult asthma patients [ 11 ]. Fe NO measurement has emerged as a non-invasive, inexpensive and reliable test which is becoming available on a wider scale. Therefore, it may prove useful in the diagnosis and management of asthma in primary care, especially in patients with obesity. When evaluated at group level, Fe NO is lower in asthma patients with obesity than in asthma patients without obesity, [ 12 ] suggesting that the group of patients with apparent airway inflammation is lower in patients with obesity. However, asthma patients with overweight or obesity have worse asthma control and respond less to corticosteroid therapy than normal weight individuals with asthma [ 13 ]. Other strategies, such as weight loss, improve pulmonary function, asthma control and quality of life in asthma patients with obesity, suggesting that the increased body weight and the resulting mechanical impairment of the lung might be an important factor [ 14 , 15 ]. It can be questioned whether patients with obesity and with symptoms of dyspnea are adequately diagnosed as asthma. According to current international guidelines, the diagnosis asthma is based on medical history, physical examination, lung function tests and additional tests [ 2 ]. However, objective methods to confirm the diagnosis asthma are not always used; [ 16 ] in 30% of the adults with asthma, the diagnosis could not be confirmed by objective methods [ 17 , 18 ]. Van Huisstede et al. suggest that, in obesity, respiratory symptoms could be incorrectly ascribed to either the obesity or asthma, resulting in a substantial proportion of misdiagnosis in this group [ 19 ]. Whereas the study of van Huisstede et al. suggests a difference in misdiagnosis of asthma between patients with and without obesity, Aaron et al. showed that overdiagnosis was not more common in patients with obesity than in those without obesity [ 20 ]. In 32% of the asthma patients with obesity, the diagnosis could not be confirmed by objective tests, compared with 29% of the patients without obesity [ 20 ]. To provide more evidence on the role of obesity in asthma, this study examines i) differences in pulmonary function, Fe NO and symptoms between asthma patients with and without obesity, and ii) differences in lung function between asthma patients with and without increased Fe NO . The emerging knowledge may help optimize treatment in patients with obesity experiencing respiratory symptoms. Methods Study design and study population The Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity (NEO) study is a population-based prospective cohort study including 6671 men and women (aged 45\u201365 years), with an oversampling of persons with a BMI of \u226527 kg/m 2 . Details of the study design and data collection have been described previously [ 21 ]. Between September 2008 and September 2012 men and women aged 45\u201365 years, living in the greater area of Leiden (in the west of the Netherlands) and with a self-reported BMI of \u226527 kg/m 2 were invited to participate. In addition, all inhabitants aged 45\u201365 years from one municipality (Leiderdorp) were also invited irrespective of their BMI. Between 2012 and 2013 information on prescriptions and diagnoses was extracted from the electronic health records of the participants at their general practitioners. According to the guidelines of the Dutch College of General Practitioners, diagnoses are coded according to the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) [ 22 ]. In the patient records, the general practitioners link all contact moments to a care episode, which is coded with the ICPC. The information is listed under four categories: subjective, objective, evaluation and plan. Measurements are coded under the heading objective, ICPC codes under evaluation, and prescriptions under plan. Drug prescriptions in the electronic health records are coded according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system [ 23 ]. The present study is a cross-sectional analysis of baseline measurements of all patients with an ICPC-coded diagnosis of asthma (R96) in their medical history ( n \u2009=\u2009513). Patients with missing values on the key outcomes were excluded ( n \u2009=\u200941). The Medical Ethical Committee of the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) approved the study protocol and all participants gave their written informed consent. Data collection in the NEO study Participants were invited to a baseline visit at the NEO study center of the LUMC after an overnight fast. Prior to the NEO study baseline visit, participants completed a questionnaire about demographics, lifestyle, clinical information and quality of life. Participants reported their highest level of education in 10 categories according to the Dutch educational system. We defined low education as no education, primary education or lower vocational training. Self-identified ethnicity of participants was reported in eight categories that we grouped into Caucasian and other. Smoking status was categorized in to current, former or never. The questionnaire included several questions about pulmonary symptoms. Participants indicated which symptoms (dyspnea, wheezing, coughing including mucus, coughing without mucus) they had experienced during the last month. They were also asked to indicate whether those symptoms worsened during physical activity, contact with animals, house dust mite or pollen, foggy weather, or at night and/or getting up in the morning. Physical activity during leisure time was reported using the Short Questionnaire to Assess Health-enhancing physical activity questionnaire and expressed in metabolic equivalents of task (MET) hours per week (MET h/week) [ 24 ]. Participants were asked to bring all medication they had used in the month preceding the study visit to the NEO study site, i.e. both prescribed medication and self-medication. All medications they were using at that time were checked and recorded by the study nurse. At the NEO study center, several measurements were performed including a physical examination and blood sampling. BMI was calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms by the height in meters squared. The World Health Organization defines obesity as a BMI\u2009\u2265\u200930 [ 1 ]. Duration of asthma was determined in two ways: i) as self-reported by the patient, and ii) calculated using the date of the first registration of the ICPC code asthma in the electronic health records. When using the registration date, the duration might be underestimated for patients with asthma since their youth, since electronic health records were introduced later. Therefore, in this study, we used the self-reported asthma duration; if this was missing, the date of the first registration of the ICPC code asthma was used. Pulmonary function tests All participants performed pulmonary function tests, including measurement of Fe NO . These tests were performed at the Department of Pulmonology of the LUMC. Spirometry was performed according to the standards of the European Respiratory Society [ 25 ]. Testing was done in sitting position with nose clips in place. A spirometer (Jaeger Masterscreen PFT; Viasys Healthcare, Hoechberg, Germany) was used by trained technicians to measure   one second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC). The FEV 1 and FVC values with the highest sum of FEV 1 and corresponding FVC value of three technically satisfactory and reproducible curves were registered for analysis. Curves were considered reproducible if the FEV 1 and FVC values were within 5%, and peak expiratory flow values within 10% of the highest values. When spirometric test results did not meet these criteria, but did include at least one technically acceptable curve, the values of this best performance were registered. FEV 1 % was defined as the FEV 1 value expressed as a percentage of the predicted normal FEV 1 and FVC% as the FVC value expressed as a percentage of the predicted normal FVC, both predictions based on sex, age and height. The Tiffeneau index (FEV 1 /FVC) was calculated by dividing the registered FEV 1 value by the registered FVC value. Fe NO Fe NO was measured once using a portable analyzer, the NIOX MINO (Aerocrine AB, Solna, Sweden). We have previously shown that a single measurement suffices for the assessment of Fe NO in persons with overweight or obesity [ 26 ]. In the present study, a cut-off of Fe NO of <25 was used; this is a clinically relevant threshold for low Fe NO according to the American Thoracic Society [ 27 ]. Statistical analysis Categorical variables were reported as numbers and percentages, normally distributed continuous variables as means with standard deviations (SD) and non-normally distributed continuous variables as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR), stratified by BMI (< 30 kg/m 2 and \u226530 kg/m 2 ). Differences in baseline characteristics between participants with obesity (BMI\u2009\u2265\u200930 kg/m 2 and without obesity (BMI\u2009<\u200930 kg/m 2 ) were tested, using linear regression analyses, separately for participants with and without an ICPC-coded asthma. For non-normally distributed variables and dichotomous variables, linear regression analyses with robust standard errors were used. Interaction effects between the main independent variables (asthma and obesity, and obesity and Fe NO ) were tested using linear regression analyses. For non-normally distributed variables and dichotomous variables linear regression analyses with robust standard errors were used. Interaction effects between obesity and asthma were tested in the total population with regard to lung function and Fe NO , and the symptoms were also tested. Furthermore, interaction effects between obesity and Fe NO were tested in the asthma population. For the outcomes for which a significant interaction was found, the main effects were analyzed in the different subgroups. Irrespective of the results of the interaction analyses, the asthma population was explored in more detail. In participants with asthma, differences in pulmonary function, Fe NO , symptoms and use of inhalation corticosteroids (ICS) between those with and without obesity were examined using linear regression analyses. In addition, differences in pulmonary function, symptoms and ICS use were examined between asthma patients with and without increased Fe NO separately for those with and without obesity. In the case that the outcome was binary, robust standard errors were used to estimate risk difference. Adjustment for confounders was based on literature. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, education levels, ethnicity, physical activity, alcohol use, and prescription of ICS. (Analyses for ICS use were not adjusted for prescription of ICS). These variables might act as confounders since they are associated with one of the main outcomes (obesity and/or Fe NO ) and with one or more of the outcomes. Analyses were performed with STATA Statistical Software (Statacorp, College Station, Texas, USA), version 12.0. Results Of the 6671 participants, 637 were excluded due to missing values. Of the 6034 complete cases, 472 had an ICPC-coded diagnosis of asthma in their electronic health records (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 Flowchart. Fe NO : fractional exhaled nitric oxide; ppb: parts per billion Baseline characteristics of the 472 included asthma patients (grouped according to BMI\u2009<\u2009and \u226530) are presented in Table 1 . Of these 472 patients, 248 (52%) had a BMI\u2009\u2265\u200930 kg/m 2 . Most asthma patients were women ( n \u2009=\u2009287, 61%), the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (6.1) years and the mean (SD) BMI was 31.2 (5.3). The asthma patients with obesity had a significantly lower education, were less physically active, had a lower alcohol intake, and a higher BMI (Table 1 ). Baseline characteristics of the participants without asthma (grouped according to BMI\u2009<\u2009and \u226530) are presented in Additional file 1 : Table S1.

We even think that NXT must have their own, where to present their former talents.  \nToday we browsed. Actually I didn't browse unintentionally! I was hoping to see Nidia's profile, added somehow. But NO! (I saw AJ Lee and thought 'When they will induct her in WWE Hall of Fame, with Molly Holly and Ivory, then I saw Emma and my heart started to bleed). So I decided to remind everyone for several big holes in that section. \nNIDIA \nWho was Nidia?  \nSeriously?!  \nNidia Guenard was part of WWE from 2001 to 2004. She debuted for SmackDown, before being traded to Raw and even had several title shots against ... wow - Molly Holly and Trish Stratus. She started as valet for the Hurricane and Jamie Noble, having a scandalous trashy angles, matches with Torrie Wilson and... Tajiri. As face she was packed with Stacy Keibler. So that woman was really interesting and really memorable from the fans of the Golden Divas generation. \nAnd if this is not enough: Nidia is the first female co-winner of the inaugural Tough Enough, relity show competition. \nTHE KAT \nA little break before another two serious suggestions! \nFormer WWF(then) Women's Champion and former Jerry 'The King' Lawer's wife, Stacy 'The Kat' Carter was iconic then-Diva, at the times, when the look and sex-appeal was almost everything. That was a dark but impotrtant period, when the title was won in a Pool match and the champ was showing her breasts on TV! But it was the time when the women were brought back and they have a chance to compete. \nThe Kat had her moments as a Chyna's valet and many other funny matches and rivalries, like the one with Terri Runnels. So, in the name of the old days, it's not bad to add this former Champion, like you add Sable and Sunny in different sections. Because like it or not, this is part of the legacy of WWE.  \nDEBRA \nSome people may said that Sunny and Sable, even Terri and The Kat are enough in the WWE Alumni, so another 'big bombs' blond bombshell, will be too much. \nWhen I started to watch WWE in the distant 2000 year, Debra Marshall was still 'The Sotne Cold' Steve Austin, wife and she participated actively in the WWE vs. WCW&ECW rivalries, even participating in a mixed tag team matches, against the likes of Lita & Matt Hardy. Debra's legacy is more the Legacy of the valet, than a legacy of a competitor. Yes, she has one title reign, that started in a really controversial way and ended down in flames, but she was the Valet, who women like Lana, Maria and Maryse, might learn a lot and use as example, for the role.  \nDebra was part of the company in the time, when it was slowly in transition,  and the women were mostly sexy valets, but were ready and for competition or every other role. I think aside from the last issues, they might add her to WWE Alumni section, in form of some gratitude. \nGAIL KIM \nI can her you argue 'No way WWE to add her in their Alumni or Hall of Fame', 'She is more Knockout, than WWE Diva/Superstar!' \nGail Kim's name stand to names like Melina, Ivelisse, Awesome Kong, Taya, Mickie James, Mia Yim etc. as worldwide Greatest female wrestlers. I know that she has a lot of bitter memories about WWE, but actually WWE gave her the start (even respect in the form of booking her winning the women's belt in a debut match, making a lot of history - first woman to win WWE Women's Championship in debut match and first Women's Champion from Korean descend). She was promoted as the female equivalent of Rey Mysterio, before injury forced her to specialize in submissions in her first run. \nGail become the foundation, the inaugural KO champion, the woman who help raising the TNA's KO division, with help from Awesome Kong, Velvet Sky and Angelina Love, Madison Rayne, ODB, Taryn Terrell, Jade, Rosemary, Sienna... she worked with different generations. She became the first to own major women's titles in WWE and Impact Wrestling.  \nHer second run with WWE... well, despite wonderful pool of talents like Melina, Beth Phoenix, Natalya, Eve Torres, Lay-Cool, she was pushed aside. She didn't get the award she deserve, her talent, was supressed, like many others. And this brought the rift between her and the company that debuted her worldwide. \nToday Kim is retiring. WWE is changed. Gail is changed. So both may made exception and to forgive and forget. To add Gail in their Alumni section will be a good start. We already have former Impact Wrestling stars in it. They can induct Kim in the Hall of Fame, because they already have one star included in Impact Wrestling's Hall of Fame - Kurt Angle! \nIt's time to not being that personal! It's time to be respectful!

We bought it at the end of February 2017 and didn't start using it till May, since our kitchen remodel wasn't yet finished. It worked fine until the end of October (same year) when it started burning everything within 10 minutes even though the oven temp was set to only 350 degrees. I called GE on October 31st and they set me up with a local appliance guy who looked at it on Nov 1. He said he never saw anything like it. He set it to 350 and the heat blew him back. It was already reading 750 before he even put the thermometer in the oven and there was no error code showing up. So he said not to use it. He had to order a couple parts which he said normally take 4-5 days. Well, 3 weeks later, the part still didn't come in and he told me it was backordered till December 4th! We'd already been without an oven for a month at this point. Called GE customer service and after some exchange I was put thru to a rep who said she expedited the part and it should be in 2 days later. Never showed up. I called the following monday and they said the order was canceled for some reason and reordered it for me. We got it 2 days later (the day before thanks giving) and of course the technician could not install it until the following monday. So we didn't have an oven for thanksgiving this year. terrible. Thankfully it's fixed now and i'm hoping it won't happen again. We did notice that now the digital readout no longer matches the green color of our GE microwave which we bought as a set with the side-by-side frig. The stove top is okay, although it can scratch easy. You can't use cast iron or ceramic pans on it. I think the writing around the knobs is kind of hard to read too. Not much contrast with the metal around it. Hoping this was a fluke, but if you buy it, get the extended warranty.
