We've a situation at the moment where people are going onto Job Seekers Allowance until they can get the state pension at 66. Jobseekers is around \u20ac50 to \u20ac60 less than the state pension.\" \nMs O'Flynn said the situation was not as clear cut and was becoming increasingly tricky in the private sector.\"Although people think there is a retirement age at 65, our legislation was brought into line with the rest of Europe in January 2016. Am employer cannot have a mandatory retirement age unless it's objectively justified. \"That includes something like succession planning or intergenerational fairness, health and safety issues or protecting the dignity of older workers,\" she said. \nShe said employers could find themselves in difficulty if they do not have a valid reason for forcing someone to retire at a particular age. \"If you're trying to rely on succession planning but you don't find a replacement you may find you're in difficulty. If people don't accept there is a mandatory retirement age, they could bring a claim to the WRC or a claim to the High Court to injunct that.\" \nCatherine O'Flynn explained that many contracts do have a specified retirement age. She said that applies \"especially to older contracts which often say 65 is the retirement date because that was the state pension payment age at the time, but the employer still has to find an objective justification for that date.\" More recent contracts might have retirement dates that reflect the state pension age as it increases, she added. \nMs O'Flynn said people were having success in taking cases. \"A fifth of claims brought in relation to discrimination have been on age grounds and they are successful if the employer can't point to a clear paper trail that there is an agreed mandatory retirement age in place. It's certainly something that employers need to put their mind to,\" she concluded. \n*** MORNING BRIEFS - The National Treasury Management agency has said it intends to borrow up to \u20ac18 billion on the bond markets next year.

Did you know that over 75% of startup businesses fail within the first 3 years? One-third of all of those fail within the first 6 months as well. If you want to make sure that you survive this crucial period then you need to make smart decisions very early on, while also ensuring that you are understanding of the various research you need to do. \nLimited company or sole trader? \nThe option that you choose here will ultimately determine the tax that you pay and if something happens, it will also determine how much legal and financial responsibility you have. When you are a sole trader, you can take all of the tax profits that you make but if you experience a bad situation with your business then you are responsible for all of this. \nThe competition \nThere is a high chance that your competition was in your position once. For this reason, it is a good idea for you to find out how they did it, what mistakes they made along the way and even what their customers like about them. This is also a good way to find out if you are even ready to start a business . You don\u2019t want to try and repeat their success, but you do want to learn the various steps they took in order to ensure their own success. If there is one big player who is continually dominating the market then find out what they don\u2019t do well, or what is bad about them. Find out who they don\u2019t cater for, or if there is a gap in the market that they aren\u2019t targeting. Then, try and fill this space. (rawpixel/Pexels.com) \nYour target audience \nIf you try and appeal to everyone then you won\u2019t actually end up appealing to anyone. You need to focus on your target audience and you also need to heavily monitor your marketing efforts as well. Ensure that you send out questionnaires and that you are also active on social media. The only way for you to make a huge amount of sales with a product is to make sure that people actually want it, so try and involve your customers in your product development as you test and try out various models or style options. The same concept applies if you want to offer a service. Ultimately, it is a good idea for you to make your customers feel as though they are a part of your voice and the movement and progress you are trying to make. \nPaying yourself \nHow will you take your wage home? You may have the best intentions when it comes to putting your profits back into your business but you do have to pay for your accommodation. Cut right back on any type of luxury products and live within your means. Your bank would rather see you doing this than you going back in 6 months to tell them that you have run out of money. (Pexels.com) \nBusiness name \nYour business name is quite possibly one of the most important decisions that you are going to make. Rebrands are expensive to say the least, and you will also have to set up a website domain that links to your business name as well. You need to communicate what your brand stands for, whether it is a geographical location or even the morals behind your business. \nStaffing requirements \nThink about it. Are you going to need staff from day 1? Or day 50? You need to have a plan when it comes to your staff and if you do have a lot then it helps to have a free employee scheduling software because this will help you to plan out the number of staff that you need and even the rota that you are going to have them on. Don\u2019t just jump into this blind and know exactly what each person is going to do before you hire them. Ultimately, you need to ask yourself, what do they bring to your business? What can they offer you? Could you do that job without them? This will help you to make the best decision regarding your own hiring situation and it is a really good way for you to keep everything organized. \nFind an accountant \nAn accountant is someone who does more than just count your money. They are a valuable and very trusted source of business advice. They usually have a ton of experience and they can also steer you away from making bad financial decisions. All you have to do is find a local accountant who has experience in your chosen business sector. Find someone who sees you as a success, not someone who sees you as a start-up. * * *", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:03.030+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ebe1d206e82123574b5cf61d6b1a42b561f11aac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWaagAUy5fmnKn3WvAWr.n_ILWwHnH6Zuusv5t43nRsbfKtVjMeMeGAxARLsp0ufHZAe2cByaHPx3sBt5hCfy_rKxhhYN4DT0LRy3r5THg3uiFn7kKSWmnTWIEfzvhkVhrR4yJuuUEo8Q-", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-kitchen-organizer-storage/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Kitchen Storage &amp; Accessories - Buy Kitchen Storage &amp; Accessories at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "5 In 1- multi colored Stainless Steel Food Container", "title_full": "5 In 1- multi colored Stainless Steel Food Container | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-06-29T17:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 26, "participants_count": 27, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b0a3ce7918698824c09963c40fdf1b6f1fef92ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWaagAUy5fmnKn3WvAWr.n_ILWwHnH6Zuusv5t43nRsbfKtVjMeMeGAxARLsp0ufHZAe2cByaHPx3sBt5hCfy_rKxhhYN4DT0LRy3r5THg3uiFn7kKSWmnTWIEfzvhkVhrTLB2UEwHgQEJI1ZZdZONnQ--", "ord_in_thread": 17, "author": "Ruzliah", "published": "2017-11-16T15:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "Good", "text": "Suitable for dry food.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:03.032+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ebe1d206e82123574b5cf61d6b1a42b561f11aac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWaagAUy5fmnKn3WvAWr.n_ILWwHnH6Zuusv5t43nRsbfKtVjMeMeGAxARLsp0ufHZAe2cByaHPx3sBt5hCfy_rKxhhYN4DT0LRy3r5THg3uiFn7kKSWmnTWIEfzvhkVhrR4yJuuUEo8Q-", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-kitchen-organizer-storage/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Kitchen Storage &amp; Accessories - Buy Kitchen Storage &amp; Accessories at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "5 In 1- multi colored Stainless Steel Food Container", "title_full": "5 In 1- multi colored Stainless Steel Food Container | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-06-29T17:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 26, "participants_count": 27, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "da96125970958b716fbf40201826117a8049e75e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWaagAUy5fmnKn3WvAWr.n_ILWwHnH6Zuusv5t43nRsbfKtVjMeMeGAxARLsp0ufHZAe2cByaHPx3sBt5hCfy_rKxhhYN4DT0LRy3r5THg3uiFn7kKSWmnTWIEfzvhkVhryl7l3_dWP.XdgMLIkfH0iw--", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "Wan", "published": "2017-11-27T10:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "Colourful Useful Container", "text": "Nice chrome colour.

Mrs. Theresa May repeated the same argument during question time.\nSince November 1 st , the opposition has passed a motion demanding the handing over of an impact assessment that has been conducted by the government. Theresa May\u2019s government is now claiming this 850-page forecast does not exit.\nMr. Davis claims the report that has been produced by the government is a sectoral analysis but not a forecast. That is not being delivered to the opposition.\nThe Brexit Secretary said that an assessment of the possible damage would have \u201czero\u201d significance because of the \u201cparadigmatic\u201d significance of leaving the EU.\nThe Labour, Liberal, and Scottish National Party opposition made clear that a forecast is urgently needed.

The only thing he did now about the report\u2019s content is that its conclusions would be \u201cunhelpful\u201d to the negotiations.\nThe leader of the opposition told Theresa May in parliament that the claim there was no impact assessment and refusing to hand over the report is \u201ca shambles.\u201d\nWhen Chancellor Philip Hammond was challenged whether he had conducted an impact assessment, he echoed the same argument suggesting that there is modelling of various scenarios but no forecast.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philip hammond", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scottish national party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brexi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:03.100+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dcd876dfcb5754dac3cb2f0a2067e1eb26e873df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pEJmYP03ByBGsrJ0edxZSXQ4YCScpmV4g", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/aco/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/aco/ - Adult Cartoons - 4chan", "title": "/stg/- Slave Trainer General/Maledom general", "title_full": "/aco/ - /stg/- Slave Trainer General/Maledom general - Adult Cartoons - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-06T14:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 34, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8172f9ab8d74c0dffc8def627ae0c04d711978ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pEJmYP03ByBGsrJ0edxZSXZ2kG48if4kV7TN_10ilfxU-", "ord_in_thread": 26, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T09:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>1928131\nthere's no logic to it, the dude's just simulating fucking everything.

Als Nachfolger der RD-4055 schreibt Horizon mit dem neuen Modell RD-4055DM nun einen h\u00f6heren Standard in puncto Qualit\u00e4t und Leistung fest: Die Stanzmaschine ist serienm\u00e4\u00dfig mit zwei Magnetzylindern ausgestattet - eine Variante, die bislang nur als Sonderausstattung verf\u00fcgbar war. K\u00fcrzeste R\u00fcstzeiten und hohe Qualit\u00e4t: Rotatives Stanzen mit der RD-4055DM erlaubt die Verarbeitung und Veredelung unterschiedlicher Materalien zu einer gro\u00dfen Bandbreite an Produkten, wie zum Beispiel Visitenkarten, Spielkarten, Etiketten, Pr\u00e4sentationsmappen, personalisierte Verpackungen oder Flyer in individuellen Formen und Formaten. Bei einer Verarbeitungsgeschwindigkeit bis zu 6.000 Bogen pro Stunde ist das System ausgelegt auf Materialformate von (minimal) 200 x 275 mm bis zu 400 x 550 mm (maximal), bei einem minimalen Stanzformat von 50 x 80 mm sowie m\u00f6glichen Materialst\u00e4rken zwischen 0,1 und 0,5 mm. Im Mittelpunkt des rotativen Stanzens steht dabei eine elektronische Bogensteuerung, mit deren Hilfe der Bogen in beide Richtungen (vorw\u00e4rts/r\u00fcckw\u00e4rts) transportiert und pr\u00e4zise positioniert wird. Damit ist auch die effiziente Herstellung von Mehrfachnutzen auf einem Bogen m\u00f6glich, womit der Kostenaufwand f\u00fcr Stanzwerkzeuge sp\u00fcrbar reduziert werden kann. W\u00e4hrend bei der RD-4055 Rillkan\u00e4le manuell auf dem Gegendruckzylinder aufgebracht werden mussten, werden beim neuen Modell mit Doppelmagnetzylinder Rillungen als Matrize/Patrize im oberen und unteren Stanzblech angelegt. Damit liefert die RD-4055DM nicht nur eine deutlich bessere Rillqualit\u00e4t, sondern eliminiert gleichzeitig eine m\u00f6gliche Fehlerquelle. Die Stanzbleche lassen sich auf den Magnetzylindern einfach und pr\u00e4zise montieren, sodass die R\u00fcstzeiten bei Auftragswechseln weiter verk\u00fcrzt werden und - je nach Produkt - nur noch f\u00fcnf bis zehn Minuten in Anspruch nehmen. Weitere Zeitvorteile liefert die integrierte Separiereinheit, in der die Stanzgitter automatisch abgeleitet sowie L\u00f6cher wahlweise mechanisch ausgesto\u00dfen oder mit Druckluft ausgeblasen werden k\u00f6nnen. Dank der hohen Flexibilit\u00e4t bei der Verarbeitung unterschiedlicher Materialien zu vielf\u00e4ltigen Produkten, bietet die RD-4055DM dem Anwender auf rentable Weise die M\u00f6glichkeit, das Portfolio zu erweitern und insbesondere bei kleineren Auflagen die betriebliche Wertsch\u00f6pfung nachhaltig zu erh\u00f6hen.

Whereas all homes may not be reached through fiber optic cable, they have now had a mobile channel they can use,\" said the chairman. \nThe company also becomes the first to offer free voice services. \"Voice will be free as long as the customer has bought a bandwidth bundle,\" said Chepkowny. \nZTE will be the company's strategy partner, enabling it to be the first in eastern and central Africa to launch the 4G Voice over Long Term Evolution (VoLTE) which is a standard for high-speed wireless communication for mobile phones and data terminals ensuring the best voice, video and internet quality and speeds. \nThe Chinese company termed the new development as historic for the east African country. \nKenya regulators Communication Authority of Kenya (CAK) said the launch on new faster and cheaper mobile and fiber data is a continuation of innovation in country's information communication sector which has helped continuously disrupt the industry. \n\"What we now need as a country are data analytics to guide us on the best way to structure data so that it becomes useful,\" said CAK Director-General Francis Wangusi. \nWangusi said the industry regulator is working to complete the IT-aided national addressing system by 2018 in a move that will make it easier to do electronic commerce. \nHenry Rotich, Kenya's Cabinet Secretary for The National Treasury, said the government will continue to work on policy and related measures to encourage private investments like those being done by Jamii Telecom. \nHe said the government has also invested in laying fiber optic cables across the country in a bid to make delivery of services efficient.

If we are breathing in this stuff every day, who knows what the long-term health effects might be?\u201d \u200b \nPfizer spokesperson Lisa O\u2019Neill quashed the rumours, telling us that while Pfizer is aware of the claims, emissions from manufacturing facilities have no effect on human health. \n\u201cPfizer manufacturing facilities operate to the highest environmental standards and are regulated and licensed by health authorities and environmental agencies which have strict protocols to ensure that emissions from manufacturing sites have no effect on human health or the environment,\u201d \u200bshe told us. \nLast week, the UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) announced \u200b Viagra Connect will be available without prescription in the UK following a request from Pfizer. \nSildenafil will continue to be made at the Ringaskiddy facility, but Viagra Connect will be manufactured in France.

Failing all else, how much might you be looking for? I might be able to help.\nI'd warn against trying to make the droppers too invisible because in the event of a problem you might struggle to find them. If you really do want them invisible, leave a chair off and solder to the underside of the rail and put half chairs on to hide.\nI've had a look at the boxfile (attached) and have changed some turnouts to curviform, which I think would be an improvement.

Is it accurate enough? I am a little worried about delamination too, But I did think it might be cheaper to buy some 3mm plywood sheets and make my own sleepers/timbers as I need alot and it would work out cheaper I think.\n2) My points are on curves, ranging from 38\" curve to like 50\"odd, Is it ok to use pre-assembled C&L crossings? as they are quite straight or the pre-made Vee's? Or would I need to custom build all that because they are on a curve? (see pictures below)\n3) I have started doing the whole \"nudge timbers\" in templot and I am wondering if anyone could just have a look to make sure I am doing it right? I have only done the one's on the main running line and the station area.. I didn't touch any that support the important rails and vee's as I know that's abit of a no no! (box file attached)\n4) Are there any special chairs I should use for the check chairs for 4-sf? As C&L don't do one's with the 1mm gap\n5 (bonus question) How do people go about hiding the dropper wires so that they remain hidden? I'm going with plastic fully functional chairs\nMany Thanks\n1 Personally speaking, unless you have a use for the Proxon other than cutting timbers I would buy them from C&L\n2 You might be able to gently curve pre-made Vees, on the other hand buy either an EMGS or Scalefour Vee filing jig. Very simple to use. Watch the inside radi on curved turnouts\n4 Use the Exactoscale 0.8 mm check chair cutting through one web and glueing the remaining half once the check rail is in situ (and in gauge)\n5 Normal method of wire soldered under the rail, through a hold is fine, as when ballasted is hidden\nBack to top Top", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:06.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2fb9c9dd6ab305871094b2aa8ae475b07d069878", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8wgtgEXMmfhmao1dFwb2yHIQyUFjPAwwdUK87qR2MlCeoR546khqxosFQltYaiuvU-", "site_full": "www.ecns.cn", "site": "ecns.cn", "site_section": "http://www.ecns.cn/rss/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["education", "business"], "section_title": "ecns", "title": "Three airlines to move to Beijing's new airport", "title_full": "Three airlines to move to Beijing's new airport", "published": "2017-12-07T19:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 11991, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2fb9c9dd6ab305871094b2aa8ae475b07d069878", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8wgtgEXMmfhmao1dFwb2yHIQyUFjPAwwdUK87qR2MlCeoR546khqxosFQltYaiuvU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T19:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "Three airlines to move to Beijing's new airport", "text": "Three airlines to move to Beijing's new airport 1 2017-12-07 17:16 Xinhua Editor: Mo Hong'e ECNS App Download \nThree airlines are set to move to Beijing's new international airport, slated to open in 2019, authorities said Thursday. \nCooperative agreements have been signed between the district government of Daxing, where the new airport is located, and China Southern, China Eastern and Capital Airlines. \nChina Eastern Airlines will build a 13.2-billion-yuan (nearly 2 billion U.S. dollars) base at the new airport, where its aircraft maintenance, catering, ground services, cargo handling, offices, and employee accommodation will be located. \nThe airline aims to operate between 150 and 200 flight routes from the new airport, serving international destinations in the Americas, Europe, Australia, southeast and northeast Asia, among others. \nChina Southern Airlines will build a 1.08 million-square-meter base at the new airport for its 20,000-plus employees. The airline will operate 250 planes at the new airport by 2025. \nCapital Airlines will operate 50 airplanes at the new airport in 2019 and the number of airplanes will be increased to 150 by 2025. \nThe new airport, located 46 km south of Beijing's city center, is being built to take pressure off the overcrowded Beijing Capital International Airport, located in the northeastern suburbs. \nThe distance between two airports will be about 67 km. \nThe new airport has been designed to handle up to 72 million passengers and 2 million tonnes of cargo each year by 2025. It will have four runways and accommodate 620,000 flights per year.

The Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) and other organizations have applauded this effort, as it furthers the independence of education and helps to align international codes with current United States standards. \nHowever, because of financial constraints in many markets around the world, healthcare providers depend on outside support to attend US-based meetings. Therefore, it is possible that your annual meeting may see some changes in 2018 and beyond.

Das Inhaberehepaar Sylke und J\u00fcrgen Neumann, die nun schon 20 Jahre der Flair Hotelkooperation angeh\u00f6ren, freuen sich sehr \u00fcber diese Auszeichnung. Sylke Neumann: \"Wir sind ein ganz pers\u00f6nliches, kleines Hotel. Jeder findet bei uns etwas f\u00fcr seinen Anspruch. Das ist es was den Urlaub bei uns ausmacht. Durch die Flair-Ehrung f\u00fchlen wir uns in unserem Tun sehr best\u00e4tigt. Unser Dank gilt auch unseren stets zuverl\u00e4ssigen Mitarbeitern.\" Das 4 Sterne Hotel, zu dem auch ein Ponyhof und ein Streichelzoo sowie ein Badesee geh\u00f6ren, liegt nur wenige Kilometer von Bad Zwischenahn entfernt und ist eine wahre Erholungsoase inmitten herrlicher Natur. Von hier aus kann man wunderbare Radtouren und Wanderungen unternehmen. Der Wellnessbereich des Hauses sorgt f\u00fcr Entspannung. Von der Gartensauna hat man einen sch\u00f6nen Blick in den gepflegten Garten. F\u00fcr die K\u00fcche ist J\u00fcrgen Neumann verantwortlich. Ob Matjesbuffet oder Rinderfilet, die Speisen sind von hoher Qualit\u00e4t und die K\u00fcche vom Flair Hotel Hubertus ist weit \u00fcber die Grenzen des Ammerlandes bekannt und beliebt. Zum Flair Koch des Jahres 2018 ist Michael Preis gew\u00e4hlt worden, K\u00fcchenchef des Flair Hotels Gr\u00fcner Baum in Donaueschingen. Mit viel Elan f\u00fchrt Michael Preis in f\u00fcnfter Generation das Flair Hotel Gr\u00fcner Baum in Donaueschingen im S\u00fcdschwarzwald. Er selbst steht mit gro\u00dfer Leidenschaft am Herd und seine K\u00fcche hat sich mittlerweile zum Geheimtipp in der Region entwickelt. F\u00fcr sein Engagement und seine Kochkunst auf h\u00f6chstem Niveau erhielt er jetzt die begehrte Flair-Auszeichnung. \"Schon als kleiner Junge hab ich bei meinem Vater in die T\u00f6pfe geschaut\", erinnert sich Michael Preis. Denn seit er denken kann, war f\u00fcr den Flair Koch des Jahres 2018 klar, dass er Koch werden m\u00f6chte. Dieses Ziel hat er ohne Umwege verfolgt und sich st\u00e4ndig weiterentwickelt. \"Ich experimentiere gern\", erkl\u00e4rt Michael Preis. So stehen auf der Speisekarte viele moderne Gerichte oder klassische Gerichte neu interpretiert. Kreativ sein und die verschiedensten Lebensmittel miteinander kombinieren, das gef\u00e4llt dem Koch. Aber auch traditionelle Klassiker kocht Michael Preis. Auf der Speisekarte sind sie unter \"Omas K\u00fcche\" zu finden. \"Das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Kompliment f\u00fcr uns ist, wenn wir neue G\u00e4ste mit unseren Kreationen \u00fcberraschen\", so Michael Preis. Informativ und bereichernd f\u00fcr alle Beteiligten war der Vortrag von J\u00f6rg Ristau vom Institut f\u00fcr Kulturwandel und Teamentwicklung in Hamburg. In seinem spannenden Vortrag ging es um Markenbildung, Mitarbeitergewinnung sowie die eigene Rolle, die man im Unternehmen hat und wie man sie ausf\u00fcllt und auch regelm\u00e4\u00dfig hinterfragt. Wie begeistert man heute die Arbeitnehmer, wie will die Generation Y arbeiten, wie kann ich sie als Arbeitgeber erreichen, was muss ich bieten? Viele Ideen, viele Anregungen und viele Antworten. Ein Vortrag, der es in sich hatte und viele Gespr\u00e4che unter den Kollegen entfacht hat. Neuer Hotelkatalog und neue Homepage Auf der Tagung wurden auch der neue Hotelkatalog sowie die komplett neu relaunchte Homepage pr\u00e4sentiert. Es gibt viel Neues zu entdecken bei beiden Produkten. Bei beiden steht die Region im Fokus. Auf Doppelseiten werden im neuen Katalog jedes Haus, die Region sowie die Gastgeberfamilien gro\u00dfz\u00fcgig vorgestellt. Auf der Homepage wird noch intensiver auf die Region und die M\u00f6glichkeiten, die die jeweilige Umgebung bietet, eingegangen. Die Webseite h\u00e4lt noch mehr Details und Informationen f\u00fcr Interessierte bereit. F\u00fcr die Mitglieder ist die j\u00e4hrliche Tagung immer von gro\u00dfer Bedeutung. Es gibt nicht nur neue Informationen, es finden vor allem untereinander viele Gespr\u00e4che statt, die wertvolle Inspirationen bringen und viel Kreativit\u00e4t freisetzen. Es tut gut, zu h\u00f6ren, dass man mit seinen Problemen nicht allein ist und oftmals ergeben sich durch den internen Austausch auch L\u00f6sungen, auf die man nicht so ohne weiteres gekommen w\u00e4re.

Since modern times, people in the developing world have fought long and hard for national liberation and independence, for freedom and equality, for dignity and happiness, and for peace and development. By doing so, they have also contributed significantly to the progress of human rights in the world. \nFollowing a people-centered development philosophy, the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese government have all along placed people's interests above all else, and worked hard to meet people's desire for a better life and improve respect for and protection of the fundamental rights of the Chinese people. The 19th CPC National Congress convened not long ago outlined an ambitious blueprint for China's development, which will give a strong boost to human rights development in China and make new and even greater contribution to the progress of mankind. \nThe development of human rights worldwide cannot be achieved without the joint efforts of developing countries, which account for more than 80% of the world's population. In the meantime, human rights must and can only be promoted in light of specific national conditions and people's needs. Developing countries should uphold both the universality and particularity of human rights and steadily raise the level of human rights protection. It is important for the international community to respect and reflect the will of the people in developing countries in the spirit of justice, fairness, openness and inclusiveness. The Chinese people would like to work in concert with people in other developing countries and beyond to advance development through cooperation, promote human rights through development, and build a community with a shared future for human beings. \nThe theme of this forum \"Building a Community of Shared Future for Human Beings: New Opportunity for South-South Human Rights Development\" is highly relevant as it reflects the trend of the world toward greater development.

(Dec. 6)\nMedia: Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Doctors treating the U.S. embassy victims of suspected attacks in Cuba have discovered brain abnormalities as they search for clues to explain hearing, vision, balance and memory damage, The Associated Press has learned.\nIt's the most specific finding to date about physical damage, showing that whatever it was that harmed the Americans, it led to perceptible changes in their brains. The finding is also one of several factors fueling growing skepticism that some kind of sonic weapon was involved.\nMedical testing has revealed the embassy workers developed changes to the white matter tracts that let different parts of the brain communicate, several U.S. officials said, describing a growing consensus held by university and government physicians researching the attacks. White matter acts like information highways between brain cells.\nLoud, mysterious sounds followed by hearing loss and ear-ringing had led investigators to suspect \"sonic attacks.\" But officials are now carefully avoiding that term. The sounds may have been the byproduct of something else that caused damage, said three U.S. officials briefed on the investigation. They weren't authorized to discuss it publicly and demanded anonymity.\nPhysicians, FBI investigators and U.S. intelligence agencies have spent months trying to piece together the puzzle in Havana , where the U.S. says 24 U.S. government officials and spouses fell ill starting last year in homes and later in some hotels. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Wednesday he's \"convinced these were targeted attacks ,\" but the U.S. doesn't know who's behind them. A few Canadian Embassy staffers also got sick.\nDoctors still don't know how victims ended up with the white matter changes, nor how exactly those changes might relate to their symptoms. U.S. officials wouldn't say whether the changes were found in all 24 patients.\nPhoto: Desmond Boylan, AP Image 1 of / 3 3 FILE - In this Oct. 3, 2017, file photo, tourists ride classic convertible cars on the Malecon beside the United States Embassy in Havana, Cuba.

You've got a sophisticated intelligence apparatus. You probably know who's doing it. You can stop it,\" Tillerson said. \"It's as simple as that.\"\nThe case has plunged the U.S. medical community into uncharted territory. Physicians are treating the symptoms like a new, never-seen-before illness. After extensive testing and trial therapies, they're developing the first protocols to screen cases and identify the best treatments \u2014 even as the FBI investigation struggles to identify a culprit, method and motive.\nDoctors treating the victims wouldn't speak to the AP, yet their findings are expected to be discussed in an article being submitted to the Journal of the American Medical Association, U.S. officials said. Physicians at the University of Miami and the University of Pennsylvania who have treated the Cuba victims are writing it, with input from the State Department's medical unit and other government doctors.\nBut the article won't speculate about what technology might have harmed the workers or who would have wanted to target Americans in Cuba. If investigators are any closer to solving those questions, their findings won't be made public.\nThe AP first reported in August that U.S. workers reported sounds audible in parts of rooms but inaudible just a few feet away \u2014 unlike normal sound, which disperses in all directions. Doctors have now come up with a term for such incidents: \"directional acoustic phenomena.\"\nMost patients have fully recovered, some after rehabilitation and other treatment, officials said. Many are back at work. About one-quarter had symptoms that persisted for long periods or remain to this day.\nEarlier this year, the U.S. said doctors found patients had suffered concussions, known as mild traumatic brain injury, but were uncertain beyond that what had happened in their brains. Concussions are often diagnosed based solely on symptoms.\nStudies have found both concussions and white matter damage in Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans who survived explosions yet had no other physical damage. But those injuries were attributed mostly to shock waves from explosions. No Havana patients reported explosions or blows to the head.\nOutside medical experts said that when the sample of patients is so small, it's difficult to establish cause and effect.\n\"The thing you have to wonder anytime you see something on a scan: Is it due to the episode in question, or was it something pre-existing and unrelated to what happened?\" said Dr. Gerard Gianoli, an ear and brain specialist in Louisiana.\nAs Cuba works to limit damage to its reputation and economy, its government has produced TV specials and an online summit about its own investigation. Cuba's experts have concluded that the Americans' allegations are scientifically impossible.\nThe Cubans have urged the U.S. to release information about what it's found. FBI investigators have spent months comparing cases to pinpoint what factors overlap.\nU.S. officials told the AP that investigators have now determined:\n\u2014 The most frequently reported sound patients heard was a high-pitched chirp or grating metal. Fewer recalled a low-pitched noise, like a hum.\n\u2014 Some were asleep and awakened by the sound, even as others sleeping in the same bed or room heard nothing.\n\u2014 Vibrations sometimes accompanied the sound. Victims told investigators these felt similar to the rapid flutter of air when windows of a car are partially rolled down.\n\u2014 Those worst off knew right away something was affecting their bodies. Some developed visual symptoms within 24 hours, including trouble focusing on a computer screen.\nThe U.S. has not identified any specific precautions it believes can mitigate the risk for diplomats in Havana, three officials said, although an attack hasn't been reported since late August. Since the Americans started falling ill last year, the State Department has adopted a new protocol for workers before they go to Cuba that includes bloodwork and other \"baseline\" tests. If they later show symptoms, doctors can retest and compare.\nDoctors still don't know the long-term medical consequences and expect that epidemiologists, who track disease patterns in populations, will monitor the 24 Americans for life. Consultations with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are underway.\n___\nAP Medical Writer Lauran Neergaard contributed to this report.\n___\nReach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP .

As a first step, Maybank Islamic initiated the pilot launch of its rent-to-own (RTO) home scheme, called HouzKEY, targeted at properties priced under RM1 million. For now, the product is limited to the bank\u2019s employees but should become available to the public early next year. The bank is aiming for a portfolio size of RM1 billion within the first year. According to experts, this is just the beginning of more RTO schemes to come as several other Islamic banks are expected to launch their own versions.
