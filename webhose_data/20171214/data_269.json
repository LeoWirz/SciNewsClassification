Warbird's birth mother was an alien slave brought from a conquered world whose body wasn't meant to birth a Shi'ar and so she died after giving birth to Ava'Dara. Ava'Dara worked in a war factory and learned how to assemble a pulse cannon before she learned how to talk. Ava'Dara loved to draw as a child but she would burn her drawings as she considered what she liked wasn't the way of the Shi'ar. She trained and gained the Warbird title in an academy [4] . At unknown point in her life she conducted \"mating rituals\" with someone while trapped inside another being and surrounded by flesh eating monster aliens. [5] After showing mercy to a child in a mission, the Shi'ar wanted her to hate children so her punishment was that she was sent by Emperor Gladiator , to escort Kid Gladiator as his personal bodyguard. Kid Gladiator was sent to Earth as a punishment for destroying more than half of the Shi'ar royal city on Chandilar , so she was brought with him to \"protect\" his son from danger. [6] [4] Jean Grey School for Higher Learning \nWarbird arrived with Kid Gladiator to Earth at the first day for school. During an attack on the Jean Grey School of Higher Learning by Krakoa , Warbird fought Krakoa and the Frankenstein monsters. When Iceman formed a group of ice-clones to fight Frankenstein monsters Warbird shows some romantic interest in one of the ice-clones. [7] Exodus attack \nWhen Exodus attacked the Jean Grey School and the students were sent to the safe room for their safety, Warbird went with Kid Gladiator and refused to let Rogue take part of his power to fight Exodus and when Rogue teleported and took part of his power through a kiss on the cheek Warbird became enraged and said she would kill her, but Kubark told her she was pardoned by royal decree. [8] The Brood Attack \nWarbird tried to stop Kid Gladiator from entering Kitty's body but failed. [9] . When she entered Kitty's body along with the other X-men they found Kid Gladiator only to lose him again and when they find him again, they discover that he wasn't himself as the Brood turned him into one of them. [10] \nWarbird and Iceman were left to hold Kid Gladiator while Beast tried to destroy the egg sac inside the infected Kitty. After Kid Gladiator used his heat vision on Iceman's head, Iceman responded with restoring his face and beating Kid Gladiator up to which Warbird asked him to stop doing it. Later on, Warbird confessed to Bobby that she considers him to be, without a doubt, the most vigorous male she has encountered since arriving to Earth and asked him if he ever conducted \"mating rituals\" with someone while trapped inside another being and surrounded by flesh eating monster aliens, because she did once to which Bobby answered with a low voice that it was a good time for Kid Gladiator to melt off his ears. After the egg sac is destroyed and Kid Gladiator is subdued the team leaves Kitty's body through her mouth. While Kitty was taken by S.W.O.R.D. to be cured from the remained Brood inside her she kissed Bobby while Warbird was watching and she did not seem too happy about it. [5] The Marauders \nWarbird entered Gambit's apartment with a decapitated head in her hand saying: it has begun, and when the Marauders broke into the apartment she helped the team fight them. [11] When Iceman was hurt by Chimera she was shown to be worried about him. She choose to fight Vanisher from the Marauders and told him she will find a way to cut his head off. When Iceman covered the area she thought it was magnificent and when Bobby noted she is looking at in a weird way she told him she wanted to conduct \"mating rituals\" with him right now. [12] Return to the Shi'ar \nWarbird eventually left Earth and rejoined the Shi'ar Empire. She later joined the Shi'ar in its fight against the Asgardians . [13] [14] Powers and Abilities Powers \nAva'Dara is a Royal Warbird of Deathbringer Class [2] with the following abilities: Superhuman Strength: As a Shi'ar , Warbird possesses enough strength to lift 1 ton in Earth -like gravity.

According to data published by the Madagascar Ministry of Health, the number of new infections has been steadily declining in recent weeks. This indicates that measures taken to contain the outbreak have been effective, but more infections of both bubonic and pneumonic plague are expected until the end of April. \u201cI congratulate the Government of Madagascar for the way it has worked with partners to contain this outbreak. This is just the type of leadership needed to prevent outbreaks spiralling out of control,\u201d Dr Ghebreyesus added. Between August 1 and November 22, the Madagascar Ministry of Public Health reported 2 348 cases, including 202 deaths. Nearly all identified plague patients and almost 7 300 contacts were provided with treatment free of charge. Ongoing support to sustain the response was required for comprehensive case finding, active contact identification and treatment, rodent and flea control, and ensuring safe and dignified burials, WHO said in a statement.

A Bamar is a member of the majority ethnic group. \u2018Burmese\u2019 refers to citizenship or the language. People from minority ethnic groups can be very offended if one equates the two terms or implies that only Bamar can be Burmese. This exclusion can be deeply hurtful and referential to the real persecution people have experienced.\nRefer to people by their chosen identity. Many from ethnic minorities may not actually want to be referred to as \u2018Burmese\u2019 and will prefer to use their ethnic identity, e.g. Karen, Chin, Rohingya. The Karen people may be particularly opposed to being called Burmese.\nBe sensitive to the reality that many Burmese living in other countries may have experienced trauma of some kind. This includes abuse by security forces, witnessing the death of family members, forced separation from family and impoverishment from a lack of basic resources. Political dissidents may have experienced interrogation, imprisonment or even torture.\nConsider that upfront honesty is not always appreciated. The Burmese are generally quite discreet unless they know someone very well.\nIf discussing a sensitive topic, add lots of reassurance throughout conversation to put your Burmese counterpart at ease .\nExpect to be asked where you are going, when you last ate and what you are doing quite often. This is a cultural norm and is not intended to be intrusive.\nDress modestly with your shoulders, chest and upper thigh covered.\nDo not\u2019s\nDo not assume that a Burmese person\u2019s visible behaviour will indicate how they really feel. They generally have a very sunny demeanour \u2013 smiling and laughing a lot \u2013 which can lead foreigners to believe they are unaffected by conversation. In some cases, foreigners can feel overly reassured by a Burmese person\u2019s cheerfulness and jump to the conclusion that they\u2019re comfortable enough to joke about, criticise or discuss things that actually offend or hurt their counterpart more than they realise.\nAvoid being openly critical or pointing out mistakes. The Burmese tend to take criticism quite personally . For example, if they have taken you to a restaurant and you do not like a dish served, commenting on its quality may be taken as a comment on their skills as a host even though they did not prepare the dish. Such occurrences can quickly cause a Burmese person to lose face.\nDo not push a Burmese person to talk about politics. Though the situation is improving in Myanmar, decades of censorship and persecution created a culture of silence. Free speech is not taken for granted and some Burmese may still feel uncomfortable telling you their opinion out of fear for the consequences, especially if they have family remaining in Myanmar.\nDo not eat food or drinks that have been left out as spiritual offerings.\nAvoid complaining unless it is totally necessary. Many Burmese have endured a lot of hardship and are very stoic about their problems. Whinging is frowned upon.\nDo not raise your voice or lose your temper. Losing control of one\u2019s emotions even in the most frustrating situations is a sign of poor upbringing and is likely to make you lose face in a Burmese person\u2019s eyes.\nAvoid talking about yourself too much or boasting. The Burmese are especially humble people.\nrecord_voice_over\nhttps://culturalatlas.sbs.com.au/bur...7-f7f3af00c2a3 Reply With Quote: 07-12-2017, 05:52 PM #18 Simon43 Thailand Expat\nJoin Date Jan 2009 Last Online Today @ 09:38 AM Location Naypyidaw, Myanmar Posts 2,226 Dillinger, think you're going a bit over the top there mate.\nRude word on the whiteboard, students have a good laugh, we talk about where/when this word should be used, end of story\nForgot to add:\nCut out this crap about Burmese culture.

Don't really expect Western school systems to pursue such esoteric subject matter as an obscure, or even well known, Burman king, do ya?

I'd have done what I always do when any teacher has been ill-mannered enough not to wipe their board clean when finished. It happens a lot in the ME.\nI'd have wiped it and got on with my lesson, after clarifying with the girls how it had got there.\nSeriously...that could have developed into a world of shit for you. Glad it seems that it probably hasn't.

Absolutely no way. This is not a PC school in Surbiton. If I considered it 'risky' to broach the subject, then I would have just cleaned the board. I know my students very well and provide them with the information and explanations that they should know as teenagers and soon-to-be young adults.

Heck, I didn't know about Poms, Chavs, Convicts and socks with sandals until I began reading TD.\nFor that matter, I only read about the \"rusty trombone\" and \"mooning\" on this site. So it's possible that the teacher (female) didn't really know the C word. She may not also have grown up as privileged (unlike your students now, since they're in an international or private school, so they must have rich parents). Maybe the teacher grew up poor & didn't have much money to watch Hollywood movies (and maybe they weren't shown on TV either).

How about exercising some common sense? Corbett was going to turn the chicken over to the fox that guards the hen house? \nThat\u2019s really poor judgment, but not unexpected considering the politics. This leads to questions about Corbett\u2019s values. Shouldn\u2019t she have sent this letter and all others like it to the state police or the state attorney general? \nIt\u2019s probably a good thing that Tompkins\u2019 letter was misplaced. Where have the people on the district attorney\u2019s staff been all these years? Apparently, the welfare of female inmates at the prison is of no concern. It\u2019s the political network at work. \nIt\u2019s important to remember that many of these people are not hard-core criminals. Here are some words to consider when politics are concerned: competence and political cronyism. \nIt\u2019s time to get the state involved and end to this abuse and cover-up. \nRON NEMO \nSCRANTON \nFixed income gripe \nEditor: While I did not yet hit the Powerball jackpot, a notice arrived recently in the mail from the Social Security Administration informing me that next year my new benefit amount will soar by 2 percent. \nI think now I could afford the new Lexus I always have dreamed about buying. I first did the math and realized that the new amount the government will take for my Medicare medical insurance amounted to two-thirds of the Social Security raise, leaving me with a net gain of just over $10 per month. \nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to cut it with the Lexus dealership. But at least I can now afford to buy my doxies a few more cans of Alpo. \nWILLIAM SPEARE \nGLENBURN \nAll hands on deck \nEditor: A new year fast approaches and the Navy has released the names of some of its secretly commissioned ships along with their capabilities. \nThere is an attack submarine called the Slick Willie. It specializes in deep-water intrusions. It can violate the regions of unwilling participants without being held accountable. Its special power is that it does all of its violating while going undetected by the far too liberally blind mainstream media. \nThen there is the USS HRC. It is a dirigible and the mother ship of the Slick Willie. As such, it enables the Slick Willie\u2019s violations. It is kept afloat with hot air. Examples include, \u201cI was targeted and fired upon by rebel snipers,\u201d and \u201cI never sent or received any classified documents on my illegal and unsecured server.\u201d In the year 2000 it was used to pilfer furniture from the White House. \nIts special power is the capability of siphoning huge sums of money from foreign governments. Alas, once it was deemed that the HRC had noting left to offer the money source dried up. \nFRANK ESPOSITO \nMOOSIC  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "willie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie tompkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tompkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "william speare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "esposito", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corbett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trish corbett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "navy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hrc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social security administration", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lackawanna county prison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moosic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scranton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lackawanna county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:04.063+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ddf0dd6d76f72148d5749a419730b8022e923498", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_msa_0mvgXuvPkZE4XEtaWVE", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/co/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/co/ - Comics &amp;
