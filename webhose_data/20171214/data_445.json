China is becoming a key market to watch, as it\u2019s leading the direction for other markets across Asia. Rising bond yields are threatening corporate profit margins for the second largest economy; meanwhile Chinese authorities are helping to drag equities lower, after sending alarming messages about a potential bubble being created in large-cap firms. Given that China continues to focus on quality rather than quantity growth, it\u2019s not surprising to witness action of this nature from the Chinese government in an attempt to mitigate bubbles in asset prices. However, such actions may have a negative impact on sentiments that could spread across other Asian markets.\nU.S. equity traders are in a wait-and-see mode. President Trump will meet senators today at their weekly policy lunch, to ensure that Republicans are on the same page regarding the tax system overhaul. I firmly believe that U.S. legislative tax reforms are strongly \u201cpriced in\u201d the U.S. markets, thus if significant tax reforms do not pass, I expect a substantial decline in major indices, particularly in small caps. Given that the effective tax rate currently stands at around 27%, taxes should be brought below 25% to be effective. Republican Senator Ron Johnson said he would vote against the bill unless his concerns about the legislation are resolved. Given that other Republican Senators share Johnson worries on deficit implications, passing the bill does not seem to be a done deal yet.\nCurrency markets were trading in narrow ranges early Tuesday, as investors brace for UK bank stress test results, BoE\u2019s Carney Speech and the Fed speech, including Powell\u2019s Congressional address. On the data front, the U.S. Goods Trade Balance, and the Housing Price Index are likely to have minimal impact on the USD.\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin scored a new record high of $9,886 in an attempt to break above the critical $10,000 threshold. Bitcoin has become a very hot topic and many fund managers have raised the price target for the cryptocurrency. Yesterday, former Fortress hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz commented on CNBC, that bitcoin could be at $40,000 by the end of 2018 and he expects that total market capitalization could reach $2 trillion, from $309 billion currently. I think that we will hear more skyrocket predictions, but few will provide an economic metric that supports their valuations. It will be interesting to see how the market reacts when Bitcoin breaks above $10,000.\nMore Info Here", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.forextime.com/market-analysis", "http://www.imghost.in/images/2017/11/28/shutterstock_444206605.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:09.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "46aeab613a0b39a6137ca6c8d250ccdcf411f800", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pCoxWmXjUMLnNK2w4tGIY22pG6or_Vu_R", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/gif/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/gif/ -

However, the Bank of Canada (BoC) is one that we should all be paying attention to as in the next 24 hours they will have their monthly interest rate decision, as well as follow up conference to the market. Now a interest rate is not priced in at present \u2013 in fact the odds are very low, but the BoC has a habit of surprising markets and the recent employment figures were very positive adding further weight to the potential for a rise. I don\u2019t anticipate we will see a surprise interest rate jump, however the words that will be used will be vital for the market when it comes to pricing in the next interest rate rise and of course are likely to have a big impact on the Canadian dollar. It\u2019s not always about oil for the Canadian economy, but one thing is clear there is certainly more to offer on the trading calendar than oil updates.\nSo far the USDCAD has been a big mover and has held up nicely on the charts in preparation for the upcoming announcement. So far the USD has been losing ground against the CAD after traders were quick to attack on USD weakness and the strong jobs report. Any movements higher on the USDCAD were likely to struggle regardless with resistance at 1.2759 and 1.2921, but also with the 200 day moving average starting to ebb lower and showing a pattern of being respected strongly by the USDCAD. Movements lower are likely to find support at 1.2628 and 1.2516 in the current market, but I would also watch out for the oil figures as well, as a strong drawdown would put further bearish pressure on the USDCAD.\nOne of the key metal markets which has been moving sharply lower recently has been silver which has been reacting sharply to the boost in equities. There has been talk recently that metals could potentially be replaced by Bitcoin and the likes, but I don\u2019t believe they represent a tangible hedge like precious metals do in the current environment. What is clear that the US economy booming is starting to have a negative effect on the price of silver and the market is starting to shift lower as a response.\nI\u2019ve always been a fan of silver and the trend is looking quite strong on the charts so far for the bears. Support has held up nicely at 15.996, with the potential to move event further lower to 15.556. Resistance is currently high in 16 dollar region at 16.546 and 16.863 at this stage. All in all though the bearish trend is strong and could continue in the current environment if we don\u2019t see any large hiccups.\nMore Info Here", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.forextime.com/market-analysis", "https://www.forextime.com/images/maa/xagusddaily_26.png?itok=c8C32PnU", "https://www.forextime.com/images/maa/usdcaddaily_39.png?itok=Wz5fi_hk", "http://www.imghost.in/images/2017/12/06/shutterstock_444206605.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:09.030+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "46aeab613a0b39a6137ca6c8d250ccdcf411f800", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pCoxWmXjUMLnNK2w4tGIY22pG6or_Vu_R", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/gif/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/gif/ -

As predicted the FED was positive about the possibility of a December rate hike before the year goes out, and the market has aptly priced this in. Markets on the other hand were caught off by certain members reluctance to actually lift rates as they felt inflation was starting to slow down and the previous large rises may not continue going forward. Now with Yellen set to resign and the new head of the FED taking over, it may be the case that we do see more hawkish movements. But the board is a democratic vote, so unless we see real movement there it becomes very unlikely at this stage and the doves could be staying on for some time.\nFor traders the USD sell off in safe-haven currencies was strong with the USD losing a number of points especially against the Yen. USDJPY was by far the most volatile trade of today, which surprised many given how flat it had recently been, but markets were quick to punish the FED over its dovish comments. One of the major reasons behind the sudden appreciation of the Yen is that thus far Abenomics has not been as active as expected and it continues to be at a risk of being devalued quickly. It\u2019s also a fantastic storage for traders looking for some sort of safety within the markets and a traditional one at that as well. However, for the USDJPY bears the time to jump was today and they certainly did.\nUSDJPY bears crashed through the 200 day moving average ruthlessly as they looked to push the pairs to strong support levels. Support at 111.133 was able to holt the downward trend, but so far is the only thing holding back the USDJPY from storming any lower. Markets looking to swing lower further are likely to find another strong level of support at 110.202, but the market may take some breather here and give up some gains. For traders looking for a bounce higher then resistance can be found at 111.944 and 112.787. The reality for the bulls jumping back in though is slim, as this bearish trend is likely to push traders back in the water in search of blood.\nAfter the recent failures of traders to break through resistance at 114.359 over the previous month, it\u2019s no surprise that the market has jumped on a bearish trend. The question is though will it continue to run, or will markets look to pause and take stock of the volatility we\u2019ve seen today. My thoughts are that it could potentially slow down but still trend, which would be promising for traders looking for an easy wave.\nMore Info Here", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.forextime.com/market-analysis", "http://www.imghost.in/images/2017/11/23/shutterstock_129030494_19.jpg", "https://www.forextime.com/images/maa/usdjpydaily_89.png?itok=O4JuUNVs"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:09.033+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f9306ff760b1ade9253db8cbab4511d9b59ecd9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKwMy_NnEGcnKumoa7aPxZQzPziABewt7QxIhi4W6Qr8FMYbF.A4RffRnYh2X_Zc8zpIF4tCBazhyk_5gyCxr7VUc89rHLNGGYQBwOahYdr.PMStbTxgfOiuw3cRBPaORdtu2k0VAPFZ3Q--", "site_full": "profile.empowr.com", "site": "empowr.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["education", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "empowr", "title_full": "empowr", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "//secure.fbstatic.com/images/Empowr/empowrDefaultStory_long.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9245, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f9306ff760b1ade9253db8cbab4511d9b59ecd9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKwMy_NnEGcnKumoa7aPxZQzPziABewt7QxIhi4W6Qr8FMYbF.A4RffRnYh2X_Zc8zpIF4tCBazhyk_5gyCxr7VUc89rHLNGGYQBwOahYdr.PMStbTxgfOiuw3cRBPaORdtu2k0VAPFZ3Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "empowr", "text": "Connect your FanBox to Facebook or Twitter & keep your friends updated with all your activity on Fanbox.

European markets concluded mostly higher on Tuesday and may open on a positive note today as market players continue to shrug off the political uncertainty in Europe. With U.S. stock indexes marching to record highs yesterday as technology and health stocks rallied, it will be interesting to see if the upside momentum is maintained this afternoon.\nChancellor Philip Hammond in the spotlight\nChancellor Philip Hammond will be in the limelight today as he presents the U.K. budget statement to the House of Commons. While Hammond\u2019s speech may revolve around managing the housing crisis, investors will be paying attention to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) which is expected to trim Britain\u2019s GDP growth forecasts. If the overall tone of the budget statement is gloomy and Brexit concerns making an appearance, Sterling is likely to find itself under renewed selling pressure.\nTaking a look at the technical outlook, the GBPUSD has found light support at 1.3230. An intraday breakout above 1.3250 could encourage a further incline towards 1.3300. Alternatively, a failure for prices to keep above 1.3230 may encourage a decline to 1.3150.\nDollar lower ahead of FOMC minutes\nThe Greenback weakened against a basket of currencies on Tuesday, after Yellen\u2019s cautious remarks reinforced market expectations of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates at a gradual pace.\nYellen cautioned that raising interest rates too quickly could obstruct the Feds efforts to reach the golden 2% target and reiterated the fact that this year\u2019s low U.S. inflation remained a mystery. With the outgoing Fed chair uncertain over the stubbornly low inflation being transitory, investors were left pondering over how this could influence the central bank\u2019s monetary policy strategy in 2018.\nMuch attention will be directed towards the minutes from the latest FOMC meeting this evening which should offer further clues on the central bank\u2019s outlook future interest rate increases. With markets widely expecting U.S. interest rates to be increased in December, investors are likely to closely scrutinize the minutes for fresh insight into monetary policy beyond 2017.\nThe Dollar could receive a boost if the minutes are presented with a hawkish touch, alternatively, if the minutes express concerns over low inflation and fail to bring anything new to the table, sellers may make a move. From a technical standpoint, the Dollar Index is coming under pressure on the daily charts with resistance found at 94.00. Sustained weakness below this level may encourage a further decline towards 93.50. Alternatively, a breach back above 94.15 puts this current bearish setup at risk, with the next level of interest at 94.50.\nMore Info Here", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.forextime.com/images/maa/gbpusddaily_388.png?itok=u6tIjPUL", "http://www.forextime.com/market-analysis", "http://www.imghost.in/images/2017/11/22/shutterstock_129030494_19.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:09.036+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "46aeab613a0b39a6137ca6c8d250ccdcf411f800", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pCoxWmXjUMLnNK2w4tGIY22pG6or_Vu_R", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/gif/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/gif/ -

So far people are expectong the figure to come in around 50-60 billion pounds that would be paid out over 40 years. Obviously, this is a large number for any sovereign nation, but it enables Britain to plow forth in its so called negotiations. The market is now looking for the next steps for the UK economy, as it expect to see some sort of trade negotiations come out of all of this. I do think that it might be a bit of a while off that we do see something realistic, the fact being that a) the UK has no strong leg to stand on, and b) it\u2019s always a long road to what people expect will be a result. Either way the volatility in the GBPUSD is likely to continue into the near future especially with the current pace of news and politics involved in Brexit.\nOn the charts it\u2019s clear to see that the bulls are back into the market and are climbing higher. Yesterday we were talking about the 1.33 levels, and today we are in the 1.34 levels which shows the market is keen on these talks. After touching resistance at 1.3438 the market has pulled back to take a breather, but the real key level is to be found at 1.3588 which is where bullish traders will be looking to aim in this market. In the even the bears do regain control and look to push it lower then support at 1.3339 is likely to be a prime candidate for support as well as 1.3256. Traders should also be aware of the previous trend line which continues to be an obstacle for any bears in the current market.\nThe US also continued its stellar run today with US pending home sales m/m lifting by 3.5% (1% exp) once again showcasing the strength in the USD. On top of the traders were also somewhat bullish about the first round of the senate tax review of the Trump tax bill, which is likely to boost the US economy \u2013 even though running a deficit for a bit. One of the big losers for this has been the commodity currencies which have been bearish against the USD with all this support.\nFor me the NZDUSD continues to be one of those currencies that will struggle with a resurgent USD in the current market climate. So far all the candles have shown exhaustion by bulls in the market as the NZDUSD dipped under resistance at 0.6891. The market is now looking to extend further lower to 0.6834 and 0.6802 on the charts, as the market looks to push it back into the red. For me the bulls are going to be a real threat until the USD gives up some ground as the NZ economy is still struggling in the interim while it figures out a new government.\nMore Info Here[/color][/url]\u201d>More Info Here", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.imghost.in/images/2017/11/30/shutterstock_444206605.jpg", "https://www.forextime.com/images/maa/nzdusddaily_52.png?itok=GyY_NaXu", "https://www.forextime.com/images/maa/gbpusddaily_394.png?itok=OPjc41_t"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:09.068+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f6392ccca361c70a852903bdc9f6b361ca7d27c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSC4DF4x34E0vmLxx7R60Kv4rUhCRjs5jGRL7Rev4PGZa6b6ZVYiPLErODlR5vSWdKZH2MoN51ozWwy.ZgLMIf_zkb8STzHrfM-", "site_full": "albuquerque.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://albuquerque.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist albuquerque | for sale search", "title": "VACUUMS - LOW LOW PRICE (Los Ranchos) $10", "title_full": "VACUUMS - LOW LOW PRICE (Los Ranchos) $10", "published": "2017-12-07T09:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.craigslist.org/01010_jXttsRt8dpZ_600x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f6392ccca361c70a852903bdc9f6b361ca7d27c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSC4DF4x34E0vmLxx7R60Kv4rUhCRjs5jGRL7Rev4PGZa6b6ZVYiPLErODlR5vSWdKZH2MoN51ozWwy.ZgLMIf_zkb8STzHrfM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "VACUUMS - LOW LOW PRICE (Los Ranchos) $10", "text": "QR Code Link to This Post $10.00 each or both for $15.00 2 Bissell vacuums.

The conference invites participants to think through the interplay of media and data in respect of the way social time is constructed, modulated, and experienced. This allows to appreciate how new technologies and representations deeply affect the temporal organization of today\u2019s media suffused societies, and it also sheds light on transformations in mediating time. We assume that mediatization as a fundamental societal change that interweaves with the development and spread of communication and information technologies leaves its mark on the ways we process and order the pace, sequence, rhythms and of social reality. This conference invites to think through the role of media and data people have or had at hand to time their interactions, relations, and states of being. ABSTRACT \u00ab Recent French perspectives on temporalities in media and communication research \u00bb Jean-Claude DOMENGET et Carsten WILHELM In 2016, the French society for information and communication sciences (SFSIC) held its 20 th congress on the theme \u00ab Time and Temporalities in information-communication \u00bb in Metz, France. This nationwide congress, which takes places every two years, is the major scientific event structuring the field of information and communication sciences (SIC) in France. This recent edition questioned the advances in research on the notions of info-communicational time and temporalitie s, the necessity of a critical vigilance on the use of time , on temporalities in their classic form as well as in digital contexts. It furthermore developed research questions emerging due to socio-technical evolution s. Following the peer reviewed selection of contributions, their presentations to the community and the editorial work following the congress, it appears that the question of mediatized times ( our plural ) has evolved. Our contribution will sketch this evolution and present the themes and emerging research questions presented in the congress. This will allow us to pinpoint multiple research perspectives on our shared object of research. The paradigm of \u201cmediatized time\u201d is one of the oldest ones in France when it comes to analyzing the relationship between media, time and temporality . From the sixties onwards, research has addressed live broadcast on television. In the eighties and nineties, critical approaches have centered on the social and political consequences of media time (Vitalis, T\u00e9tu, Palmer et Castagna 2000), others on the different forms of the representation of time and its mise en recit by the media (Lits, 1995), on television flow, programmed media time, etc. An original approach has been interested in the temporalities of reception and the use of media inspired by French sociology of use (Th\u00e9venin et Wilhelm 2017). These different approaches are characterized by an international outlook, at least at its beginnings with Italian inspiration (Domenget et Aroldi, 2003), as well as a rich supply of paradigms (narratological , socio-technical, socio-political, organizational). They have, however, never succeeded in becoming a transversal domain of study as has, at a certain point for example, the question of the territoire. The 20 th congress has allowed us to identify several current research topics concerning the question of time and temporality in SIC.The first questions time and temporalities in mediation devices ( dispositifs de m\u00e9diation ) in relation to social time (Lamy and Carr\u00e9, 2017). These contributions deal specifically with the transformation of our relationship to time, its constraints, limits and potential. We will thus be able to evoke how media space-time shapes our own relation to time (Lafon). The second theme deals with the links between communication and organizations, through temporal accelerations , at the heart of the West\u2019s social-liberal modernity (L\u00e9pine, Alemanno and Le Mo\u00ebnne, 2017). Indeed, these transformations are linked to an \"ephemerization of the present\", to dyschronias that produce many tensions. Nevertheless, they also produce adjustments allowing for a differentiated reappropriation of time. These changes have been addressed in the field of information and communication technologies for learning (Bessi\u00e8res) as well as health (Lamy). A third theme focuses on time in arts and culture , transformed by so-called cultural or culture industries (Bonaccorsi, Collet and Raichvarg, 2017). It is concerned with the place that communication devices and information systems can claim in the cultural inscription or de-inscription of cultural objects and phenomena. Taking into account the place of history in the communicational thought of culture (Moeglin) should allow to analyze the industrial futures of cultural objects as well as their patrimonial temporalizations. A final theme contributes towards an epistemology of information and communication sciences on temporalities, through concepts and methods (Domenget, Mi\u00e8ge and P\u00e9lissier, 2017). This is still work in progress needs since, as one of the issues raised by researchers states, there is a tropism of research on the \"times of the SIC\" (Gallezot and Marty) for short-time phenomena, taking place in the present or the future at the expense of taking into account phenomena of a longer duration (George and S\u00e9n\u00e9cal). However, researchers propose and experiment new research practices (Mercier), allowing to think collectively about the digital ecosystem (Zacklad). After having established these themes and approaches, our contribution will propose several possible research perspectives. A first deals with the relationship between a perception of time at the level of the individual and the long-term history. A second perspective concerns the analysis of the temporal culture of societies in late modernity, from the point of view of acceleration (Rosa, 2010). A final perspective aims to reinforce the consideration of the cultural dimension in the analysis of temporalities and in the study of our objects of research (Hall, 1984). On arrival, if interdisciplinarity seems essential, and in contrast to the movement provoked by academic institutionalization which has meant for most humanities and social sciences an increased specialization and a closure from neighboring disciplines, present info-communicational approaches would benefit from an ecological or ethical effort, which constitutes the basis of a new collective representation of our relationship to time (Grossin, 1996).

There\u2019s very little new for 2017; I just didn\u2019t buy or get as much stuff this year, because I really don\u2019t need anything, and I gave a lot more money to charity this year in the wake of this fall\u2019s hurricanes. Enjoy and feel free to ask questions in the comments. \nI\u2019ve seen a few \u201cChristmas gift guides for the cooks in your life!\u201d over the last couple of years, but most of them are like this 2014 gem from Grub Street , with recommendations for things that no one could possibly need \u2013 a \u201crosemary stripper\u201d (I have two of those; I call them \u201chands\u201d); a \u201cbanana slicer\u201d (use your paring knife, genius); a $140 toaster (makes toast); and a $1600 set of Thomas Keller-branded pans, which, unless he forged them personally out of pure adamantium, are a colossal fucking waste of money. These are not gifts to by the cook in your life; these are gifts to buy the person in your life who pretends to cook but really just likes playing with toys. Toys don\u2019t make you a better chef; they just make you a less socially responsible one. \nI do have a few pricier toys in my kitchen, but aside from one, they\u2019re all highly functional, at the middle to low end of the price range for their jobs, and built to last a long time. I\u2019ve had my chef\u2019s knife for over a decade, my food processor for 17 years (my next upgrade \u2013 looking at this Cuisinart model ), my Dutch oven for about eight years, and just replaced my 18-year-old stand mixer when we moved in 2013. You are free to call me cheap, but I think I\u2019m just prudent. I\u2019ll spend money in the kitchen if it gets me something I need. I will not spend money to get a famous name, a fancy design, or a paperweight to live at the back of a gadget drawer until we move again. If I can make do with something I already have in the house \u2013 binder clips, a (clean) putty knife, a (clean) paintbrush \u2013 I\u2019ll gladly do that instead. \nTherefore, what I recommend here \u2013 for your cheffy friends or for yourself \u2013 is largely what I own and use. If what I own isn\u2019t available, or isn\u2019t good value for the price, I recommend something else. I am also willing to answer any and all questions about these or other suggestions; if I include it here, that\u2019s an endorsement that it\u2019ll be money well spent. I will post an updated list of cookbooks I recommend in the next few days; in the meantime, here\u2019s last year\u2019s list . \nThe most important tool for any cook is a good chef\u2019s knife, and I love my Henckels 8\u2033 chef\u2019s knife , although I have a discontinued model with a different handle. It\u2019s a workhorse, has only needed professional sharpening once, and is a comfortable grip and weight for my rather small hands. It\u2019s also nearly 60% off right now, a steal at $38.50, so while in past years I\u2019ve steered readers towards the $36 Victorinox 8\u2033 chef\u2019s knife , which America\u2019s Test Kitchen has long recommended, at these price points I\u2019d say go for the Henckels. \nThe basic knives any home cook must have are a chef\u2019s knife, a paring knife, and a bread (serrated) knife. The bread knife is good for more than just slicing bread \u2013 serrated blades are safer for slicing tomatoes, and they\u2019re excellent for chopping chocolate and other hard foods. I have another Henckels four-star model, also eight inches, but the same blade is available with a different handle for just $13 . You might look at a 10\u201d blade if you get a lot of large, artisanal loaves. Any strong paring knife will do, such as this OXO 3.5\u2033 paring knife at $15. With a modicum of knife skills, you can tweak and hull strawberries with one of these without any risk to your fingers or waste of fruit. It\u2019s also good for cutting citrus supremes, slicing apples and pears, pitting olives and cherries, and other fine-motor-skills work. \nI do have two other knives I use frequently, but they\u2019re not essential for most cooks. One is the santoku, a very sharp knife with a thin edge but wide body that\u2019s ideal for slicing vegetables and hard fruits; I recommend a 7\u201d blade, which you can get in this two-santoku Henckels set for $27.50 and just \u2026 I don\u2019t know, regift the 5\u201d version or something, because I can\u2019t see any use for it. The boning knife I own, from Henckels, appears to be discontinued, but there\u2019s another Henckels 5.5\u2033 boning knife for $26 that looks like it has the same blade. A boning knife is ideal for breaking down a whole chicken \u2013 it\u2019s substantially cheaper to buy a whole chicken (sometimes called a broiler-fryer, usually 3-5 pounds total weight) and cut it into parts, and you get the bones to make stock \u2013 or for deboning other cuts of meat like short ribs. Some folks recommend a flexible blade instead, but I have never used that kind so I can\u2019t give an opinion. \nI finally caved and bought a home knife sharpener in 2015, buying this Chef\u2019s Choice Diamond Hone 3 Stage Sharpener , a manual sharpener that turned out to be both easy to use and very effective; I sharpened every knife I own and even a few pairs of scissors, including the kitchen shears some of you saw me using to spatchcock this year\u2019s Thanksgiving turkey. \nMy pots and pans aren\u2019t a single set any more; I have some remnants from an All-Clad anodized aluminum set I got with rewards points in 2001, but have swapped out certain pieces to get better nonstick (coated) skillets. What you really should get for your loved one (you may include yourself in that category) is a a 12\u2033 Lodge cast-iron skillet , an absolute workhorse that can handle about 90% of what I need from a skillet or a saute pan. I still use a nonstick skillet for egg dishes, and a saucier (sadly one that\u2019s no longer made) for sauces or custards, but the Lodge skillet is past a decade old and just keeps getting better. The work of seasoning them is nowhere near as arduous as you\u2019ve heard. \nI got a Lodge 10\u2033 carbon steel skillet for Christmas in 2015, and I love it. It\u2019s not as nonstick as the cast-iron one, which I\u2019ve had for years and thus has built up more of a coating, but for getting a pan rocket-hot quickly and working fast on something small, it\u2019s great. I\u2019ve found that the more I use it, the more resistant the surface becomes to sticking \u2013 even eggs \u2013 and it is the ideal skillet for making the dramatic, puffy pancake known as a Dutch baby. \nIf you want to splurge on something, get an enameled cast-iron Dutch oven, great for soups, stews, braises, deep-frying, jam-making, and caramelizing huge batches of onions. Cast-iron doesn\u2019t distribute heat well, but it holds heat for a long time. These pots are heavy, but I use mine for every saucepan duty that doesn\u2019t involve boiling water or cooking grains on their own. They go stove to oven (as do the skillets) and can take the hours of low heating required for a proper braise. I own a Le Creuset that I got on sale at an outlet store because the color was discontinued; if you\u2019re not quite that fortunate, try the 7.5 quart Lodge model, a pretty good value at $60 considering how heavy and durable they are. \nI upgraded my stockpot last year with this $30 Excelsteel 16 Quart Stainless Steel Stockpot . I make stock constantly throughout the year; I buy whole chickens, break them down myself, and freeze the carcasses and necks for future stocks. I also made a turkey stock after Thanksgiving with the backbone, neck, and the picked-clean roasted carcass, and the result was so full of gelatin that it was solid at room temperature. (It made an unbelievably rich turkey and soba noodle soup.) I needed a good stockpot since my previous one\u2019s pseudo-nonstick finish had started to fade; this pot is also taller and heavier so it holds the heat in more effectively and I can do a double batch with two chicken carcasses and plenty of aromatics. I usually have to get at the interior bottom with a little Bon Ami, though. It\u2019s also been my go-to pot for sous-vide cooking, since it\u2019s deep enough to hold my circulator. \nI don\u2019t own a proper mandolin slicer, but I do pretty well with a handheld mandolin for under $20 that works great for things like root-vegetable chips or thinly slicing onions. I use my digital instant-read thermometer almost every night, and I\u2019ve run through at least three of them over the last ten years. Amazon tells me that I bought my Microplane classic grater in November of 2003, and I\u2019ve had their coarse grater for almost that long. The former is great for zesting citrus fruits or grating nutmeg; the latter is ideal for creating a snowfall of hard cheese over a pasta dish. I now own four silicone baking mats , two of which are amazon brand, now listed at two for $14 but which I got cheaper on Prime Day this summer. \nI own two scales \u2013 a chef I\u2019m friends with on Twitter made fun of me for this \u2013 one, this AWS Digital Pocket Scale for weights up to about 2 kg, which is ideal for precise measurements like grams of coffee (more on that in a moment), and a larger scale that\u2019s long discontinued. This $13 Ozeri scale looks like a more than adequate replacement, measuring up to 12 kg; I rarely need to measure more than about two pounds of anything, maybe a little more for some large-batch baking but that\u2019s about it. You need at least one good scale if you\u2019re serious about baking, though; the best bread and pastry recipes all use grams, not cups or liters. I finally killed my digital candy/frying thermometer this year, replacing it with an old-fashioned, $7.50 analog frying thermometer . I use it for jam, macarons, and my various deep-frying experiments (see the sous-vide discussion below). You absolutely must have one of these to make caramel, any kind of jam or preserves, or true buttercream frosting. \nI haven\u2019t included this on past lists, but I do use my OXO potato ricer for mashed potatoes \u2013 it\u2019s much better than a so-called \u201cmasher,\u201d which is otherwise useful for guacamole or for crushing fruits while making jam but makes lumpy mashed potatoes. \nOther things I always appreciate getting or often end up buying for myself: Wooden spatulas (not spoons), silicone spatulas, good (not decorative) metal measuring spoons, Pyrex or similar measuring cups for liquids (never measure liquids in a plastic cup designed for measuring solids). \nI don\u2019t have this exact brand/model, but I love having a few silicone ingredient cups in the kitchen. I use one for measuring and pouring out coffee grounds, and I often have another one next to the stove with salt or freshly ground pepper or toasted sesame seeds to add to something right before serving. \nNow, for the expensive stuff: \n* New for 2017 : I finally caved and upgraded my food processor to this 14-cup Cuisinart model , although mine is black and has a slightly different model number (which I can\u2019t find on amazon). You can get a 7-cup model for $100, and it will probably be fine for most home cooks. I have a few recipes I make regularly that require the larger capacity. I have also noticed that the blade on the new model is the sharpest thing I own. I\u2019m actually a little scared of it. But you kind of need a food processor for things like pesto, hummus, mayonnaise, pie or biscuit doughs (if you don\u2019t want to or can\u2019t do them by hand), and my favorite pumpkin pie recipe. \n* I\u2019ve gone full geek, getting an Anova sous-vide immersion circulator for $99 (pot not included) and using it frequently for cooking chicken legs, chicken breasts, steak, pork, duck, even salmon. Serious Eats has many recipes for it, and I\u2019ve used their chicken thighs recipe many times, often cooking entire chicken legs that way. (I\u2019ve discovered that, if you can handle some spattering, you can take the drumsticks, pat them dry, then bread and deep-fry them for some of the juiciest fried chicken you\u2019ll ever taste.) I\u2019ve cooked skirt steak, which can be tough even when cooked medium-rare, sous-vide and it melted in our mouths. Sous-vide cooking takes time, and some up-front investment \u2013 I caved and bought a FoodSaver vacuum-sealer , although you can do it with zip-top bags too \u2013 but once you use it you\u2019ll find it indispensable. \n* I have this Vitamix 1782 TurboBlend \u201cfood preparing machine\u201d (it\u2019s a blender, stupid), and it\u2019s amazing. I can make smooth vegetable soups with it, no cream required; don\u2019t toss those broccoli stalks, just peel, quarter, and roast them, then blend them with some vegetable stock and season to taste, maybe with some basil oil and toasted pumpkin seeds on top. I used it at Thanksgiving 2015 to make the carrot soup in Hugh Acheson\u2019s The Broad Fork . The blender is down to $328 (from four bills), but that\u2019s too much if you\u2019re just making milkshakes and smoothies (and there is nothing wrong with just making milkshakes and smoothies). You\u2019ll probably be fine with just a basic blender and the food processor. \n* I have the 5-quart KitchenAid stand mixer , which is about $270 right now. I kind of wish I had the next model up, mostly for bread-baking, which is still a bit of a chore for this model, but it\u2019s great for everything else \u2013 mixing up cookie dough, brownie batter, quick breads, whipped cream, and Italian meringues (for macarons). The pasta-maker attachment is overpriced, but it does the job, and the grinder attachment has been good for me in a handful of uses, especially for turning stale bread into bread crumbs. \n* Coffee is my big kitchen weakness, at least when it comes to spending money; I\u2019m fortunate to have a few friends in the industry (whom I met through social media) who work for direct-trade roasters and have tipped me off to good sources of coffee and helped me pay for the gear I own, which is wonderful but expensive. The Baratza Virtuoso burr grinder is the least expensive grinder of its kind and caliber; when my first one had an issue with the motor, I sent a quick video of it jamming to Baratza and had a new machine within two weeks. I do make pour-over coffee at home using this Hario V60 ceramic dripper , but my preference is espresso, for which I use a Rancilio Silvia machine that is a wonder. The boiler is huge, so it bounces back quickly between shots and you can heat up the steam wand before your shots go cold. (You can probably beat that price by $30-40 if you shop around.) If you get your ratios right \u2013 for me it\u2019s 17.5 to 19 grams per double shot, depending on the bean and roast \u2013 you\u2019ll get great crema, 30-32 grams of output in 25-30 seconds, with almost no bad pulls. I use it every morning and I miss it when I travel.

a thanksgiving service today to mark the one-year anniversary of the party\u2019s massive victory over the then ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC). \nThe all-white interdenominational service, to be attended by President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo and his vice Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, will take place at the Accra International Conference Centre (AICC). \nAccording to the party, almost all appointees, including Ministers of State, Members of Parliament, National Executive Council members, among others, are expected to grace the occasion. \nThe Journey \nPresident Akufo-Addo made history last year when against all odds, he defeated incumbent John Dramani Mahama with a margin of over one million votes, after a keenly contested general election on December 7, 2016. \nWhile then candidate Nana Akufo-Addo\u2019s votes appreciated significantly, that of NDC\u2019s John Mahama dropped and eventually, Nana Akufo-Addo widened the gap with some 1,002,749 valid votes. \nThe then opposition candidate polled 5,716,026 which translated into 53.85% while incumbent Mr. Mahama managed 4,713,277, representing 44.40%. \nThere was spontaneous and wild jubilation all over the country when the Returning Officer of the presidential poll, who is the Chairperson of the Electoral Commission (EC), Charlotte Osei, declared the 72-year-old legal gem the president-elect. \nSome Ghanaians even referred to the historic victory by the NPP as the \u2018second independence\u2019 of Ghana. \nJohn Jinx \nAfter Ghana had transitioned into democratic rule in 1992 \u2013 after 11 years of military dictatorship (Provisional National Defence Council) \u2013 all those who occupied the presidential seat had their first names as John. \nNana Akufo-Addo thus became the first person to break the chain of the Johns since the 4 th Republican Constitution was promulgated in 1992. \nHistorical Facts \nHe is the first son of an ex-president (Edward Akufo-Addo) to be president of Ghana. \nHe is also the first person to maintain one running mate (Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia) for three consecutive elections \u2013 2008, 2012 and 2016. \nPresident Akufo-Addo is the first opposition leader to win \u2018one-touch\u2019 (over the 50% plus 1 as mandated by the Constitution) in Ghana\u2019s electoral history. \nHe is also the first opposition leader to stop an incumbent president (Mahama) from winning a second term in office. \n2008 Episode \nIn 2008, Nana Akufo-Addo, who was then the incumbent NPP candidate, led then opposition NDC\u2019s Professor John Evans Atta Mills in the first round of poll but could not hit the 50% plus 1 vote to win outright to enable him to succeed exiting John Agyekum Kufuor as president. \nAs a result, the election entered into a second round and Nana Addo lost to the NDC candidate, thereby returning the NDC \u2013 which had ruled from 1992 to 2000 \u2013 to power. \nPresidential Death \nUnfortunately for the NDC, Prof Mills died suddenly on July 24, 2012, when he was preparing to contest again for a second term, and his then vice, John Dramani Mahama, had to continue until the December 7, 2012 contest when he (Mahama) was fielded by then ruling NDC against the NPP\u2019s Nana Akufo-Addo, who was contesting for a second time. \nThe 2012 election was bizarrely called for Mr. Mahama by then EC Chairman Dr. Kwadwo Afari Gyan, in spite of widespread irregularities and fraud the opposition NPP complained about. \nElection Petition \nAs a result, the NPP, through Nana Akufo-Addo, Dr. Bawumia and then Chairman Jake Otanka Obetsebi Lamptey (now deceased), filed a presidential election petition at the Supreme Court, challenging the validity of President Mahama\u2019s declaration by the EC. \nThe case, which was telecast live, travelled for about eight months and on August 29, 2013, the court, in a 5:4 majority, dismissed the petitioner\u2019s case and upheld the EC\u2019s declaration of Mr. Mahama as then president-elect. \nIt was the first time the EC was using a biometric voters\u2019 register to conduct elections in the country. \nNPP Determination \nHowever, in 2016, the NPP vowed never to allow irregularities to dominate the process and appeared to have \u2018policed\u2019 the process, using a very sophisticated technology in the independent compilation of its version of the results. \nThe strict supervision given by

[ Re: dr.ona ] Joined: Aug 2001\nPosts: 4,218 Mark Z\n Mark Z\n Aug 2001\nPosts: 4,218\nOwego, NY, USA My 2 cents, based on 40 years of riding and rebuilding only 2 A65s, for street use only:\nIn the beginning, it was a cultural norm to buy the highest octane available at the pump for your motorcycle, which at that time, if I remember right, was 95 (and I know that the rating systems have changed). In those days, I don't recall anyone's Brit bike pinking, nor do I recall anyone talking about pinking as being an issue.\nIn the 1980s, I was having chronic pinking problems with my '67 L, but there were other factors at work there, primarily engine wear, and improperly tuned Mikuni carburetors. Anyway, this provided a good testcase for fuel until the problems were corrected (or, as my racer friend would call it, \"tune up in a can\"). I found that a half-and-half mixture of 110-octane aviation fuel and pump gas would eliminate the pinking. One night at the flattrack races I was caught low on fuel and borrowed some racing fuel from one of the riders to get home. The bike ran exceptionally well that night (but the Beesa always ran better at night).\nI've gone through three rebuilds on A65 #2, and I've had occasional pinking until the last rebuild. During this whole time, I've run Sunoco 94. Since my last rebuild, I've had no pinking whatsoever, so I have to attribute this to finally getting everything right (or \"right enough\") in the engine, since neither the carburation, ignition, nor exhaust were changed (nor was the fuel). I don't live in SoCal, and there's very little traffic around here, and I don't push the bike all that hard, but I didn't before either.\nMark Z\n'65(lower)/'66(upper, wheels, front end, controls)/'67(seat, exhaust, fuel tank, headlamp)/'70(frame) A65 Bitsa. #717774 - 12/05/17 1:16 pm Re: Octane question..

TR7RVMan,\nThat was a pretty extensive review of different gasolines.\nI am not sure why you found black goo. That is usually from using gas with ethanol. That is what got boaters hopping mad. So much black goo, it destroyed their engines. As Lannis posted, Marine Sta-bil is called Marine for that reason. Sta-bil was originally just extend the life time of gasoline. Then they caught on that they were not cutting the mustard.\nStartron, is the best. They were ahead of the game on this ethanol thing. It extends the life of gas, and prevents the phase separation caused by ethanol, that is unless you expose the gas to open air. Only this year, have I found that even Startron can't handle it. I think they have done something to reformulate the \"gas\" again. Low evap gas here now like Calif. I posted a picture of \"phase separation\" in another post. But you can see the results for yourself very easily. Just use a white aerosol cap, and pour some gas into it and check the next morning. Look to the bottom of the cap. You will see the outlines of the water with black specs that are the wax. That is most likely the source of \"the goo\". The results you see are called phase separation. The more water in the atmosphere the greater the separation.\nI would much prefer the lead deposits.\nStartron is also noted for stopping the growth of algae in the ethanol of the gas. Yes it will grow in that medium even in the presence of the gas. That is why Harley guys talk about mold. They don't seem to understand the phase separation aspect. But then again they don't need to understand gears and shifting either. They can lug their engines with no bad results. Our engines may sound like a Harley but are a completely different beast, because they breath differently. It is all in the head. Kevin Cameron gives a great explanation of this in his book, \"Sportbike\".\nThis is why I hate to follow Harleys. They will slow down to a crawl up a hill or around a corner, putting you in a gear between 1st and 2nd that you don't have on your Triumph. This is why I have given up \"Poker Runs\", which is the name given to bar ride events around here. It happens on every single one of them around here. It just is to annoying to be fun. 1st 2nd 1st 2nd 1st 2nd. OH no another hill ahead....\nSo, doc, Just keep your rpms up at least around 3500 to be safe. You can add a bit of the leaded stuff to help, but it won't save you from lugging the engine. Our bikes were built to spin. Don't try to make it sound like a Harley.\nI add a little startron when at home and a cleaner by Chevron with Techron (sp?). The carb will not need cleaning as often. Pump gas has almost no cleaners. They cost more money so why would they add them? Cleaners are preventative.\nI am surprised they are adding ethanol at all. At these prices, it must be more expensive than gasoline. Unless, they are adding it as a cheap way to increase octane. Yes ethanol increases octane, the way they measure it now.\nBob, Lifetime bike: '71 T120R, bought in '71 at Ken Heanes, England. #717847 - 12/05/17 9:35 pm Re: Octane question..

If the engine is in good shape,the machine work for the head and ignition system is around $1000 . Now you can safely run the run on 91 octane, maybe even 89 octane....Second approach, not using dual plugs, is what I did on a 750 kitted 650 a few years ago....Using tight quench 9.5 compression MAP forged pistons and setting quench to .035, setting intake cam timing lobe center at 102 degrees, ignition timing at 37 degrees , I was able to get this engine to run 91-93 pump gas with no detonation using proper ridding techniques and it had more performance....\n650 Triumph modified production LSR record holder 133.1 MPH...

People Normally I start my reviews with a synopsis, but having just finished this marvellous book and finding the time to write my review immediately I wanted to convey how endearingly brilliant this book is, and I think the quote from People does just that. So what\u2019s it about\u2026 \nSynopsis\nAT FIRST SIGHT\nOve is almost certainly the grumpiest man you will ever meet. He thinks himself surrounded by idiots \u2013 joggers, neighbours who can\u2019t reverse a trailer properly and shop assistants who talk in code.\nBut isn\u2019t it rare, these days to fine such old-fashioned clarity of belief and deed? Such unswerving conviction about what the world should be, and a lifelong dedication to making it just so?\nIn the end, you will see, there is something about Ove that is quite irresistible\u2026\nI\u2019ve been looking forward to reading this book for a while, having seen so many gushing comments over on Instagram, however having thought The Scandal (Beartown) was brilliant I had a few reservation as I had heard Ove was very different. And it is nothing like The Scandal, it is about cantankerous and rude Ove marching through life not bothering to hide his frustration and irritation with the rest of the world. But we quickly learn that Ove is grieving and while that doesn\u2019t excuse his rudeness his circumstances force the reader to sympathise. A stickler for rules Ove monitors his local community doggedly enforcing his standards on all who cross his path. But there is something incredibly endearing about Ove and while he expresses his irritation at the incompetence of others, he likes to see things done properly and in this way he finds himself unwittingly assisting those who cross his path and eliciting some wonderful, but to Ove unwelcome responses.\nThis book is heartwarmingly charming as a community bonds around Ove and he is not left to suffer alone, because of the compassion of others and despite his abrupt and grumpy manner. A nostalgic read which bought to mind books such as The Trouble with Goats and Sheep and When God was a Rabbit, with a touch of Forrest Gump thrown in.

and it is the commencement of the process that is brewing trouble in the town. \nMatters came to a head when the selection process was started in the palace of Nana Kwasi Omenako II, who is the head of the Akuapem Asona royal family (Asonahene) on Tuesday. \nThe Okuapemhemaa introduced Kwasi Akuffo to the Asonahene as the proposed successor to the late Omanhene and the nominee was sent to \u2018Mogyawere,\u2019 the palace of the Adumhene, Adu Panyin II, for confinement for about 40 days for traditional tutelage. \nIn the process, the Baamuhene, in the company of Nana Osim Kwatia, chief of Amanokrom and Akuapem Gyaasehene Nana Yaw Afari Bampoe, brought Kwadwo Kesse, slaughtered sheep and spilled the blood on his feet to signify the selection of another Akuapemhene. \nThey allegedly took over the palace and installed Kwadwo Kesse to occupy the Omanahene\u2019s Hall of the palace as a new paramount chief of the Akuapem Traditional Area. \nThe police then stepped in as things were getting nasty, picked up the Baamuhene, who has since been granted bail, and asked the other chiefs to vacate the palace. \nLater, the Municipal Chief Executive of Akuapem North, Dennis Agyapong, told Citi FM in Accra that the residents were in safe hands. \n\u201cThere has been no casualty; there has been no quarrel; there has been no fight. Everything has been peaceful as it should be. From the outset, we have assured the people that their safety and security is paramount, so, we just put in place measures to ensure that their property and lives are protected,\u201d he said. \n\nBy William Yaw Owusu & Daniel Bampoe, Akropong", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kwadwo kesse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "odehye kwasi akuffo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akuapem north", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nana afua nketia obuo ii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adu panyin ii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akuapem asona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nana kesse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel bampoe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "okuapemhemaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "odehyie kwasi akuffo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baamuhene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dennis agyapong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "odehyie akuffo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kwasi akuffo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oseadeyo addo dankwah iii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nana osim kwatia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nana afari bampoe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asonahene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "omanhene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nana kwasi omenako ii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "william yaw owusu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akuapem gyaasehene nana yaw afari bampoe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akropong", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "akuapem traditional area", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sakyebea royal family", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "citi fm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "akropong akuapem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "accra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baamuhene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akropong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:13.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "69e4ac33e19fd6e9e20d1cd4b5851565d68b6f5d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSC4DF4x34E0vmLxx7R60Kv4rUhCRjs5jGDj4kyHrAOpQsQQ_Yv9zsTi_vQ1aOgS77Wawk5AnD954Woj.MWnREBvownq1fWj8Ng7atfMzvq7w--", "site_full": "albuquerque.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://albuquerque.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist albuquerque | for sale search", "title": "Come get your picture taken with Santa Claus for Free.

In near perfect shape. I am the original owner and hate to part with this beauty. Playing this acoustically or plugged in is a real treat to my ears. It has such a wide range of tone and could suit a fingerstyle technique or a strummer. I do both. The guitar is so easy to play with the Concert size body and newer Taylor neck shape. A couple of years ago Taylor redesigned some of their higher end guitars and this is one of those. The bracing and other features were changed to bring more to the tone as well as give it a more articulate sound. They succeeded.\nSo this is like a new Taylor in every way. The photos don't really do it justice. Every time I open the case and take the guitar out I love to look at it. Its just a beautiful smaller body guitar that makes up for the size with the 12 fret design and the cutaway. Then add in the ES2 electronics and you have a great all around instrument for so many types of music. I have used it very little though I don't know why. I just am thinning the herd right now and need to let this go. I have priced it realistically as a used buy near mint Taylor 812ce with the slotted headstock and 12 frets to the body. Those are extras in the Taylor book and some 812's don't come with either or the electronics, the slotted headstock or the cutaway.\nPM me with questions.

(Totally not joking, btw \u2013 I\u2019ve actually wondered if we should get the guy something for Christmas\u2026) \nEvery time I get this comment, meanwhile, I just laugh hollowly and think, \u201cLOL, NOPE.\u201d Honestly, I suspect pregnancy only ever really \u201cflies by\u201d for the people who AREN\u2019T pregnant. At this point, though, I currently feel like I\u2019ve been pregnant for at least 100 years \u2013 with twice as long still to go. I think these last few weeks are shaping up to be some of the longest of my life: I\u2019m 36 weeks today, which is SO close to the end \u2013 especially given that my c-section has been booked for 39 weeks, so I know I won\u2019t go over that \u2013 but those three little weeks feel like an entire lifetime to me, and I\u2019ve basically just resigned myself to being pregnant forever . I know: dramatic, much? On the plus side, though, time may have stopped moving forward \u2013 and I\u2019m 98% sure it HAS \u2013 but, symptom-wise, week 35 has actually been not too bad, all things considered. For one thing, the baby moves so much (and feels so hyyyyugge) now that I haven\u2019t been having quite as many \u201cOMG, I haven\u2019t felt him move in 30 seconds, WAH!\u201d freak-outs as usual. I mean, I DO still have them, obviously \u2013 mostly in very public places, in fact, which makes me think the baby is just trolling me at this point- but, for the most part, he\u2019s big enough now that when he moves it sometimes feels like he\u2019s trying to fight his way out of my belly, which is as reassuring as it is occasionally uncomfortable. Like, seriously, what are you DOING in there, baby? Little outfit \u2013 J by Jasper Conran at Debenhams , c/o my parents! \nFor another thing, although I\u2019m feeling very, very large and clumsy, and walking up the stairs sometimes feels like an impossible task to me these days \u2013 like, can this girl get a medal or what? \u2013 for some reason I\u2019ve actually been sleeping a little better this week, which is good, because, honestly, lying awake in those dark hours before dawn, and thinking about all of the things that could go wrong is NOT fun, let me tell you. \nWith that said, I may be sleeping better, but I\u2019m still not sleeping great, and, as for Terry, I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s been sleeping at all : not only has the poor soul come down with a bad cold this week, which he\u2019s manfully pretending not to have (Terry doesn\u2019t get \u2018Man Flu\u2019\u2013 instead he just lies his face off and says he\u2019s feeling totally fine, even when he\u2019s blatantly not\u2026), I\u2019m also apparently snoring so much that at one point this week I woke up to find him huddled on the rug next to the bed with a pillow clamped over his head to try to block me out: whoops! \nThe irony of this situation, of course, is that Terry has ALSO been snoring lately \u2013 in fact, when I woke up that night, I was really confused, because I couldn\u2019t SEE him, but I could most definitely HEAR him. So, basically, we now have ourselves a situation whereby at least one of us is being kept awake by the other one\u2019s snoring every night: some times it\u2019s me, sometimes it\u2019s him, but either way, only one of gets to sleep on any given night. (And no, we don\u2019t have a spare bed one of us could go to, just the couch \u2013 which is looking increasingly like a good option!) So, yeah, that\u2019s fun, too. In more positive week 35 pregnancy news, though\u2026 \nThe car seat arrived! \nThis is the Maxi-Cosi Pebble Plus , and, as well as going into the car , it also clips onto the base of our stroller, so you can take the baby out of the car, and then wheel him around without having to wake him up by transferring him from car to pram: \nThe arrival of this car seat was actually a pretty big moment for us, because it basically means we\u2019re all set now for the baby\u2019s arrival. The nursery is done , the closet is fully stocked, the hospital bags are packed. In fact, all we really needed was a little toy elephant (Well, you do, don\u2019t you?), and, as luck would have it, one turned up on my doorstep this week, courtesy of the kind people at WWF : \nThis was sent to me as part of their #justlikeus campaign, which reflects the fact that, just like us, elephants are complex mammals, who feel a wide range of emotions. Unlike us, though, these beautiful creatures are being killed every day for their tusks, so while I\u2019m very happy to have this little guy for our little guy, I\u2019m even happier to show my support for the campaign. The elephant toys are currently out of stock on the WWF website, but you\u2019ll also receive one if you decide to adopt an elephant (And yes, I did decide to adopt an elephant while I was looking at the website so, er, Terry, we have an elephant now, and no, I\u2019m not referring to this toy one\u2026), so GO GO GO help an elephant, people! \n(Random week 35 pregnancy symptoms: dissolving into floods of tears over the plight of the elephants. Wanting to adopt ALL the elephants. Also all of the dogs, cats, and random other animals that need it. Trying to convince Terry we need a micro pig. Being told that no, we cannot have a micro pig. Wanting to cry over this. Trying to convince Terry we should keep our old car, because cars have f lings too, and we cannot possibly hurt ours in this callous way by selling it. Being told NO. Actually crying over this. Being told that if I want to take over the monthly payments for the car, I can keep it. Realising I can\u2019t really afford it. Buying a lottery ticket instead, even although the website made me open an account and add \u00a310 to it, and I\u2019d literally JUST bought that elephant. I mean, adopted that elephant. Writing this long, stream of consciousness paragraph, even although I know I should stop now. Stopping now.) \nAnd that was week 35 of pregnancy: it was a strange mix of elephants, car seats and lottery tickets, but I\u2019m 100% sure I\u2019m going to catch Terry\u2019s cold now, so I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll look back on it with fondness when I\u2019m lying in bed feeling like death warmed up soon. \nHow was YOUR week?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jasper conran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terry", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "debenhams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hermes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wwf", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "maxi-cosi pebble", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:13.035+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "610e8704f16314121cb79ad24292b3ef15594bbc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSzJw4wB16pY4KI7aqZAF1Iw-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:43:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "610e8704f16314121cb79ad24292b3ef15594bbc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSzJw4wB16pY4KI7aqZAF1Iw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "require([\n                        \"esri/Map\",\n                        \"esri/views/SceneView\",\n                        \"esri/geometry/Geometry\",\n                        \"esri/geometry/Point\",\n                        \"esri/geometry/Polyline\",\n                        \"esri/geometry/Polygon\",\n                        \"esri/Graphic\",\n                        \"esri/symbols/SimpleMarkerSymbol\",\n                        \"esri/symbols/SimpleLineSymbol\",\n                        \"esri/symbols/SimpleFillSymbol\",\n                        \"esri/Color\",\n                        \"dojo/domReady!\"\n                    ], function(Map, SceneView, Geometry,Point,\n                                    Polyline,\n                                    Polygon,\n                                    Graphic,\n                                    SimpleMarkerSymbol,\n                                    SimpleLineSymbol,\n                                    SimpleFillSymbol,\n                                    Color){\n                              var map = new Map({\n                                basemap: \"streets\",\n                                ground: \"world-elevation\"\n                              });\n                              var view = new SceneView({\n                                container: \"viewDiv\",     \n                                map: map,                \n                                scale: 50000000,          \n                                center: [-101.17, 21.78]  \n                              });\n                                var point = new Point(-106.61, 35.1107);\n                                var pointSymbol = new SimpleMarkerSymbol();\n                                var pointAttributes = { city: \"Albuquerque\", state: \"New Mexico\" };\n\n                                var pointGraphic = new Graphic(point, pointSymbol, pointAttributes); \n                                view.graphics.add(pointGraphic); \n                    });", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "new mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albuquerque", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:13.039+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15111074, "moreResultsAvailable": 15110974, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512639973039&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 491}
