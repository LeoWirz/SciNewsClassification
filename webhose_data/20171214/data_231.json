Joshua Wong ... more Photo: Kin Cheung, AP Judge postpones sentencing of Hong Kong democracy activist 1 / 8 Back to Gallery HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 A judge put off sentencing Thursday for young Hong Kong's democracy leader Joshua Wong in a contempt case stemming from 2014 protests in the semiautonomous Chinese city. The 21-year-old Wong, who was out on bail while he appeals a separate prison sentence, was among a group of 16 activists set to learn their punishments following their convictions on charges of criminal contempt of court. But a High Court judge adjourned the case to an unspecified date to await further submissions from defense lawyers. Hong Kong law sets no maximum penalty for contempt, with sentences usually ranging by case law and legal precedents. Wong and the others were convicted months earlier for failing to comply with a court order to clear out of a protest camp on a main road during the 79-day \"Umbrella Movement\" protests against Beijing's restrictions on elections for Hong Kong's top leader. Wong and some others had pleaded guilty. Wong rose to global fame, including a starring role in a Netflix documentary, for leading anti-China protests in the city when he was still a teen. In a separate case, he and two other activists had been given prison sentences ranging from six to eight months for their roles in an unlawful assembly that sparked the 2014 protests. They originally got community service or suspended sentences but those were upgraded after the justice secretary asked for a sentencing review, a move that raised fears the city's independent judiciary was being undermined. Wong was bailed when he received permission to appeal, which will be heard in January.

Bridging loans with terms from one to 36 months; loans available from \u00a310k to \u00a310m; rates from 0.49% per month; plans with no repayments required during the term; and up to 75% LTV for certain cases, 70% LTV available with many lenders. \n\nThe Loan Partnership has a wide range of lender relationships producing many options for clients across set product ranges, but it is also able to offer finance arrangements based on individual needs and circumstances which fit outside published terms. \nParadigm believes The Loan Partnership offers an exceptional service to advisers and their clients, and will be a strong introducer route for those member firms that are looking for specialist expertise and a commitment to quality compliance in these product areas. \nJohn Coffield, Head of Paradigm Mortgage Services, commented: \n\u201cDue to member demand, we have been looking at our specialist lending panel and after reviewing a number of market options, we are very pleased to be able to announce this new relationship with The Loan Partnership. We wanted to work with a business that has a similar commitment to service and compliance that we, and our members have and it was soon apparent that the team at The Loan Partnership had this in spades and would be a natural fit for us. Advisers who work with specialist master brokers want to have confidence in the offering, want to know their clients are in safe hands, and effectively want them to provide a seamless extension to the business. This is certainly the case with The Loan Partnership, and we are looking forward to working with the team and helping our member firms explore the options that are available in these growing product sectors.\u201d \nJohn Webb, Director at The Loan Partnership, said: \n\u201cWe are extremely excited about the opportunity to team up with Paradigm, and we firmly believe The Loan Partnership will be a real asset to its members. Our expert knowledge of the market, the products available and our close relationships with lenders has created an environment that is producing outstanding conversion levels for our introducer partners, which delivers successful outcomes for our clients, lenders and business partners alike.

genre-typical and intricately created locations in Real 3D.  A  very  vivid\r\n      experience which is achieved by combining Anaglyph 3D Technology  with  the\r\n      enclosed 3D glasses.\r\n     \r\n      In The Rockin&#039; Dead, the player takes on the role of Alyssa, member  of  the\r\n      pretty to look at but unsuccessful metal band \"Deadly Lullabyes\".

While some had completely defaulted, others owe the government a sizeable amount of the money.\n\n\u201cThe investigation further revealed that 32,305 houses were captured by the committee on the sale of government properties while 24,345 were eventually sold to beneficiaries.\n\n\u201cHowever, civil servants in some government agencies, notably OHSCF and the Federal Housing Authority, have allegedly turned the policy into a shoddy business with the aim of defrauding the Federal Government.\u201d\n\nThe ICPC said it also found out that some public servants and government agencies were concealing government properties and collecting rent on same without the consent of the Federal Government. This, the agency noted, flouted the intent of the policy that primarily focuses on divesting government\u2019s interest from providing housing for its employees.\n\nThe commission said an employee of the OHSCF allocated some of the houses to undeserving beneficiaries who were not public servants at the time of the exercise and some of the properties had yet to be allocated.\n\nIt added, \u201cThe investigation has so far yielded fruitful result with the recovery of N18, 031,000 from some civil servants and a host of companies including Montgomery & Campbell Ltd. and SICCONS, which has been paid into the coffers of the government.\u201d\n\nThe ICPC vowed that anyone found to have contravened the law would be prosecuted upon conclusion of the investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, the commission says it has arrested a retired Justice of the Court of Appeal, Justice Mohammed Tsamiya, for allegedly demanding N200m bribe from one Mr. Nnamdi Orji, in exchange for a favourable judgment in a National Assembly election case that was pending before the Imo State Judicial Division of the Court of Appeal.\n\nThe ICPC said the offence, which violates Section 10 of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000, was alleged to have been committed in 2015, when the retired Justice asked Orji, who was the candidate of the All Progressive Grand Alliance for the Arochukwu/Ohafia Federal Constituency, to give him N200m to enable him to influence the court\u2019s decision in his favour.\n\nOrji had approached the Court of Appeal, Imo State Division, to seek redress in a case involving an alleged inflation of the result of election in the Arochukwu Local Government Area of Abia State, which he had earlier lost to his opponent, Mr. Nkole Ndukwe, at the National Assembly Election Petition Tribunal.\n\nThe retired judge was alleged to have assured the appellant of getting a favourable judgment from the court upon the payment of the money.\n\n\u201cJustice Tsamiya has since been granted bail by the commission upon the fulfilment of his bail conditions even as investigation continues,\u201d the ICPC added.

Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital despite intense Arab, Muslim and ... more Photo: Evan Vucci, AP On Jerusalem, Trump delivers for supporters at home 1  /  1 Back to Gallery WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump's move to recognize the divided   capital may have triggered a worldwide chorus of critics but the president had his ears closely tuned to his supporters at home.\nFor Trump, the proclamation was an important way to make good on a pledge to his political base, which includes evangelical Christians and pro-Israel Republicans eager for such a move.\n\"While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver,\" the president declared Wednesday in announcing his decision. \"Today, I am delivering.\"\nThose were words to savor for a president who's been frustrated to see a number of key campaign pledges stalled or slowed \u2014 sometimes by a bitterly divided Congress, some by larger national or international concerns.\nRepealing the Obama era health care law is a promise unfulfilled, much to Trump's frustration. Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall.\nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation.\nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box \u2014 although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months.\nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters.\nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action.\n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\"\nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\"\nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East.\nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move.\nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\"\nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts.\n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.\nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\"\nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\"\nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court.\nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way.

It was not nice for me to see that and it is part of football. I have to deal with it. \n\u201cI want to prove (myself) in every game and of course there is a new manager coming in so it\u2019s a fresh start for everyone. I haven\u2019t had the chance to play the last few games and it is going to be up to me to show what I can do and that I can make a difference to the team. \n\u201cIt needs to be the aim of everybody to show themselves and show that they can play. It is a chance to prove you can play.\u201d \nIn the absence of Allardyce and his assistant Sammy Lee, first-team coaches Craig Shakespeare and Duncan Ferguson will be in the dugout at the GSP Stadium. \nThe stakes were considerably higher when Shakespeare last took charge of a European fixture eight months ago, with his Leicester side exiting the Champions League to Atletico Madrid at the quarter-final stage. \nShakespeare was sacked from his first permanent managerial role two months ago but revealed thoughts about returning to such a post have been shelved now he is back in a coaching capacity. \n\u201cIt is something I\u2019m not thinking about at the moment,\u201d he said. \n\u201cI have come here, I know my role, my responsibilities, I want to try and improve the players, try to improve the football club, improve myself as well. I see it as an opportunity for the team we pick to show what we can do. \n\u201cWhen you come into any new club you make impressions about players and form opinions. They form an opinion about you, as a player, as a coach, and you do likewise. \n\u201cIt is that fresh start, it is there for us.\u201d \nSource: PA Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Franken's behavior,\" said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state. \"It's clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time. It's time for him to step aside.\" Though the writing appeared to be on the wall, Franken's departure was not certain. A tweet posted Wednesday evening on Franken's Twitter account said: \"Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate.\" Late in the day, Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York added his voice. \"I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately,\" Schumer said. The resignation demands came in rapid succession even though Franken on Wednesday vehemently denied the new accusation that came from a former Democratic congressional aide, who said he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006. The woman, who was not identified, told Politico that Franken pursued her after her boss had left and she was collecting her belongings. She said that she ducked to avoid his lips and that Franken told her: \"It's my right as an entertainer.\" Franken, in a statement, said the idea he would claim such conduct as a right was \"preposterous.\" But it was soon clear that his position had become untenable. Fellow Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who spoke to Franken, wrote on Twitter, \"I am confident he will make the right decision.\" The pressure only mounted Tuesday, when Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., resigned after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. Rep Ruben Kihuen, D-Nev., faces pressure to resign as well over allegations reported by Buzzfeed that he repeatedly propositioned a former campaign worker. While Franken apparently is departing, Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore could be arriving, if he prevails in a Dec. 12 special election. Multiple women have accused the 70-year-old Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were teens and he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s. If Moore is elected, it could create a political nightmare for Republicans, who have promised an ethics probe. A national conversation about sexual harassment has intensified this fall after the heavily publicized case of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of many acts of sexual misconduct, including rape, by actresses and other women. Just on Wednesday, Time magazine named as its person of the year the \"silence breakers\" \u2014 women who have come forward on sexual harassment. Punishment has been swift for leaders in entertainment, media and sports while members of Congress have tried to survive the onslaught of allegations. Franken already faced a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into previous claims by several other women that he groped them or sought to forcibly kiss them. The allegations began in mid-November when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan. Other allegations followed, including a woman who says Franken put his hand on her buttocks as they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Two women told the Huffington Post that Franken squeezed their buttocks at political events during his first campaign for the Senate in 2008. A fourth woman, an Army veteran, alleged Franken cupped her breast during a photo on a USO tour in 2003. Franken has apologized for his behavior but has also disputed some of the allegations. ___ Associated Press writers Juliet Linderman in Washington and Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Alabama, contributed to this report.

I'm sure many kids nowadays can say that, but I'm a 47 year old guy.\n\nI remember when my parents brought home a little box that they plugged into the wooden-console television set, and suddenly we could play a game of pong on the TV screen.\n\nAfter that was the amazing Atari 2600, with its Pitfall and Space Invaders and Breakout and more.\n\nMy school got the new Apple IIE, and I got my first taste of text adventure games. Oregon Trail. Adventure.\n\nI followed that up with my favorite machine of all time--the Atari 800XL. Sure it had the regular games like Miner 2049er, Shamus, Donkey Kong, Lode Runner...but it was the Infocom adventure games that I loved the most. Zork I, II and III. Planetfall. Stationfall. Deadline. Cutthroats. I loved these games so much that I learned to program so that I could make them.\n\nThere was a time in college when I didn't game THAT much. I was still playing games on the Atari 800XL, but many of the text-based adventure gave way to games like Alternate Reality and The Bard's Tale(that we played on my buddy's Commodore 64). I played a fascinating game called M.U.L.E. for more hours than I'd like to admit, and got my roommates hooked on it too.\n\nI got a Dreamcast some time after that. Soul Caliber. Crazy Taxi. Shenmue. And my first taste of a Resident Evil game in Codename Veronica. (the first game that ever actually scared me)\n\nYears later came the Xbox, and my first taste of true addiction in the Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind game. Also my first taste of online play as I met a group of people who I am still friends with online to this day, twenty years later. One of them even passed away a few years back, which left a very\nstrange feeling. Losing someone you feel is a friend, a person you've talked to for many nights and yet never met...there's really nothing quite like it.\n\nThat game that brought us all together was Return To Castle Wolfenstein: Tides of War. I still own it, and will never sell it. The memories of playing that game will stay with me forever, and whether you think that's cool or sad depends on whether you're a gamer or not. In particular I'll never forget one lonely New Year's Eve when a bunch of us got together online to play the game until the sun came up the next day.\n\nAfter a while though came Battlefield 2: Modern Combat, one of the greatest shooters to ever grace a console. I was still playing it on the original Xbox when the Xbox 360 came out, and they released a new version that you had to buy for full price to play on the 360, even if you'd bought it on the Xbox. I gladly did, and continued playing the game, and it was even better on the 360.\n\nMore Battlefield games followed, and more Elder Scrolls(Oblivion sucked many, many hours from me, and then Skyrim was even more), and then Fallout 3.\n\nOf course I got the Xbox One when it came out. Battlefield 4 was a disaster at launch, but after a few months was fixed and was the best Battlefield game since Bad Company 1. Fallout 4 was amazing. Dying Light and State of Decay were simply glorious, and set new standards for how great zombie games could be. The remastered Skyrim took more hours from me than the original play of it did.\n\nThe above isn't what I set out to talk about, but sometimes when the fingers get going, I digress.\n\nThe phenomenon I meant to talk about doesn't apply to the single-player, non-online games. The phenomenon is what happens when a game you've been playing online for literally years suddenly goes dark. The servers all go down. You cannot play the game anymore. You cannot visit the places you've been spending hours and hours in.\n\nI'm not kidding. I can vividly remember the maps from Wolfenstein. The Barn. The Chateau. The Village.\n\nThe Battlefield 2 maps. Deadly Pass. Backstab. A Bridge Too Far.\n\nIt's strange that you can miss a place that doesn't actually exist, but you can. I've never heard any other gamers talk about it, but when I've mentioned it to some, they nod and get a far-away look in their eyes. They remember those games, whatever those games are for them.\n\nI think if you've ever read a great book then maybe you can identify a little. It's similar to the feeling you get knowing you can never read that book again for the first time. Never have that feeling you got, discovering its secrets.\n\nIt's a bit of that, and just the nostalgia of a place you knew every nook and cranny of, whether it was real or not.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wolfenstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shamus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "veronica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skyrim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple iie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "infocom", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oregon trail", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donkey kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:32.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7bb77dc1ffd331312edd491d011a0330694a7ce9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpRhWig25MowzJ8aksdDJH4wky7aGbfAke7Jn1ejkCS7iJvPz.Yen.gBljMXoRGOoQPPNCK9kZAMlKQtTKHLF0XZpIw5m70wyP7ezd7myM9dJvKLwKZAmXMkWvDzucpFarEEIqgeFp1vVZeYXaWjhnLXzelYvayLlrk-", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "https://www.hotukdeals.com/tag/audiovisual?page=4\n", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Audiovisual Deals \u21d2 Cheap price, best Sale in UK - HotUKDeals - page 4", "title": "DOSS Soundbox XL bluetooth speaker 20% off - Now \u00a363.99 Good Reviews.

Scott Barbour / Getty Images Members of Parliament celebrate at Parliament House on Thursday in Canberra, Australia, after the approval of same-sex marriage. Michael Masters / Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 7:50 am \nUpdated at 5:50 a.m. ET \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nMarriage in Australia is now defined as \"the union of two people\" instead of \"union of a man and a woman.\" \nLawmakers had tried and failed some two dozen times in the past to make the change. \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of the 80 percent of registered voters who cast ballots, ensuring that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\" Copyright 2017 NPR.

Some family members think that they do not need the help of a caregiver and that they can provide their loved ones the kind of care that they require. However, although it is possible with commitment and dedication, it is at times tiring. The fact is that caregiving requires passion, experience and expertise, which many family members may lack. Providers of Home care services Atherton has today have what it takes to take care of your aging relatives.\n\nThe good thing is that caregivers will ensure that your loved one receives all the non medical care he or she requires. As you know, some seniors require help with everything that concerns them. From cooking, eating, cleaning, bathing and shopping, you need to have caregivers who will make the love of your loved one worthwhile and who has the ability to offer such services amicably.\n\nFirst, avoid hiring caregivers before you clearly understand the needs of your seniors. This is because caregivers will require knowing what is expected from them, before they charge certain amount for the services. Noting down all the things that the caregiver will require from the service giver can ensure that you do not leave out any.\n\nYou also need to conmen up with a comprehensive plan. As you know, every task requires planning. You need to know where to start and where to begin. For instance, in the plan, you need to include a detail of what the caregivers need to. You should not forget to include even the time that you need then caregivers to do certain things.\n\nYou should also not assume that the caregiver you plan to hire will work well simply because he or she worked well in another home. Remember that people have varying needs. Although you can get a lot of help from referrals from colleagues and friends, and also from online reviews, do your own research and interview the caregivers before hiring.\n\nAlso, if you are not feeling adequate enough to shop, interview and hire a caregiver, you do not have to struggle. This is because there are agencies that can help you with the work of hiring. You simply need to let them know the kind of a caregiver you aim at having and they will search for one. They will also interview the caregiver on your behalf.\n\nYou do not have to let the good words from prospective caregivers deceive you. Remember that they will talk nicely because they want you to give them the job. Although proper customer service is important, you should not use it as the only factor while hiring the caregivers. Research more about the background of the caregiver before hiring.\n\nAvoid the mistake of hiring certain caregivers because they are not asking you for a lot of money. Cheap services may be wanting as far as quality is concerned. The best thing is to look for affordable services without compromising the quality of services that you receive.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nYou can find a detailed list of the benefits of using home care services Atherton companies offer at http://www.privatenursesolutions.com/services right now. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "frank martin   home", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atherton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hiring home care services atherton", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:34.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e3f269f7cbae62adfff004ed641c9c638fed7125", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtbLXzObJGQpo_trTYZsgrS", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/lgbt/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/lgbt/ - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, &amp; Transgender - 4chan", "title": "/MtFG/ - No balls Edition", "title_full": "/lgbt/ - /MtFG/ - No balls Edition - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T12:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 47, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8c35f13f9c99b67b19f1b1bbf9103aa8c7bebae1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtbLXzObJGQpsmgy3sn65BPiq9U4HjYrI4-", "ord_in_thread": 29, "author": "Amy", "published": "2017-12-07T13:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>9250982\nHey qt", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:34.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "32ebaece82dc8713d27e5077fd844dcd73d35da4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspa09cPOGnxA4.N6d10rPDETdB4EUOo0WzgpkFhPZw4sNU8XGs1JwHR_3uC7wNa29YMqj0Bj5HShmMromknvzPDTg--", "site_full": "www.expedia.com.br", "site": "expedia.com.br", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com.br/Manhattan-Hoteis.d129440.Guia-de-Hoteis", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hot\u00e9is em Manhattan: Pague em parcelas em at\u00e9 12x sem IOF | Expedia.com.br", "title": "Salisbury Hotel:", "title_full": "Salisbury Hotel: Pre\u00e7os, promo\u00e7\u00f5es e coment\u00e1rios | Expedia.com.br", "published": "2017-12-01T15:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46532, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb19400db26c796630da6caa527193ddaf27a5e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspa09cPOGnxA4.N6d10rPDETdB4EUOo0WzgpkFhPZw4sNU8XGs1JwHR_3uC7wNa29YMqj0Bj5HShmOCDdURQextBmwrmmci6gtrRS0GWqmSY4iZrRtfjO.7aA--", "ord_in_thread": 17, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-06T02:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Salisbury is conviently located and reasonably priced", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 4.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:34.003+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15127873, "moreResultsAvailable": 15127773, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512638914003&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 705}
