This was seen in all lessons, and as a result pupils concentrate and focus on learning, trying their best.\u201d \nThey said parent confidence, staff morale, curriculum and teaching had all improved over the last two years. The topping out ceremony held at the new Chapel Green School, in Old Buckenham, which will replace Chapel Road School in Attleborough.

Picture: David Blake \nThe new two-storey school is due to be opened in January. \nIt will include 14 classrooms and tailor-made learning rooms, including a sensory space and hydrotherapy pool, as well as a computer suite, football pitches and multi-use games area. \nA long time coming \nThe move to the new site has been 10 years in the making. \nCampaigners have long said the school needed more space and upgraded facilities to better help its pupils. \nBut in 2013, funding \u2013 which has come from both Norfolk County Council and the Department for Education - was finalised , planning permission was given the following year and building work finally began in 2016 . \nMORE: Proposals for new \u00a310m complex needs school in south Norfolk are unveiled Mr Hickman Smith said: \u201cAfter all the hard and amazing work the staff, pupils and parents have put in over so many years in buildings not fit for purpose, it is with great excitement and relief that we are to move into our beautiful new school in January. \n\u201cThe old school has many memories and we will be sad to leave our neighbours who have been so supportive over the last 50 or so years. We will not be leaving Attleborough behind and will keep a presence in town through our school shop.

Contributed photo Save \nServing others is at the heart of the mission for the faculty, staff and doctor of physical therapy students at Southwest Baptist University. \nSBU\u2019s DPT department hosted an event Saturday, Nov. 4, called \u201cGo Baby Go\u201d to provide mobility opportunities for local children with disabilities. \nThe project was developed by Cole Galloway, a physical therapy researcher at the University of Delaware. The idea is to take a battery-operated toy car, build in extra support for a child who may not be able to sit independently, and modify the activator switch so the child can operate it by using a hand- or head-activated switch. \n\u201cResearch has shown that finding ways to help kids be independently mobile improves their expressive language and social interaction, and does not reduce their potential for eventually walking,\u201d said Dr. Sarah Jones, associate professor of physical therapy at SBU. \nThis fall, SBU DPT students modified four battery-operated toy cars to make them more accessible for children who cannot operate a foot pedal or steer by themselves. Modifications often include replacing the foot pedal with a hand- or head-activated pedal that powers the car and almost always involves building a better support seating system, including the seatbelt, head support and roll bars. \nPairing a motor skill with immediate reward helps promote a child\u2019s exploration, Jones said, otherwise, they can become passive. \n\u201cSeeing a child begin to realize that they are the ones making that car move, and the way that changes their facial expressions or their vocalizations; that\u2019s a sweet moment,\u201d Jones said. \nJones said that Delaware produced its \u201cGo Baby Go\u201d manuals free of charge for those who are interested in the project in an effort to encourage communities to participate and promote a grass-roots, low-tech effort. \n\u201cWe are excited to see where this project goes,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI am hopeful to do a build project each year, if not each semester, and partner with the community to provide mobility for children of all abilities.\u201d \nSBU\u2019s DPT students provided the labor, but relied on the financial support of local individuals, businesses and sponsors, including Super Lube, Jim Rush Auto and Chuck\u2019s Auto Supply. \n\u201cThis is a project that gets to the heart of what physical therapy is all about,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe want our patients to be mobile, but not just for the sake of moving \u2014 it\u2019s more about using functional mobility to help kids explore and participate in their world.\u201d \nFor more information about the \u201cGo Baby Go\u201d project

She was surrounded by the love of her friends and family in her final days. Judy was born in Lodi, CA and grew up in Sacramento with her brother, Bill. She supported herself through college, earning a Bachelor of Science in Personnel Management from Sacramento State University in 1969. Judy met her husband, Peter, on their first day of training as credit officers at Bank of America. They married in 1970 and shared 36 years together in a loving marriage. In 1983, Judy and Peter moved their family to Santa Rosa. Judy began her 34 years of service to Sonoma County. She was devoted to the Assistance League of Sonoma County, the Historic Railroad Square Association and CHOPS Teen Club. It is with these service organizations that Judy shared her leadership, organization and finance skills to better our community. In 2005, Judy was nominated by these organizations and received the Volunteer of the Year Award from the Volunteer Center of Sonoma County. In Judy's spare time, she enjoyed making memories with her family and friends at special lunches, cruises, and trips with her whole family to Hawaii. She beamed with joy when she saw her children and grandchildren enjoying life due to her thoughtful efforts. Judy placed the greatest importance and value on her family. She will be deeply missed by her son and daughter-in-law Stephen and Emily Fromm of Eugene, OR, her daughter and son-in-law Tina and Mike Ediger of Spokane, WA, her grandchildren Lucy and Michael Fromm and Madison and Mackenzie Ediger, and her brother Bill Barnett and his partner Angel Rosario of Sonoma, CA. Judy will be remembered by her friends and family as a loyal woman who was intentional in her love for her family and friends. She took the time for her loved ones by spending many hours talking with them, showing care for their lives and interests, and reminding them that she was only a phone call away. Judy's family and friends will remember how she handled her sudden diagnosis of cancer with strength, courage and grace. She lived to make memories with her grandchildren as their Nana. Now, we have peace in knowing that she has rejoined her husband, Peter, whom she has deeply missed since his passing 11 years ago. Judy was the matriarch of our family, our source of unconditional love and strength, and she will always be deeply loved.

Lots of stretch for extra festive eating.\nThe only downside is it\u2019s kind of pricey - \u00a3208, to be exact. And you may actually struggle to buy one, as they\u2019re currently sold out\u2026but the designer is confident you can have your order within 14 days of payment.

BY SERGIONE INFUSO/CORBIS/GETTY IMAGES. There is proof the millennials wept. Hans Zimmer\u2019s assistant has the photo: a scene of grown men crying in the audience at this year\u2019s Coachella Music Festival , their tears peaking at about the time the prolific film composer and his band laid into his score for The Lion King. The result was not a given when Zimmer earned billing below Kendrick Lamar, Radiohead, Lady Gaga , the XX, Bon Iver, and Lorde at the annual celebration of music and all things youthful and marketable. But the gamble paid off. There\u2019s more footage of the crowd rocking out to the scores of Pirates of the Caribbean and the Dark Knight trilogy, while a 60-year-old German in red khakis and a black polo shirt led the 20-plus-member band. \u201cI\u2019m slightly irked that one still gets put into these little pigeonholes,\u201d Zimmer said a few months later. \u201cI wanted to see if we could play in front of a non-dedicated film audience and just turn it from film music into music. . . . Here I was, spending 40 years in this room, and nothing was in real time and I was hiding behind a screen. But I had a suspicion I was having a conversation with people all over the world, even though we had never met. That picture sort of confirmed that. Finally, we did have that conversation, and we got to meet each other and look each other in the eye.\u201d Zimmer was sitting in that room tucked away in the back of his Santa Monica-based Remote Control Productions, a complex that\u2019s like a WeWork facility for film and TV composers. ( Ramin Djawadi and Rupert Gregson-Williams rent space.) He designed his personal studio to look like a 19th-century Viennese bordello, with burgundy velvet couches, oak wood paneling, and flickering pillar candles. Here, Zimmer spends most days working at a wraparound desk topped with keyboards, computer monitors, and a large L.C.D. screen. All in all, it was a \u201cslacking year,\u201d said Zimmer, who scored Boss Baby, Dunkirk, and Blade Runner 2049, in addition to touring with his stage show. This need to avoid typecasting stems from Zimmer\u2019s unorthodox background\u2014not classically trained, he got his start playing in bands (including the Buggles, the one-hit wonders behind \u201cVideo Killed the Radio Star\u201d)\u2014and explains why his credits include A League of Their Own and The Holiday, 12 Years a Slave and Inception, in addition to numerous documentaries, TV shows, and animated films. He never wants a score to tell an audience how to feel, and credits collaborations with such directors as Ridley Scott and Christopher Nolan for continually challenging him. In the case of Dunkirk, that meant taking Nolan\u2019s suggestion for using British composer Edward Elgar\u2019s \u201cNimrod\u201d piece from his \u201cEnigma Variations\u201d for a pivotal scene, but going one further. \u201cChris was nervous about even mentioning [\u201cNimrod\u201d] because he wants me to come up with my own ideas,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cBut the first thing I said was, \u2018Well, hang on, Elgar\u2019s piece is about 14 variations. Why can\u2019t we go and write Variation 15?\u2019\u201d Nolan hadn\u2019t realized it was one of Zimmer\u2019s favorite pieces of music. The composer turned it into a score he described as one continuous song, which took him seven months to complete and required throwing everything he knew about filmmaking out the window. Nolan had decided early on that Dunkirk was going to be a 90-minute movie, one he wanted to have an \u201cobjective score\u201d with no emotion. \u201cIt means we\u2019re going to enter at the third act,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cSo, I couldn\u2019t lay all that pipe. How do you set up your characters and tell their backstories?\u201d Nolan and Zimmer decided on the idea of running out of time\u2014appropriate for a film about the World War II evacuation of Allied forces from the port of Dunkirk\u2014and opened the film with the sound of a ticking watch, which, it turns out, belongs to the director. \u201cWe had this idea of constantly ratcheting up the tension . . . that time is running away.\u201d For Blade Runner 2049, Zimmer almost balked at coming on board. Director Denis Villeneuve and editor Joe Walker \u2014with whom Zimmer has worked on several projects\u2014called one day wanting to come to his studio with a dilemma and a proposition. \u201cI said, \u2018Absolutely no way. I\u2019m going on tour, there\u2019s no way I can do anything,\u2019\u201d Zimmer recalled telling them. The pair showed up anyway and unspooled an early cut of the film for him and composer Benjamin Wallfisch, a frequent collaborator. \u201cWe got to the end, and I was sitting at my keyboard, and I just had an idea, just a fraction of an idea, but it got the conversation going.\u201d Zimmer owned the same Yamaha CS-80 that Vangelis used to compose for the original 1982 movie, and played a melody that eventually became the \u201cMesa\u201d track on the score. (Zimmer said he even sent Vangelis a letter to see if he\u2019d want to join the project, but \u201cit just didn\u2019t work out.\u201d) Wallfisch ( It, Annabelle: Creation ) carried out the remainder of the duties, with Zimmer helping to finish during a 10-day break from the road. \u201cThere were a few notes that were completely in tune with what I think Denis was hoping to hear,\u201d Wallfisch said. \u201cThere was a sense of hope to the melody and, as Hans and I often do, we crowded around the keyboard and just started playing, going, \u2018No, try that, try this.\u2019 We\u2019re different kinds of musicians, but we both have a similar way of thinking. . . . I feel like this is a score where you clearly hear both of our voices very much influencing each other.\u201d The two composers recalled their similar backgrounds as musicians in bands, where \u201cit\u2019s not about how well you play, but about how well you listen to each other,\u201d Wallfisch said. That ability to riff and to re-invent is something Zimmer needs to rely on more and more. \u201cAll I\u2019ve got in front of me is a blank page,\u201d he said of his process. \u201cThe more movies I\u2019ve done, and the more I try not to repeat myself or become redundant or irrelevant, the blanker that page seems to become.\u201d Get Vanity Fair\u2019s HWD Newsletter Sign up for essential industry and award news from Hollywood.

[PHOTOS] Sonam Kapoor attened the opening night gala of the 14th annual Dubai International Film Festival recently and she looked mind-blowing. December 7, 2017 14:45 IST Getty Images \nIt was a moment of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when Sonam Kapoor walked the red carpet of the ongoing Dubai International Film Festival. The Padman star stepped out in a stunning ivory Ashi Studio gown topped with a floor length overcoat on the first day of the event. \nThe stylish diva not only looked fabulous and chic but she also reminded several of an outfit from the archive Oscar fashion book. The site High Heel Confidential points out that the 32-year-old looked inspired by Gwyneth Paltrow at the film festival. \nFor those of you who don't get the reference, the Iron Man star, who will soon be seen in Avengers 4, wore a similar floor-length overcoat gown ensemble when she attended the Oscars in 2012. It is interesting to see that Sonam chose to go back into time and imitate the beautiful outfit. Gwyneth Paltrow at the Oscars 2012 Getty Images \nUnlike Paltrow who wore a flowy gown under her overcoat, Sonam donned a busty corset over a gown like skirt and topped it off with the floor length overcoat hung from her shoulders. The highlight of the dress, however, was the corset that helped the actress put forward a bustier presentation. A post shared by sonamkapoor (@sonamkapoor) on Dec 6, 2017 at 10:53am PST \nWhile it is not exactly the same, Sonam also looks inspired by Paltrow short hairstyle sported at the 2012 Oscars. The Indian actress tucked her long locks insider her overcoat to camouflage her long hair into a smart looking short hairstyle.

Sporting a gorgeous dial wrist watch matching her dress, Kapoor wore a pair of diamond studs, a diamond ring and walked in on a pair of Roger Vivier pumps to complete her look. Times Now reports that her stylist and sister Rhea Kapoor dressed her for the occasion.

One recent morning Paul Urbanek, 71, found a strange sign by the entrance to Alwine, a small and remote community of run-down houses in ex-communist eastern Germany.\nThe entire place was up for sale.\nOn Saturday, its dozen buildings, plus sheds and garages, are to go under the hammer at an auction in Berlin, with a starting price of \u20ac125,000.\nErika K\u00fchne and Paul Urbanek. Photo: DPA. \nWhoever buys Alwine will get a small slice of German history - a place whose empty homes and ageing residents mirror the wider fate of the east German hinterlands since the country's reunification 27 years ago.\nOnly about 20 mostly retired people still live in the cluster of decaying homes in rural Brandenburg state, 120 kilometres south of Berlin.\n\"We have been chucked into cold water!\" Urbanek told AFP, standing in front of his dilapidated house, a common sight in a region where villages are shrinking as young people move away.\n\nNo prospects  \n\nDuring the Second World War, the Hitler Youth trained around Alwine and prisoners of war were incarcerated nearby. Then the Iron Curtain went up and it became part of Germany's communist East.\nUntil Germany's 1990 reunification, all the property in Alwine, which once counted about 50 residents, was owned by a nearby coal briquette plant, the oldest in Europe.\n\nSeveral local residents had worked there since the 1960s, said Andreas Claus, the mayor of Uebigau-Wahrenbrueck of which Alwine is a part.\nThe plant closed in 1991 and many people left.\n\"Most of the departures were, of course, younger people - the daughters and sons of this place\" who moved to West Germany, said Peter Kroll, the district representative, who has lived nearby since 1945.\nNone have come back, he said.\n\"People had no other prospects here, especially if they were older,\" added Claus.\nAlwine is not the only such community in eastern Germany, which still lags behind the west in prosperity, wages and jobs, with a per capita GDP that was only 67 percent of that in western states in 2015.\nBetween 1990 and 2015, the region's population fell by about 15 percent, said a government report this year.\n\"After reunification, many people moved away for jobs,\" said Hildegard Schroeteler-von Brandt, a professor of architecture and urban studies at Siegen University.\n\"These jobs have not been replaced everywhere in East Germany.\"\n\nSold for one Deutschmark \n\nIn 2000, the hamlet was sold to private investors for one \"symbolic Deutschmark,\" the pre-euro national currency, Kroll said.\nThe two brothers who are the current owners did not manage to stop its slide into neglect.\nUrbanek, who moved there after a divorce in 2010, said he likes Alwine because it's quiet.\nBut now the roof of his house needs to be replaced, he said, and the electrician doesn't come by anymore.\nExcept for one family, all of Alwine's inhabitants are elderly.\n\"I'm retired, my neighbour is retired ... The others are also both retired,\" Urbanek noted, pointing across the way.\nGiven the region's exodus of younger people, \"the ageing process in eastern Germany is progressing much faster than in western Germany,\" according to the government report.\n\n'Left alone' \n\nMayor Claus, who only learned of the sale in the tabloid-style Bild daily, said his town would not seek to buy it.\nAnd Urbanek said it was unlikely that anyone living there would be able to raise the necessary \u20ac125,000 to do so.\n\"People in economically underdeveloped areas feel left alone with their problems,\" said Claus, voicing a common complaint that has impacted eastern German politics.\nDuring the elections in September, nearly 23 percent of Uebigau-Wahrenbrueck voted for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, nearly twice the national average.\nNow the fate of Alwine rests on the result of the auction.\n\"Many people are interested,\" Matthias Knake of the Karhausen auction house told AFP, saying it was the first time they were selling \"an entire village\".\nAnd Claus said he would invite the new owner to the town hall \"to see how we can try to develop something here, in collaboration with the people, and not against them.\"\n\"The concern is that nothing will happen,\" he said.

"text": "Western Balkans countries will improve the performance of their major transport corridors and expand trade with support from a planned World Bank project announced today. The Trade and Transport Facilitation Project is designed to streamline border crossings, improve the efficiency of logistics services and deploy modern 'intelligent' technologies to improve freight and passenger transport and get goods to customers faster. \n'Citizens of the Western Balkans countries will see transportation costs reduced and trade expanded under the $150 million Trade and Transport Facilitation Project ,' said Kristalina Georgieva, World Bank Chief Executive Officer . 'We estimate the benefits to be in the order of $1 billion per year - an important contribution to regional efforts to boost growth and create jobs and opportunities for more people.' \nGeorgieva spoke at a Conference on Stronger Regional Integration in the Balkans , hosted by Bulgarian Prime Minister, Boyko Borissov. The conference was designed to develop tangible ways to drive forward growth and development in the Western Balkans countries and accelerate their EU Accession aspirations. \nThe high-level conference was attended by Mr. Edi Rama, Prime Minister of the Republic of Albania, Mr. Mirko Sarovic, Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr. Hashim Thaci, President of the Republic of Kosovo, Mr. Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of FYR Macedonia, Mr. Filip Vujanovic, the President of Montenegro, and Ms. Ana Brnabic, Prime Minister of the Republic of Serbia. \nWestern Balkans countries have already achieved strong growth and poverty reduction. Since global financial crisis of 2008, countries in the region have taken action to reform their economies and it's paying off with growth averaging 2.4% through 2015. This year the World Bank is projecting regional growth of 2.6% and 3.6% by 2019. In addition, 230 thousand jobs were created across the region between June of last year and June of this year. \nWhile Western Balkans leaders are making strong progress, World Bank research shows at current growth rates it will take another six decades for income levels in the Western Balkans to catch up with the European Union. However, with the right reforms and macroeconomic stability, average annual growth rates could hit 5 percent and parity with EU income levels could be achieved in just two decades. \nTo achieve higher economic growth will take stronger economic integration within the region and further business climate improvements to boost private sector investment and create private sector jobs. \n'It is important for Western Balkans leaders to come together to advance economic cooperation across borders, in transport, trade, and connectivity, which will promote business growth,' said Georgieva. 'We are committed to supporting each country to achieve its objectives - while also connecting the region to the wider EU and global markets.' \nGeorgieva says Western Balkans leaders can also tap Bulgaria's experience to generate additional resources to invest in transport connectivity. Bulgaria is working with the World Bank to see how best to leverage the revenues generated from its e-tolling initiative - which is expected to generate up to Euro 9 billion over the next decade. New financing raised through this effort could allow Bulgaria to accelerate completion of its transportation infrastructure and become more competitive. \nThe World Bank is already investing to improve transportation connections across the Balkans. It is working to close some of the gaps along Corridors 8 in Macedonia and 10 in Serbia. It is expected that improvements to Corridor 8 will cut travel time for trucks from Sofia to Skopje from 6 hours to three and a half hours. \nWorld Bank Group published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 09:16:04 UTC . \nOriginal document http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/12/07/western-balkans-trade-and-transport-competitiveness-to-get-150-million-boost-from-world-bank \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/A0029B164D2DA0A9A85B4007296EFEDEA44396A0", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "worl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hashim thaci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boyko borissov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "filip vujanovic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristalina georgieva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgieva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mirko sarovic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zoran zaev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ana brnabic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edi rama", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "western balkans trade and transport competitiveness", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "world bank world bank", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fyr macedonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foreign trade and economic relations of bosnia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world bank group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trade and transport facilitation project", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corridors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corridor", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "republic of kosovo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sofia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republic of serbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balkans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herzegovina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skopje", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western balkans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macedonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bulgaria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "serbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montenegro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republic of albania", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:53.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "190682e71c7cced290c3d55f256c85aee6c72aa8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCriqPy2Zxy8a6NvL9Y5XrdaAqxdn_63iZp0y4ZG_7CZYqNalT94SO_X1VcuNNRM8_97jp4R0yz.tmcf8qXZbCernuwshR3NWU4wN1BvgAe5VKesKCerrNgQIVm6n8.2zxpDOeT2PckNTc8pz8sJUi23", "site_full": "bolivarmonews.com", "site": "bolivarmonews.com", "site_section": "http://bolivarmonews.com//search/?q=&t=article&l=100&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news,news/*&f=rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "bolivarmonews.com - RSS Results in news,news/* of type article", "title": "Two injured recently in area crashes", "title_full": "Two injured recently in area crashes", "published": "2017-12-06T19:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/bolivarmonews.com/content/tncms/custom/image/d54db0ae-97c0-11e7-87e3-ffacf264259c.jpg?_dc=1505224012", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "190682e71c7cced290c3d55f256c85aee6c72aa8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCriqPy2Zxy8a6NvL9Y5XrdaAqxdn_63iZp0y4ZG_7CZYqNalT94SO_X1VcuNNRM8_97jp4R0yz.tmcf8qXZbCernuwshR3NWU4wN1BvgAe5VKesKCerrNgQIVm6n8.2zxpDOeT2PckNTc8pz8sJUi23", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T19:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Two injured recently in area crashes", "text": "Two injured recently in area crashes 15 hrs ago Save \nA Bolivar woman was injured in a two-vehicle crash at around 5:40 p.m. Friday, Dec. 1, on Mo. 83 3.5 miles south of Wheatland. \nAccording to the Missouri State Highway Patrol crash report, a westbound 2016 Nissan Versa, driven by Regina E.

In the book, Graham draws primarily on Gallup data to argue American happiness is faltering as a rational response to growing inequality. \nAmong Graham's most striking finding is, as she puts it, \"markers of well and ill-being, ranging from life satisfaction to stress, are more unequally shared across the rich and the poor in the U.S. than they are in Latin America, a region long known for high levels of inequality.\" Low-income Americans are particularly skeptical that hard work will improve their economic situation. \nBlanchflower and Oswald wanted to see if other data sources corroborated Graham's findings. They first turn to the General Social Survey (GSS), a nationally-representative survey administered every several years and used frequently in social science work. The GSS data show, unambiguously, that Americans' evaluations of their own happiness has been falling in recent years. \nThe decline is visible across multiple demographic groups. Declines have been steepest among Americans with the least education, and the happiness gap between the most-educated and least-educated Americans has nearly doubled since 1972. \nBlanchflower and Oswald note the GSS data show similar trends for Americans' feelings about their finances - everyone is less optimistic about money relative to 1972, but optimism has dropped particularly sharply among the least-educated. They call these disparities a form of \"psychological inequality,\" which is both a reflection of actual monetary inequality and a driver of it - after all, it's difficult to improve your financial situation if you don't believe your financial situation can be improved. \nAs another marker of psychological distress, Blanchflower and Oswald look at cross-country data on the experience of pain. In 2011, the International Social Survey Programme asked respondents in over 30 nations how often they had experienced bodily aches and pains in the past month. \nAmericans were the most likely to report frequent pain, with 34 percent saying they experienced it \"often\" or \"very often.\" The average across all countries surveyed was just 20 percent. \n\"As the US is one of the richest countries in the world, and in principle might be expected to have one of the most comfortable lifestyles in the world, it seems strange - to put it at its mildest - that the nation should report such a lot of pain,\" Blanchflower and Oswald write. \nAware that some of this could be attributable to question translation issues or cultural differences (for instance, Americans may just be more predisposed to complain about pain than members of other nations), the authors ran the numbers controlling for age, gender, marital status, labor force status and education. The United States remained an outlier even when these factors were accounted for. \nThe nation's relatively stingy social safety net may be one factor contributing to this exceptionalism. Many Americans still lack access to health care, which is available universally in most other wealthy nations. The expense of health care, even for those who have insurance, could mean Americans experiencing aches and pains are more likely to tough it out and forego treatment, relative to people in other countries. \nIn the United States, health issues remain a major contributor to financial insecurity, meaning they likely contribute to some of the declining happiness and financial pessimism seen in the other research surveyed by Blanchflower and Oswald. \nAll told, the data underscore how country-level material wealth can be a poor indicator for the well being of its inhabitants.

His survivors include his daughter, Birgit Huppertz Quezada, his son, Mark Huppertz, his grandchildren, Adalie Byers and Ryan Byers, and his great-grandson, Bentley Byers, as well as many close friends and relatives. Born in New York City on July 21, 1932 to his parents Katherine and Bernd Huppertz, Dick, as his mother nicknamed him, spent much of his childhood in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. His early interests included music, aviation, and art. His mother was an operatic soprano and his father, a well-known conductor. As a youth, he piloted small planes and later became an accomplished glider pilot who earned his diamond badge for his extraordinary skill in soaring. As an adult, he enjoyed dancing, jazz, yoga, pilates, skiing, art, and classic films. A graduate of Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, Dick became well-known for the innovative design features that he introduced as head of Westinghouse's Corporate Design Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He later served for over 20 years as Account Manager for the prominent graphic design firm Saul Bass and Associates in Los Angeles, California, where he managed such accounts as Exxon Mobil, the Girl Scouts, AT&T, United Airlines, Lawry, and United Way. His expertise and intelligence spread worldwide as he aligned corporate objectives with local needs. Dick's accomplishments far surpassed his genuine modesty. Most of all, Dick loved his family, was a loyal friend and colleague, and smiled at life's vicissitudes with an enduring optimism. We will miss seeing him, and he will remain forever in our hearts.

December 7, 2017 14:40 IST Padmavati, Kaalakaandi stills Twitter \nSaif Ali Khan has won hearts with the recently released trailer of Kaalakaandi. The hunk will be playing the lead role in the dark comedy and he has done a brilliant job in the trailer. \nBut the hype around the movie did not last long due to the delay in its release date. After being postponed to January 12 next year, speculations are rife that the movie will get delayed even further. \nSaif Ali Khan hinted at Padmavati for the delay in Kaalakaandi release date. Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Padmavati features Shahid Kapoor, Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh in lead roles. \n\"If Padmavati comes in, we will think of shifting our release date. I hope we don't have to do that. Kaalakaandi is a film I am proud of,\" Saif told Mid Day. \nHe, then, said that he won't mind if Padmavati and Kaalakaandi release on the same day. \"It would have been nice to see Kaalakaandi releasing with Padmavati, as it shows that we have a film industry, which makes different kinds of movies.\" Padmavati stills Movie Stills \n\"Recently, we saw Secret Superstar and Golmaal Again releasing on the same day and both films did well. Personally, I feel it's a good time to have films releasing alongside one another. But filmmakers are wary about it and you need to take that into consideration,\" Saif added. \nWell, we appreciate that Saif is confident about his film, but releasing it along with Padmavati is not a good idea. Don't you think Saif should check with his producers about its release? \nSince the trailer of Kaalakaandi is out, the movie is going to grab attention for sure for its content. The film seems to be all about sex, drugs and action laced with some light humour reminding you of Delhi Belly. Kaalakaandi poster Twitter \nAlthough one cannot predict the storyline by watching just the trailer, it certainly generated curiosity. \nSaif's unique look and his performance in the movie's trailer are just to the point. Directed by Akshat Verma, Kaalakaandi is a dark comedy starring Saif, Vijay Raaz, Deepak Dobriyal, Shobita Dhulipala, Kunaal Roy Kapur, Isha Talwar, Shenaz Treasurywala, Nary Singh and Akshay Oberoi. \nWatch the trailer here: Related ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "padmavati saif ali kha", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shahid kapoor", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "padmavati saif ali khan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "saif ali khan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "akshat verma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vijay raaz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kunaal roy kapur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saif", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaalakaandi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deepika padukone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deepak dobriyal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ranveer singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "padmavati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shenaz treasurywala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shobita dhulipala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isha talwar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanjay leela bhansali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akshay oberoi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kaalakaandi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "padmavati", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:54.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9c3780926d43c806490d5a14cc12eb3024334e84", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSylLUTTmBtg2repo.r8fn.0-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "config.yml", "title_full": "config.yml", "published": "2017-12-07T11:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9c3780926d43c806490d5a14cc12eb3024334e84", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSylLUTTmBtg2repo.r8fn.0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "_Twiistrz", "published": "2017-12-07T11:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "config.yml", "text": " \r\nversion:\r\n    # This is the current version of Towny.

Charcuterie board. Lobster tail. Seared lamb chops. \nThese aren\u2019t the typical foods found on restaurant menus in Bolivar. But, thanks to a new restaurant near the heart of the city, area residents can find something new in local dining. \nThis past summer, Kathy Gifford of Kathy\u2019s Pasta, 329 S. Main Ave., started a new venture, renovating a space in the back of her long-standing Italian eatery and opening Savour. \nGifford has owned and operated Kathy\u2019s Pasta for 23 years but was ready for a new challenge. \nCalling it \u201cBolivar\u2019s first upscale dining restaurant,\u201d Gifford said she saw a need for a local place \u201cwhere people can come have a nice, relaxing dinner.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot quieter atmosphere with very attentive service,\u201d she said. \nHer goal, Gifford said, was to offer a dining experience usually found in larger cities in Bolivar\u2019s own backyard. \n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have something like this close by,\u201d she said. \u201cIt saves people time and money.\u201d \nShe said while some staples stay on the menu from week to week, other items come and go based on the availability of local seasonal ingredients. Savour also features a craft beer and wine menu. \nTraditional entrees appear on the menu, as do small plates meant for sharing with others, which are unique among dining options in Bolivar. \n\u201cThis gives us an opportunity to experiment with new dishes and create specialties just for Savour,\u201d Gifford said. \nChef Michael Williamson has worked as a chef for 10 years, previously with Silo Ridge and with Kathy\u2019s for the last six years. He said he enjoys \u201cgetting to be creative on a weekly basis.\u201d \nGifford also teamed up with her daughter, Karen Dorsey, an interior designer in Houston, Texas, to make Savour\u2019s atmosphere equally as unique as its menu. \nShe said she loves nothing more than \u201cwalking back and seeing everything in its place.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Gifford said. \u201cIt\u2019s just as beautiful as the day we opened it.\u201d \nSavour gives a nod to the past, featuring the original concrete floors and exposed rafters reminiscent of the building\u2019s origin as a lumber yard loading dock, Gifford said. \nHowever, the rest of the interior showcases a modern social dining setting. While some tables line the walls for those who prefer a traditional dining experience, the restaurant has multiple groups of lounge chairs and sofas for diners looking for \u201ca more casual experience,\u201d Gifford said. \n\u201cIt builds a comaraderie between people,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople can sit and chat, getting to know the community more while trying out new dishes and drinks.\u201d \nSavour also features outdoor patio seating that overlooks the Polk County Courthouse on Bolivar\u2019s square. \nGifford said reservations are recommended but not required. The restaurant is open from 5 to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday. \nTo make a reservation, call 327-9937, and for more information, visit Savour\u2019s Facebook page or savourbolivar.com online.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "savour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karen dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kathy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kathy gifford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gifford", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bolivar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "polk county courthouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:55.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d0443587f97412a4e04208fa9d59896ba149fa40", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94oobUZghFoTw56xnszBkzQJEAX_X8byDart2bRZBXk55Gh6QxDpqE9L9rmMQ_DTqwnzibXwd93YQ9hWOT33XLyx9gmombRefJX0UBLhW_7cKIdfQCzLll0O0TENgRvSFXQm6A3iQwbwfi_z8lpOOSiOE-", "site_full": "www.amazon.co.uk", "site": "amazon.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product-reviews/1408856778/ref=s9_acsd_zwish_hd_bw_b17GB_c_x_8_w?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-11&pf_rd_r=FJKTB864TB0WXTC3603S&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=fd347e45-37c2-5ef7-938e-e2348b8d0a86&pf_rd_i=266239", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Amazon.co.uk:Customer reviews: Harry Potter Box Set: The Complete Collection (Children's Paperback)", "title": "Box Set: The Complete Collection (Children's Paperback)", "title_full": "Amazon.co.uk:Customer reviews: Harry Potter Box Set: The Complete Collection (Children's Paperback)", "published": "2017-12-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "097135b6b1949cf281d46a18efdec63ccce732ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94oobUZghFoTw56xnszBkzQJEAX_X8byDart2bRZBXk55Gh6QxDpqE9L9rmMQ_DTqwnzibXwd93YQ9hWOT33XLyx9gmombRefJX0UBLhW_7cKIdfQCzLll0O0TENgRvSFXQm6A3iQwbwfiZB7NLqKwDq1qX5SDjN1X8GQN4su.BZ99EwgNAx6PZDviFEupbXvEmw--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Selma", "published": "2017-12-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I\u2019ve read it so many times but I still love it.

The hunk has quit the show owing to creative differences. \nA source told Bombay Times: \"I wasn't happy with the way my character was shaping up and the track didn't pan out as I was promised. I had a meeting with the producer and we decided to part ways mutually.\" \nNaagin 3: Krystle D'souza to replace Mouni Roy; Priyank Sharma to play male lead? \nTalking about why he chose to take an exit, Sidharth told the daily: \"I wasn't happy with the way my character was shaping up and the track didn't pan out as I was promised. I had a meeting with the producer and we decided to part ways mutually.\" \nOn the other hand, rumour has it that Sidharth's unruly behaviour and starry tantrums on the sets caused the makers to oust him from the show. Besides making the cast and crew wait for several hours for start the shoot, Sidharth had apparently abused co-actress Jasmin Bhasin and Kunal Verma in the past as well. Not just that, the actor even had a heated argument with Shital Somani, show's Project Head, after which he stormed out of the set. Sidharth Shukla wins IANS \nMeanwhile, the report said that Rohan Gandotra, who was last seen on Kaala Teeka, will step into Sidharth's shoes. He will play the role of Parth Bhanushali in Dil Se Dil Tak. \nConfirming the news of Rohan entering the show, producer Sumeet Mittal said, \"Sidharth and we had creative differences and hence, we decided to go our separate ways on a good note.\" \nDil Se Dil Tak started off with a unique concept, breaking the stereotype of saas-bahu dramas on Indian television. Also starring Rashami Desai, the show deals with the subject of surrogacy and how the older generation of a traditional family will accept it.

Scott Barbour / Getty Images Members of Parliament celebrate at Parliament House on Thursday in Canberra, Australia, after the approval of same-sex marriage. Michael Masters / Getty Images \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of registered voters and ensured that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\" Copyright 2017 NPR.

I graduated college and got a job that grosses 40k with a 3% matching 401k option that I will start in January. I have roughly 24k in student loans that average 4% interest that I have to begin paying back in January. ($220 payment) Before my senior year of college I bought a house with my best friend which we co-own. My bills range from 800-1000 dollars a month (not including impending student loans and 401k withdrawal) and I have 4k in savings.\nStep 1 My plan is to make the minimum payment on my student loans while saving because I should be able to save more than 4% of it per year.\nStep 2 The money I save is going towards investing into retirement and creating a method of being financial independent. I have heard(and seen) that real estate can be a decent way of doing this so I planned to invest into rental properties in my town, leave the management up to a property management company, and collect the income. This would be the best scenario for me while I was working.\nI'm posting this because I want others with more experience and knowledge to look over my plan and give me guidance, tips, criticism, or suggestions. I know this might seem like a long shot but I feel as if i'm in a decent position as a 23 year old recent graduate and i'm determined to become wealthy. I know I have missed some information some might need to help me so please just ask and i'll be glad to share what I can. Please be kind as this is my first reddit post ever(I think i'm good on the rules here, I hope.) I appreciate any feedback!

Apple is expected to launch it AR headsets before the expected time, according to some reports it recorded that Apple is putting all its efforts to make it possible till 2019. Close Google Pixel 2 XL vs Apple iPhone 8 Plus \nCatcher is the company which is responsible for making the metal frames and chassis for the Apple iPhone and Apple iPad. Catcher chairman Allen Horng has recently revealed that in 2018 his company will start producing chassis for a new product line. \nAfter this announcement, some analysts believe that this information indicates that Catcher will be making some part of Apple's rumored AR headset. This is the device that former Piper Jaffray analyst and current hedge fund honcho Gene Munster say will be bigger than the iPhone. \nMunster and many other analysts expect Apple's AR headset to launch in 2020. Even Apple CEO Tim Cook said a couple of months ago that the technology is not yet mature enough for such a product to be released soon. REUTERS/Stephen Lam \nCatcher's chairman notes that the first quarter of 2018, which traditionally would be a slow period for the company, will feature a high utilization rate in part thanks to the new product line it will be supplying. \nQuanta is a company which is known for handling some assembly work for Apple, and recently the company has received the licenses to manufacture AR optical camera components from Israeli-AR firm Lumus. According to reports, Quanta has pumped a $45 million investment into Lumus in 2016. \nQuanta which manufactures the Apple Watch and Macbooks said that an AR headset will be ready for launch no later than 2019. While Quanta isn't specifically talking about a product for Apple. Rumours suggest that the AR headset will carry a model number of T2888, and will run on a new Os called the reality Operating System (rOS) \nAll these information and announcements indicate that Apple is working hard on the production of AR headsets, and the launch can be expected before the estimated time. So far, there is no official confirmation on this matter. Hope Apple will soon clear the air over AR headsets.
