(AP Photo/Jae C.

That figure is up nearly 1 percent from 2016.\nOf that total, 193,000 people had no access to nightly shelter and instead were staying in vehicles, tents, the streets and other places considered uninhabitable. The unsheltered figure is up by more than 9 percent compared to two years ago.\nIncreases are higher in several West Coast cities, where the explosion in homelessness has prompted at least 10 city and county governments to declare states of emergency since 2015.\nCity officials, homeless advocates and those living on the streets point to a main culprit: the region's booming economy .\nRents have soared beyond affordability for many lower-wage workers who until just a just few years ago could typically find a place to stay. Now, even a temporary setback can be enough to leave them out on the streets.\n\"A lot of people in America don't realize they might be two checks, three checks, four checks away from being homeless,\" said Thomas Butler Jr., who stays in a carefully organized tent near a freeway ramp in downtown Los Angeles.\nButler said he was in transitional housing \u2014 a type of program that prepares people for permanent homes \u2014 for a while but mostly has lived on the streets for the past couple of years.\nThe numbers in the report back up what many people in California, Oregon and Washington have been experiencing in their communities: encampments sprouting along freeways and rivers; local governments struggling to come up with money for long-term solutions; conflicts over whether to crack down on street camping and even feeding the homeless.\nThe most alarming consequence of the West Coast homeless explosion is a deadly hepatitis A outbreak that has affected Los Angeles, Santa Cruz and San Diego, the popular tourist destination in a county where more than 5,600 people now live on the streets or in their cars. The disease is spread through a liver-damaging virus that lives in feces.\nThe outbreak prompted California officials to declare a state of emergency in October.\nThe HUD report underscores the severity of the problem along the West Coast.\nWhile the overall homeless population in California, Oregon and Washington grew by 14 percent over the past two years, the part of that population considered unsheltered climbed 23 percent to 108,000. That is in part due a shortage of affordable housing.\nIn booming Seattle, for example, the HUD report shows the unsheltered population grew by 44 percent over two years to nearly 5,500.\nThe homeless service area that includes most of Los Angeles County, the epicenter of the crisis, saw its total homeless count top 55,000 people, up by more than 13,000 from 2016. Four out of every five homeless individuals there are considered unsheltered, leaving tens of thousands of people with no place to sleep other than the streets or parks.\nBy comparison, while New York City's homeless population grew to more than 76,000, only about 5 percent are considered unsheltered thanks to a system that can get people a cot under a roof immediately.\nIn the West Coast states, the surge in homelessness has become part of the fabric of daily life.\nThe Monty, a bar in the Westlake neighborhood near downtown Los Angeles, usually doesn't open until 8 p.m. Partner and general manager Corey Allen said that's because a nearby shelter requires people staying there to be in the building by 7. Waiting until after that to open means the streets outside are calmer.\nAllen said the homeless have come into his bar to bathe in the restroom wash basins, and employees have developed a strategy for stopping people from coming in to panhandle among customers.\nSeventy-eight-year-old Theodore Neubauer sees the other side of it. Neubauer says he served in Vietnam but now lives in a tent in downtown Los Angeles. He is surrounded by thriving business and entertainment districts, and new apartments that are attracting scores of young people to the heart of the nation's second most populous city.\n\"Well, there's a million-dollar view,\" he said.\nHelping those like Neubauer is a top policy priority and political issue in Los Angeles.\nSince last year, voters in the city and Los Angeles County have passed a pair of tax-boosting ballot initiatives to raise an expected $4.7 billion over the next decade for affordable housing and services for the homeless. HUD Secretary Ben Carson praised the region for dealing with the issue and not relying solely on the federal government.\n\"We need to move a little bit away from the concept that only the government can solve the problem,\" he said.\nBut Mayor Eric Garcetti said that insufficient federal funding for affordable housing and anti-homelessness programs are part of the reason for the city's current crisis.\n\"Los Angeles' homelessness crisis was not created in a vacuum, and it cannot be solved by L.A. alone,\" Garcetti said in a statement.\nExcluding the Los Angeles region, total homelessness nationwide would have been down by about 1.5 percent compared with 2016.\nThe California counties of Sacramento, which includes the state capital, and Alameda, which is home to Oakland, also had one-year increases of more than 1,000 homeless people.\nIn contrast, the HUD report showed a long-running decline in homelessness continuing in most other regions. Nationally, the overall homeless number was down by 13 percent since 2010 and the unsheltered number has dropped by 17 percent over that seven-year span, although some changes in methodology and definitions over the years can affect comparisons.\nPlaces where the numbers went down included Atlanta, Philadelphia, Miami, the Denver area and Hawaii, which declared a statewide homelessness emergency in 2015.\nThe homeless point-in-time survey is based on counts at shelters and on the streets. While imperfect, it attempts to represent how many people are homeless at a given time. Those who work regularly with the homeless say it is certainly an undercount, although many advocates and officials believe it correctly identifies trend lines.\nThe report is submitted to Congress and used by government agencies as a factor in distributing money for programs designed to help the homeless.\n___\nMulvihill reported from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

(AP Photo/Noah Berger) prev next comments LOS ANGELES \u2014 A wildfire erupted in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section Wednesday as yet another part of Southern California found itself under siege from an outbreak of wind-whipped blazes that have consumed multimillion-dollar houses and tract homes alike.\nHundreds of homes across the L.A. metropolitan area and beyond were feared destroyed since Monday, but firefighters were only slowly managing to make their way into some of the hard-hit areas for an accurate count.\nAs many as five fires have closed highways, schools and museums, shut down production of TV series and cast a hazardous haze over the region. About 200,000 people were under evacuation orders. No deaths and only a few injuries were reported.\nFrom the beachside city of Ventura, where rows of homes were leveled, to the rugged foothills north of Los Angeles, where more than two dozen horses died at a boarding stable, to Bel-Air, where the rich and famous have sweeping views of L.A. below, fierce Santa Ana winds sweeping in from the desert fanned the flames and fears.\n\"God willing, this will slow down so the firefighters can do their job,\" said Maurice Kaboud, who ignored an evacuation order and stood in his backyard with a garden hose at the ready.\nAir tankers that were grounded most of Tuesday because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again.\nThey were expected to gust as high as 80 mph (about 130 kph) overnight into Thursday, possibly creating unprecedented fire danger. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, which uses a color-coded wind index, issued a purple forecast, the most severe, for the first time ever, director Ken Pimlott said.\n\"They're going to be extreme tomorrow,\" Pimlott said. \"We need to have everybody's heads up \u2014 heads on a swivel \u2014 and pay very close attention.\"\nBefore dawn Wednesday, flames exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes in Bel-Air, where houses range from $2 million to tens of millions of dollars.\nFirefighters hosed down a burning Tudor-style house as helicopters dropped water on hillsides to protect homes from the 150-acre (60-hectare) blaze.\nA Christmas tree saved from the flames was in the front yard of a burned-out house and a large painting was propped against a Range Rover.\nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said.\nBel-Air was the site of a catastrophic fire in 1961 that burned nearly 500 homes. Burt Lancaster and Zsa Zsa Gabor were among the celebrities who lost houses.\nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday.\nUCLA, at the edge of the Bel-Air evacuation zone, canceled afternoon classes and its evening basketball game. Students on campus wore dust and surgical masks.\nBy late afternoon, firefighters said they had controlled the fire's advance.\nProduction of HBO's \"Westworld\" and the CBS show \"S.W.A.T.\" was suspended because of the danger to cast and crew from two nearby fires.\nIn Ventura County northwest of L.A., the biggest and most destructive of the wildfires grew beyond 100 square miles (259 square kilometers) and had nearly reached the Pacific on Tuesday night after starting 30 miles (about 45 kilometers) inland a day earlier.\nThe fire destroyed at least 150 structures, but incident commander Todd Derum said he suspects hundreds of homes have been lost.\nAlong a stretch of a hilly subdivision with stunning ocean and mountain views above Ventura, about 65 homes were razed. Fewer than 30 houses still stood in the same area, where embers glowed and trees smoldered. Homes farther up the road fared much better, with only two burned and 42 intact.\nWhile winds were calmer Wednesday, the fire remained active around Ventura, spreading along the coast to the west and up into the mountains around the community of Ojai and into the agricultural city of Santa Paula.\n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\"\n___\nAmanda Lee Myers in Ventura and John Antczak, Jae Hong, Reed Saxon in Los Angeles contributed to this report.\n___\nFor complete coverage of the California wildfires, click here: https://apnews.com/tag/Wildfires", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://apnews.com/tag/Wildfires"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maurice kaboud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jae hong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel dreifuss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pimlott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rupert murdoch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zsa zsa gabor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amanda lee myers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john antczak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ken pimlott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "todd derum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim chavez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carlson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burt lancaster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reed saxon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "southern california associated press", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "california department of forestry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hbo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press firefighters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "southern california bel-air", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bel-air", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "creek fire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sepulveda pass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bel air", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ojai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moraga vineyards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa ana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l.a.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa paula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lake view terrace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:34.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "60d854e898e12b1eab7d74af8608e630d04c9326", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ50HWkEALmJMhgrQ5d93EilL3B29ELNT2tB5Eehjds8T5hCaP4TNQc1GQYZwJhEX.DBJ1.3vhfBg--", "site_full": "thefiringline.com", "site": "thefiringline.com", "site_section": "https://thefiringline.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=1", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Handguns: General Handgun Forum - The Firing Line Forums", "title": "I solved a major problem that's been bothering me for a while", "title_full": "I solved a major problem that's been bothering me for a while - The Firing Line Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T13:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 32529, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b046c49d821d56054c4ebf06bbe2b333b9cdc472", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ50HWkEALmJMhgrQ5d93EilL3B29ELNT2tB5Eehjds8T5hCaP4TNQc1GQYZwJhEX9z1xvA85YPfU4tO0xC61yT", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Bob Wright", "published": "2017-12-06T16:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I found a zippered tool bag at Home Depot that has an extension handle and wheels.

That's what we do this time of year.\"   SUBSCRIBE NOW \nThose efforts are paying dividends. Earlier Wednesday, Miami received a commitment from Jarren Williams, the nation's sixth-ranked dual-threat senior quarterback. \n\"I'm not allowed to talk about 1/8that3/8 at this point,\" Richt said, alluding to NCAA recruiting rules, but he added coyly, \"I heard something good happened.\" \nThe success the 10-2 Hurricanes had this season certainly isn't hurting in getting the attention of the players Richt covets. Williams, a 6-foot-2 four-star prospect from Central Gwinnett in Lawrenceville, Ga., visited Miami on the weekend of the Hurricanes' 41-8 rout of Notre Dame. \nRicht pointed out that recruiting efforts began to gain traction after last season, his first at UM, when the 'Canes went 9-4 and finished with five consecutive wins. That helped land a number of early commitments before this season started. \n\"I knew as a head coach that we had to show enough on the field throughout the season to keep our confidence as a staff and in us as a program. I think we accomplished that,\" he said. \n\"We do have a wonderful class set to come in. We can't really talk about them yet. But if everybody stays true to their word, we're going to have a whale of another group of guys to help that roster.\" \nThe back-to-back defeats against Pittsburgh and Clemson showed that the Hurricanes need reinforcements on offense. Running back Mark Walton and tight end Chris Herndon, arguably their two best offensive players, had their seasons cut short by injuries and won't return. Leading receiver Braxton Berrios is graduating. \nAn upgrade at quarterback could also be welcomed. Redshirt-junior Malik Rosier, in his first year as starter, showed a winning touch in some comeback efforts but not always an accurate one. \nAsked if a certain new quarterback recruit might be entering school as a mid-year enrollee, Richt said: \"We plan on having a bunch of mid-year enrollees, and there's a possibility of that.\" \nEnrolling early would enable Williams to participate in spring practices and potentially in the mix to vie for the starting job. \nAs to the possibility of an open competition at quarterback, Richt said, \"We do that every spring in every season.\" \nThe Hurricanes' 2018 class, with 21 commitments so far, is ranked in the top five of several recruiting sites: second by Rivals.com, third by 247sports.com and fourth by ESPN. \nAs Richt and staff look to add to it, their message is that a team that ranked as high as No. 2 in the College Football Playoff poll this season can offer opportunities for talented newcomers to play early. \n\"I think they see the success that we've had, they see how close we've been,\" Richt said. \"But they know we need help. They can see that we don't have quite the depth that we need to have to sustain any kind of injures or attrition. So that's why we're beating the bushes hard, like everybody else.\" \nThat is particularly true this year with the new Early Signing Period. From Dec. 20-22, high school prospects can sign a national letter of intent. Previously, they had to wait for the first Wednesday of February. \nRicht could point out to potential signees the chance to play for the 2017 Walter Camp Coach of the Year, a prestigious honor he earned this week after earlier being named the ACC's top coach. \nRest assured he will, as a means of touting the overall strength of UM and the football program. \n\"I think it's the biggest team award that there is, quite frankly,\" he said. \"You don't get that type of an honor unless the team wins. You don't win unless you have all the ingredients.\" \nThe focus now is on adding ingredients. Richt noted that his staff lost valuable recruiting time last week while preparing for the ACC Championship Game. So they are redoubling their efforts and haven't yet begun preparations for the Orange Bowl. \nPlayers are focused on academics to conclude the fall semester. They are doing strength and conditioning and may work out informally, but won't begin formal preparation for the Orange Bowl until the week after next, Richt said. \n\"We'll get at least eight really quality practices in. It's like having an open date, which is plenty,\" Richt said. \nThe Hurricanes will have their hands full against Wisconsin, which is 12-1 and has the nation's top defense.

illegal mining (galamsey) in Kumasi in the Ashanti Region, has been dismissed by an Accra high court for want of credible evidence. \nThe court, presided over by Justice Abdulai Idrisu, ruled that the applicants (Huang and four other Chinese) were not able to demonstrate that the bail conditions as set by the court, were negatively affecting them to necessitate their (conditions\u2019) variation. \nLawyer for the Chinese lady, popularly known as Aisha Huang, and the others \u2013 Gao Jin Cheng, Lu Qi Jun, Habin Gao and Zhang Pen \u2013 filed the application two weeks ago praying the court to show some clemency and review some of the bail conditions which they claimed were placing a financial burden and other challenges on them. \nThe five were arrested in Kumasi for their alleged involvement in large-scale illegal mining and were brought to Accra to face trial. \nAisha Huang was granted bail by the court in June 2017 in the sum of GH\u00a2500,000 with two sureties to be justified. \nThe four others were also granted bail in the sum of GH\u023c500,000.00 with one surety each who must be a Ghanaian by birth. Each surety is to be justified. \nPer the bail conditions, all the accused persons are to report twice a week to the Inspector General of Police or the Director of Immigration in Accra or their representatives, in writing. \nTheir lawyer, Bernard Owiredu Donkor, five months after the granting of bail, filed the application praying the court to allow his clients to report to the Ashanti Regional Police Commander and the Regional Immigration boss instead of travelling from Kumasi to Accra all the time. \nAccording to him, that particular term of the bail bond had brought untold hardship both financially and physically to the accused persons since they have to spend so much on hotel bills and transportation. \nHe argument was vehemently opposed by a state attorney, Watkins Adama, who told the court that the five had not complied fully with all the terms of the bail. \nHe argued that the five could not present any evidence to substantiate their claims and subsequently prayed the court to dismiss the application. \nJustice Idrisu, in his ruling, stated that bail conditions can be varied if the applicant presents compelling reasons to show that the conditions are harsh and detrimental, and also demonstrate how the bail conditions affect them. \nHe said Aisha and her accomplices could however, not demonstrate to the court why the conditions should be varied, stating that they could not present any receipt to the court relating to payment of hotel bills, transportation or money spent on buying fuel for their vehicles. \nHe noted that the applicants also failed to present to the court any medical reports indicating that traveling from Kumasi to Accra had subjected them to any medical condition resulting from stress. \nJustice Idrisu stated that all the conditions of the bail were to ensure that the accused persons would come to court, considering the seriousness of the offences they have been charged with. \nHe concluded that the applicants have sureties who are capable of ensuring that they come to court \u2013 and all the sureties are resident in Accra. \nHe therefore dismissed the application for want of compelling evidence.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "en huang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aisha huang  an", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aisha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lu qi jun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhang pen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdulai idrisu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gao jin cheng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernard owiredu donkor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "watkins adama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aisha huang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idrisu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "habin gao", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "accra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashanti region", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kumasi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:35.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "62269ba77da16a5acc0cde3967b921ed1910a365", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqgAk4LN_6vb_vGHyCO0yCXlu9cXLJ52AbfWJSXNfs0RIl5RHO.8Wf8tzlqoQnGBHWXtoTAigqBLEadPwKpNnjYI6pIhav7w74npCocQ7fs6w-", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/business/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Business links", "title": "(9830352) Roger Goodell will continue the wreck the NFL for years to come", "title_full": "FARK.com: (9830352) Roger Goodell will continue the wreck the NFL for years to come", "published": "2017-12-07T10:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "http://img.fark.net/images/cache/orig/X/X1/fark_X1JG7tLB2FBcrO6NNi4m3pgjNKY.jpg?t=gLfh0XzOALHsFazq0IWV5w&amp;f=1512968400", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3382, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "62269ba77da16a5acc0cde3967b921ed1910a365", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqgAk4LN_6vb_vGHyCO0yCXlu9cXLJ52AbfWJSXNfs0RIl5RHO.8Wf8tzlqoQnGBHWXtoTAigqBLEadPwKpNnjYI6pIhav7w74npCocQ7fs6w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "davidphogan", "published": "2017-12-07T10:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "(9830352) Roger Goodell will continue the wreck the NFL for years to come", "text": "redmid17 : I love how you're trying to preach the gospel and whaaaargbl comes out.

They hit 4 of 5 3-pointers to that point. They ended the first half with a 13-0 run that included three treys, two by Blake, for a 49-20 lead. \nBlake scored 18 points in the first half on 7-of-11 shooting, including all four of his 3-pointers. The Vandals made 9 of 13 3-pointers and shot 51 percent (20 of 39) while the Cougars were at 39 percent (12 of 31), going 4 of 16 from distance. \n\"I was just locked in and focused, my teammates were helping me, got me the ball,\" Blake said. \"Just hard work, hard work is paying off, so I am just blessed.\"   SUBSCRIBE NOW \nThe Cougars (6-2) used a 3-pointer from Carter Skaggs and a 3-point play by Robert Franks to get it to 14 on two occasions in the first three minutes of the second half but Sanders had a 3 and five points in a 7-0 run to push the lead to 21 with 15 minutes left and Washington State never challenged. \n\"It's a long season, you don't get too up when you are 6-0, you don't get too down, you just get ready for the next one,\" said WSU Coach Ernie Kent. \nPerrion Callandret added 16 points with five rebounds and five assists for the Vandals. \nFranks led the Cougars with 16 points. \n\"I told the players before this week started that players circle games on their schedules, I circled this week,\" said Idaho Coach Don Verlin. \"We went to Nicholls State on Sunday all away across the country, we come home for our rivals on Wednesday and we have to go visit the WAC champions on Saturday.\" \nBIG PICTURE \nWashington State: The Cougars put themselves in holes early the last two games trailing by 17 points to UC Davis and 19 points to Idaho at the half, losing two straight after winning their first six, including the Wooden Legacy Tournament Championship. \nIdaho: The Vandals had a 43-31 rebounding advantage and had 20 assists with just nine turnovers. ... Trevon Allen had a huge block that ignited the crowd, followed by a fast break layup from Sanders on the other end to give Idaho a 22-point lead. \nFUN FACT \nIdaho and Washington State have the oldest continuous rivalry west of the Mississippi River. The teams met for the 113th-consecutive season. The win by Idaho is the third largest in rivalry history and largest since 1963. \nUP NEXT: \nWashington State: The Cougars will play at UTEP on Saturday. \nIdaho: The Vandals go on the road to face CSU Bakersfield on Saturday.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "blake", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brayon blake", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trevon allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malachi flynn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "franks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carter skaggs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert franks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ricky hester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ernie kent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perrion callandret", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "don verlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idaho  brayon blake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victor sanders", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "washington state 91-64 mobile & apps idaho", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "washington state's milan acquaah", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "ncaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap pete caster idaho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lewiston tribune", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap pete caster blake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "csu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicholls state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wsu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cougars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utep", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "idaho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bakersfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mississippi river", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:35.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3cffa606ebd64d1b762492c6b9dce771159e7af8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU447ZRj027T_H_SxGA9z2lEzdFa8mAxXDTxxt69FUyTbrfsW9uEsBAbiCvp5YPYMPk6yS9YQj2.NnOlICIM5U1fIdjscwlNwUBpT80gKqy3Hrw--", "site_full": "lawprofessors.typepad.com", "site": "typepad.com", "site_section": "http://blawgsearch.justia.com/blogs/categories/criminal-law/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Recent Criminal Law posts - Justia BlawgSearch.com", "title": "Henderson on Vigilantism", "title_full": "Henderson on Vigilantism", "published": "2017-12-07T01:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://taxprof.typepad.com/lpbn.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3cffa606ebd64d1b762492c6b9dce771159e7af8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU447ZRj027T_H_SxGA9z2lEzdFa8mAxXDTxxt69FUyTbrfsW9uEsBAbiCvp5YPYMPk6yS9YQj2.NnOlICIM5U1fIdjscwlNwUBpT80gKqy3Hrw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CrimProf BlogEditor", "published": "2017-12-07T01:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "Henderson on Vigilantism", "text": "Stephen E. Henderson (University of Oklahoma College of Law) has posted Daredevil: Legal (and Moral?) Vigilante (Ohio State Journal of Criminal Law, Vol. 15, 2017)   In 1964, the comic world was introduced to its first physically disabled practicing attorney: Matt Murdock. Initially a proud graduate of \u201cState College\u201d and later more impressively pedigreed as a graduate of either Columbia or Harvard Law, Murdock supplemented his day job as attorney with a side of vigilante justice as Daredevil.In 2003, Murdock became the only attorney superhero to appear as the title character in a movie. A truly awful movie, yes, but a movie all the same. And then in 2015, thanks to the talents of Drew Goddard, Murdock became the star of a terrific television series.But while it makes for good comics and television, does it make for good law? Good policy? Is there such a thing as moral vigilantism, and, if so, is Matt Murdock a moral vigilante? What of his foil, the Punisher, or the police officer who comes around to assisting Daredevil\u2019s endeavors? I propose preliminary answers to these questions, including considering vigilantism as theorized by Paul and Sarah Robinson, Les Johnston, and Travis Dumsday. Their metrics are helpful and illuminating, but not, I think, a fully satisfying articulation of what constitutes moral vigilantism. And if we cannot adequately discern moral vigilantism in fictional characters, we will fare no better in the real world. There remains more good work to be done\u2014and more good comics to be written. http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/crimprof_blog/2017/12/henderson-on-vigilantism.html", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stephen e. henderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "henderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murdock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drew goddard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah robinson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "travis dumsday", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt murdock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "les johnston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of oklahoma college of law", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vigilante", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio state journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard law", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:35.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "62269ba77da16a5acc0cde3967b921ed1910a365", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqgAk4LN_6vb_vGHyCO0yCXlu9cXLJ52AbfWJSXNfs0RIl5RHO.8Wf8tzlqoQnGBHWXtoTAigqBLEadPwKpNnjYI6pIhav7w74npCocQ7fs6w-", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/business/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Business links", "title": "(9830352) Roger Goodell will continue the wreck the NFL for years to come", "title_full": "FARK.com: (9830352) Roger Goodell will continue the wreck the NFL for years to come", "published": "2017-12-07T10:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "http://img.fark.net/images/cache/orig/X/X1/fark_X1JG7tLB2FBcrO6NNi4m3pgjNKY.jpg?t=gLfh0XzOALHsFazq0IWV5w&amp;f=1512968400", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3382, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9b691d71e7daa7cae551bd8a7d433401a2545ca4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqgAk4LN_6vb_vGHyCO0yCXlu9cXLJ52AbfWJSXNfs0RIl5RHO.8Wf8tzlqoQnGBHWXtoTAigqBLEadPwKpNnjYI6pIhav7w74NJdWdYIGuD9ADa9CpKvyew--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "themindiswatching", "published": "2017-12-07T11:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "It's not Goodell who will sign it, it'll be Roger Goodell LLC.

One challenge averted, but do others await? \nAs it turned out, there were 2,900 double votes cast in nine races. And, although officials initially claimed no races were affected, the numbers indicated it was, in fact, mathematically possible after all for one race to be impacted: West York Borough Council. \nFour seats were up, and Councilwoman Shelley Metzler finished fifth. She might have secured fourth-place - and another term - if she'd received enough of the double votes cast for other candidates. \nNormally, you can't vote twice for a candidate on one ballot. But the programming error made it possible in 20 races in York - nine of which were contested - one month ago. One was countywide, for Court of Common Pleas judge, which is why tens of thousands of ballots could've been impacted. \nMetzler t old The York Dispatch that she was considering filing a challenge. If successful, that would've meant a special election (costs range from $5,000 to $186,000, depending, according to Pennsylvania Department of State data from 2003-16). \nThis particular election is no longer an issue, because a challenge was never filed by Metzler, who didn't return calls inquiring about her decision. \nBut the county has been forced to re-examine its election administration process. \nOfficials listed ideas for improvement in a four-page response to the state - although it's unclear whether those steps will fully address lingering compliance issues. York didn't follow state guidelines \nOfficials say they intend to contract Dominion Voting Systems to help administer future elections, according to the county's report and spokesman Mark Walters. \nThe county has declined to provide a cost estimate for engaging Dominion, which acquired Sequoia Voting Systems after York purchased its touch-screen machines from Sequoia in 2006 (the machines are expected to last no longer than 10 to 15 years, but the county's been adamant that human error, not the machines' age, is to blame for the confusion in November). \nYork also failed to follow state guidelines for testing voting machines before delivering them to precincts. The checklist includes simulating voting for cross-filed candidates (those who secure nominations for both major political parties during the primary and thus appear on both sides of the ballot). \nCross-filing - which appears to be relatively proliferate in Pennsylvania, judging from responses from experts at Ballotpedia and the Leauge of Women Voters - is where the problem occurred: when a voter selected a cross-filed candidate from one side of the ballot, the name remained on the other side instead of disappearing as it normally would. \nSome voters reported becoming confused and hitting the name again, which counted as two votes and reduced the number of selections remaining. For example, in a race (like West York) where voters could select up to four candidates, such confusion would leave them with only two selections remaining instead of three as would be the case with a properly functioning ballot. \nIt is unclear why the county skipped the cross-filing simulation in its voting machine tests, which happen weeks in advance of Election Day. The report doesn't address this question. An email from Walters attributed the oversight to \"a breakdown with checks and balances,\" although that was clear before the report was even compiled. \nThe cross-filing problem wasn't known until Election Day when it was discovered by Nikki Suchanic, Director of York's Department of Elections and Voter Registration. \nSuchanic discovered it while fixing a separate, smaller-scale ballot mistake for a race involving one precinct, two candidates and four machines. Response, re-examined \nSuchanic and other county officials didn't see an overnight fix for an error affecting hundreds of machines already delivered to precincts over 900 square miles. \nThey also didn't want to widely publicize the problem because they feared prompting intentional - and illegal - double-voting, according to the county's report to the state. \nSo they decided to post signs at each precinct warning voters about the problem and not to double vote. But some county residents later reported voting as late as 10 a.m., well past the end of peak poll traffic, without seeing any notifications that there was an issue. \nThe report attributes the flyering failure to shortcomings of rovers, who are county employees from various departments tasked with pitching in on Election Day. Officials say Suchanic will come up with a method for ensuring rovers carry out their duties as assigned. Oversight issues \nInitially, the county also said it didn't resort to using emergency paper ballots because there \"wasn't time.\" \nYork County hasn't provided a copy of its election administration plan. But state law requires counties to prepare enough emergency paper ballots for 20 percent of registered voters in each precinct, and to have a strategy for quick restocking. \nThe law also provides for using emergency ballots if at least half of voting machines become \"inoperable.\" \nWalters says last month's scenario didn't meet those legal thresholds, and the law - both statutes themselves and relevant caselaw - doesn't address what constitutes an \"inoperable\" machine. \nBut election officials also try to avoid breaking out emergency ballots at all costs, taking preventative steps such as having extra machines and backup generators on hand, according to Forrest Lehman, who heads the Elections & Registration division in Lycoming County (larger and more sparsely populated than York) and sits on the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania's elections committee. \nLehman says using scannable sheets can delay results in counties with electronic machines because they might only have access to one or two scantron machines - if any. \nIf York had used emergency ballots, they would've been tabulated by hand, Walters says. \nAs it was, the problem did prompt a manual recount and audit i n York, which was completed within the week already afforded for dealing with provisional ballots and other anomalies before results are certified. More numbers, more problems \nThere were other counties that had problems on Election Day, althought the state only requested a follow-up report from York and Philadelphia. \nPhiladelphia's ballots misstated the name of a statewide judicial candidate. \nIn Chester County, 163 voters were assigned to the wrong polling place, but ultimately were able to cast ballots, according to the state . \nAnd although election outcomes aren't in dispute in Lawrence County, the ban there on cell phones inside voting booths might prompt a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, according to deputy legal director Sara Rose. \nNearly half of states have fully or partly banned taking photos of ballots, citing concerns that the pictures could be used in vote-buying schemes, Rose says. \nSome of these laws laws have been struck down in federal court, while others remain in place. Editor's note: This post was corrected to reflect that the state also requested a post-general election report this year from Philadelphia.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "emily pre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forrest lehman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark walters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nikki suchanic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shelley metzler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "director of york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sara rose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lehman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metzler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "county commissioners association of pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pennsylvania department of state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west york borough council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american civil liberties union of pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of elections and voter registration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keystone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the york dispatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dominion voting systems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sequoia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sequoia voting systems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dominion", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elections & registration", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "news york county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "york county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ballotpedia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lycoming county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chester county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lawrence county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:36.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e273ea8a65dd08ddbf2c108420c7bfde93a1cc7c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21QFKgdFfPH9.wOWom_fciBOF35IgpCs4R1hqmBorzISqFGJxQbnNSlbBYdoCnq4u_Iay.eIW68Uez_AO0yIuuz3k9lHOm7cV8Bq38IiwFrC5w--", "site_full": "austinboronews.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://austinboronews.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Austin Boro News", "title": "Statement by VA Secretary Shulkin - Homeless Funding", "title_full": "Statement by VA Secretary Shulkin - Homeless Funding", "published": "2017-12-07T12:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e273ea8a65dd08ddbf2c108420c7bfde93a1cc7c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21QFKgdFfPH9.wOWom_fciBOF35IgpCs4R1hqmBorzISqFGJxQbnNSlbBYdoCnq4u_Iay.eIW68Uez_AO0yIuuz3k9lHOm7cV8Bq38IiwFrC5w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bernard Fowler (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "Statement by VA Secretary Shulkin - Homeless Funding", "text": "VA News Release \n12/06/2017 05:53 PM EST \nStatement by Secretary Shulkin - Homeless Funding \nThere will be absolutely no change in the funding to support our homeless programs. \nWe will not be shifting any homeless program money to the Choice program. \nThe President has increased VA homeless program funding by $66 million in his fiscal year 2018 budget. \nOver the next six months, I will solicit input from our local VA leaders and external stakeholders on how best to target our funding to the geographical areas that need it most. \nBased on that input we will come forward with proposals for fiscal year 2019 on how to improve the targeting of our homeless program funding.

But 20 years later, after DNA evidence excluded Coleman and Fulton from crime scene evidence and identified a local man who\u2019d been convicted of several rapes, it was revealed that both men were innocent. The same judge who\u2019d sentenced the men to spend the rest of their lives in prison two decades ago told them last Friday, \u201cYou\u2019re free to go.\u201d \nAccording to a recent article in the Chicago Tribune , no physical evidence linked Coleman or Fulton to the crime. They were implicated in the crime when Coleman and a friend found the body of the victim in the basement\u2014which was accessible only from the outdoors\u2014of Coleman\u2019s mother\u2019s house. The victim had disappeared a few weeks prior. \nColeman was taken to the police station where he was both physically assaulted and called a \u201clying assed n\u2014er\u201d by one of the police officers interrogating him. Ultimately, Coleman maintained his innocence but was coerced into signing a court-reported statement that implicated him as well as Fulton and one of their other friends. Fulton was then arrested and taken to the police station where he too was physically assaulted and threatened to be shot in the head by a police officer. Fulton, too, eventually signed a confession although he insisted that he was not involved in the crime. \nAt trial, Coleman and Fulton were both found guilty and barely escaped the death penalty. \nIn 2016, after trying to prove their innocence for decade, the conviction integrity unit at Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office reinvestigated the case. Evidence was submitted for DNA testing. It was discovered that the DNA profile found excluded Coleman and Fulton but was consistent with another man convicted of other rapes. Earlier this year, the Exoneration Project at the University of Chicago Law School filed a post-conviction petition on behalf of Coleman, and attorney Kathleen Zellner filed a petition for Fulton, and in November the men\u2019s convictions were vacated and they were released. \nLast Friday, Cook County Assistant State\u2019s attorney Eric Sussman said that his office would not seek a retrial based on the results from the DNA testing. \n\u201cThe sun is shining. It\u2019s a beautiful day. . . . It\u2019s a great time to be free. It\u2019s been a long time coming,\u201d Fulton said following the hearing, according to the Chicago Tribune .

Various transformation programmes and 1Malaysia products have been introduced. Infrastructure projects are not implemented only in the federal capital, but also in the rural and interior areas, including in Sabah and Sarawak. \nAll these need the necessary support and a huge mandate, not only from UMNO or BN members, but from all the people to together uphold the aspiration to empower the race and transform the country. \nThroughout the policy speech, the words \u201cgeneral election\u201d were mentioned not less than 20 times by the president and he also repeatedly reminded the delegates of the possible disaster if the mission failed. \n\u201cIn this war, which is the mother of all general elections, we will fight all out,\u201d said Najib to the cheering sea of party delegates, including Wanita, Youth and Puteri members, who were dressed in red. \nUMNO realises the huge challenges facing this coming general election.

Ibrahimovic return against Man City \nAny concerns as to his personality were quickly eased, though, with United\u2019s staff learning that the 36-year-old is a likeable character and true

had never met him before and he's the sort of guy that garners instant respect because of the way he carries himself. \n\"Zlatan apparently looked the kit men up and down and said: \u2018I hope you know God has arrived\u2019. \n\"The kit men were shaking and didn't know what to think, then he fell about laughing with them. He always does that.\" \nIbrahimovic was able to back up his bold comments off the field with eye-catching performances on it in 2016-17. \nHe helped United to get back on the trophy trail with winning goals in the Community Shield and EFL Cup final, while also putting them on the path to Europa League glory. \nHis debut campaign at Old Trafford had delivered 28 goals by the time he picked up an untimely knee injury in April which forced him under the knife.

(AP Photo/Desmond Boylan) prev next comments WASHINGTON \u2014 Doctors treating the U.S. embassy victims of suspected attacks in Cuba have discovered brain abnormalities as they search for clues to explain hearing, vision, balance and memory damage, The Associated Press has learned.\nIt's the most specific finding to date about physical damage, showing that whatever it was that harmed the Americans, it led to perceptible changes in their brains. The finding is also one of several factors fueling growing skepticism that some kind of sonic weapon was involved.\nMedical testing has revealed the embassy workers developed changes to the white matter tracts that let different parts of the brain communicate, several U.S. officials said, describing a growing consensus held by university and government physicians researching the attacks. White matter acts like information highways between brain cells.\nLoud, mysterious sounds followed by hearing loss and ear-ringing had led investigators to suspect \"sonic attacks.\" But officials are now carefully avoiding that term. The sounds may have been the byproduct of something else that caused damage, said three U.S. officials briefed on the investigation. They weren't authorized to discuss it publicly and demanded anonymity.\nPhysicians, FBI investigators and U.S. intelligence agencies have spent months trying to piece together the puzzle in Havana , where the U.S. says 24 U.S. government officials and spouses fell ill starting last year in homes and later in some hotels. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Wednesday he's \"convinced these were targeted attacks ,\" but the U.S. doesn't know who's behind them. A few Canadian Embassy staffers also got sick.\nDoctors still don't know how victims ended up with the white matter changes, nor how exactly those changes might relate to their symptoms. U.S. officials wouldn't say whether the changes were found in all 24 patients.\nBut acoustic waves have never been shown to alter the brain's white matter tracts, said Elisa Konofagou, a biomedical engineering professor at Columbia University who is not involved in the government's investigation.\n\"I would be very surprised,\" Konofagou said, adding that ultrasound in the brain is used frequently in modern medicine. \"We never see white matter tract problems.\"\nCuba has adamantly denied involvement, and calls the Trump administration's claims that U.S. workers were attacked \"deliberate lies .\" The new medical details may help the U.S. counter Havana's complaint that Washington hasn't presented any evidence.\nTillerson said the U.S. had shared some information with Havana, but wouldn't disclose details that would violate privacy or help a perpetrator learn how effective the attacks were.\n\"What we've said to the Cubans is: Small island. You've got a sophisticated intelligence apparatus. You probably know who's doing it. You can stop it,\" Tillerson said. \"It's as simple as that.\"\nThe case has plunged the U.S. medical community into uncharted territory. Physicians are treating the symptoms like a new, never-seen-before illness. After extensive testing and trial therapies, they're developing the first protocols to screen cases and identify the best treatments \u2014 even as the FBI investigation struggles to identify a culprit, method and motive.\nDoctors treating the victims wouldn't speak to the AP, yet their findings are expected to be discussed in an article being submitted to the Journal of the American Medical Association, U.S. officials said. Physicians at the University of Miami and the University of Pennsylvania who have treated the Cuba victims are writing it, with input from the State Department's medical unit and other government doctors.\nBut the article won't speculate about what technology might have harmed the workers or who would have wanted to target Americans in Cuba. If investigators are any closer to solving those questions, their findings won't be made public.\nThe AP first reported in August that U.S. workers reported sounds audible in parts of rooms but inaudible just a few feet away \u2014 unlike normal sound, which disperses in all directions. Doctors have now come up with a term for such incidents: \"directional acoustic phenomena.\"\nMost patients have fully recovered, some after rehabilitation and other treatment, officials said. Many are back at work. About one-quarter had symptoms that persisted for long periods or remain to this day.\nEarlier this year, the U.S. said doctors found patients had suffered concussions, known as mild traumatic brain injury, but were uncertain beyond that what had happened in their brains. Concussions are often diagnosed based solely on symptoms.\nStudies have found both concussions and white matter damage in Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans who survived explosions yet had no other physical damage. But those injuries were attributed mostly to shock waves from explosions. No Havana patients reported explosions or blows to the head.\nOutside medical experts said that when the sample of patients is so small, it's difficult to establish cause and effect.\n\"The thing you have to wonder anytime you see something on a scan: Is it due to the episode in question, or was it something pre-existing and unrelated to what happened?\" said Dr. Gerard Gianoli, an ear and brain specialist in Louisiana.\nAs Cuba works to limit damage to its reputation and economy, its government has produced TV specials and an online summit about its own investigation. Cuba's experts have concluded that the Americans' allegations are scientifically impossible.\nThe Cubans have urged the U.S. to release information about what it's found. FBI investigators have spent months comparing cases to pinpoint what factors overlap.\nU.S. officials told the AP that investigators have now determined:\n\u2014 The most frequently reported sound patients heard was a high-pitched chirp or grating metal. Fewer recalled a low-pitched noise, like a hum.\n\u2014 Some were asleep and awakened by the sound, even as others sleeping in the same bed or room heard nothing.\n\u2014 Vibrations sometimes accompanied the sound. Victims told investigators these felt similar to the rapid flutter of air when windows of a car are partially rolled down.\n\u2014 Those worst off knew right away something was affecting their bodies. Some developed visual symptoms within 24 hours, including trouble focusing on a computer screen.\nThe U.S. has not identified any specific precautions it believes can mitigate the risk for diplomats in Havana, three officials said, although an attack hasn't been reported since late August. Since the Americans started falling ill last year, the State Department has adopted a new protocol for workers before they go to Cuba that includes bloodwork and other \"baseline\" tests. If they later show symptoms, doctors can retest and compare.\nDoctors still don't know the long-term medical consequences and expect that epidemiologists, who track disease patterns in populations, will monitor the 24 Americans for life.

It seems to be stuttering like almost every 4 seconds on time.\nI did a clean reinstall and it didn't exhibit this problem at the beginning but it began to show stutters again.\nI did find and applied temporary fixes like disabling the GTX 1060, leaving GeForce Experience turned on and using TrayPwrD3 that keeps the GPU idle when not in use.

While I received product and compensation, all opinions are my own. Thank you for supporting the brands that encourage my creativity and support my work. \nConfession: I\u2019m one of those people that saves Holiday shopping for mid-December, right about the time I look up, stare at the calendar, and realize that I\u2019m nearly out of time to tackle my list! \nOne of my favorite things to gift are the little things that can be stuffed in a cute tote bag or make the perfect stocking stuffer. One of the places I often visit to purchase my office supplies is Staples, and this year, I took advantage of their huge selection of gifts in one spot. \nAnd let\u2019s not mention the realization three days before Christmas Eve that we have gifts to ship! I\u2019ve nearly cried a river at the long post office lines and then once at the counter discovering that they couldn\u2019t guarantee before Christmas delivery. Of course, I can\u2019t get mad at the post office since I\u2019m the one that waited that long to get it together. It\u2019s a vicious cycle, I tell you. \nI also tackled my online orders like a boss once I heard that Staples offers free next day shipping on orders of $49.99 or more online all year long! I shipped a variety of holiday gifts without having to lift a finger -although I made sure to leave enough shipping time for my gifts to arrive, and now I\u2019m enjoying the holidays stress-free knowing my gifts will arrive quickly and safely. \nOf course, I also wanted to check out what was new in their Holiday collection right at the store and to my surprise, they are like a one-stop shop for a lot of Holiday must-haves! I took care of the wrapping, packaging, and shipping right at the store in one easy step. \nI nearly shocked myself with the fact that I was able to find fun gifts for my co-workers, my kid\u2019s teachers, and the other people outside our family members on our list, all right at Staples. \nI purchased journals and planners, cute stationary, and sparkly pens. And in one fell swoop, with the help of a few cute gift bags and tissue paper, before I left the parking lot my trunk looked like the back of Santa\u2019s sleigh. \nFor the kids, I purchased a lot of stocking stuffers and kits, like this fun Karaoke Mic ($19.99) and travel Spirograph kit ($9.99) . Plus, a set of luggage tags to accompany my daughter\u2019s new set of suitcases. \nOne of my favorite things to pick up this year was a Bucket List notebook for my husband. We always talk about all the things we\u2019d love to do and accomplish; and like they say\u2026 you\u2019ve got to write those things down. \nI\u2019m the type of person that needs inspiration (often at the store) to find the things I need for the people on my list. So I practically shopped the aisles and their holiday gift areas one section at a time all while getting the satisfaction of crossing off nearly everyone on my extensive list and half of the gifts in boxes at the shipping area. \nAs a bonus, I picked up a few ornaments for our office to make the place a little more festive. \nAnd just like that, my friend, I felt like I conquered the stress of Holiday shopping once and for all! Now, all the time I saved shopping for gifts, finding the perfect festive wrapping paper and gift bags, and shipping to loved ones across the country with Staples can be spent how I prefer during the holiday season: cooking up delicious recipes, sipping coffee, and hanging out with my family and friends! \nFor all the things I get at Staples for my business and personal supplies, I\u2019m appreciative to have more time to spend with the people that matter most instead of going to 20 different places. So no matter if you like to shop in-store or online, Staples has you covered.
