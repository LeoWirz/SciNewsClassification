He certainly can\u2019t now, as Hornacek said Lee has to pick up a bulk of the missing shots with Hardaway\u2019s 17.8 points per game missing. \n\u201cTim was shooting like 18, 20 shots a game, so I need to warm this arm up man, get ready, if he wants me to shoot that many times,\u201d Lee said. \u201cOn top of my shots that\u2019s like 30 shots, if he wants me to do that.\u201d \nMoving from forward back to shooting guard in Hardaway\u2019s absence, Lee took 17 shots, about seven more than his season average. He fell just shy of his season high for points and was the catalyst in a big run to open the second half that largely determined the game. \nPorzingis scored 12 after halftime as the Knicks rebounded from consecutive losses without their top two scorers that had dropped them under .500. \nPorzingis came back from his sprained right ankle and illness, but the Knicks announced Tuesday that Hardaway had a stress injury in his lower left leg and had begun a treatment and rehabilitation plan. He will be re-evaluated in two weeks. \nMarc Gasol had 17 points and eight rebounds for the Grizzlies, who were playing for the first time since ending their 11-game skid with a victory over Minnesota on Monday. Tyreke Evans added 15 points but was just 4 for 13 from the floor. \nPorzingis was just 3 for 11 for six points in the first half, but the Knicks rallied to tie it at 49 going into the break on Lee\u2019s 3-pointer. \nPorzingis then hit a deep 3 to open the third quarter and the Knicks took off from there. Lee had a pair of baskets and then consecutive 3s late in what became a 19-2 run that made it 68-51. \n\u201cWe knew that second half was going to be different and you could already see that end of the first half we were turning up our defense and it was giving us results right away,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we did in the second half. We came out with a different mentality and we had that run.\u201d \nAnd the Grizzlies thought they made it easy for New York with selfish play. \n\u201cWe stood around too much,\u201d Grizzlies interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. \u201cOffensively we got stagnant and watched one guy try to go 1-on-1.\u201d \nNew York kept a safe lead from there and when Memphis trimmed it to 88-82 with about five minutes remaining, Lee scored in the lane and Porzingis followed with a basket and a 3-pointer to push it back to 95-82. \nTIP-INS \nGrizzlies: Gasol was fined $15,000 by the NBA for using a profanity during a live television interview after the victory Monday. \u2026 Memphis has lost six straight road games. \nKnicks: Enes Kanter finished with 12 points and 12 rebounds. \u2026 Lee\u2019s season high is 26 points. \u2026 The Knicks were 9 for 14 (64.3 percent) from 3-point range. \u2026 Joakim Noah was activated so the Knicks had another big body to use against Gasol, but he did not play. \nGASOL\u2019S TROUBLES \nGasol said his right knee locked up on him during the game. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what happened. It just locked up,\u201d he said. \u201cCouldn\u2019t really extend it. I never had any knee issues. So it was a new feeling for me.\u201d \nMORE MEMPHIS MISERY \nThe Grizzlies fell to 0-7 against Eastern Conference teams. They had won eight of the previous 10 meetings. \nUP NEXT \nGrizzlies: Host Toronto on Friday. \nKnicks: Visit Chicago on Saturday. \nFor more NBA coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball TAGS", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian mahoney", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "porzingis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tim", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gasol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grizzlies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristaps porzingis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff hornacek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j.b. bickerstaff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joakim noah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hornacek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyreke evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hardaway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enes kanter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "courtney lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hardaway jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marc gasol", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "knicks", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "grizzlies", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gasol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "memphis grizzlies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "memphis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "host toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eastern conference", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "memphis", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:11.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3f3c2fcd162d4a4a01294865b4a4179ac1875402", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqgAk4LN_6vb_qcQGhdOak1.NjOUQ74kZSk9jvRCX86r9PBNf3WBHH2ro9BSZIC.NZ5OEuySY0hXdu1KEQsKQL9L4hx5I0B.WpaQRlUE1vB.WiNSaBDdHvZofoq9H57vODQFDcwdtPhYDnN8qST.BgT4bOC.WfuOuQaLhduuWkA.9YP2hu3f84RwP26X6.jHhDC_L54ERxPkYvB92uRa0MgXet5vjBwia7afXJck5oK0XjBdYmiTuN_QoQgaPzA8mO22YYXcxjd.kf.0ewqRfK4aibpv3G0FES", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/politics/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Politics links", "title": "(9830114) Following the Las Vegas and Texas massacres, Congress has passed its first bill targeting gun restrictions.

Eastern Co (EML) \nEastern Co (EML) will be on trader\u2019s radar at the beginning of the upcoming session as the closing price ticked above the Parabolic SAR indicator (PSAR). The PSAR, Developed by Welles Wilder, is designed to determine the point in time when there emerges a better than average probability of a trend switching directions. This is a common tool used by traders and investors to try to gauge potential reversal of a trend. \nThe parabolic SAR is shown on the charts as a series of small \u2018dots\u2019 that are placed either above or below the price. When the price is trending to the upside, the dots are below the price action and when the price is trending to the downside, the dots are above the price action. The basic use of the Parabolic SAR is to buy when the dots move below the price bars (signaling an uptrend) and sell/short-sell when the dots move above the price bars (signaling a downtrend). \nTraders may be keeping a close eye on ATR indicators. The current 14-day ATR for Eastern Co (EML) is currently sitting at 0.89. The ATR measures the volatility of a stock on a day-to-day basis. The average true range is typically based on 14 periods and may be calculated daily, weekly, monthly, or intraday. The ATR is not considered a directional indicator, but it may reflect the strength of a particular move. \nChecking in on some other technical levels, the 14-day RSI is currently at 48.84, the 7-day stands at 47.05, and the 3-day is sitting at 26.83. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a commonly used technical momentum indicator that compares price movement over time. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold. The RSI may be useful for spotting abnormal price activity and volatility. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. The normal reading of a stock will fall in the range of 30 to 70. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued. A reading under 30 may indicate that the stock is oversold, and possibly undervalued. \nAnother technical indicator that may be a powerful resource for determining trend strength is the Average Directional Index or ADX. The ADX was introduced by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970\u2019s and it has stood the test of time. The ADX is typically used in conjunction with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to help spot trend direction as well as trend strength. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Eastern Co (EML) is noted at 16.51. Many technical analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. \nThe Williams Percent Range or Williams %R is another technical indicator worth taking a look at. Eastern Co (EML) currently has a 14 day Williams %R of -43.94. The Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and -100 measuring whether a security is overbought or oversold. The Williams %R is similar to the Stochastic Oscillator except it is plotted upside-down. Levels above -20 may indicate the stock may be considered is overbought. If the indicator travels under -80, this may signal that the stock is oversold. Chart analysts may also use the indicator to project possible price reversals and to define trends. \nEastern Co (EML) currently has   -3.04. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eml", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "technicals telling us about eastern co", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eastern co", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "psar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atr for eastern co", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parabolic sar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "parabolic sar", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:12.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1de384643b7586009126b251b7a42cce01d8ede3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9soV4T7Mg_PVxn4lLvCXOWP93RidcbOMshCwiEJj.KZxfJ7_Vo5J73Cf30VYs7DOPFIlN9VQnGuw--", "site_full": "www.therepublic.com", "site": "therepublic.com", "site_section": "http://www.therepublic.com/feed/cat/6720", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Pro Basketball (NBA) \u2013 The Republic", "title": "Irving, short-handed Celtics earn 97-90 win over Mavericks", "title_full": "Irving, short-handed Celtics earn 97-90 win over Mavericks", "published": "2017-12-07T05:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://d1bdhkmqqz901h.cloudfront.net/1200x630/smart/http://s3.amazonaws.com/new-smedia/3e5ec888b72a4cf5a278cb1ad752e4ca/a6135a481b254acfaf4f5541c183fd5b.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 79823, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1de384643b7586009126b251b7a42cce01d8ede3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9soV4T7Mg_PVxn4lLvCXOWP93RidcbOMshCwiEJj.KZxfJ7_Vo5J73Cf30VYs7DOPFIlN9VQnGuw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The Associated Press", "published": "2017-12-07T05:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "Irving, short-handed Celtics earn 97-90 win over Mavericks", "text": "Irving, short-handed Celtics earn 97-90 win over Mavericks By KYLE HIGHTOWER - 12/6/17 11:00 PM \nBOSTON \u2014 The Boston Celtics are no strangers to adjusting on the fly this season. \nThey recovered from Gordon Hayward\u2019s injury on opening night and the early absence of Marcus Morris to reel of 16 straight victories following an 0-2 start. \nThat ability to bounce back was on display again to help them remain perfect against the Western Conference. \nKyrie Irving had 23 points and five assists, and Jayson Tatum added 17 points and 10 rebounds and the short-handed Celtics slipped past the Dallas Mavericks 97-90 on Wednesday night \nBoston\u2019s Al Horford finished with 17 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. \n\u201cIn the NBA you can have afternoons like today, where all of a sudden, you\u2019re down to 11 guys, and the next man up has got to be ready,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. \nBoston has won four straight and six of their last seven. The Celtics are 8-0 against the West. \nThe Celtics played without Jaylen Brown and Morris. Brown sat with an inflamed right eye, while Morris was out due to left knee soreness. \nIt forced Stevens to rely heavily on his reserves. They came through in the fourth, leading a 10-0 run to put Boston back in front 80-73. \nDallas fought back to tie it up at 85. But the Celtics ran off eight straight points to push their lead to 93-85 with 2 minutes to play. \n\u201cJust covering for one another. We\u2019re a team. We\u2019re pros for a reason,\u201d said Terry Rozier, who led all Celtics reserves with 12 points. \u201cYou put all that hard work in and you have to be ready.\u201d \nHarrison Barnes led the Mavericks with 19 points and seven rebounds. Dirk Nowitzki added 16 points and six rebounds. \nBoston\u2019s bench outscored their Dallas counterparts 36-23 for the game. \n\u201cThey have a good team, they keep coming,\u201d Nowitzki said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really good tonight. I didn\u2019t close the game the way I wanted to.\u201d \nDallas had just three turnovers in the opening 24 minutes and led 57-47 at the half. \nThe Celtics fought through periods of sloppiness offensively, committing seven turnovers in the first two quarters. They were also outscored 20-12 in the paint. \nThough it\u2019s early, Horford said it feels good to be 22-4 after all they\u2019ve been through. \n\u201cI\u2019m very happy,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing into the season you never have any expectations. This is good. We want to keep building on it.\u201d \nStevens is also cautiously optimistic. \n\u201cI feel good about where we\u2019re headed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go.\u201d \nTIP-INS \nMavericks: Were outrebounded 53-45. \u2026 Were outscored 34-32 in the paint. \nCeltics: Stevens said both Brown and Morris are expected to be with team when it departs for three-game trip on Thursday. \nQUOTABLE \n\u201cOur first half was really good. Their second half was better, and that\u2019s the game.\u201d \u2014 Dallas coach Rick Carlisle. \nWILD THIRD \nThe Mavericks took a 59-47 lead earlier in the third quarter. But the Celtics erased the deficit with a 15-2 run. It was part of a fast-moving quarter that saw the lead change hands eight times. \nBarnes had 12 points in period for Dallas. Horford paced Boston with 10 points. \nNOEL SURGERY \nCarlisle announced before the game that forward Nerlens Noel will have surgery later this week in Cleveland for a torn ligament in his left thumb. \n\u201cHe\u2019ll be out for several weeks,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cI don\u2019t know for how long.\u201d \nNoel has appeared in 18 games this season, but hasn\u2019t played since Nov. 22. \nDIRK\u2019S LONGEVITY \nNowitzki hasn\u2019t said whether this will be his final NBA season at age 39.

He gave this explanation while addressing state house correspondents at the end of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), which was presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. He said that the Minister of Petroleum (State), Dr Ibe Kachikwu, would have been at the briefing but had to go for an urgent meeting in order to resolve the petroleum scarcity in the country. \u201c\u201dGovernment has no intention at all to increase the pump price of PMS; the minister has assured the council that there is enough products for the next one month even to end of January,\u2019\u2019 the minister stated. According to him, there is usually more demand for petrol product during the yuletide which explains the scarcity of the product during the period. Mohammed said that the council had given a marching order to the Petroleum Minister (State) that the fuel crisis in the country should not last beyond the weekend. He said that the minister had given assurance to ensure that the problem was contained. On digitization, the minister said that the migration from analogue was on course. He said that the digital switch over (DSO) platform in Ilorin would soon be inaugurated while those in Kaduna, Osogbo and Enugu were also ready for inauguration. \u201c\u201dWe hope that in the next couple of weeks we are going to inaugurate these DSOs. \u201c\u201cThe idea is that in the next few weeks we will inaugurate one DSO in one state in each of the regions of the country,\u2019\u2019 he said. Mohammed observed that there were challenges the country was working on especially the issue of set up boxes as the government was not in a position to subsidise 40 million set up boxes. \u201c\u201dWe are looking at bringing down the cost of the boxes at the same time not lowering the quality of those boxes. \u201c\u201cI think the set up manufacturers are working very hard to bring the cost from 40 dollars to 20 dollars and we are also working with the governors and local government chairmen to see how we can collaborate. \u201c\u201dThey can buy more boxes while we use our technology to ensure efficient payment of television licenses,\u2019\u2019 the minister said.

The PSAR, Developed by Welles Wilder, is designed to determine the point in time when there emerges a better than average probability of a trend switching directions. This is a common tool used by traders and investors to try to gauge potential reversal of a trend. \nThe parabolic SAR is shown on the charts as a series of small \u2018dots\u2019 that are placed either above or below the price. When the price is trending to the upside, the dots are below the price action and when the price is trending to the downside, the dots are above the price action. The basic use of the Parabolic SAR is to buy when the dots move below the price bars (signaling an uptrend) and sell/short-sell when the dots move above the price bars (signaling a downtrend). \nInvestors may be trying to get an edge by following current technical levels for Ishares Vii Plc (CU31.L). In terms of Moving Averages, the 50-day is 8012.93, the 200-day is at 8229.70, and the 7-day is 7879.30. Using a longer term moving average such as the 200-day may help block out the noise and chaos that is sometimes created by daily price fluctuations. In some cases, MA\u2019s may be used as strong reference points for finding support and resistance levels. Employing the use of the moving average for technical equity analysis is still highly popular among traders and investors. The moving average can be used as a reference point to assist with the discovery of buying and selling opportunities. \nIshares Vii Plc (CU31.L)\u2019s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R currently sits at -58.02. The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. A reading between 0 and -20 would point to an overbought situation. A reading from -80 to -100 would signal an oversold situation. The Williams %R was developed by Larry Williams. This is a momentum indicator that is the inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator. \nIshares Vii Plc (CU31.L) currently has   -24.78. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal. \nCurrently, the 14-day ADX for Ishares Vii Plc (CU31.L) is sitting at 19.66. Generally speaking, an ADX value from 0-25 would indicate an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would support a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would identify a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would lead to an extremely strong trend. ADX is used to gauge trend strength but not trend direction. Traders often add the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to identify the direction of a trend. \nThe RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a widely used technical momentum indicator that compares price movement over time. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold. The RSI may be useful for spotting abnormal price activity and volatility. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. The normal reading of a stock will fall in the range of 30 to 70. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued. A reading under 30 may indicate that the stock is oversold, and possibly undervalued. After a recent check, the 14-day RSI is currently at 43.90, the 7-day stands at 48.15, and the 3-day is sitting at 69.94. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ishares vii plc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larry williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ishares vii plc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "psar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williams percent range", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parabolic sar", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "parabolic sar", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:13.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "18a02c312672cc22b15bdc159809d2eea89920ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.6WespeyswwXed1fBb0ZBpoo_YpCHeGRK2JA3Sx6.zcmcGWNJynMNPBWlPD3sXZb3NJvrRDveT5X1DP431aCCpFYj9djhnoAU-", "site_full": "www.anchorsaweighblog.com", "site": "anchorsaweighblog.com", "site_section": "http://www.anchorsaweighblog.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Anchors Aweigh", "title": "7 Years of Christmas Cards", "title_full": "7 Years of Christmas Cards", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "18a02c312672cc22b15bdc159809d2eea89920ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.6WespeyswwXed1fBb0ZBpoo_YpCHeGRK2JA3Sx6.zcmcGWNJynMNPBWlPD3sXZb3NJvrRDveT5X1DP431aCCpFYj9djhnoAU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Chelsea Phelps (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "7 Years of Christmas Cards", "text": "Christmas cards were a big deal in my family when I was growing up. My sisters and I coordinated in our best, cheesiest outfits, Mom printed the picture onto a card, and we sent it out to our closest friends and family. I loved sending it and I loved checking the mail each day to see if we received any new cards.  \nWhen Parker and I got married, I started sending our own Christmas card. I have sent one for every year we have been married! I joke that I can't remember the last time I mopped my floors, but I always have our Christmas card in the mail the week of Thanksgiving so it will arrive before December 1st. Priorities.  \nWe always try to take our Christmas picture in a place that is special to us and represents the past year. I thought I would take today to share our cards through the years! \n2011 was the year we got married and our first Christmas together! We took this picture in my Nana's front yard in Midlothian, TX. This was just a few weeks before we started our new lives in Florida, so I love that we were home and in Texas for this card. Jenny was just a year old! \n\n2012 was the year we moved to Pensacola, FL for Parker to begin flight school! We moved that January and absolutely fell in love with the place. We had so many great friends and spent most weekends on the beautiful beach. It was only fitting that we take our picture on the beach! \n\n2013 was the year we moved to Kingsville, TX and were finally back in the motherland! We took this picture on the naval base since that year was spent with Parker logging more study/flight/Navy time than I knew was possible.  \n\n2014 was spent in Norfolk, VA. We took this picture in the middle of such a big, trying time in our lives. I was pregnant with Taylor Grace in this picture. By the time this card arrived in mailboxes, I was no longer pregnant with her. We also had Darla that year, the dog we took in for a year while her owner was on deployment. We took our picture in front of our house with a tripod. That house holds so many memories that I never want to forget, so I love that we chose to take it there.  \n\n2015 was spent in Virginia Beach, VA, and we took this picture on the nature trail behind our house. This was our first house to buy, so that makes this picture extra special to us! Bonus: this is the first picture Jenny decided to crack a smile for! ;) \n\n2016 was the year of the deployment and the year of the pregnancy! Go big or go home, right? Since Parker was deployed from June-December, we had a little fun with this card and made sure it was an adequate representation of 2016. I mailed Parker the sign he is holding. I am in Texas with my family, and Parker is in Bahrain! \n\n2017 was our first Christmas card with baby Preston! It was so surreal for me to get to include our son in this card. It sounds silly, but it was a dream come true! We took this one again in the nature trail behind our house, knowing this is the last year we will get to do so before we move. We also learned this year that getting both a dog and a baby to look at the camera is impossible. (Oopsies- i just realized I cut off the \"P\" in Parker's name. It was included in the actual card. ;)) \n\nAll cards are really special to me, and of course I love our card this year because it has sweet baby Preston in it, but if I had to pick a favorite card, it would be our card from 2014. That card was taken on a tripod in our front yard, so it's not winning any photography awards, but it is so special to me. It is the only card that has Taylor Grace and Darla in it. We will Godwilling have so many cards in the future, but that is the only card that will ever say Taylor's name, so it will always be really special to me.  \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taylor grace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "preston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taylor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jenny", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kingsville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pensacola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tx", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "midlothian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "va", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bahrain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norfolk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:13.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ddee66ec8de53bf6de53fb8a7ba7e1e758e57eb1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94orQZ9QJAYI0m5hWg7ndh3JrAAZ4MgDA_4nhRk2HepqOenAFm3z4RL2r2RBdUE._afI2XSejd5ujuOwA85o9VhMKG9ORsMjnjZcdjMr2rgn.uNWef6zgC36NY11RvDwFsMpHNy4xGIpUkMRFUAkc5m5OapzdVbEw55f.lgJqPlBo4qe2_Y5oPzYC9lNoAziW97g--", "site_full": "www.amazon.ca", "site": "amazon.ca", "site_section": "https://www.amazon.ca/product-reviews/B01LZV6TYQ/ref=acr_dpproductdetail_text?sortBy=recent", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Amazon.ca:Customer reviews: Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Bluetooth Speaker with 30-Hour Playtime - Richer Bass Greater Sound Quality &amp; 10W+ Loud Volume, Water Resistant Splashproof, Portable Wireless Speaker", "title": "Amazon.ca:Customer reviews: Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Bluetooth Speaker with 30-Hour Playtime - Richer Bass Greater Sound Quality & 10W+ Loud Volume, Water Resistant Splashproof, Portable Wireless Speaker", "title_full": "Amazon.ca:Customer reviews: Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Bluetooth Speaker with 30-Hour Playtime - Richer Bass Greater Sound Quality & 10W+ Loud Volume, Water Resistant Splashproof, Portable Wireless Speaker", "published": "2017-11-30T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.402, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ddee66ec8de53bf6de53fb8a7ba7e1e758e57eb1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94orQZ9QJAYI0m5hWg7ndh3JrAAZ4MgDA_4nhRk2HepqOenAFm3z4RL2r2RBdUE._afI2XSejd5ujuOwA85o9VhMKG9ORsMjnjZcdjMr2rgn.uNWef6zgC36NY11RvDwFsMpHNy4xGIpUkMRFUAkc5m5OapzdVbEw55f.lgJqPlBo4qe2_Y5oPzYC9lNoAziW97g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Amazon Customer", "published": "2017-11-30T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Amazon.ca:Customer reviews: Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Bluetooth Speaker with 30-Hour Playtime - Richer Bass Greater Sound Quality & 10W+ Loud Volume, Water Resistant Splashproof, Portable Wireless Speaker", "text": "I'm really happy with this speaker.

Christmas miracle. \nWith an excited tremor, Nicholas punched the lobby button on the elevator keyboard. Twenty-four floors, then through the glass doors, and into a cab to arrive at the Snow Ball. As the doors glided toward each other, making his grand entrance into the ball flitted away when a small, manicured hand thrust through the sliver of an opening and bounced the doors apart. He retreated to the back of the cube as the teenaged girl hopped onto the elevator. Ignore her. She wouldn\u2019t know him or where he was going and couldn\u2019t hinder his mission. Rocking a moment on the balls of her feet clad in shiny, black heels, she smiled\u2014one of those brief, close-mouthed polite smiles as the hallway disappeared and she shifted, turning away from him. A subtle hum indicated they were moving.  Twenty-four, Twenty-three. A distant screech of scraping metal nearly drowned out the whisper of the ebony-haired girl. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d  He gripped the railing on the back wall with one hand while adjusting his white fur trimmed, red hat with his other. The old elevator always groaned. Glints of light from the track around the top edges of the elevator played across the back of her hair, a reflection moving like the wave a crowd does at a football game. Hmm, how long had it been since he\u2019d been to a ball game? Another creak, and she jumped. \u201cWhy have we stopped?\u201d She darted a glance in his direction. \u201cHey, what happened to the lights?\u201d The darkness was blacker than a moonless night at the North Pole. His heart thumped against his ribs. Small spaces didn\u2019t bother him. He lived in a small space with small people. But an elevator malfunction would disrupt his plan. Patience . She shuffled her feet. \u201cIt\u2019s so quiet.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d The young one needed reassuring. \u201cSomeone will fix it.\u201d He leaned his hips against the railing that ran along the walls, the cold metal chilling his bottom through his red dress slacks. The dark was so thick, so silent, if he\u2019d not seen the girl before the lights went out, he\u2019d think he was alone. Except for her annoying, spicy scent. The smell made his nose itch. A distant growl of metal echoed from far below them. A gasp from his unseen companion bounced around the blackness. \u201cDon\u2019t panic. How are we doing?\u201d \u201cFine, if getting stuck in a dark elevator with a stranger is your idea of fun.\u201d Her caustic tone could indicate fear. \u201cThe darkness doesn\u2019t change anything, so there\u2019s no need for alarm.\u201d He knew how to handle unforeseen situations. \u201cNo reason to get excited.\u201d \u201cThis is hardly exciting, and I\u2019m not afraid of the dark.\u201d \n\u201cOf course you aren\u2019t, child.\u201d \u201cChild? Listen, mister\u2026\u201d \u201cJust stay calm!\u201d So much needing his reassurance. Teenagers could be so difficult. \u201cAll right, all right.\u201d The blackness didn\u2019t mute her huff. He imagined her arms crossed, and her eyes glaring. Typical teen. He ran a finger between his neck and the collar of his shirt. The dark grew stuffy. He should\u2019ve been on his way, out the building. He needed a Christmas miracle, and what he got instead was an obstacle. \u201cBut what do you think is going on?\u201d Her voice, now quietly needy, slithered between his thoughts. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a power problem.\u201d \u201cOh, really?\u201d Her sarcasm wasn\u2019t quiet. He could ignore it. \n  \u201cWe should call for help,\u201d she suggested. \u201cI left my cell in my purse in the office. Do you have yours?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Cell phones, email, and electronic voices. He shuddered. Why would he want to be reached wherever he went? All messages are delivered to the workshop . That was their job. He only checked them \u2013 twice. \u201cHey, wait!\u201d Her sudden outburst made him straighten up from his resting-place on the railing. \u201cThe telephone! All elevators have telephones. It must be on this side by the buttons.\u201d Her scuffling noises shattered the dark. \u201cStop. You might touch something you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d He took a few steps in the direction of the sounds of her movements and was startled when he bumped into her. \u201cExcuse me, but please don\u2019t touch anything.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m looking for the phone.\u201d \u201cTell me what you find before you actually do anything.\u201d Only inches from her, the pitch-black took on her irritating scent. His nose twitched, and he took a breath through his mouth. The darkness grew warmer. He loosened his tie. \u201cI feel a metal door. This has to be it. Too bad I don\u2019t read Braille.\u201d \u201cHere, let me see.\u201d He reached out, amazed when his hand found the small oblong metal door as she opened it. \u201cI can do it!\u201d An elbow knocked his hand away. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly capable of speaking on a telephone.\u201d \u201cOf course, you\u2019re capable.\u201d How could he deal with such childishness? Yet, his lot in life was exactly that. But the younger ones were so much easier to contain, to appease, to please before they grew into double-digit ages. \u201cHello, hello. There\u2019s no sound. No dial tone or anything. Hello!\u201d This time she screamed. He wiped the dampness from his forehead. Excitement, overzealous joy he could handle, not panic. \u201cNow, will you let me have it?\u201d A hard thump hit his chest as she relinquished the phone. In his ear, there was silence, dead silence. With his other hand, he ran fingers around the perimeter of the box and along the back. Cold metal. His nails snagged on six screws. Nothing else. He\u2019d never used an elevator phone. Never given any thought as to how they operated. Maybe it was there for looks only, giving a false sense of security to the occupants, like the pretend cameras or plastic phones he delivered. Or maybe an alarm to catch you for touching something you shouldn\u2019t. His hand jerked back. He fumbled, setting the receiver back on its cradle. \u201cIt might set off an alarm when you pick it up. Just wait.\u201d Nothing. How long should he wait? There was a crackle overhead. The Carpenters harmonized, Away in a Manger . At least something was fixed. \n\u201cThis is progress, right?\u201d Her voice sounded hopeful. Setting his finger aside of his nose, he raised his gaze upward, but only black met him. He wondered if a panel in the ceiling could be slid away. \u201cRight?\u201d \u201cHmm\u2026yes, progress.\u201d He\u2019d nearly forgotten about her with his musings. Overhead the lights flickered, went out, then shined and held. Although dim, his relief flashed bright. Her dark brown eyes widened as she scanned their surroundings as if searching for what? More people? She bit her dark red lower lip, which clashed with her neon orange dress. He didn\u2019t like orange, a poor imitation of red. \u201cWell!\u201d She tilted her chin in his direction. \u201cMusic. Lights. Now where\u2019s the camera? Since when doesn\u2019t an elevator have a security camera?\u201d He surveyed every corner. She was right. After two years, or was it four years, going in and out of this building, he had never noticed there weren\u2019t cameras in the elevators. They must be hidden. No good watching people if they knew you were watching. She walked around the compartment, corner to corner. \u201cIt may be my imagination, but I think this contraption is broken.\u201d Sarcasm again. \u201cWell, it certainly isn\u2019t moving.\u201d He tried to match her wit. \u201cDo you think it could fall?\u201d \u201cIt isn\u2019t even moving.\u201d \u201cBut, do you think, if I were to move around too much, it would fall?\u201d His abilities might be taxed in dealing with her. His skills had been limited to reaffirming belief\u2014fireside chats with children\u2014not survival techniques with teenagers. Where was his Christmas miracle? \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d \u201cHow do you know?\u201d He gave her his most authoritative expression. He hoped. Jolly wouldn\u2019t work in this instance. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get upset in such situations.\u201d The girl cocked her head to one side. \u201cDo I look like I\u2019m upset?\u201d He stroked his close-cropped beard, still unhappy about having to cut it. He stared at a sassy smile on a pale face dusted with freckles. He opened his mouth to answer when the elevator gave a jolt. Knocked off balance, he stumbled and caught himself on the metal railing. The girl gasped, but kept her balance, throwing her hands to her chest. He saw the time on her watch. Damn. They\u2019d miss him at the Snow Ball, and they\u2019d come looking. The elevator creaked, the lights flickered and the dark enveloped them again. \u201cThey must be trying to fix it.\u201d She sounded hopeful. He stood perfectly still, listening for noise beyond their breathing, but the only sound was Barry Manilow crooning overhead. \u201cKill. The. Elevator. Music. \u201d Each word rose in pitch until she was screeching. \u201cWhy play music if the stupid thing isn\u2019t moving?\u201d He understood her irritation. Jingle Bells should not be crooned. Again, the lights blinked and this time stayed on, dimmer than before. His eyes adjusted to the semi-darkness. Agitation wrinkled her forehead. Despite their situation, joy should fill their lives, not needless negative moodiness. His plans could fall through, but he should be jolly. He swallowed, ill-equipped to deal with her age group, but he\u2019d give it a shot. \u201cDoes the music upset you?\u201d \u201cIt makes me manic!\u201d She threw her hands in the air. \nPlease come back tomorrow for chapter two!

Preston North End manager Alex Neil (Image: Alex Livesey/Getty Images) \nAnd it was Hugill who continued North End's resurgence of late, striking in the 88th minute to earn his side a 1-0 win over QPR at the weekend to stretch their unbeaten run to four games in the Championship. Read More Burton Albion could be without several attacking options for Preston North End clash \n\"They are a good team,\" said Clough. \n\"Simon Grayson left a very good team and a very good squad, and Alex Neil has come in and just taken it on. \n\"They had a great start to the season, a little bit of a dip but then have come back just recently. \n\"So once again, it's not an ideal time to be playing them in some ways. \n\"They are a good, solid, all-round team with some experienced Championship players. \n\"They are very competitive all over the pitch as well. Nigel Clough and Alex Neil (Image: Epic Action Imagery) \n\"It's the foundation that Simon Grayson put in over a number of years, why they have this very good Championship squad. \n\"Whether it is good enough to get in the top six, only in comparison to the other teams, I'm not quite sure. Read More Nigel Clough hopes Burton Albion have a January transfer window as successful as last season's \n\"But they certainly won't be in trouble.\" \nClough is wary of the threat Neil's sides pose having come up against his Norwich City outfit when the Scotsman was in charge at Carrow Road last term. Alex Neil during his time at Norwich City (Image: Nathan Stirk/Getty Images) \nThe Brewers were beaten 3-1 in East Anglia, before Clough got his revenge in February with a crucial 2-1 win at the Pirelli Stadium. \nThat began the slippery slope that eventually led to Neil's departure from Carrow Road in March, only 10 months after leading them to the Premier League. \nAnd Clough reckons Neil can have another go at promotion to the top flight with Preston, with the squad at Deepdale more suited to his style of management. \n\"I think it is Alex's sort of squad,\" Clough added. Callum Robinson of Preston North End (Image: Dan Mullan/Getty Images) \n\"We played against him when he was at Norwich, and I think they had a different sort of player at Norwich to what he has at Preston. \n\"But I think it's more the sort of real, honest players, rather than the flair sort of players. \n\"It's a very good appointment first of all.
