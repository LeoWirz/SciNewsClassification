He did not do what they are saying he did.\u201d\n\u2013 President Trump, re Vladimir Putin after their meeting in Vietnam.\nPutin later added that he knew \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d about Russian contacts with Trump campaign officials. \u201cThey can do what they want, looking for some sensation. But there are no sensations.\u201d\nNumerous US intelligence agencies have said otherwise. Former Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, responded to Trump\u2019s remarks by declaring: \u201cThe president was given clear and indisputable evidence that Russia interfered in the election.\u201d\nAs we\u2019ll see below, there isn\u2019t too much of the \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d stuff. And this of course is the same James Clapper who made an admittedly false statement to Congress in March 2013, when he responded, \u201cNo, sir\u201d and \u201cnot wittingly\u201d to a question about whether the National Security Agency was collecting \u201cany type of data at all\u201d on millions of Americans. Lies don\u2019t usually come in any size larger than that.\nVirtually every member of Congress who has publicly stated a position on the issue has criticized Russia for interfering in the 2016 American presidential election. And it would be very difficult to find a member of the mainstream media which has questioned this thesis.\nWhat is the poor consumer of news to make of these gross contradictions? Here are some things to keep in mind:\nHow do we know that the tweets and advertisements \u201csent by Russians\u201d -\u2013 those presented as attempts to sway the vote -\u2013 were actually sent by Russians? The Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS), composed of National Security Agency and CIA veterans, recently declared that the CIA knows how to disguise the origin of emails and tweets. The Washington Post has as well reported that Twitter \u201cmakes it easy for users to hide their true identities.\u201d Even if these communications were actually sent from Russia, how do we know that they came from the Russian government, and not from any of the other 144.3 million residents of Russia?\nEven if they were sent by the Russian government, we have to ask: Why would they do that? Do the Russians think the United States is a Third World, under-developed, backward Banana Republic easily influenced and moved by a bunch of simple condemnations of the plight of blacks in America and the Clinton \u201cdynasty\u201d? Or clich\u00e9d statements about other controversial issues, such as gun rights and immigration? If so, many Democratic and Republican officials would love to know the secret of the Russians\u2019 method. Consider also that Facebook has stated that 90 percent of the alleged-Russian-bought content that ran on its network did not even mention Trump or Clinton.\nOn top of all this is the complete absence of even the charge, much less with any supporting evidence, of Russian interference in the actual voting or counting of votes.\nAfter his remark suggesting he believed Putin\u2019s assertion that there had been no Russian meddling in the election, Trump \u2013 of course, as usual \u2013 attempted to backtrack and distant himself from his words after drawing criticism at home; while James Clapper declared: \u201cThe fact the president of the United States would take Putin at his word over that of the intelligence community is quite simply unconscionable.\u201d\nGiven Clapper\u2019s large-size lie referred to above, can Trump be faulted for being skeptical of the intelligence community\u2019s Holy Writ? Purposeful lies of the intelligence community during the first Cold War were legendary, many hailed as brilliant tactics when later revealed. The CIA, for example, had phoney articles and editorials planted in foreign newspapers (real Fake News), made sex films of target subjects caught in flagrante delicto who had been lured to Agency safe houses by female agents, had Communist embassy personnel expelled because of phoney CIA documents, and much more.\nThe Post recently published an article entitled \u201cHow did Russian trolls get into your Facebook feed? Silicon Valley made it easy.\u201d In the midst of this \u201cexpos\u00e9,\u201d The Post stated: \u201cThere\u2019s no way to tell if you personally saw a Russian post or tweet.\u201d So \u2026 Do the Cold Warriors have a case to make or do they not? Or do they just want us to remember that the Russkis are bad? So it goes.\nAn organization in Czechoslovakia with the self-appointed name of European Values has produced a lengthy report entitled \u201c The Kremlin\u2019s Platform for \u2018Useful Idiots\u2019 in the West: An Overview of RT\u2019s Editorial Strategy and Evidence of Impact \u201d. It includes a long list of people who have appeared on the Russian-owned TV station RT (formerly Russia Today ), which can be seen in the US, the UK and other countries. Those who\u2019ve been guests on RT are the \u201cidiots\u201d useful to Moscow. (The list is not complete. I\u2019ve been on RT about five times, but I\u2019m not listed. Where is my Idiot Badge?)\nRT\u2019s YouTube channel has more than two million followers and claims to be the \u201cmost-watched news network\u201d on the video site. Its Facebook page has more than 4 million likes and followers. Can this explain why the powers-that-be forget about a thing called freedom-of-speech and treat the station like an enemy? The US government recently forced RT America to register as a foreign agent and has cut off the station\u2019s Congressional press credentials.\nThe Cold War strategist, George Kennan, wrote prophetically:\n\u201cWere the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American military-industrial establishment would have to go on, substantially unchanged, until some other adversary could be invented. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy.\u201d\nWriter John Wight has described the new Cold War as being \u201cin response to Russia\u2019s recovery from the demise of the Soviet Union and the failed attempt to turn the country into a wholly owned subsidiary of Washington via the imposition of free market economic shock treatment thereafter.\u201d\nSo let\u2019s see what other brilliance the New Cold War brings us. \u2026 Ah yes, another headline in the Post (November 18, 2017): \u201cBritish alarm rising over possible Russian meddling in Brexit\u201d. Of course, why else would the British people have voted to leave the European Union? But wait a moment, again, one of the British researchers behind the report \u201csaid that the accounts they analyzed \u2013 which claimed Russian as their language when they were set up but tweeted in English \u2013 posted a mixture of pro-\u2018leave\u2019 and pro-\u2018remain\u2019 messages regarding Brexit. Commentators have said that the goal may simply have been to sow discord and division in society.\u201d\nWas there ever a time when the Post would have been embarrassed to be so openly, amateurishly biased about Russia? Perhaps during the few years between the two Cold Wars.\nIn case you don\u2019t remember how stupid Cold War Number One was \u2026\n+ 1948: The Pittsburgh Press published the names, addresses, and places of employment of about 1,000 citizens who had signed presidential-nominating petitions for former Vice President Henry Wallace, running under the Progressive Party. This, and a number of other lists of \u201ccommunists\u201d, published in the mainstream media, resulted in people losing their jobs, being expelled from unions, having their children abused, being denied state welfare benefits, and suffering various other punishments.\n+ Around 1950: The House Committee on Un-American Activities published a pamphlet, \u201c100 Things You Should Know About Communism in the U.S.A.\u201d This included information about what a communist takeover of the United States would mean:\nQ: What would happen to my insurance?\nA: It would go to the Communists.\nQ: Would communism give me something better than I have now?\nA: Not unless you are in a penitentiary serving a life sentence at hard labor.\n+ 1950s: Mrs. Ada White, member of the Indiana State Textbook Commission, believed that Robin Hood was a Communist and urged that books that told the Robin Hood story be banned from Indiana schools.\n+ As evidence that anti-communist mania was not limited to the lunatic fringe or conservative newspaper publishers, here is Clark Kerr, president of the University of California at Berkeley in a 1959 speech: \u201cPerhaps 2 or even 20 million people have been killed in China by the new [communist] regime.\u201d One person wrote to Kerr: \u201cI am wondering how you would judge a person who estimates the age of a passerby on the street as being \u2018perhaps 2 or even 20 years old.\u2019 Or what would you think of a physician who tells you to take \u2018perhaps 2 or even twenty teaspoonsful of a remedy\u2019?\u201d\n+ Throughout the cold war, traffic in phoney Lenin Quote: s was brisk, each one passed around from one publication or speaker to another for years. Here\u2019s U. S. News and World Report in 1958 demonstrating communist duplicity by quoting Lenin: \u201cPromises are like pie crusts, made to be broken.\u201d Secretary of State John Foster Dulles used it in a speech shortly afterward, one of many to do so during the cold war. Lenin actually did use a very similar line, but he explicitly stated that he was quoting an English proverb (it comes from Jonathan Swift) and his purpose was to show the unreliability of the bourgeoisie, not of communists.\n\u201cFirst we will take Eastern Europe, then the masses of Asia, then we will encircle the United States, which will be the last bastion of capitalism. We will not have to attack. It will fall like an overripe fruit into our hands.\u201d This Lenin \u201cquotation\u201d had the usual wide circulation, even winding up in the Congressional Record in 1962. This was not simply a careless attribution; this was an out-and-out fabrication; an extensive search, including by the Library of Congress and the United States Information Agency failed to find its origin.\n+ A favorite theme of the anti-communists was that a principal force behind drug trafficking was a communist plot to demoralize the United States. Here\u2019s a small sample:\nDon Keller, District Attorney for San Diego County, California in 1953: \u201cWe know that more heroin is being produced south of the border than ever before and we are beginning to hear stories of financial backing by big shot Communists operating out of Mexico City.\u201d\nHenry Giordano, Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 1964, interviewed in the American Legion Magazine : Interviewer: \u201cI\u2019ve been told that the communists are trying to flood our country with narcotics to weaken our moral and physical stamina. Is that true?\u201d\nGiordano: \u201cAs far as the drugs are concerned, it\u2019s true. There\u2019s a terrific flow of drugs coming out of Yunnan Province of China. \u2026 There\u2019s no question that in that particular area this is the aim of the Red Chinese. It should be apparent that if you could addict a population you would degrade a nation\u2019s moral fiber.\u201d\nFulton Lewis, Jr., prominent conservative radio broadcaster and newspaper columnist, 1965: \u201cNarcotics of Cuban origin \u2013 marijuana, cocaine, opium, and heroin \u2013 are now peddled in big cities and tiny hamlets throughout this country. Several Cubans arrested by the Los Angeles police have boasted they are communists.\u201d\nWe were also told that along with drugs another tool of the commies to undermine America\u2019s spirit was fluoridation of the water.\n+ Mickey Spillane was one of the most successful writers of the 1950s, selling millions of his anti-communist thriller mysteries. Here is his hero, Mike Hammer, in \u201cOne Lonely Night\u201d, boasting of his delight in the grisly murders he commits, all in the name of destroying a communist plot to steal atomic secrets. After a night of carnage, the triumphant Hammer gloats, \u201cI shot them in cold blood and enjoyed every minute of it. I pumped slugs into the nastiest bunch of bastards you ever saw. \u2026 They were Commies. \u2026 Pretty soon what\u2019s left of Russia and the slime that breeds there won\u2019t be worth mentioning and I\u2019m glad because I had a part in the killing. God, but it was fun!\u201d\n+ 1952: A campaign against the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) because it was tainted with \u201catheism and communism\u201d, and was \u201csubversive\u201d because it preached internationalism. Any attempt to introduce an international point of view in the schools was seen as undermining patriotism and loyalty to the United States. A bill in the US Senate, clearly aimed at UNESCO, called for a ban on the funding of \u201cany international agency that directly or indirectly promoted one-world government or world citizenship.\u201d There was also opposition to UNESCO\u2019s association with the UN Declaration of Human Rights on the grounds that it was trying to replace the American Bill of Rights with a less liberty-giving covenant of human rights.\n+ 1955: A US Army 6-page pamphlet, \u201cHow to Spot a Communist\u201d, informed us that a communist could be spotted by his predisposition to discuss civil rights, racial and religious discrimination, the immigration laws, anti-subversive legislation, curbs on unions, and peace. Good Americans were advised to keep their ears stretched for such give-away terms as \u201cchauvinism\u201d, \u201cbook-burning\u201d, \u201ccolonialism\u201d, \u201cdemagogy\u201d, \u201cwitch hunt\u201d, \u201creactionary\u201d, \u201cprogressive\u201d, and \u201cexploitation\u201d. Another \u201cdistinguishing mark\u201d of \u201cCommunist language\u201d was a \u201cpreference for long sentences.\u201d After some ridicule, the Army rescinded the pamphlet.\n+ 1958: The noted sportscaster Bill Stern (one of the heroes of my innocent youth) observed on the radio that the lack of interest in \u201cbig time\u201d football at New York University, City College of New York, Chicago, and Harvard \u201cis due to the widespread acceptance of Communism at the universities.\u201d\n+ 1960: US General Thomas Power speaking about nuclear war or a first strike by the US: \u201cThe whole idea is to kill the bastards! At the end of the war, if there are two Americans and one Russian, we win!\u201d The response from one of those present was: \u201cWell, you\u2019d better make sure that they\u2019re a man and a woman.\u201d\n+ 1966: The Boys Club of America is of course wholesome and patriotic. Imagine their horror when they were confused with the Dubois Clubs. (W.E.B. Du Bois had been a very prominent civil rights activist.) When the Justice Department required the DuBois Clubs to register as a Communist front group, good loyal Americans knew what to do. They called up the Boys Club to announce that they would no longer contribute any money, or to threaten violence against them; and sure enough an explosion damaged the national headquarters of the youth group in San Francisco. Then former Vice President Richard Nixon, who was national board chairman of the Boys Club, declared: \u201cThis is an almost classic example of Communist deception and duplicity. The \u2018DuBois Clubs\u2019 are not unaware of the confusion they are causing among our supporters and among many other good citizens.\u201d\n+ 1966: \u201cRhythm, Riots and Revolution: An Analysis of the Communist Use of Music, The Communist Master Music Plan\u201d, by David A. Noebel, published by Christian Crusade Publications, (expanded version of 1965 pamphlet: \u201cCommunism, Hypnotism and the Beatles\u201d). Some chapters: Communist Use of Mind Warfare \u2026 Nature of Red Record Companies \u2026 Destructive Nature of Beatle Music \u2026 Communist Subversion of Folk Music \u2026 Folk Music and the Negro Revolution \u2026 Folk Music and the College Revolution\n+ 1968: William Calley, US Army Lieutenant, charged with overseeing the massacre of more than 100 Vietnamese civilians in My Lai in 1968, said some years later: \u201cIn all my years in the Army I was never taught that communists were human beings. We were there to kill ideology carried by \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 pawns, blobs, pieces of flesh. I was there to destroy communism. We never conceived of old people, men, women, children, babies.\u201d\n+ 1977: Scientists theorized that the earth\u2019s protective ozone layer was being damaged by synthetic chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons. The manufacturers and users of CFCs were not happy. They made life difficult for the lead scientist. The president of one aerosol manufacturing firm suggested that criticism of CFCs was \u201corchestrated by the Ministry of Disinformation of the KGB.\u201d\n+ 1978: Life inside a California youth camp of the ultra anti-communist John Birch Society: Five hours each day of lectures on communism, Americanism and \u201cThe Conspiracy\u201d; campers learned that the Soviet government had created a famine and spread a virus to kill a large number of citizens and make the rest of them more manageable; the famine led starving adults to eat their children; communist guerrillas in Southeast Asia jammed chopsticks into children\u2019s ears, piercing their eardrums; American movies are all under the control of the Communists; the theme is always that capitalism is no better than communism; you can\u2019t find a dictionary now that isn\u2019t under communist influence; the communists are also taking over the Bibles.\n+ The Reagan administration declared that the Russians were spraying toxic chemicals over Laos, Cambodia and Afghanistan \u2013 the so-called \u201cyellow rain\u201d \u2013 and had caused more than ten thousand deaths by 1982 alone, (including, in Afghanistan, 3,042 deaths attributed to 47 separate incidents between the summer of 1979 and the summer of 1981, so precise was the information). Secretary of State Alexander Haig was a prime dispenser of such stories, and President Reagan himself denounced the Soviet Union thusly more than 15 times in documents and speeches. The \u201cyellow rain\u201d, it turned out, was pollen-laden feces dropped by huge swarms of honeybees flying far overhead.\n+ 1982: In commenting about sexual harassment in the Army, General John Crosby stated that the Army doesn\u2019t care about soldiers\u2019 social lives \u2013 \u201cThe basic purpose of the United States Army is to kill Russians,\u201d he said.\n+ 1983: The US invasion of Grenada, the home of the Cuban ambassador is damaged and looted by American soldiers; on one wall is written \u201cAA\u201d, symbol of the 82nd Airborne Division; beside it the message: \u201cEat shit, commie faggot.\u201d \u2026 \u201cI want to fuck communism out of this little island,\u201d says a marine, \u201cand fuck it right back to Moscow.\u201d\n+ 1984: During a sound check just before his weekly broadcast, President Reagan spoke these words into the microphone: \u201cMy fellow Americans, I am pleased to tell you I have signed legislation to outlaw Russia, forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.\u201d His words were picked up by at least two radio networks.\n+ 1985: October 29 BBC interview with Ronald Reagan: asked about the differences he saw between the US and Russia, the president replied: \u201cI\u2019m no linguist, but I\u2019ve been told that in the Russian language there isn\u2019t even a word for freedom.\u201d (The word is \u201csvoboda\u201d.)\n+ 1986: Soviet artists and cultural officials criticized Rambo-like American films as an expression of \u201canti-Russian phobia even more pathological than in the days of McCarthyism\u201d. Russian film-maker Stanislav Rostofsky claimed that on one visit to an American school \u201ca young girl trembled with fury when she heard I was from the Soviet Union, and said she hated Russians.\u201d\n+ 1986: Roy Cohn, who achieved considerable fame and notoriety in the 1950s as an assistant to the communist-witch-hunting Senator Joseph McCarthy, died, reportedly of AIDS. Cohn, though homosexual, had denied that he was and had denounced such rumors as communist smears.\n+1986: After American journalist Nicholas Daniloff was arrested in Moscow for \u201cspying\u201d and held in custody for two weeks, New York Mayor Edward Koch sent a group of 10 visiting Soviet students storming out of City Hall in fury. \u201cThe Soviet government is the pits,\u201d said Koch, visibly shocking the students, ranging in age from 10 to 18 years. One 14-year-old student was so outraged he declared: \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay in this house. I want to go to the bus and go far away from this place. The mayor is very rude. We never had a worse welcome anywhere.\u201d As matters turned out, it appeared that Daniloff had not been completely pure when it came to his news gathering.\n+ 1989: After the infamous Chinese crackdown on dissenters in Tiananmen Square in June, the US news media was replete with reports that the governments of Nicaragua, Vietnam and Cuba had expressed their support of the Chinese leadership. Said the Wall Street Journal : \u201cNicaragua, with Cuba and Vietnam, constituted the only countries in the world to approve the Chinese Communists\u2019 slaughter of the students in Tiananmen Square.\u201d But it was all someone\u2019s fabrication; no such support had been expressed by any of the three governments. At that time, as now, there were few, if any, organizations other than the CIA which could manipulate major Western media in such a manner.\nNOTE: It should be remembered that the worst consequences of anti-communism were not those discussed above. The worst consequences, the ultra-criminal consequences, were the abominable death, destruction, and violation of human rights that we know under various names: Vietnam, Chile, Korea, Guatemala, Cambodia, Indonesia, Brazil, Greece, Afghanistan, El Salvador, and many others.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

growing as we continue to live. \n\u2014 Mortimer Adler \nIn some areas of our lives we are right on target. Our level of maturity is exactly as it should be, and we are going through the stages that people of our age ought to be going through. In other areas, this is not so. We are complex people, irregular, uneven. In all of us there are areas fixated in some emotional ice age, areas that have not felt the freeing warmth of the sun. \nWe cannot expect ourselves to move forward all at once. Not only is it okay to move slowly \u2013 it\u2019s often the only way it can be. Confusion, conflict, or pain may have caused us to let our memories or feelings be frozen safely away. This has been a long process, and we can allow ourselves more time to heal. The task now is not to deny or hide from these changes, but to have confidence that the healing warmth of the program will reflect on all areas of our lives and help make us whole. \nI am thankful I am given both time and patience in which to continue my growth. \nYou are reading from the book: \n\nDays of Healing, Days of Joy by Earnie Larsen and Carol Larsen Hegarty \nDays of Healing, Days of Joy by Earnie Larsen and Carol Larsen Hegarty. \u00a9 1987, 1992 by Hazelden Foundation ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "carol larsen hegarty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "earnie larsen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2014 mortimer adler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hazelden betty ford foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hazelden foundation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:50:51.089+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4faa5c1de6a316e68180725cbcbc08abccbcc5e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.XHA16XB.0e_m7xrUCfbcTY.z_ZvxXHEOAPZ.0QofB1sk3W2JuAu5h2EpOuGVM.9pCgx8PEaPrTKA--", "site_full": "kamadharmaarta.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://kamadharmaarta.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "kama blog", "title": "Inverno", "title_full": "Inverno", "published": "2017-12-07T11:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IT", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4faa5c1de6a316e68180725cbcbc08abccbcc5e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.XHA16XB.0e_m7xrUCfbcTY.z_ZvxXHEOAPZ.0QofB1sk3W2JuAu5h2EpOuGVM.9pCgx8PEaPrTKA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "roshelinda (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "Inverno", "text": "\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "inverno", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:50:52.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a7a64d360e1bdafe9ccb6a8e7c7201fd07ad218c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAptyvKFc4xma2HWFzpgGyauCkTIdlWvFc0XXZjHn3K26yPZGjBv8yaAQ1IckTJVjvUc72Sbo5mXVjltbg6pbiwOzxvTCywttXw5DdjIk_cztkCTJJ3imTch2", "site_full": "mobilemarketingwatch.com", "site": "mobilemarketingwatch.com", "site_section": "http://mobilemarketingwatch.com", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "Mobile Marketing Watch", "title": "Ionic Brings App Development Suite to Teams and Enterprises", "title_full": "Ionic Brings App Development Suite to Teams and Enterprises", "published": "2017-12-07T11:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a7a64d360e1bdafe9ccb6a8e7c7201fd07ad218c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAptyvKFc4xma2HWFzpgGyauCkTIdlWvFc0XXZjHn3K26yPZGjBv8yaAQ1IckTJVjvUc72Sbo5mXVjltbg6pbiwOzxvTCywttXw5DdjIk_cztkCTJJ3imTch2", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michael Essany", "published": "2017-12-07T11:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "Ionic Brings App Development Suite to Teams and Enterprises", "text": "Ionic, maker of the popular open source Framework for building cross-platform mobile and progressive web apps, has launched a suite of development tools for enterprise developers and teams.\nIonic Pro is a cloud-based solution that makes it faster and easier to design, build, test and deliver apps.\nLaunched in 2013, the Ionic Framework has acquired a community of more than five million developers around the world.

We finished roughly 3000 a year with the cattle only on for the farm 3-4 months before sent to kill. A simple way we used to use was feed a 90% soya Hull 10% barley for the first day gradually increasing the mix to 100% barley over a 14 day period. The cattle responded well as the soya hull is basically a shell which acts as a fibre source balancing the diet. Once we had the cattle on adlib they received nothing else but the rolled barley mix.

New Delhi: Google India announced a slew of India-first products and features built especially for the ever-growing base of Indian internet users at the third edition of its annual \u201cGoogle for India\u201d event. \nCustomized for Indian conditions and needs, these include two-wheeler navigation in Google Maps, bill pay in payments app Tez, Android Oreo (Go edition) to improve the experience on low-RAM phones, new apps like Google Go and Files Go that are built from scratch, and Google Assistant for the Reliance Jio Phone that brings the benefits of the Assistant to first-time internet users. \nALSO READ: Android Oreo Go Edition is meant for entry-level smartphones \n\u201cThe India-first suite of products and features are aimed to help more people discover how the internet can make life easier and more convenient\u2014whether it\u2019s helping pay bills on time, navigating through the quickest routes or searching for answers to questions wherever we are. These products and features are India-first, but they are not India-only. When we build better products for India, we ultimately build better products for everyone,\u201d said Caesar Sengupta, vice-president, Next Billion Users, Google\u2019s initiative to connect all Indians to the internet. \nGoogle\u2019s payments and commerce app Tez, which the company launched in September, will offer a customized experience to pay bills from within the app. Not only will users be able to pay their utility bills, the app will also remind users when a bill is due, track payments and store payment history so that users will never pay the same bill twice. \nSengupta said Tez will support more than 70 billers (both national and state providers), including utilities and direct-to-home service providers like BSES, Tata Power, Dish TV etc. Once users pay a bill on Tez, they will never have to add the billing organization again. The bill pay feature will start rolling out gradually over the next month. Tez has 12 million daily active users and has processed 140 million transactions in about 10 weeks, with 70% of all UPI transactions being driven by the app. \n\u201cGoogle has gone all out for India and is finding solutions for India and by doing this it will find solutions for the rest of the seven billion people around the world,\u201d Amitabh Kant, chief executive of Niti Aayog said at the event. \nAnother India first product launched at the event was the two-wheeler mode in Google Maps. The company said India is the world\u2019s largest two-wheeler market and the navigation needs of these millions of riders are different from automobile drivers. Two-wheeler mode in Maps gives routes that use shortcuts not accessible to cars. It also provides customized traffic and arrival time estimations. The two-wheeler mode uses machine learning to suggest more relevant routes for riders, using smaller roads and two-wheeler-friendly shortcuts. It will also show major landmarks on the route so that riders can better plan their trip before starting, and not keep checking their phone on-the-go. Two-wheeler mode will be available in India starting Tuesday, and in more countries in the coming months. \nAdditionally, the company rolled out its Google Assistant in both English and Hindi for the Reliance JioPhone. This is the first time globally that the virtual assistant will be available on a feature phone. \nThe company is also enhancing the Search experience for users and over the next few months, Google will also offer information on air quality for 20 Indian cities through its search platform. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve been hard at work at this and the body of work that has happened is astounding even for us. For an American company putting this kind of focus on India and being determined to prove that we are as Indian as any other Indian company is a pretty big step and I felt that this was a desire at some point of time and now our actions speak louder than our words,\u201d said Sengupta.

Naturally, this was exactly what colourful agitator and former senior editor for Breitbart News Milo Yiannopolous wanted: outrage, insensible anger, and heady adoration. Without any of these, he would vanish, a figure charged on a narcissism that would otherwise vanquish him. Left alone, and the shallowness would be overwhelming.\nHis visit to Australia triggered the usual fanfare over the credentials of controversy. Australian authorities tend to prefer their visitors to be of a milder sort, but Milo has touched a vein. He has shown himself, rather artificially, to be radical, contrarian, different. He is Right wing impulse made chic; prejudice made glamorous.\nMilo has also managed to marry a few curious themes that grate with the traditional left: he is flamboyant, gay and totally uninhibited, even if all of these seem forced. He, in fact, inhabits a confused being, a soul that sells anger while also charming establishment outlets. By his own admission, he can change, evolve, adapt.\nMichael Brull, writing for New Matilda , remarks pertinently that Yiannopoulous has been given expansive exposure on media outlets across Australia, more out of curiosity than anything else. The Murdoch Press, through The Australian , has offered him opinion space to tease and vent; Channel 7 has fawned and praised; and the Kyle and Jackie O show floated with his waves.\nHis Melbourne show itself resonated with customary fleshiness and garish distraction. Models were in ready supply, given the sponsorship provided by Penthouse. Preliminary photo shoots involved a gathering of up to 100 supporters. Then came the smoke, lights and music, the projected messiah, champagne glass in hand, gracing the stage. Other performances also supplied a private dinner option, if you dared.\nThe performances have wooed those present. Reservations evaporate. This is the impression from a far from critical Luke Kinsella : \u201cMilo is so unyielding, captivating and charismatic; it\u2019s easy to understand why a cult of followers has developed around him. He uses humour to make his point, and humiliate his opponents.\u201d\nBrull\u2019s uses a comparison that gives pause for thought. Gideon Levy, a progressive Israeli scribe not keen to play to the halls of lukewarm acceptance, is also on tour in Australia. He has garnered a relatively poor harvest in fielding reviews and interviews, including an aggressive session on Lateline . \u201cCertainly, no-one invited him on commercial television.\u201d Those \u201crare occasions\u201d which see leftists appear on television require the sort of balance that sees them drowned \u201cout with conventional wisdom.\u201d\nThe Melbourne event on Monday duly became rowdy, a process that made the police work for their brief. Hundreds from the Campaign Against Racism and Fascism squared off against the True Blue Crew. Two arrests, one from each side, were duly made.\nA battle of accounts began to circulate: who agitated whom? Avi Yemini , a self-proclaimed \u201cOzraeli\u201d and former Israeli soldier, insisted that there was \u201ca small group of pro-Milo supporters. People who are standing up for freedom of speech. People who are proudly announcing that they are Aussies. You don\u2019t have to agree with all their different schtick.\u201d\nYemini describes a scene of aggressive chaos, a kaleidoscope of \u201cMuslim women in burkas\u201d, \u201cAntifa with their face coverings\u201d, the enthusiastic sporting of middle fingers with calls of being a Nazi. There were flashbacks: \u201cI felt like I was in the Middle East on the Gaza Strip again where they were throwing rocks at the police.\u201d\nForces of occupation are hardly going to engender support, though Yemini\u2019s sentiment does point to the unnecessary attention given to Yiannopoulous. That he has generated that much incendiary interest from so-called members of progressive groups suggest the unfortunate mirroring of tribal anger, the great trap of incarnating an image he attacks.\nIf the streets are supposedly awash with the prospect of Islamic terror, best not try to please Milo by donning Islamic outfits and throwing rocks at police and rival supporters. This is music to the reactionary Yiannopolous machine showing, to a certain degree, Australia\u2019s troubled relationship with the rigorous engagement of free speech.\nThe political and sometimes legal response has tended to be the executive action of immaturity. Even Milo is onto this, suggesting that the country, suffering \u201ca deeper malaise in the state\u201d has \u201ca serious problem with free speech.\u201d\nYiannopolous promoter Damien Costas puts on a face that barely conceals the glee generated by the promise of violence. It is meant to be affirming: the left populated by blood thirsty loons keen to shut off avenues for discussion on the right. \u201cThere have been many death threats targeted at Milo, myself and others in the team.\u201d\nThe politics of Milo is the politics of anger speared with humour (not always of the ha-ha variety), but even more than that it entails the show of a pantomime driven poseur. He draws his detractors in, and mocks them for slipping up. It is school boy debating tempered by occasional evidence marked by a fashion statement.\nThe most pronounced effort at erasing influence would be to ignore him, allowing the fruit, in time, to fall into ecological oblivion. Much suggests that this will not happen \u2013 neither forces of the political spectrum will permit that to happen. Instead, the Milo show saw the need for a police presence at his Melbourne event to the tune of $50,000. The cost, perhaps, of aggressive free speech, whatever the substance.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/OzraeliAvi/videos/796565047134637/", "http://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/conservative-activist-avi-yemini-said-protests-outside-milo-yiannopoulos-speech-was-like-being-in-the-middle-east/news-story/439b7e5a6670f75661e940c9529cd572", "https://newmatilda.com/2017/12/04/milo-has-a-platform-because-he-upholds-the-status-quo-which-speaks-volumes-about-australia/", "http://www.news.com.au/national/what-actually-happens-at-milo-yiannopoulos-speaking-events/news-story/ad9374c6cb6f0ce9735f7a2243ae5e4b"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "damien costas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackie o", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yemini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gideon levy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yiannopoulous", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luke kinsella", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael brull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milo yiannopolous", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "avi yemini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "breitbart news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murdoch press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "campaign against racism", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new matilda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:50:53.037+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dea30ba242c97cf654999248d88795430a666d89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQibUEKmojPZsf1fwTnSMtkFg9QTNskxnuhqyNnzC_YphZ1doKsiNmXj6rKzYOyvfI6BMjPMQYvzPY7SsclC3Sh", "site_full": "www.f150forum.com", "site": "f150forum.com", "site_section": "https://www.f150forum.com/f78/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Members Builds - Ford F150 Forum - Community of Ford Truck Fans", "title": "2017 Magnetic XLT Sport Evolution", "title_full": "2017 Magnetic XLT Sport Evolution - Ford F150 Forum - Community of Ford Truck Fans", "published": "2017-12-06T06:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33477, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3ebc0613880864a131199098ee19631b33ef5a39", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQibUEKmojPZsf1fwTnSMtkFg9QTNskxnuhqyNnzC_YphZ1doKsiNmXj6rKzYOyvfI6BMjPMQYvzKWqKw8ZlClsUECfrefHy6A9c2FWW386KA--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Bigcat1185", "published": "2017-12-07T07:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "How\u2019s the extra visuals with the tow mirrors?

Mahindra though has pretty much been at the forefront with its various electric only initiatives \u0096 be it acquiring a majority stake in the erstwhile Reva Electric Car Company and developing the e2o and e2o Plus or becoming the first and only Indian manufacturer to compete in Formula E . The Mahindra e20 Plus. Image: Mahindra \nIn fact, Mahindra is pretty much the only mainstream car maker in the country to offer electric cars currently and also sells its eVerito sedan apart from the aforementioned hatchbacks. As reported by The Times of India , Mahindra is now set to take its EV program to the next level and is working on three all-new electric cars apart from electric versions of its existing products. \nThe interesting bit here is that all three models in question will be high-performance models. The three new models are currently under development and are expected to be launched around 2019-2020. Readers might recall, Mahindra had showcased its first ever all-electric sports car, the Halo at the 2014 Auto Expo in New Delhi, which had elicited a huge response. Back then Mahindra had claimed the Halo will clock the 0-100kmph dash in under 8 seconds, apart from boasting a 160kmph top speed and a 200km range. \nWhile the Halo could be one of the models Mahindra is looking at launching as a performance electric car , specifications could get even better by the time the car is launched. That said, it is obvious that Mahindra\u2019s learnings from its Formula E program, where the manufacturer has been doing really well, will help it create electric cars boasting some serious performance levels. \nPawan Goenka, MD, Mahindra and Mahindra had also confirmed earlier this year that Mahindra will launch an electric-only version of its smallest SUV, the KUV100 in the next couple of years. This is in addition to the confirmation that Mahindra will launch an electric version of every new SUV and crossover it launches in future. Apart from looking at launching more and more EVs in the coming years, Mahindra is also working on reducing charge time for its electric cars. It also hopes batteries will get more affordable in the coming years, which should help in making electric cars more affordable.

Defying dire, worldwide warnings, President Donald Trump on Wednesday broke with decades ... \nJERUSALEM (AP) - The Latest on the fallout from President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital (all times local): \n11:35 a.m. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says President Donald Trump \"bound himself forever\" to the history of Jerusalem by recognizing the city as Israel's capital. \nNetanyahu claimed other states are considering following the U.S. lead and recognizing Jerusalem. He spoke on Thursday at the Foreign Ministry. \nNetanyahu says that \"we are already in contact with other states that will make a similar recognition.\" \nHe says the \"time has come\" and expressed confidence that others will follow suit and move their embassies to Jerusalem. \nMeanwhile, the Israeli military said it will be deploying additional troops to the West Bank ahead of Friday, when mass Palestinian protests are anticipated in response to Trump's move. \nThe army statement on Thursday says it will deploy several battalions to the territory while other troops have been put on alert to address \"possible developments.\" \nPalestinians went on strike across the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip on Thursday and protests are expected on Friday after midday prayers. \n___ \n11:25 a.m. \nThe top leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas is calling for a new uprising against Israel in the wake of President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nIsmail Haniyeh spoke to his followers in the Gaza Strip on Thursday and called the U.S. decision an \"aggression on our people and a war on our sanctuaries.\" \nHe says the uprising should begin Friday, the Muslim holy day. \nHaniyeh then added: \"We want the uprising to last and continue to let Trump and the occupation regret this decision.\" \nHamas killed hundreds of Israelis during an armed uprising in the early 2000s. But Hamas' ability to carry out attacks is more limited. Israel has imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip, and many of Hamas' supporters in the West Bank have been arrested. \nEven so, Hamas possesses a large arsenal of rockets in Gaza capable of striking many areas in Israel. \n___ \n10:30 a.m. \nSaudi Arabia's royal court, led by King Salman and his powerful son, are condemning the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nIt's a rare public rebuke by the royal court of U.S. ally and President Donald Trump. \nSaudi Arabia, a regional powerhouse that could help the White House push through a Middle East settlement, said on Thursday the kingdom had already warned against this step and \"continues to express its deep regret at the U.S. administration's decision,\" describing it \"unjustified and irresponsible.\" \nTrump's move puts the Sunni nation in a bind. The kingdom, particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. \nU.S. Embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa have warned American citizens of possible protests as a result of Trump's decision. \n___ \n9:40 a.m. \nSchools and shops are closed in the West Bank, as Palestinians are protesting President Donald Trump's recognition of contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nPolitical groups have called for protest marches in West Bank town centers at noon on Thursday. \nTrump's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. \nThe Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. In recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Trump was seen as siding with Israel which claims the entire city. \n___ \n9:30 a.m. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is accusing his American counterpart of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" by declaring the divided holy city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nErdogan also compared President Donald Trump to a \"blender\" that is stirring up trouble in the region. \nThe Turkish leader said, addressing Trump: \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it.\" \nErdogan added that \"political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace.\" \nHe also said: \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right,' he is mistaken.\" \nErdogan spoke to a group of workers on Thursday who had gathered at Ankara's airport, before he departed for an official visit to Greece. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nPalestinians, Israelis and the wider Middle East are bracing for the fallout after President Donald Trump's seismic shift in recognizing the bitterly contested Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was to travel to Jordan on Thursday to meet with King Abdullah II. The monarch is seen as Abbas' closest Arab ally, and the two leaders might try to coordinate a response to Trump's policy change. \nIn Wednesday's move, Trump defied worldwide warnings and insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, describing his decision as merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. \nTrump also said the United States would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable for that.

I don't what I'm doing or why I'm doing it, I can't tell if I'm subconsciously faking it or if that's even a thing, I don't know if this is for attention but I really can't help how I feel and what's on my mind and why I can't stop it. I'm scared I'm frustrated I'm lonely but I don't allow myself to show my emotion to other people. I can't even talk about it because when I do I either cry or everything that's coming out of my mouth doesn't even sound like myself. I was extremely depressed a year ago around this time and I missed basically my 9th grade year of high school and I have to do it again which i am doing this year. I've struggled with depression since I was younger. And of course I keep my emotions bottled up . I can give more background information if y'all ask for it but I'll get to the point of what's really bugging me now. Being black and complaining about life issues isn't a good mix cause we have this idea that we're stronger and therapy is for whites people and etc. But me I've been stuck idk I'm trying to get to the point it's hard I always feel like I have to explain myself fully so people will understand exactly how I feel. I get high a lot just weed So that may be my problem too, but like I've just been feeling like empty, dull or idk spectating my whole life, I fantasize a lot about people I know or barely know or want to know and just make up long stories in my head. But everyone does that right ? If I'm not doing that I'm Contemplating on my homework and school I missing too much school and I can never say why I just stare at my mother while she yells at me she has come to the conclusion that hittin me does nothing anymore that has been stopped being effective. But like I will get all the work I need to do out and sit it right in front of my face and just stare at it debating with myself in my head . And I still won't do it. But I won't get on the phone or watch tv either because I tell myself I don't deserve it because this is what you should be doing but my body is just like \"nah.\" And than sometimes my brain goes f**k it and I watch tv or get otp. If this isn't happening I'm overthinking about what to say in a conversation because idk what to say, I would think of something My sister would say or just anybody else so I can sound idk better ? But when I say that my one side of my brain disagrees and tells me What I as myself would say but I think it's dumb and I think the person would think I'm dumb or weird because that's all I used to get called and all the time not in a mean way but growing up my sister (I have 2) they would make fun of me. But I'm not the type to let myself get bullied either but I wasn't as mean as them I never understood how could people say mean things to hurt other people they care about so even when they hurt my feelings I didn't want to hurt theirs as much so I would just stop fussing and cry. And they really just think I don't care like nobody sees me the way i see myself . But I don't really know how I see myself and I'm sorry I'm trying to stay on topic. But anyway she like I was saying when I was high I would find myself holding myself and just staring into in deep thought like I'm stuck and than I would have this feeling of reality like Aniya wtf are you doing and I would try to engage in conversation but it doesn't work because I don't really be knowing what to say and I force fake laughs to make it seem like I care because I do or at least I think I do. And if I'm not thinking about that I'm thinking about embarrassing moments in my life that has happened to me going years back or recent. If I'm not thinking about that I'm thinking about this me right here telling someone about my problems and then I talk myself out of it saying it's dumb, they are made up you'll be fine just keep pretending, but it's getting exhausting nobody understands my aunt still asks me or says stuff about last year my mother tells me I hope I'm not going through my lil thing again because she doesn't have time and etc. And I'm just so nice in a a**hole way though I try to be considerate of others feelings recently I have toughened up and stood my ground more tho. But if I'm not thinking about that I'm thinking about sex. And I have some secrets that I really want to tell people about that happened when I was really really young like not even doubled digits I think that may have had an affect on me. But I've always been weird in a way idk my grandmother has Bipolar my mother and father are alcoholics and he's on some mental medicine. I don't know and if I'm not thinking about that I'm thinking about me comparing myself to others how people have been through so much more than me and I want to be complaining or how it could be worse and than the other side of my brain goes in therapy they tell you to not do that becaus everyone has there own problems. But let's be real some people are just seeking attention and need to be grateful and I think I'm one of those people but why is this idea that something is wrong with me is stuck in my head . I don't feel like myself I never really did I don't know how to handle my emotions unless I'm crying about one of my tv series or to a song I cry to myself because when I cry outloud I make people mad becaus I never say what's wrong just tears . I make a lot of sarcastic comments and jokes I'm good at seeing things from a lot of perspective which is why it's hard for me to ask for help because I think I can help myself but now I just think I'm helpless. Lately I've just been thinking so deep my mind has just been racing about things to be mad about and when I get mad I can barely control I have to hit something to relieve myself bang my Head or something I shake I get hot everything is more intense. I'm a small bit paranoid too Idk if it's from weed or from growing up with a father who mentally abused me and my sisters and my mother and physically abused my mother in our face . Plus he was in and out jail he is currently locked up but I talk to him still and tell him I love him because no one else is holding a grudge and he's hurting enough so why should I hurt him some more right ? Really I just been thinking about how I need some consistency i want a family dinner, someone to force me to do my homework, I want to be told I love you and I can say it back without feeling weird or uncomfortable, I want people to see me how I see me, I need reassurance but everybody treats me like I'm dingy when I ask a lot of questions so I can make sure I don't get the wrong thing and make a mistake when they ask for a favor . And it's a lot more of just desperate emotions I'm feeling . I just wanna know if it's real or not and can someone make it stop please I just wanna be like everybody else and worry about a boy and do my schoolwork like I used to I mean I never had to really apply myself in elementary and middle it was alll too easy but high school and I'm at the best public school in my city it's hard, but instead of being overly obsessive about everything but still not doing what I'm supposed to be doing .

We currently pull fences using a home made clamp made out of two lengths of angled steel. Pull with telehandler to desired tension and staple up. Sometimes we overdo the tension with the telehandler and something breaks or gives and sometimes we don't get it tight enough. Also getting the tension correct at top and bottom of fence is tricky.

Social Democratic Party, SPD, chairman Martin Schulz addresses the media during a news conference after a board meeting at the party's headquarter in Berlin, Germany, Monday, Dec. 4, 2017. \nBERLIN (AP) - Germany's center-left Social Democrats are discussing Thursday whether to open talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives on extending their governing coalition, or at least backing a minority government. \nThe Social Democrats' leadership insisted the party would go into opposition after a disastrous election result in September. It reinforced its refusal to join a new coalition after Merkel's talks with two smaller parties collapsed last month. \nHowever, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made clear that he doesn't want a new election, and Social Democrat leader Martin Schulz reversed course. \nAt a previously scheduled party congress Thursday, Schulz is seeking members' approval for a resolution approving talks on \"whether and in what form\" the Social Democrats can support a new government. \nHowever, some members - including the party's youth wing - want to specifically rule out another coalition, leaving only a minority government or a new election as options. Merkel has said she is \"very skeptical\" about leading a minority government, which hasn't yet been tried in post-World War II Germany. \nSocial Democrat parliamentary group chief Andrea Nahles said the collapse of Merkel's talks with other parties produced an unexpected new situation. \n\"We can't play the ostrich and stick our heads in the sand,\" she said. \nThe Social Democrats have been part of Germany's government for 15 of the past 19 years - first leading a center-left government under Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder from 1998 to 2005, then twice governing in a \"grand coalition\" under Merkel, from 2005 to 2009 and again from 2013 until now. \nThe party suffered historically poor election results after both Merkel coalitions, with support slumping to a post-war low of 20.5 percent in September.

GulfBankers", "text": "Saudi non-oil private sector growth hits 27-month high November data from Emirates NBD Saudi Arabia PMI signaled a strong upturn in the Saudi Arabia non-oil private sector. Steep output and new order expansions contributed to the latest positive result. Meanwhile, foreign demand improved at a modest pace and job creation continued. On the price front, cost burdens rose moderately, while output prices were unchanged since October amid strong competition in the sector. Business confidence remained positive, albeit the level of sentiment fell slightly since the preceding survey. The survey, sponsored by Emirates NBD and produced by IHS Markit, contains original data collected from a monthly survey of business conditions in the Saudi private sector. Commenting on the Saudi Arabia PMI survey, Khatija Haque, Head of MENA Research at Emirates NBD, said: \u201cThe strong November PMI reading is particularly encouraging given the heightened political uncertainty in the Kingdom, and indicates that it was largely \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d last month. That output and new orders continued to increase sharply bodes well for non-oil sector growth in the fourth quarter. Higher oil prices likely contributed to the broadly positive business sentiment.\u201d The headline seasonally adjusted Emirates NBD Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) \u2013 a composite gauge designed to give a single-figure snapshot of operating conditions in the non-oil private sector economy \u2013 rose to 57.5 in November, from 55.6 in October. This figure indicated the steepest improvement in the non-oil private sector since August 2015. That said, the expansion was slower than the series\u2019 historical average. Output continued to increase, in line with the survey\u2019s trend. The rate of growth was sharp overall and accelerated to a ten-month high in November. According to anecdotal evidence, the upturn in business activity was supported by strong domestic demand. Growth of new business accelerated during November, with the respective index hitting a 27-month high. The improvement in new work inflows was reported by 37% of respondents. New export order growth reached a three-month high during November. Non-oil private sector firms commonly linked the rise in new orders from abroad to an economic upturn in neighboring countries. Job creation continued in November, thereby extending the current sequence of hiring to 44 months. That said, the rate of increase eased since October, in contrast to the trends for output and new orders. In terms of prices, input cost inflation eased, with the respective index recording below the series long-run average. Softer increases in both purchase prices and staff costs were recorded. Despite the ongoing increases in cost burdens, output charges were unchanged. Some panel members reported higher selling prices, however these were offset by those discounting their charges for goods and services in response to strong competition. Stocks of purchases were accumulated at the second-fastest rate in the survey\u2019s history in November. Firms noted that increasing demand had led them to build-up their inventories. Optimism towards future growth prospects softened in the latest survey. That said, business confidence remained positive overall. The ongoing economic upturn alongside higher business investments underpinned the positive outlook.

Bullet jump will gain distance but not speed.\nCareful, blast procs and knockdown shockwaves will send her flying.\nSkill 2\nHover: Toggle Skill\nUsing her light weight frame and control over wind Zephyr rides an updraft to hover midair, allowing long range firing. Being in one place will attract alot of incoming fire.\nSkill 3\nTurbulence: Duration\nPretty much keep it as it is. The all around projectile deflection barrier of wind will go rather well with skills one and two, since both tend to put her in places where many of the enemies can see her.\nSkill 4\nFunnel Gunnel: Channel\nThis is basically a horizontal tornado, flinging enemies back from Zephyr. Aim, then start channeling, once started redirecting the funnel is ill-advised so the targetting is locked in position until the toggle is turned off. Enemies caught in the gunnel are flung back, only taking damage if they come into contact with a solid surface, like a wall or rock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:00.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bbc17fbcfaa0606773bd604524f36bd12e55d0f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWZVoVpH.7oRmu3MVMoOe7sp9ht1vcKAmdGwW0nsEoNeT9f16_TGV1CxNAIeeka1KYfc03YgPlJSFx4OSMmcriD88tq3DpU0VVACnP6dl9ZAd6za8zM2AUQ9", "site_full": "hidepoliticalapocalypse.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://hidepoliticalapocalypse.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Trumpnado S**tstorm: Sharknado Apocalypse of Donald Trump and All World Psychopathic Dictators", "title": "World commits to pollution-free planet at environment summit", "title_full": "World commits to pollution-free planet at environment summit", "published": "2017-12-07T11:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bbc17fbcfaa0606773bd604524f36bd12e55d0f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWZVoVpH.7oRmu3MVMoOe7sp9ht1vcKAmdGwW0nsEoNeT9f16_TGV1CxNAIeeka1KYfc03YgPlJSFx4OSMmcriD88tq3DpU0VVACnP6dl9ZAd6za8zM2AUQ9", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Spiral Fractal (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "World commits to pollution-free planet at environment summit", "text": "environment news - BingNews World commits to pollution-free planet at environment summit The world has committed to a pollution-free planet at the close of the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi, with resolutions and pledges promising to improve the lives of billions across the globe by cleaning up our air, land and water.

to stop, so scientists calculate just the right amount of sugar in our foods that makes us won\u2019t more but also not too much.\r\nd.\tAnother possibility Is to leave a small powder left on the

What if the next problem becomes shopping while driving? \nGeneral Motors announced the release of an in-vehicle shopping app called Marketplace that has already drawn the attention of the National Safety Council. This app, which would be accessible on the vehicle\u2019s dashboard console, allows drivers to order food, make hotel reservations and even purchase grocery items \u2013 all while racing down the highway. \nObviously, this technology could be great for advertisers. They would be able to reach audiences through a medium with fewer competitors. On your way to work, you might be more tempted to buy a cup of coffee because pre-paying on the road could save time once you reach the caf\u00e9. \nHowever, the National Safety Council is gravely concerned about this behavior. Distractions are part of nearly one in every four crashes, after all. Drivers who are looking down to decide which entr\u00e9e to order could fail to spot pedestrians, cyclists or another vehicle.

Social media,social network concept. shutterstock Gulf News Nearly 60 per cent believe in next 10 year people will use only biometrics to access financial information Dubai: The UAE embracing digital adoption faster than West in all areas of life including financial services, according to a recent HSBC research.HSBC\u2019s new global research report, Trust in Technology, which includes research from over 12,000 people in 11 countries, finds people in the UAE are ahead of the West when it comes to adoption of new technologies due to greater understanding and optimism.More than two-thirds of people (77 per cent) prefer doing most things with new technology when they can, the third highest after India and China, versus 49 per cent in Canada and 51 per cent in Germany. According to the research, people in the UAE rank near the top of the markets surveyed in terms of positive attitudes towards technological innovation. UAE (25 per cent) has the third highest adopters of fingerprint technology, after China (40 per cent) and India (31 per cent), versus 9 per cent in France and Germany, and 14 per cent in Canada.The global findings also suggest that trust in technology and its adoption are driven not only by consumer trends, but can be encouraged by wider governmental support. A 2016 United Nations report shows that the UAE is listed among the world\u2019s leading countries in terms of the level of progress in e-governance and e-participation. Advertisement Technology is so popular among UAE residents that almost 3 in 10 (29 per cent) will switch bank if they find another with a better technology offering. However, only 38 per cent show extreme concern for their personal data being leaked.Fifty-nine per cent of people in the UAE believe that in the next 10 years we will only use biometrics to access financial information. Fast paced awareness, trust and adoption of technologies including biometrics, chatbots and digital wallets in the UAE has seen the nation overtake the traditional Western technology trailblazers. For instance, 77 per cent people in the UAE prefer doing most things using new technology when they can versus just 49 per cent in Canada and 51 per cent in Germany.The adoption of fingerprint recognition, a widespread consumer technology, highlights these contrasting perspectives. People in the UAE are the highest users of fingerprint recognition technology to unlock their devices across the markets surveyed, at 55 per cent. They also place extremely high levels of trust in available forms of biometric technology (fingerprint, voice and iris recognition), with 66% trusting it to replace their passwords.The research suggests a nation which is ambitious and adventurous in the face of technological advancement, enthusiastic when it comes to new products, and open to using different types of technology.This can be delivered through large global organisations, like HSBC, to ensure that the global adoption of technology continues to develop and enables the delivery of a simpler, better and faster banking service.HSBC launches digital accountDubai: HSBC UAE announced on Wednesday the launch of its 10-minute digital account opening solution, which provides customers an account number instantly online.
