Doctors told him that more would continue to break off if he didn't get it fixed. \n\"It definitely took me by surprise,\" Green said. \"I don't really know the word for it. I was just shocked. I was very upset. I didn't think I was going to have my high school season, to be honest. But we found a doctor who said I could swim and have my high school season.\"   SUBSCRIBE NOW \nGreen finished his freshman swim season before having his surgery in March. Doctors had to drill on the sides of his knee and insert screws to establish blood flow for his bone to grow. \nThe doctors took bone from his hip and partially filled the hole with bone plugs in hopes of having the rest of his bone grow back. Green received good news when a doctor told him at his most recent checkup that the bone was growing back. \nGreen's next check up is on Thursday, where doctors will check the progress and see if any screws in his knee have migrated. \nGreen, who has been swimming competitively since he was 6 years old, wasn't sure if the surgery would work, which put his entire swimming career in jeopardy. Fortunately for Green, he spent eight weeks on crutches, but was allowed back in the water just two weeks after the surgery. \nGreen eventually transitioned to a custom-fit unloader knee brace to help shift the weight from the healing portion of his leg. He participated in physical therapy once a week at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital for about four months. \nAlthough he could get back in the water, Green wasn't allowed to kick for six months. He put a pull buoy between his legs to prevent himself from kicking, which put a lot of strain on his upper body muscles. \nGreen had to push off with one leg for his flip-turns and did only upper body lifts in the weight room. He couldn't even carry weights around because he couldn't have any more than the weight of his back pack weighing down on him. Green spent almost an entire year not kicking his legs in the water. \n\"It's just a long process, and it's still not over,\" Green said. \"They said it's going to take up to two years to completely heal all the way because I guess bone grows back really slowly.\" \nGreen still is dealing with a lot of pain, but said he is happy he still gets to compete this year. He swims the 200- and 500-yard freestyle events for the Bull Frogs and is also hoping to get on relay teams this year. \nGreen is not yet able to do any impact activity like running, but his doctor informed him that moving his leg around in the pool can actually be good for his recovery. \nGreen is back to regular swimming workouts and competitions for his sophomore season. He isn't all the way back to where he was, but is slowly working on getting there. North coach Logan Schaefer said they both have been working on focusing on the things Green is able to do and do the best they can. \n\"I think once we start to move and progress overall to getting back to full swimming, I think those things that we could do are going to be some strengths as we build back into more of the kicking and those types of things that we couldn't do a whole lot of recently,\" Schaefer said. \nGreen already is getting close to the times he swam last season, which is a good sign of how his recovery is going.

What should I do?", "text": "So I started my first, official job out of college a few weeks ago. I lucked out heavily with a base salary of 70K plus great benefits/bonus. Unfortunately, I have about 170K in student loans.\nQuick rundown of debt accrual: Since I'm the eldest, my parents had no idea how to handle paying for my college tuition. My tuition is actually fairly cheap compared to most colleges, but it was how my dad took out money that really screwed me over. Every semester I applied to FAFSA, got money from the gov't in the form of sub/unsub loans but it wasn't enough to cover each year. My dad would take out a Parent's Plus loan from FAFSA to cover the rest. Unfortunately, he would ask for the most amount of money, and instead of refunding the money back to Sallie Mae, he would use it on household funds, bill payments, or even family vacations (I was completely unaware he was doing this until I poked around at why I had to pay so much back). At some point, I also took out my own private student loans from FAFSA (in addition to the gov't loans) because there was one semester that they wouldn't give me money because of my grades. With that private loan, I was also never told to refund the money or save it to pay back the debt because my dad took care of everything & pretty much told me to \"sign here\" when it mattered.\nI should only have 75K in loans, but have an extra 100K due to my dad's poor financial management (he did it with a good heart, I promise, he just doesn't know as much about money as he thinks he does) & I'm stuck with it all.\nCurrent Situation: Right now, I'm 24, started a new job, and living with my parents - they told me I can stay with them as long as I need to save or until I get married (however, I would rather not be living at home until I'm 30). The car I used through college finally sputtered out so I'm borrowing a family member's car to get to work atm, but I can't do it much longer so I'll need a car as well. My base salary is 70K. I pay my family's phone bills and help pay for groceries. I know my salary is pretty high for a recent grad, so I want to be smart about what to do.

Alex Wong / Getty Images \nFour months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in \"tatters\" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics. \nIt's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray. \nOn Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch. 1. Russia, Russia, Russia \nWray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, \"a witch hunt.\" \nWray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied to the Trump campaign, including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nDoes that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Stzrok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation , suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case? \nShould there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him? \nLook for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this. \n\"The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,\" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing. \n\"We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,\" Goodlatte added. 2. Independence \nThe job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was \"the Russia thing.\" \nFor his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees , who have faced criticism from the president this year. \nThis week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to \"keep calm and tackle hard\" amid the current adverse climate. And, at his confirmation hearing, Wray pledged his loyalty was to the Constitution, not a political regime. \"I will never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice, period, full stop,\" he said at the time. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee will no doubt want to ask Wray about his contacts with President Trump and others in the White House this year. 3. Oh, yeah \u2014 FBI business \nIn a matter of weeks, an important electronic surveillance tool will expire if Congress does not reauthorize it. The murder rate has spiked in several major American cities. \nCourts have thrown out corruption charges or reduced sentences of public officials accused of bribery and other offenses, following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the tools the Justice Department's public integrity unit can use to attack graft in state houses across the country. \nThe bureau also has open investigations into activity by sympathizers of the Islamic State in every one of its field offices. \nThe FBI, in short, has its hands in many baskets. And after the questions about Russia and Trump, members of the committee may want to discuss some business in regular order. Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/.

Suffolk Downs owner HYM Investment Group has therefore put forward a general redevelopment plan with two paths. Both paths include 16.5 million square feet of new residential, retail, office, hotel, and lab space built out over as long as two decades. Eleven million square feet of that would go in Boston and 5.5 million in Revere. Now, here\u2019s where it gets interesting. Should Amazon pick Boston as host of its second headquarters, HYM would go with a so-called pro-commercial approach. That pro-commercial path would be paved with the up to 8 million square feet of office space that Amazon is seeking in a new HQ. It would, too, include 7,500 residential units, 550,000 square feet of retail, and up to 830 hotel rooms. HYM would also want expedited permissions to build two office buildings so that Amazon could open by its headquarters\u2019 scheduled 2019 debut. But suppose Amazon choose Dallas or some such exotic place instead of Boston. In that case, HYM would take a pro-residential path, with 10,000 housing units, 450,000 square feet of retail, and 670 hotel rooms. There would also be 5.25 million square feet of office space. Either way, things will be big. And the Blue Line will creak and shudder under the new ridership. Stay tuned.

If you are worried about your credit info being breached but didn\u2019t freeze all three agencies, do that now.", "text": "Why this is important: With the recent Equifax breach, plenty of people have put freezes on their credit reports (for good reason). But if you only froze one, someone can now still take out a loan on your name if they have the rest of your info.\nWhat changed: Until recently, Fannie Mae required all three credit reports to actually report for them to buy a loan from a bank. The change now allows for your report to be frozen with one credit reporting agency, but the other two must be unfrozen.\nWhy this matters: Your local bank might sell the mortgages they originate to Fannie Mae. Many small and even moderately sized banks have investors they sell mortgages to. Fannie Mae is one of the largest investors here. The loan must be originated and underwritten to Fannie Mae\u2019s standards for them to purchase it. This means that Fannie Mae\u2019s guidelines impact your local banks\u2019 guidelines if they sell to them. This change means that other banks will now be allowing this same thing. So if you\u2019re worried about your credit but didn\u2019t freeze it with all three agencies, do that now.\nEdit: source\u2014I\u2019m a technical writer at a bank and am rewriting our internal procedures on what we accept based on the above as I type this.\nEdit 2: I\u2019m not suggesting Fannie Mae originates loans. The thing is that their decisions as an investor will impact how banks do business. Fannie Mae says they\u2019ll take loans that are riskier? Banks that sell to Fannie Mae will start originating those riskier loans because they know they can sell them. This is about Fannie Mae (being a large investor) saying they\u2019ll take loans with one frozen score, so some banks will start accepting that too and not require that it be unfrozen.

(Eric Weddle/WFYI Public Media) \nThe State Board of Education approved a controversial rewrite of the high school graduation requirements Wednesday in the face of opposition from school leaders, teachers, parents and professional associations. \nDuring nearly six hours of public comment before the vote, dozens of educators asked for more time to vet the plan since the cost and details around implementation are unknown. \nEarlier, more than 200 school leaders, teachers, and officials wrote letters to the state education department raising concerns with the proposal. \nJeff Butts, Wayne Township superintendent and president of the Indiana Association of Public School Superintendents, told board members Wednesday it would be \u201cirresponsible to approve the recommendations\u201d without cost analysis and input from local districts. \nBut a majority of board members sidestepped those concerns and said that lawmakers and state officials would eventually provide adequate funding and flexibility in accountability to local school districts. \nThe board voted 7 to 4 to set the plan in motion for high school students beginning with the 2019 freshmen class. State schools chief Jennifer McCormick, Maryanne McMahon, Cari Whicker, and Steve Yager voted no. \nBoard member Tony Walker says the pathways were developed to give students better and more targeted economic opportunities. \n\u201cAlmost all concerns I\u2019ve heard about the proposal relate to the adjustments they would require from the adults and not the impact on the kids,\u201d he wrote on Twitter during the meeting. \u201cEducation should be kids first.\u201d \nGraduation Pathways require high school students to satisfy three requirements to walk across the stage. \nIn addition to meeting high school diploma conditions, students must prove job skills and earn a credential, certificate or reach a predetermined score set by the state on a standardized test, such as the ACT, military entrance exam or earn an honors diploma. \nThe board\u2019s vote also signaled a stamp of approval to end to the 10th grade ISTEP as a graduation requirement. Next month lawmaker will likely consider replacing it with a college entrance exam, such as the ACT or SAT. \nThe idea behind the graduation pathways is to let students choose a college or career-focused academic track. Ideally, this would allow a student to tailor their classes, extracurricular activities or internships to a particular job, joining the military or college major. \nStrong support for the so-called Graduation Pathways came from the business sector and higher education who want higher skilled workers and students. Indianapolis Public Schools also fully supported the increased requirements. \nCaryl Auslander, the Indiana Chamber\u2019s vice president of education and workforce development, said businesses want employees who have a diploma and soft skills. Auslander, who helped author the pathways, says Indiana jobs are going unfilled due to unqualified workers. \n\u201cEmployers have an important stake in K-12 education,\u201d she says. \u201cWe pay half the taxes and are the end users.\u201d \nBy 2020, up to 65 percent of all Indiana jobs will require postsecondary attainment, says Alicia Kielmovitch, the board\u2019s senior director of policy and legislation. Currently, the state has an approximately 41 percent postsecondary attainment, including certificates, associate, bachelor and graduate degrees. \nEarlier this year the General Assembly charged the State Board of Education with creating new graduation requirements. The board\u2019s subcommittee, led by member Byron Ernest, created the pathway recommendation after 10 public meetings totaling around 30 hours. \nBut some, including Butts, have questioned the committee\u2019s transparency. The final recommendation document was seen by some members shortly before it was made public. \nBoard members tussled with each other Tuesday and Wednesday about what details should be hammered out now and what should be left to legislators or the future to sort out. \nBut board member David Freitas, who helped write the plan, argued that the proposal was never intended to answer every question. \n\u201cThis is a visionary document,\u201d Freitas said Tuesday during a hearing about the plan. \u201cThe details aren\u2019t going to be there yet.\u201d \nData from the state education department found nearly 10,000 students would not graduate under the proposed graduation requirements. \nOther local school leaders have questioned the impact on poor and special education students to inequity for rural districts unable to take advantage of new ways for students to graduate. \nHere is the current version of the recommended graduation requirements . Students graduating in 2023 must satisfy all three of the requirements by completing a pathway.

December 7, 2017 at 2:50 pm \nFirst of all, I\u2019m disappointed that like Pogo has done recently, they did not \u201cgift\u201d us a M-n-M badge. I think Pogo not only wants the revenue, but are testing to see if this game is as \u201cpopular\u201d as stated in the Pogo Insider. I\u2019ve acquired all \u201c3\u201d badges because I\u2019m hoping by completing them, I\u2019ll atleast reach rank #10. However all \u201c3\u201d challenges seem to be extreme to me. Good Luck to all who purchase these badges. December 7, 2017 at 3:05 pm \nI know what they have done this past year with new games, but they have given us 77 M&M Badges since the middle of February. And the Christmas celebration is going to start in a few days. So I honestly believe that they have given us so much more than anyone should expect. \nSuz December 7, 2017 at 4:56 pm \nThere are people that love these games. I\u2019m not included, but I understand that Pogo has to gear their games to what younger people want. If they don\u2019t get the younger crowd the site will die out as we do. \nSuz \nWell, that\u2019s a happy Christmas thought. LOL. \nthe demographics on this site are most definitely not younger people. the younger demographic blows up worlds and plays virtual reality games, which is not what pogo does i have children. they laugh at pogo December 7, 2017 at 5:29 pm \nThat\u2019s right, but we aren\u2019t all going to be here in another 10 or 15 years. And that is what Pogo has to plan on. Trust me, I hate the majority of the games now. But I love my badges, so I do them, no matter the game. \nPeople over 50 are not their target market, and never will be. \nSuz December 7, 2017 at 6:25 pm \n\u201cSuz\u201d; \nAs a \u201cretired\u201d Accountant I can confirm your above comments are so correct. I\u2019ve posted before that Pogo is aware that many of their \u201cveteran\u201d members are not happy with the \u201cnew\u201d direction they are headed in. However as you stated, Pogo is looking towards the future when many of us will no longer be around. The games we grew up playing are not the games most of our children are into. It\u2019s not easy for many of us to accept because of the \u201cvast\u201d amount of revenue we currently provide. But again, Pogo is looking towards the future. WCurry5990 says December 7, 2017 at 6:45 pm \nHi \u201cyall\u2019; \nFor those of you who have yet to get into Jewel Academy, be advised these \u201c3\u201d badges are very doable. In re \u2013 \n1.__Cool Customer__Remove \u201c999\u201d blue gems and 2.__Landmark Wins__Score \u201c100,000\u201d points. \nI just continued to play the game while trying to level up and the badges came naturally.

If you are worried about your credit info being breached but didn\u2019t freeze all three agencies, do that now.", "text": "Why this is important: With the recent Equifax breach, plenty of people have put freezes on their credit reports (for good reason). But if you only froze one, someone can now still take out a loan on your name if they have the rest of your info.\nWhat changed: Until recently, Fannie Mae required all three credit reports to actually report for them to buy a loan from a bank. The change now allows for your report to be frozen with one credit reporting agency, but the other two must be unfrozen.\nWhy this matters: Your local bank might sell the mortgages they originate to Fannie Mae. Many small and even moderately sized banks have investors they sell mortgages to. Fannie Mae is one of the largest investors here. The loan must be originated and underwritten to Fannie Mae\u2019s standards for them to purchase it. This means that Fannie Mae\u2019s guidelines impact your local banks\u2019 guidelines if they sell to them. This change means that other banks will now be allowing this same thing. So if you\u2019re worried about your credit but didn\u2019t freeze it with all three agencies, do that now.\nEdit: source\u2014I\u2019m a technical writer at a bank and am rewriting our internal procedures on what we accept based on the above as I type this.\nEdit 2: I\u2019m not suggesting Fannie Mae originates loans. The thing is that their decisions as an investor will impact how banks do business. Fannie Mae says they\u2019ll take loans that are riskier? Banks that sell to Fannie Mae will start originating those riskier loans because they know they can sell them. This is about Fannie Mae (being a large investor) saying they\u2019ll take loans with one frozen score, so some banks will start accepting that too and not require that it be unfrozen. All I was saying was, if you were concerned but thought freezing one or two was good enough, that\u2019s not necessarily the case.\n submitted by /u/poopsmitherson\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:07.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "736910171898214c605f9f6ec4f3a00babace421", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS4mlWRaQOV30AHBjwgH78HaLneCKktrsXWRvgsKQX3sCcXcMZWHHFn38KDKS3yKj2pQ5f8Wg9olpJ1MdA_hDziPvd4uetnu4ZB3uZOYRlrqooqFz7RigLChiRQMvGjA0GNz40IFpTeMM-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "comments : personalfinance", "title": "Aellion Getting kicked out of house and need to sustain myself.", "title_full": "Aellion comments on Getting kicked out of house and need to sustain myself.", "published": "2017-12-05T02:17:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9f158875a34bb28648ee1a8f8a8369e525ee1c46", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS4mlWRaQOV30AHBjwgH78HaLneCKktrsXWRvgsKQX3sCcXcMZWHHFn38KDKS3yKj2pQ5f8Wg9olpJ1MdA_hDziPvd4uetnu4ZB3uZOYRlrqooqFz7RigLChiRQMvGjA0GTr.HU5Qv8PPbbpFeMwR_2OlGO_XtLFmP", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Aellion", "published": "2017-12-07T11:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Thanks for the reply, however that's not how it works in the Netherlands.

Be it Italy with their fabulous vintages or France with their fruity blends, few countries don\u2019t enjoy wine from time to time. Want to know more about enjoying wine? Read below to learn as much as you can quickly.\nProtect your wine\u2019s flavor with proper storage. Any large variance in temperature will alter your wine\u2019s taste. Store your wine at 50-55 degrees to allow the flavor time to develop. Store your wine in a basement or a wine refrigerator.\n<iframe src=\" https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3 ! Suggested Web page !2d-81.489879!3d28.452059!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0xeeb0eb55425a9848!2sChristinis+Ristorante+Italiano!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1512046365265\u2033 width=\u201d600\u2033 height=\u201d450\u2033 frameborder=\u201d0\u2033 style=\u201dborder:0\u2033 allowfullscreen>\nHave a plan prior to picking your wine. Be sure you know which wine you\u2019re looking before to avoid getting overwhelmed by brands, varieties, and prices. Certain wines fit dinners and others better fit large parties. Knowing which wine suits your needs can help you choose a better wine than browsing and choosing something on a whim.\nAllow red wines to warm up. Often, red wines are stored at temperatures near 60 degrees. The best temperature for serving red wines is above 70 degrees, which allows the full body of the wine to be present. When you open a bottle of red, allow it to sit and come to room temperature before drinking.\nUse the right stemware when serving wine. Your guests can be impressed by your wine more easily if it is served in a flawless glass. It\u2019s time to buy some new pieces when you notice chips or when the stemware becomes outdated.\nSparkling wines and champagnes should be poured very cold. If you drink these beverages at room temperature, the flavor will be compromised. Before you drink your champagne, be sure to chill it in the refrigerator for at least an hour.\nIf you are looking for a good deal on wine, try to purchase it from the rack at a liquor store. Generally, you will find that these are the items that are on sale or the dealer wants to get rid of the fastest. The quality of these wines has not dissipated though, so you can score a great deal this way.\n\nTake a trip to the regions where wine is produced. You will really appreciate a wine after seeing where the grapes grow and also associate a wine you love with pleasant memories. You\u2019ll gain an idea of the origins of the wines and what creates their flavor. It\u2019s also a nice excuse to have a lovely vacation.\nLet any recently uncorked wine breathe for a bit. Giving the wine time to settle helps bring out the rich flavors of the beverage. Use a decanter for this. Pour the wine into one and then let it sit for about a quarter of an hour. You\u2019ll find the wine much more delicious after doing so.\nHave a basic idea of what kind of wine you like. Even if you are not sure of what brand, winery or region you prefer, it is pretty easy to determine if you prefer a blush, red or white. By knowing just this basic fact, you can more easily determine which wines are worth trying for your next meal.\nKeep a journal just for wine. The easiest way to keep track of the wines that you enjoy and the ones that you do not like is to keep a list of them. You can also include the foods that you drank them with so that you can repeat the experience if you like.\nRed and white wines are made from different grapes. To create red wine, the winemaker must use bold, strongly flavored purple grapes. White wines are made with green grapes, which are often much lighter and crisper. That\u2019s the basics between the two, but there are so many more differences.\nDon\u2019t just go for wines that are expensive or highly-rated. This can be a real temptation if you have a lot of disposable income, especially when once you did not. Rather, drink a lot of styles of wine so you can choose the ones you personally consider the best. Fill your cellar with these, regardless of price, label or popular opinion.\nA great tip you should remember about wine is to store it at the right temperature. A lot of people make the mistake of keeping their white wine too cold. This makes it painful to drink because it hurts your teeth. Red wine should be kept at about room temperature.\nWhen tasting wine, you should avoid distractions as much as possible. Keep in mind that the presence of a strong smell in the room might influence how you perceive the aroma of the wine you are tasting. The temperature of the room and of the bottle you are tasting will also influence your impressions.\nSearch for online information about different wines. Look for a wine discussion forum and read the comments until you feel confident enough to add your own ideas. If you are unfamiliar with international wines, this is a great place to find information. You can gain enough information to try a few wines you would not otherwise have considered.\nhttps://www.aikenstandard.com/lifestyle/whiskey-alley-offering-fun-bar-atmosphere-unique-menu-items-whiskeys/article_4c20e5f4-d62b-11e7-8b45-5b1704571c25.html makes senses to take all advice and reviews from wine \u201cexperts\u201d with a grain of salt. No expert in the world knows everything there is to know about wine, and the true experts will admit as much. Understand that a lot about the wine you choose will be personal preference.\nWine dates back thousands of years ago. Choosing the ideal wine can be tough, but you can do it with persistence and patience. Keep the information you\u2019ve learned here in mind during your next wine purchase, and it will be much easier.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:09.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ad54c92edb39e8c6f10185928d51142d02ce3bb3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8h7fMZ_93nh4MmlO3MqhpNH6lYHRJ5OXomT5VT6_Rm9nI3TZMtQ7zRbyWeA0gV2D8Tv_HPdC7UMr2KJlUg35ItH9DwZYPA4PTfROf9F9IzUaTWotCdgIQnL6mZc3MOYiOmpuLj18.DIJ96EzH6co8YA4Cnkc6h9qG0f6950iCv_XV8Q1HW1My", "site_full": "www.honestjohn.co.uk", "site": "honestjohn.co.uk", "site_section": "http://classics.honestjohn.co.uk/askhj/rss", "site_categories": ["buying_selling_cars", "vehicles"], "section_title": "Ask Honest John - Latest Questions", "title": "Can an insurer refuse to pay out following an accident because of an MoT advisory on brakes?", "title_full": "Can an insurer refuse to pay out following an accident because of an MoT advisory on brakes?", "published": "2017-12-05T20:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20125, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ad54c92edb39e8c6f10185928d51142d02ce3bb3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8h7fMZ_93nh4MmlO3MqhpNH6lYHRJ5OXomT5VT6_Rm9nI3TZMtQ7zRbyWeA0gV2D8Tv_HPdC7UMr2KJlUg35ItH9DwZYPA4PTfROf9F9IzUaTWotCdgIQnL6mZc3MOYiOmpuLj18.DIJ96EzH6co8YA4Cnkc6h9qG0f6950iCv_XV8Q1HW1My", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-05T20:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "Can an insurer refuse to pay out following an accident because of an MoT advisory on brakes?", "text": "Search the forum Ask Honest John Honest John \u00bb Ask Honest John \u00bb Can an insurer refuse to pay out following an accident because of an MoT advisory on brakes?   Can an insurer refuse to pay out following an accident because of an MoT advisory on brakes? The insurance company of a friend refuses to pay out. She went into the back of another car on the motorway because she was not paying attention and admits fault due to her carelessness. As she had not put right an MoT advisory on the brakes, the insurance company is refusing to pay out, potentially involving her in personal liability to the driver in front for whiplash. Although, he was walking about and inspecting the damage after the shunt. How should she proceed with her own insurance company to persuade them to pay out? She was comprehensively insured and had payed her premium. The car was an MoT pass. Presumably the insurers are acting unreasonably and she needs to seek redress. Asked on 5 December 2017 by Billson Answered by Tim Kelly Yes she needs to complain, and vigorously. Ask the insurer for the evidence they seek to rely on in court that shows the incident was a result of faulty brakes. The insurer cannot refuse to pay out for an unrelated issue. Ie, her brakes are either faulty or not. If her brakes are faulty, she is in the wrong. If they are not, the insurer has to pay. She does need to act quickly on this, as it can quickly spiral out of control.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tim kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "billson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:09.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d79d4a632a03425e39b018982e0b6d539221f3ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKz6uO0GmBObFBC52HNOq23UrsNPJDFkg6TZtrPG8ZbYeA--", "site_full": "pk.shafaqna.com", "site": "shafaqna.com", "site_section": "http://pakistan.shafaqna.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Pakistan News (News Reader) |", "title": "Karachi: Kidnapped boy, Abban, recovered", "title_full": "Karachi: Kidnapped boy, Abban, recovered", "published": "2017-12-07T10:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5727, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d79d4a632a03425e39b018982e0b6d539221f3ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKz6uO0GmBObFBC52HNOq23UrsNPJDFkg6TZtrPG8ZbYeA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "Karachi: Kidnapped boy, Abban, recovered", "text": "1 days ago Karachi: Kidnapped boy, Abban, recovered KARACHI: A five-year-old boy, Muhammad Abban, who was kidnapped on Wednesday in Karachi, has been recovered, Samaa reported.

December 7, 2017 at 11:10 am \nWhat are \u201cboss levels\u201d? I thought it was maybe 3 stars, but I\u2019ve gotten a few with no credit. Maybe finishing a city? I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ve got 3 out of 5 \u201cboss levels\u201d so far and I have no idea what I did to get them. December 7, 2017 at 12:56 pm \nI would *guess* it\u2019s the last level of each city (the one that doesn\u2019t unlock right away if you don\u2019t have enough stars), based on how \u201cboss\u201d is the general term in games like fighting and shooting games for the last, more-powerful-than-normal enemy to defeat at the end of each level in those kinds of games. It\u2019s kind of weird for them to use that kind of terminology here though. December 7, 2017 at 6:31 pm \nI just completed this badge and it is 5 of the last level in a city. The one with the Airplane Icon. You can redo the first Airplane level 5 times, or do any 5 Airplane levels to get the badge. December 7, 2017 at 3:32 pm \nwow, another game \u2026 I was just getting used to the Jewel Academy game \u2026 tried it and got to level 10, now come to see 3 new m/m badges for it \u2026.. and lo and behold \u2026 another game with 3 m/m badges \u2026. well \u2026 i have reached 105 m/m that i need to buy and play \u2026. \nwas down to 12 m/m that i was behind and now have what, 21 magic ones to get before the end of the month \u2026. well am glad I left the Tournament \u2026 hopefully will be having more time \u2026. \nall have a great weekend coming up \u2026. 45 degrees down here in the southermmost tipe of texas \u2026.
