The plant will have a total output of 28MW. The execution of the contract will take place until August 2019.   \nThe project for Areado plant includes the supply and installation of two similar units. The plant will have a total output of 18.6MW. Its commissioning is due to be completed in September 2019. \nOnce fully commissioned, both plants will power the local industry and about 165,000 households. \nAtiaia Energia S.A chose GE's horizontal S-Kaplan turbines because they are fully adapted to rivers with smaller falls and higher flows, while being compact and robust machines with low maintenance. \nThose contracts add to the previous successful collaborations between GE and Atiaia Energia S.A for Garganta da Jararaca, Canoa Quebrada, Buriti, Paranatinga and Porto das Pedras power plants. \nOnly 40% of the world's Small Hydropower potential is equipped. With over 25,000 km of rivers, 98 GW of installed hydropower capacity out of 151.7 GW of installed power, Brazil is one of the leading countries in terms of hydropower. In 2016, 203 MW of Small Hydropower were added. \nMauro Cruz, General Manager for GE Renewable Energy's Hydro business in Latin America, said, \"We are extremely proud and honored to have been chosen by Atiaia Energia S.A for those two Small Hydropower plants contracts. GE has launched a complete new range of Small Hydropower solutions which benefit from GE's unique experience in Large Hydropower and meet GE's highest standards of quality, reliability and flexibility.

Health Secretary Shona Robison told GPs at a special BMA conference that the move will ensure long term sustainability of GP practice. There are currently around 4,900 GPs in Scotland. Ms Robison also announced \u00a37.5 million in 2018-19 to recruit and retain GPs, particularly in rural areas. Support will be available for all 160 rural and remote practices, including \u2018golden hello\u2019 payments of \u00a310,000 to GPs taking up their first post in a rural practice and relocation packages of up to \u00a35,000. Ms Robison said: \u201cThe new GP contract, a historic joint agreement between the SNP Government and the BMA, will ensure that GPs are able to spend more time with patients and less time on bureaucracy. If accepted, it will help cut doctors\u2019 overall workload and make general practice an even more attractive career prospect. As multi-disciplinary teams are developed further within GP practices, our ambition is to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over ten years to ensure a sustainable service for the future.\u201d Added Kenneth Gibson MSP said \"The SNP Government\u2019s commitment to invest \u00a37.5 million, including expanding the remote and rural incentive scheme and relocation funds, will have a real impact going forward.

Combining Percepio\u2019s Tracealyzer tools to provide insight into real-time behaviors in RTOS-based (real-time operating system) embedded software, with UltraSoC\u2019s hardware-based universal monitoring and analytics platform, the partnership allows embedded development teams to achieve enhanced system performance, as well as significant benefits in predictability, power, security and safety \u2013 plus reduced time-to-market and system development costs. \nEmbedded software systems \u2013 which are at the heart of a variety of electronic products from lightweight IoT sensors to high-performance computing (HPC) platforms \u2013 are prone to sporadic errors that can be hard to spot and virtually impossible to predict or to prevent from reoccurring. At the same time, traditional chip design requires the use of debug tools to ensure the chip is ready for production. However, traditional hardware debug tools do nothing to spot nor to prevent changes or problems in the completed system in the field: these can significantly affect performance or power, impacting security and safety amongst other things. \nThrough this partnership, the Percepio and UltraSoC embedded debug tools are able to communicate and share essential information in real-time to ensure system-wide monitoring, effectively guaranteeing maximum performance and reliability. \n\u201cUltraSoC\u2019s universal semiconductor debug, monitoring and analytics platform is an ideal complement for our Tracealyzer visualizations,\u201d commented Johan Kraft, CEO and founder of Percepio. \u201cBy combining our tools and offering something the industry has never seen, there are significant opportunities available to both companies.\u201d \nUltraSoC CEO Rupert Baines added: \u201cI\u2019m excited to be able to address additional customer needs with Percepio\u2019s ground-breaking Tracealyzer tools. By having an out-of-the box offering that combines both software and hardware analytics that work perfectly together, the time-to-market and development cost savings we can both offer our customers will be significant.\u201d \nPercepio is widely used by designers using FreeRTOS, RTLinux and VxWorks, amongst other environments. UltraSoC\u2019s analytics IP is designed to be used across any hardware platform, providing semiconductor designers with embedded analytics and intelligence in hardware debug. Bringing these two toolsets together ensures system designers benefit from an integrated embedded analytics solution. Synchronizing Percepio\u2019s Tracealyzer with UltraSoC\u2019s IP modules gives system designers an unparalleled insight into their embedded hardware and software. \nPercepio\u2019s Tracealyzer embedded software debug tool offers unprecedented levels of insight into the run-time behavior of complex multi-threaded RTOS (Real Time Operating systems) or Linux-based software systems, allowing for improved development productivity, reduced time-to-market and better software quality. Tracealyzer is already used by companies with very demanding applications in industrial, robotics and drilling industries, amongst others. \nUltraSoC\u2019s embedded semiconductor IP simplifies development of such complex and powerful devices \u2013 even in heterogeneous multi-core systems. UltraSoC\u2019s embedded analytic features support developers of systems in a broad range of applications, such as: safety and security in the automotive industry, where the move towards autonomous vehicles is creating unprecedented change and risk; optimization in big data applications, from search to data centers; and cybersecurity, including for the Internet of Things. \nGraphic available to download, click here www.ultrasoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Per[...] Previous Article Curtiss-Wright Congratulates Sierra Nevada Corporation on a Successful Free Flight of Dream Chaser Spacecraft \nREUSABLE SPACECRAFT CONDUCTS SUCCESSFUL FREE-FLIGHT AT EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE Next Article Leti Integrates Hybrid III-V Silicon Lasers on 200mm Wafers Using Standard CMOS Process \nLeti, a research institute of CEA Tech, has integrated hybrid III-V silicon lasers on 200mm wafers using st...

According to Wayan, ASEAN needs to learn from South Korea to develop entrepreneurship. Moreover, Indonesia`s entrepreneurship ratio is still far from ideal, he said. Although Indonesia`s entrepreneurship ratio currently stands at 3.1 percent of its total population, it still has to catch up with Malaysia and Singapore whose entrepreneurship ratios reach 5.2 percent and 7 percent respectively, he said. \"South Korea serves as the best practice of how to develop entrepreneurs. Many startups are flourishing there,? he said. Meanwhile, special staff to the Minister of Cooperatives and Small and Medium Businesses, Hermawan Kartajaya said the presence of the human entrepreneurship center is expected to encourage entrepreneurship spirit in Indonesia. \"We hope this effort will increasingly encourage and develop entrepreneurship spirit in Indonesia and show that we are serious about the matter,? he said. Hermawan, who is also President of the International Council for Small Business (ICSB) said Indonesia will actively get involved in the development of human entrepreneurship along with other countries. By routinely participating in the development of human entrepreneurship, Indonesia will increasingly be serious about developing technology-based entrepreneurship which has a social imapct. Human entrepreneurship is a concept of entrepreneurship developed by Prof Ki-Chan Kim of South Korea, along with Indonesian team chaired by DR Jacky Mussry, dean of MarkPlus Institute.

The move was triggered after Indonesia`s success in taxation pay by Google company, the minister stated here on Wednesday. \"Google has paid (the tax). It is an improvement, which has led other parties want to learn from Indonesia on how Google can settle its taxation obligation. I will make an appointment with Thai minster, under a promise that the (Thai) minister will send the country`s personnel to Indonesia to learn how handle the OTT, so that Google can then pay the tax. I welcome them (Thai personnel) to deal with the joint effort,\" Rudiantara stated. It was reported that the Directorate General of Taxation of Ministry of Finance had ensured that the US-based information technology company, Google, had settled tax arrears for fiscal year 2015.

Just a few hours ago, Bitcoin surged above $13,000 and now, on notable volume, it has reached the stunning $14,000 level, up 20% today... The real surge began at 1715ET... For those keeping track, this is how long it has taken the cryptocurrency to cross the key psychological levels: $0000 - $1000: 1789 days $12,000-$13,000: 17 hours $13,000-$14,000: 4 hours As Bitcoin has soared, it appears traders have sold other cyrptocurrencies to chase it as Ether has dropped in sync... One of the regions in the world with the most active Bitcoin community is South Korea where so many Koreans have embraced bitcoin that the prime minister recently warned that cryptocurrencies might corrupt the nation\u2019s youth. # As Bloomberg reports, while neighboring Japan hosts more transactions by some measures, Korea punches far above its weight: In the 24-hour period through Wednesday evening in Seoul, about 21 percent of the world\u2019s bitcoin trades on fee-charging venues involved the Korean won, according to Coinmarketcap.com. The country accounts for about 1.9 percent of the world economy. As Korean policy makers grow increasingly worried that the mania has gone too far, the nation could become a focus for bitcoin traders around the world. Korea\u2019s top financial watchdog, which briefly roiled cryptocurrency markets with its ban on initial coin offerings in September, said this week that it has \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about overheated speculation and has formed a task force with other government bodies to increase supervision. While it\u2019s unclear what measures will emerge from Korea\u2019s cryptocurrency task force, the government seems intent on acting. The tax authority is considering a levy on cryptocurrency trading gains, Yonhap News reported on Tuesday, while Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon warned last month that cryptocurrencies could become gateways to pyramid schemes and other illicit activity if left unchecked. \u201cIf we let things continue, I feel some serious pathological phenomena could occur,\u201d Lee said. Bitcoin\u2019s stateless status appeals to some Koreans who\u2019ve grown wary of keeping their savings in a country that shares a border with Kim Jong Un\u2019s increasingly belligerent regime in North Korea, according to Kwak Keumjoo, professor of psychology at Seoul National University. \u201cPeople want to take comfort in something outside and beyond the country,\u201d Kwak said. Finally, we note that growth continues as Coinbase CEO today noted they currently have 220 customer service reps and will add 400 next year: \"it's very difficult to keep up with the user influx.\" As CoinTelegraph reports , since China, Russia, and a few others cracked down hard on Bitcoin, it has been relatively quiet on the regulations front as Bitcoin has continued to soar unbridled. However, the head scratching on how to regulate continues. The next fear, for Former Fortress Hedge Fund Manager Michael Novogratz, is that Bitcoin\u2019s continued rise and prominence in the mainstream media could reawaken the regulation beast. However, Novogratz still feels that Bitcoin is difficult to regulate and it will be hard for governments to make an impact immediately. Novogratz, who has been outspoken on Bitcoin for some time now, claiming it could be a bubble , but one to profit from has his concerns now. \"I've got concerns that if price movements go higher, we're going to get more regulation,\" Novogratz said. \u201cBut I think it's hard to shut down. I don't think that's a probability.\" \"One of the big risks out there right now is that prices are moving so fast that regulators are going to get nervous,\" he added. \"I could legitimately see Bitcoin go $13,000, $14,000, $20,000, $25,000 and see somebody balk.\" Novogratz adds : \"We're in a speculative frenzy. Period. Stop. How long can it go? Who knows,\" Novogratz said. \"What's interesting about this is it's global.\" Another reason that Bitcoin has hit such heights must also be attributed to it finding its identity. Many were scratching their heads as to what Bitcoin is, a currency or an asset, but recent changes have set it straight . \"Bitcoin is winning out as digital gold,\" Novogratz explained. \"I don't think it's going to be a currency. Nothing that volatile is going to be a currency\"....

But, instead of a real judicial reform, Ukrainian government does its best to put the judicial branch of government under an absolute control. The slogans of reform are trying to hide the dominance of the president and the executive power. Changes in procedural codes make judicial proceedings inaccessible to people. Related: Ministry of Justice implements project on informing of citizens on their rights \nFirst, the purpose of what the government is doing is changing the composition of the Supreme Court. For the first time in the history of Ukraine, all 120 judges of the highest judicial level were appointed personally by one person, based on a single criterion - loyalty. And although there are \"competitive principles\", in reality these people will receive direct instructions from President\u2019s Administration. \nSecondly, the trials are actually closed. The court will be able to restrict media access without any motivation, because the new Codes provide for the possibility to prohibit shooting if it \"interferes with justice\". How exactly \u2013 the mechanism is not explained. A huge layer of cases will now be considered without calling the parties. Related: US Department of Justice appealed court\u2019s decision on halting immigration order \nThirdly - there is a completely incomprehensible concept of \"experts in the field of law.\" Now any judge can invite an \"expert\" who will motivate the court decision. Why judge cannot be an expert in the field of law? There is a violation of the proceedings - some specialists who will help to make decisions appear. It generally brings associations with the Middle Ages, when the position of a judge was bought or provided for the origin - they were really given to the aid of experts, because they did not understand the law. And today this gives the judges the opportunity to step back from the decision and be motivated by the expert's opinion. Related: Ministry of Justice will return political prisoner Valentyn Vyhivsky who was condemned in Russia \nWell, finally, appeals to the court become more and more expensive. The judicial fee was already high enough - not every person can now afford paying $60 so easily to file an elementary lawsuit in court. And today any documents, any requests should be paid. This will lead to the fact that the courts will be available only to wealthy people. The access to cassation becomes 80% more expensive, almost all privileges for payment of court fees are abolished, additional payments are introduced. For example, if you are suing, you must pay an \"advance\" to recover the defendant's possible costs in case he wins. If you did not make such an advance, it means that you automatically lost the case. Related: New Supreme Court to begin work on December 15 \nIn my opinion, now the judicial branch of government, instead of moving to independence and being a mechanism for establishing justice in society, will remain in the same corrupt and dependent state as it was in the days of the past power.

This breakthrough shows the way to transitioning away from 100mm wafers and a process based on bulk III-V technology that requires contacts with noble metals and lift-off based patterning. \nThe project, carried out in the framework of the IRT Nanoelec program, which is headed by Leti, demonstrated that the hybrid device\u2019s performance is comparable to the reference device fabricated with the current process on 100mm wafers. The fabrication flow is fully planar and compatible with large-scale integration on silicon-photonic circuits. \nThe results were reported Dec. 5 at IEDM 2017 in a paper titled \u201cHybrid III-V/Si DFB Laser Integration on a 200mm Fully CMOS-compatible Silicon Photonics Platform\u201d. \nCMOS compatibility with silicon photonics lowers fabrication costs, and provides access to mature and large-scale facilities, which enables packaging compatibility with CMOS driving circuits. \n\u201cSilicon-photonic technologies are becoming more mature, but the main limitation of these platforms is the lack of an integrated light source,\u201d said Bertrand Szelag, a co-author of the paper. \u201cThis project showed that a laser can be integrated on a mature silicon-photonic platform with a modular approach that does not compromise baseline process performances. We demonstrated that the entire process can be done in a standard CMOS fabrication line with conventional process and materials, and that it is possible to integrate all the photonic building blocks at large scale.\u201d \nThe integration required managing a thick silicon film, typically 500nm thick, for the hybrid laser, and a thinner one, typically 300nm, for the baseline silicon-photonic platform. This required locally thickening the silicon by adding 200nm of amorphous silicon via a damascene process, which presents the advantage of leaving a flat surface favorable for bonding III-V silicon. The laser can be integrated on a mature silicon photonic platform with a modular approach that does not compromise the baseline process performance. \nThe novelty of the approach also included using innovative laser electrical contacts that do not contain any noble metals, such as gold. The contacts also prohibit integration lift-off-based processes. Nickel-based metallization was used with an integration technique similar to a CMOS transistor technique, in which tungsten plugs connect the device to the routing metal lines. \nNext steps include integrating the laser with active silicon-photonic devices, e.g. a modulator and photodiode with several interconnect metal levels in a planarized backend. Finally, III-V die bonding will replace III-V wafer bonding in order to process lasers on the entire silicon wafer.

They charged me for things in the minibar, which we have never used. There is a coffee machine in the room, never used, though, they have charged us too. I did not check the bill when I signed so I saw at home in Berlin. Bad practice!! 2. The room is \"fancy wannabe\" but they lack quality. The aircon does not work properly and because it is top floor, only windows, it got very cold at night. Ont op, the ventilation from the restaurant somehow passed near our room so the room smelled constantly of food. Big no no for us. The quality overall is just bad. Bed has 2 mattresses and they are badly connected and so hard that I have bruises on my right side. Curtains, not working properly, TV, a joke; bathroom was for me the worst. No privacy what so ever, very cold, the shower had hot or very hot as options and the shower sprayed everywhere, including under the door into the larger bath area. The breakfast is nothing special and the coffee machines don't work properly, I have never had a more bitter coffee in my life. No sugar would compensate. Staff, not so friendly, just bored. The one lady in reception was nice, but no communication, no interest in us as guests, no maps, guidance, nothing, just very transactional and cold. For the price paid, it was worth it I would say, though I would not go back there again. We found a few hotels in the same price range but we opted for this due to location.\n\ub207 We were lucky enough to have received one of the top floor rooms. They look just like in the picture. A big glass window separates the bed area to the bath area where we had a massive bathtub. A shower cabin and a toilet are also there, further separated by individual doors (plus the sink of course). It looks nice, but there is no privacy and if you turn on the light in there you wake up the other person, no question about it. We also had a balcony which I assume is handy in summer. The location is also nice, right in front of the hotel door you have the Metro entrance, but no nearby shops or good restaurants. More of a business area I would say. And the closest supermarket is around 15 mins walk and not easy to find.

Law exists to protect individuals and society as a whole by keeping order.\r\n2. Criminal law deals with wrongs committed against society.\r\n3. Individuals and society are linked because any wrong committed against an individual is a wrong\r\nagainst everyone.\r\n4. Civil law deals with wrongs committed against an individual.\r\n5. Criminal law does not help the individual victim, it is civil law that does that job.\r\n\r\n4.2 The Nature of Criminal Law -\r\n\r\n1. The Criminal Code is the main source of criminal law in Canada.\r\n2. Four conditions for an act to be considered a crime by The Law Reform Comission of Canada.\r\n3. Laws in the Criminal Code must represent what Canadians want.\r\n4. Government can satisfy different beliefs on what contitutes immoral behaviour by criminalizing,\r\ndecriminalizing, or legalizing specific types of behaviour.\r\n5. Canada defines fairness in the criminal justice system as procedural justice.\r\n\r\n4.3 The Power to Make Criminal Law -\r\n\r\n1. Criminal law is enacted by a democratically elected federal Parliament.\r\n2. The Supreme Court has a significant impact on criminal law in Canada.\r\n3. The Criminal Code restrictions must not infringe upon a citizen's legal rights defined in the \r\nCharter\r\n4. Canadian criminal law is public law.\r\n5. The Criminal Code is written and amended by the federal Parliament.\r\n\r\n4.4 Summary Conviction and Indictable Offences\r\n\r\n1. Less serious crimes are summary conviction offences and more serious crimes are indictable\r\noffences.\r\n2. Hybrid offences refer to offences that may be treated as either summary conviction or\r\nindictable offences, depending on the decision of the prosecutor.\r\n3. Maximum penalty for most summary conviction offences is a fine of $2000 and/or six months in jail\r\n4. There is no statute of limitations for laying a charge of an indictable offence.\r\n5. The Crown attorney decides the punishment of a hybrid offence\r\n\r\n4.5 The Elements of a Criminal Offence\r\n\r\n1. To find someone guilty of an offence, the Crown must prove that both actus reus and mens rea\r\nwere present.\r\n2.

Another breakthrough presents a high-density SRAM bitcell on Leti\u2019s CoolCubeTM 3D platform, which reduces the area required for memory by 30 percent, while maintaining full device functionality. This breakthrough points the way to easing the major memory bottleneck in more complex systems on chip (SoC), where up to 90 percent of the SoC area might be taken by SRAM. \nThe breakthroughs were reported Dec. 5 at IEDM 2017 in a paper titled \u201cAdvanced Memory Solutions for Emerging Circuits and Systems.\u201d \nA key obstacle to shrinking SRAM on SoCs is bitcell-area limitations linked to required performance and yield, both of which become more challenging as technology scales. Lowering system power consumption is also limited by memory, as the SRAM performance and its stability scale less successfully than logic performance at lower voltages. Other memories like CAM might be affected even more by voltage scaling. \n\u201cAll of these obstacles become particularly important for the Internet of Things, where ultralow-power consumption and the cost of individual nodes are crucial, and SRAM limitations have a big impact on both,\u201d said Bastien Giraud, one of the paper authors. \nLeti approached these challenges with a CoolCubeTM SRAM design focusing on the development of a compact and functional four-transistor bitcell, along with other innovations: o Reconfiguring memory between the CAM and SRAM, depending on the application \no Optimizing memory using TFET, focusing on the exploitation of its negative differential-resistance effect to build ultralow-power SRAM, Flip Flops (FF) and refresh-free Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) \no A new compensation technique for crosspoint memory that reduces the voltage drop and leads to larger memory arrays. \nLeti said its proposed CAM/SRAM outperforms state-of-the-art memories, with operations at 1.56GHz and 0.13fJ/bit energy per search. In addition, the proposed TFET designs are competitive in terms of area, performance and static power consumption. Leti\u2019s proposed compensation technique in crosspoint memory also enables the design of cost-efficient large memory arrays, while reducing the impact of temporal and spatial variations. \nShort-term applications include crossbar circuits for storage-class memory and flexible SOCs with SRAM/CAM re-configurability. \n\u201cIn the longer term, Leti\u2019s CoolCubeTM technology will be able to deliver very high-density SRAM,\u201d Giraud said. \u201cEnabling TFET-based DRAM and integrating TFET standard cells into CMOS designs will allow circuit designers to take advantage of the best features of both technologies.\u201d About Leti \nLeti, a technology research institute at CEA Tech, is a global leader in miniaturization technologies enabling smart, energy-efficient and secure solutions for industry.

Marheni stated that the coaches who passed would be candidates for coaches of the Indonesian contingent to the Asian Para Games 2018. \"Indonesia made a success in the ASEAN Para Games 2017 in Malaysia last August. We hope the Indonesian contingent will be able to make an optimal achievement in the Asian Para Games, where competition will certainly be harder,\" she remarked. NOC representative Sapta Kunta Purnama noted that the coaches to train athletes with disability have strategic roles to play in leading the Indonesian contingent towards better achievements than in the Asian Para Games 2014 in South Korea, where Indonesia was only able to collect nine gold medals. \"We hope Indonesia will be able to collect 19 to 20 gold medals in the Asian Para Games 2018,\" he noted. The chief executive of the national training program to coach athletes with disability, Yayan Tubaeni, explained that 50 coaches from 21 provinces have joined the training program. \"They are selected by their respective regions and have been in charge of assisting the athletes to achieve success,\" he concluded.

Above, a car speeds past the flames in Ventura, Calif. prev next comments John and Linda Keasler were counting their blessings last night, less than 24 hours after they watched helplessly as a \u201craging wall of fire\u201d consumed their downtown Ventura, Calif., apartment building and all of their belongings.\nJohn, 65, and Linda, 55, said it only took a few hours for a pinkish glow on the horizon to transform into a cascading inferno that decimated much of their coastal community and forced thousands of neighbors to abandon their homes.\nFrom the safety of their son\u2019s family home in Santa Barbara, Linda Keasler told the Herald\u2019s Owen Boss about the irreplaceable items she wished she had taken with her and how thankful she is that she and her husband escaped before the wind-swept blaze arrived at their front door:\nI woke up to a very loud boom and noticed the power was out, so I woke my husband up and I said, \u2018We have to get out, something is going on.\u2019\nOur apartment overlooked the coast, we had a beautiful, million-dollar view of the coastline and the city of Ventura, and when we went out onto the balcony to see what was happening, everything was black. There were no lights.\nThen, when I looked out the other window, I said, \u2018Oh my God. We need to leave right now.\u2019 When I looked out the back window, the whole sky was pink. I didn\u2019t think the fire was imminent but I knew that we had to leave immediately. So we grabbed an envelope with all of our important papers in it and we left.\nWe hadn\u2019t heard the news reports ahead of time, so we thought we\u2019d just be looky-loos. ... We got in the car and we drove around town and that\u2019s when it hit us.\nIt was unbelievable. It was hard to grasp. There was a raging wall of fire on our hillside.\nWe went to Thousand Oaks but couldn\u2019t find a hotel room because they were all filled up. Then, when my husband called our apartment manager, he told us, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, but your apartment is in flames.\u2019 So we drove back to Ventura and videotaped our apartment building in flames.\nWe couldn\u2019t believe it, we were like, \u2018Oh my God, is this really happening?\u2019 There was absolutely nothing we could do.\nWe lost everything. ... The thing I regret the most are the photos of my family. ... That was the irreplaceable item for us.\nBut I\u2019m so grateful. We went to the shelter and there weren\u2019t any cots and now here we are, spending time with our new grandbaby.\nAll of those things that we lost, they\u2019re replaceable. Even, really, the photos, because I still have them in my memory.\nI\u2019m just living in the present. I\u2019m by my husband, we\u2019re with our family, and we have all the necessary items and thank God we\u2019re both OK.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "getty imag", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "berger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "owen boss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linda keasler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linda", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap a los angeles county fire department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap smoky scene", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bel air", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saxon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "highway 101", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bel-air", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa barbara", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:53:06.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "12d94b9397470822cafe08b0693ca14e754d15de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRzlB.3lY..G7UaluR_p7DYryiLI_WTh.lZPNFlAALltwD0VqYhTKiLfvFYGv2HjN479fVRXXlVdEt8yhrKnqWbkQklhjxZ.ww-", "site_full": "forums.opera.com", "site": "opera.com", "site_section": "https://forums.opera.com/category/5/opera-for-computers", "site_categories": ["bodybuilding", "sports"], "section_title": "Opera for computers | Opera forums", "title": "made no changes, but gif stopped working", "title_full": "made no changes, but gif stopped working | Opera forums", "published": "2017-12-07T15:23:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "EU", "spam_score": 0.037, "main_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f848f9c185d4bf610d6221323143d59c?size=192&d=mm", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3197, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "12d94b9397470822cafe08b0693ca14e754d15de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRzlB.3lY..G7UaluR_p7DYryiLI_WTh.lZPNFlAALltwD0VqYhTKiLfvFYGv2HjN479fVRXXlVdEt8yhrKnqWbkQklhjxZ.ww-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "catmcfarlane", "published": "2017-12-07T15:23:00.000+02:00", "title": "made no changes, but gif stopped working", "text": "Unfortunately, gif avatar has stopped working ... of 17 images within the 6kb 0-setting gif, only 3 now show, then it goes blank.

This probably won't change too, but if I had to do it again I would ask management to see the room first and then view the shower to determine if I wanted that room. There are not enough power outlets for the guests without unplugging everything else. Extension cords could solve this issue. Finally, the space in the refrigerator could be balanced so that the guest could also use the refrigerator without emptying its contents (snacks, over priced alcohol, soft drinks etc).\n\ub207 Excellent location as the hotel is situated next to one of the exits of the subway. Good shower pressure. Rooms were a bit small though as a large double bed took up most of the space in the room. Perhaps twin size beds would be ideal for you. I stayed in two different rooms. One room was clearly and upgrade as it had a coffee maker, jacuuzzi bath and huge windows the size of the room. Pay the extra, get that. Breakfast, excellent though 2 things I think can be improved. 1. Salad greens. It would not be much to add some salad greens to the already lovely breakfast-- just some nice raw vegetables as an option. 2.

Hours later, another woman said Franken inappropriately squeezed \"a handful of flesh\" on her waist while posing for a photo with her in 2009. That brought the number of women alleging misconduct by Franken to at least eight. \nFranken, the former comedian who made his name on \"Saturday Night Live,\" faces a chorus of calls to step aside, and Democratic senators said they expected their liberal colleague to resign. \n\"Enough is enough,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. \"We need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is OK, none of it is acceptable, and we, as elected leaders, should absolutely be held to a higher standard.\" \nGillibrand was the first to call for Franken's resignation on Wednesday, but a torrent of Democrats quickly followed. \n\"I'm shocked and appalled by Sen. Franken's behavior,\" said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state. \"It's clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time. It's time for him to step aside.\" \nThough the writing appeared to be on the wall, Franken's departure was not certain. A tweet posted Wednesday evening on Franken's Twitter account said: \"Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate.\" \nLate in the day, Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York added his voice. \n\"I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately,\" Schumer said. \nThe resignation demands came in rapid succession even though Franken on Wednesday vehemently denied the new accusation that came from a former Democratic congressional aide, who said he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006. \nThe woman, who was not identified, told Politico that Franken pursued her after her boss had left and she was collecting her belongings. She said that she ducked to avoid his lips and that Franken told her: \"It's my right as an entertainer.\" \nFranken, in a statement, said the idea he would claim such conduct as a right was \"preposterous.\" \nBut it was soon clear that his position had become untenable. \nFellow Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who spoke to Franken, wrote on Twitter, \"I am confident he will make the right decision.\" \nThe pressure only mounted Tuesday, when Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., resigned after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. Rep Ruben Kihuen, D-Nev., faces pressure to resign as well over allegations reported by Buzzfeed that he repeatedly propositioned a former campaign worker. \nWhile Franken apparently is departing, Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore could be arriving, if he prevails in a Dec. 12 special election. Multiple women have accused the 70-year-old Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were teens and he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s. If Moore is elected, it could create a political nightmare for Republicans, who have promised an ethics probe. \nA national conversation about sexual harassment has intensified this fall after the heavily publicized case of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of many acts of sexual misconduct, including rape, by actresses and other women. Just on Wednesday, Time magazine named as its person of the year the \"silence breakers\" - women who have come forward on sexual harassment. \nPunishment has been swift for leaders in entertainment, media and sports while members of Congress have tried to survive the onslaught of allegations. \nFranken already faced a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into previous claims by several other women that he groped them or sought to forcibly kiss them. \nThe allegations began in mid-November when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan. \nOther allegations followed, including a woman who says Franken put his hand on her buttocks as they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Two women told the Huffington Post that Franken squeezed their buttocks at political events during his first campaign for the Senate in 2008. A fourth woman, an Army veteran, alleged Franken cupped her breast during a photo on a USO tour in 2003. \nFranken has apologized for his behavior but has also disputed some of the allegations. \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Juliet Linderman in Washington and Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Alabama, contributed to this report.

In the past they messaged her pretending to give a shit by claiming they believe I'm having a nervous breakdown. Apparently, they don't realize my wife watches damn near everything I make on my blog and past videos. Of course, when they're not pretending to care they will also say sexually harassing things to her. The kind of shit that is illegal and worthy of jail time. Proving once again that Atheists don't think they're accountable to anyone including God or the law of the land.\n\nThe truth is I'm very happy. I have issues with siblings and disagreements with friends from time to time but usually, I work things out or take a breather from people. If you're the perfect person and just can't identify with this then good for you. 9 times out of 10 you're either a liar or mentally ill if you actually believe you've never had these kinds of issues.\n\nNow that I'm not producing video's I'm extremely happy. I have not retired from reporting people and having youtube channels removed. Now that I no longer deal with trolls or ideas for video's and the development I'm able to thoroughly investigate the losers of youtube and copy and paste reports on them and get great joy from watching fuckers cry when they lose it all due to being useless pricks. My advice is to put thought into your video's and not use the service and social media to harass people and I will never bother you.\n\nI will not be returning to youtube but I will continue with my site. I still watch video's and keep up to date on how users are getting fucked over by Google. Youtube seems to be going full-on Hulu Netflix and there will be no reason for most of the filth to exist on youtube any longer. I'm pleased with this.\n\nEveryone knows I have depression. I'm one of the people in this world that sees's how stupid shit is and how simple it would be to resolve most of our problems globally. But humanity doesn't care unless they get paid and even then they do nothing.\n\nI've also enjoyed watching Hollywood and the sex predators of social media and politicians get destroyed. I spoke out against abuse for years. But like usual no one gave a shit until now.\n\nAs a footnote, I have allowed myself to be interviewed by people. If anyone messages me and claims to be of DP and want my side or my experiences my answer will be go fuck yourself. I don't give a shit about what you're wondering. I don't give a shit about you playing Dick Tracy. I don't need to prove anything to a loser like yourself. In the end, I will most likely be a better person than you will ever be. If you enjoy watching men put fruit up their ass then you're dead to me anyway. The only way to get me to discuss drama with you is you go to the bank and get me some money providing you have a job.\n\nYoutube was nothing more than 10 minutes of my life a day unless I wasted time talking to assholes.\n\nI've been pushing myself to deal with my depression and agoraphobia.
