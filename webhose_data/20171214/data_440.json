By: PTI | Washington | Published: December 7, 2017 2:33 PM Researchers identified candidates out of the hundreds of millions of objects WISE found that would be worthy of follow-up with Magellan. (IE) \nScientists have discovered the farthest known supermassive black hole \u2013 a matter-eating beast that is 800 million times the mass of our Sun. Astronomers combined data from NASA\u2019s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) with ground-based surveys to identify potential distant objects to study, then followed up with Carnegie Observatories\u2019 Magellan telescopes in Chile. Researchers identified candidates out of the hundreds of millions of objects WISE found that would be worthy of follow-up with Magellan. \u201cThis black hole grew far larger than we expected in only 690 million years after the Big Bang, which challenges our theories about how black holes form,\u201d said Daniel Stern of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the US. For black holes to become so large in the early universe, astronomers speculate there must have been special conditions to allow rapid growth \u2013 but the underlying reason remains mysterious. The newly found black hole is voraciously devouring material at the centre of a galaxy \u2013 a phenomenon called a quasar. \nThis quasar is especially interesting because it comes from a time when the universe was just beginning to emerge from its dark ages. The discovery will provide fundamental information about the universe when it was only 5 percent of its current age. \u201cQuasars are among the brightest and most distant known celestial objects and are crucial to understanding the early universe,\u201d said Bram Venemans of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany. The universe began in a hot soup of particles that rapidly spread apart in a period called inflation. About 400,000 years after the Big Bang, these particles cooled and coalesced into neutral hydrogen gas. However, the universe stayed dark, without any luminous sources, until gravity condensed matter into the first stars and galaxies. \nThe energy released by these ancient galaxies caused the neutral hydrogen to get excited and ionise, or lose an electron. The gas has remained in that state since that time. Once the universe became re-ionised, photons could travel freely throughout space. This is the point at which the universe became transparent to light. Much of the hydrogen surrounding the newly discovered quasar is neutral. That means the quasar is not only the most distant \u2013 it is also the only example we have that can be seen before the universe became re-ionised. \u201cIt was the universe\u2019s last major transition and one of the current frontiers of astrophysics,\u201d said Eduardo Banados, astronomer at Carnegie Observatories in the US.

Delhi | Press Trust of India | Updated: December 07, 2017 15:08 IST Share PRINT COMMENTS A Delhi man strangled his live-in partner as she used to pressure him to divorce his wife and marry her New Delhi: A Delhi court has sentenced a min to life imprisonment for killing and then burning the remains of his live-in partner in 2012.Additional Sessions judge Sanjeev Aggarwal jailed north Delhi resident Umakant while relying on circumstantial evidence and sent his accomplice Sumit to rigorous imprisonment for a period of four years.\"The circumstances cumulatively establish and support the hypothesis, that it was Accused 1 (Umakant) but none else who had committed murder of deceased Rachna by strangled her and thereafter burning her dead body consequent to her death, in which he was actively aided, abetted and helped by Accused 2 (Sumit),\" the judge said.The court also imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on Umakant.According to the prosecution, Umakant had rented out an apartment in Delhi's Rohini where he was living with the woman as a married couple. On June 19, 2012, a neighbour saw the convicts dragging a bag from the apartment, from which blood was oozing out, and putting it into a car, the prosecution said.It said the neighbours alerted the police and Umakant and his accomplice were apprehended later that night. The prosecution claimed that he had strangled her as she used to pressurise him to divorce his wife and marry her.Umakant had claimed innocence and said he was falsely implicated in the case while his accomplice Sumit denied having even met the convict or the victim.However, both the convicts failed to adduce any evidence to their claim, the court noted.\"The defence version which is supported by no tangible or intangible evidence, does not in any way dilute or scale down the probative force of the overwhelming nature of prosecution evidence which is almost touching the point of certainty,\" the court said while convicting them.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rohini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rachna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanjeev aggarwal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sumit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umakant", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "delhi | press trust of india", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:46.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cae5c7f10eae33fdee2c8171035ab3d0ad4c55b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRT8mhACjDa0deHb5AlvQ76fcYAla6zteImnL2LC2BHcDo18mIkjfrrofZGUIjBONUn3FnL9YaqPfeHX6owP4zR9RQtuAbbFyOYGZKplJnahrROriZyg6CJDmeGNiggQys-", "site_full": "www.ndtv.com", "site": "ndtv.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/NDTV-LatestNews", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NDTV News  -  Special", "title": "Samsung India To Hire 1,000 Engineering Graduates In 2018", "title_full": "Samsung India To Hire 1,000 Engineering Graduates In 2018", "published": "2017-12-07T11:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2017-11/job_650x400_41511849999.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 306, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 99, "comments": 0, "shares": 99}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cae5c7f10eae33fdee2c8171035ab3d0ad4c55b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRT8mhACjDa0deHb5AlvQ76fcYAla6zteImnL2LC2BHcDo18mIkjfrrofZGUIjBONUn3FnL9YaqPfeHX6owP4zR9RQtuAbbFyOYGZKplJnahrROriZyg6CJDmeGNiggQys-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "Samsung India To Hire 1,000 Engineering Graduates In 2018", "text": "COMMENTS Samsung India will hire over 300 engineering graduates from various IITs New Delhi: Here is an important update for the tech job seekers in India.

World | Indo-Asian News Service | Updated: December 07, 2017 15:08 IST Share COMMENTS Nepalese voters will directly elect 165 national lawmakers. (AFP) Kathmandu: Millions of people across 45 districts in Nepal on Thursday voted in the final phase of the general elections that will send representatives to the country's first bicameral legislature following the approval of the 2015 Constitution.The polls, that will elect members of the national and provincial assemblies to end almost two decades of an interim government, opened at 7 am and will conclude at 5 pm.\"The elections are taking place in a peaceful manner across the country except for some stray incidents,\" Election Commission spokesperson Nabaraj Dhakal told Efe news.Two homemade bombs had exploded in Kathmandu's Manamaiju area and in Dharan, located some 400 km to the east of the capital, but did not cause any damage to life or property, he added.By 10 a.m., around 20 per cent of the 12.2 million people who were eligible to vote had cast their votes, Sudhir Shah, one of the five election commissioners, told Efe.\"We want stability so that the country can move toward prosperity. I hope this election gives us a stable government,\" Yadav Dhakal, a 67-year-old retired teacher, said after casting his vote.Nepal has a total of 15.4 million registered voters, out of which more than 3 million had voted in the first phase of the elections that were held on November 26 across 32 districts in the northern part of the country.With a total of 25 governments in the last 27 years, three of them in the last two years, Nepal has been steeped in grave political instability for long.In these elections, Nepalese voters will directly elect 165 national lawmakers while another 110 members of the lower house will be elected through the party-list proportional representation system, which takes into account the total number of votes secured by the parties.Similarly, 330 members of the seven provincial assemblies will be elected directly while another 220 members will be elected through the same party-list proportional representation system.Counting will begin after voting concludes, with results expected to be announced next week.

Kids symbolize spontaneity and freshness, and a posed look is the exact opposite. It is very difficult to direct anyone, especially a kid, not to look directed and look spontaneous.\nPerhaps a combination of some of the following may help:\n1. Establish a rapport with the kid being photographed so that he/she feels comfortable enough to ignore you and not look posed. This will take some time.\n2. Arrange for some unrehearsed distractions (e.g. a kitty walking in, the sound of the ice-cream truck outside, etc.), so as to get the kid to forget about you for a moment and pay attention to something much more fun (kitty, ice cream truck, whatever).\n3. Have the kid wear casual comfy clothes; wearing his Sunday-best is a guaranteed way to get the undesirable posed look.\n4. Take many photos in the hope that one of them may catch that fleeting expression that is endearing.\n5.

(AP) \u2014 The mayor of Kentucky\u2019s second-largest city is running for Congress. \nJim Gray announced Tuesday he will seek the Democratic nomination in Kentucky\u2019s 6th Congressional District. Republican Andy Barr has held the seat since 2013. \nGray will face at least three other people for the Democratic nomination: former fighter pilot Amy McGrath, state Sen.

Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio, left, and Keith Gregg, the county's Chief Information Technology Officer, right, speak at a press conference Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, at the Government Center about t... \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

In this Nov. 21, 2017 photo provided by the Montefiore Health System, Dr. Tova Koenigsberg at The Montefiore Einstein Center for Cancer Care in New York shows an example of a traditional mammogram scan. U.S. health of... \nBy LAURAN NEERGAARDAP Medical Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens. \n___ \nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.
