Class 6A will be made up of schools with enrollments of 2,190 and above, and Waco High submitted an average daily enrollment snapshot number of 2,195 to the UIL in October. \n\u201cYou hear a lot of rumors on where the cutoff will be, but you never know,\u201d Waco ISD athletic director Johnny Tusa said Wednesday. \u201cObviously we were hoping to be one of the larger schools in 5A rather than one of the smallest in 6A. If you had your pick, you\u2019d rather be on the top of the pecking order.\u201d \nThis will mark Waco High\u2019s first return to the state\u2019s largest classification since 2005. \nThe UIL will release its biennial realignment and reclassification on Feb. 1, 2018, shifting schools into the athletic districts that they\u2019ll compete in for the next two years. But the organization released the cutoff numbers on Wednesday in order to \u201cincrease transparency and provide for additional verification of enrollment figures.\u201d \nOn the surface, Waco High\u2019s jump to Class 6A would seemingly reunite the Lions with the Killeen ISD schools, Copperas Cove, Temple (which will also make the jump from 5A), Belton and Midway. However, that group consists of nine schools in all, and the UIL prefers to cap districts at eight. \n\u201cIt\u2019s just speculation, but there is the possibility of one the schools on the south end (like Belton) moving down to a district with the Round Rock, Pflugerville and Leander schools,\u201d Tusa said. \u201cOf course, we\u2019re on the northernmost end of that group. So we could end up with some schools in the Metroplex, going up toward Dallas or Fort Worth. You can speculate, but you won\u2019t know until Feb. 1.\u201d \nWaco High\u2019s crosstown brother University will remain in Class 5A for all sports, and in 5A Division II for football. Asked if the Lions and Trojans would still meet on the football field as a nondistrict game, Tusa said, \u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019ll discuss.\u201d \nLike Waco High, University could venture in a variety of directions when the UIL creates its districts. Schools like Ennis and Corsicana are also in Class 5A Division II, so the Trojans could go north. Currently, University and Waco High are linked with a variety of schools in the Bryan-College Station area, and A&M Consolidated and Bryan Rudder are also in 5A Division II for the next realignment. \nThe majority of Central Texas schools will stay put in their current classification, based on Wednesday\u2019s numbers. Besides Waco High and Temple, schools that will be on the move include Bruceville-Eddy (from Class 3A to 2A), Marlin (3A to 2A) and Hamilton (rising from 2A to 3A). #TribFridayPhotos: Tag your Friday night pics on Instagram, Twitter \nSome schools will shift to different football divisions within their classification, like Mart (157 students), which will go from 2A Division I to 2A Division II. That means Mart will not be in a football district with schools like Bosqueville, Riesel or Crawford, but more likely with Bremond, Chilton and Hubbard. \nAmong six-man schools, Bynum (54 students) and Kopperl (49) will both shift from 1A Division I to 1A Division II, which has an enrollment of 55 students and under. \nIt makes sense that schools would rather be one of the bigger fish in a smaller pond than vice versa.

Kennedy Jr. Assassination by the Bush Family", "text": "\n\nJFK, Jr.'s death was not an airplane accident, but an assassination, and that George W. Bush was the key perpetrator, securing his seat in a global conspiracy that keeps Big Oil in power. \nJFK Jr. was a rising star with political conscience, likely to win the presidency eventually. A mind-controlled co-pilot was on board with him on July 16, 1999. After JFK Jr. checked in with the Martha's vineyard airport, the co-pilot forced the controls to point the plain straight downward. He then turned to fuel switch off to prevent a pull out of the dive. As the plane hit, its emergency beacon immediately broadcast the exact location of the crash. All of this was covered up by Bush and company (with complicity of many within the shadow government) who were monitoring the entire affair, and running damage control with the media, to make sure their version of the story is what got out, not the truth. With this murder on his hands, Bush then had the nod of the shadow mob who financed him into office, and who still control him. \nJFK Jr. was a serious potential political contender, who spoke out about conspiracy, and helped expose it. \nHe supported Oliver Stone's account of his father's assassination. \nHe published an article that stated that the assassination of Rabin could not have happened if the government had done it's protective job, strongly indicating government complicity. \nThe Pentagon took up the role of being the central clearing house of information. What they told the media is proven to be full of lies. \nThe official report said no flight book was found. However, those who frequently flew with JFK Jr. said he routinely kept the flight book in a blue duffle bag. The bag was recovered in tact, washed ashore, but no flight book was in it -- indicating that it had been intercepted prior to coming ashore. \nThe official report said that JFK Jr. had no flight instructor with him on that flight, but a myriad of evidence says otherwise, including the fact that the co-pilot's seat was missing from the retrieved wreckage. \nThe Search and Rescue operation was delayed 15 hours -- enough time for covert agents to recover the body of the flight instructor and all necessary evidence to enable them to twist the account. \nWreckage from the plane washed up on the beach in front of JFK's widow's estate, where a wedding JFK Jr. was headed to was to take place. \nJFK Jr. checked in with the Martha's Vineyard airport just before the plane went down. The Pentagon said no such check-in was made. \nThe wrecked plane had the fuel switch turned off -- something that requires intent, and cannot be done by accident. \nThe nose-dive plunge into the ocean was mirrored 50 miles away by a downed jetliner not long afterwards. \nGeorge W. Bush's whereabouts on July 16, 1999 are unaccounted for. None of his aids or acquaintances knew where he was. He has no alibi. \nFollowing a loss in the New Hampshire Primary, loads of funding came into Bush's campaign, eventually resulting in his ascension to the presidency. The video alleges that Bush's overseeing the murder of JFK Jr. is what won him the support of the insider mob, who then financed his campaign. \n\n\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "george w. bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bush family   jfk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john f. kennedy jr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oliver stone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jfk jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rabin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jfk", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new hampshire primary", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "martha's vineyard", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:35.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd9c27f13d4d4e9111066423839585cc7b5a28a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvaeUiGi7ecYy7NOBYBVoXu8NM6KdU..nhlW_OZjN5mpSTAVRbx0pzp6yahpRmJEAMbbKALSB2D5njAiwJy0IGl", "site_full": "miami.backpage.com", "site": "backpage.com", "site_section": "http://miami.backpage.com/online/exports/Rss.xml?section=4383", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "apartments", "sailing", "sports"], "section_title": "backpage.com | dating | miami, florida", "title": "(786) 868-7708", "title_full": "(786) 868-7708", "published": "2017-12-07T07:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 949, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4, "comments": 0, "shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dd9c27f13d4d4e9111066423839585cc7b5a28a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvaeUiGi7ecYy7NOBYBVoXu8NM6KdU..nhlW_OZjN5mpSTAVRbx0pzp6yahpRmJEAMbbKALSB2D5njAiwJy0IGl", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T07:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "(786) 868-7708", "text": "The requested ad could not be found.

Sookdeo, through his attorneys Larry Lalla and Sarfraz Alsaran, is contending that the police, who accompanied the bailiff, were negligent in their duties as they \u201clegitimised\u201d the unlawful demolition. \nAccording to the evidence in Sookdeo\u2019s case, at about 8 am a bailiff and a group of police came to his home at Deena Trace and told him they were there to evict him and his family. Even as he produced his deed for the property, which had been in his family since 1921, the men, who did not produce any court order, bulldozed the two-storey house and put up a fence around the one-acre property, which was valued at over $3 million. When Sookdeo\u2019s attorneys did a search in the land registry they found three false deeds had been attached to documents relating to the ownership of the property. Sookdeo, in a separate lawsuit, was able to have the false deeds removed from the registry. \n\u201cWithin recent times the courts have seen many applications to set aside false deeds,\u201d Lalla said, adding that land theft was very real in TT. \u201cThe police must be careful not to be used by criminal elements who are actors hiding in the shadows.\u201d \nAs he urged Harris to find the State liable for the police\u2019s actions, Lalla also asked for his client to be awarded compensation for trespass and negligence, including aggravated damages of almost $900,000. \nIn her reply, state attorney Monica Smith said Sookdeo\u2019s claim was an abuse of process, since he should have gone after those who presented the fake deed, or the bailiff. \nShe also pointed out that in his other lawsuit, Sookdeo had not been awarded compensation for trespass. Smith said under the Police Service Act, one of the duties of a police officer was to preserve the peace, and that was exactly what they were doing that day. \nWhile admitting that the police had a duty to satisfy themselves that the documentation presented to them to carry out the demolition was legal, Smith said the police who were at the house were on extra duty, acting on instructions from a senior officer. She also said there was no evidence they trespassed on the property, but were only there to keep the peace. \n\u201cAnd they did so,\u201d she said. 7 Hrs Ago ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lalla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarfraz alsaran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larry lalla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david harris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monica smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sookdeo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deonarine sookdeo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tobago newsday jada loutoo land", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "deena trace", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "trinidad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st augustine", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:36.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c06627622fb8fc6f06f908e210d2e683a6acdbfc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU46RXCtAcM6LmPbP9kyp1oRXX_68B7p.U7WaBnypXCfGdX1JOaN6plO882XBztQjoByUut7fQO0Tdhs14a249Dy6", "site_full": "lonestarboars.com", "site": "lonestarboars.com", "site_section": "http://lonestarboars.com/forums/for-sale-hunting.13/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "FOR SALE - Hunting | Lone Star Boars", "title": "Armasight Zeus 336 5-20 X75MM", "title_full": "Armasight Zeus 336 5-20 X75MM | Lone Star Boars", "published": "2017-12-06T19:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fe9c0116ace4d25de3e7a08da98aafe17d43db3b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU46RXCtAcM6LmPbP9kyp1oRXX_68B7p.U7WaBnypXCfGdX1JOaN6plO882XBztQjoByUut7fQO0TdsL.vlBARavWTINZMnazzGU-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Mrnaildriver", "published": "2017-12-06T19:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Email me at mrnaildriver @ yahoo.com I'll try and hagle with you on it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:36.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8e8ea7bae6c8c8776463821c98a0d8fcf49c253b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg89oFxZ.XV8iayU4WOunVN9Y7mBYeOegNVEAJe2eoIOyDpIVJ0MWdr8.sX6Qt81Mpi4YnyPuuy9VbtiWMra.QYLsF9cjwBI_F.MyWM85Q.QbjThJPez_tgrq.F10B0g8fTYPcF6rgs7QMXAU7D9vmaeTTTGnlBydk8a6gQd7CV_xwil9xzyYyv6bZ6JedFQrTNwYt4xq.CTHK3AOw96RriLx0uj7cpHzBA-", "site_full": "www.wacotrib.com", "site": "wacotrib.com", "site_section": "http://www.wacotrib.com//search/?q=&t=article&l=100&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=sports,sports/*&f=rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "www.wacotrib.com - RSS Results in sports,sports/* of type article", "title": "Crawford, Mart meet Thursday for a trip to state semis", "title_full": "Crawford, Mart meet Thursday for a trip to state semis", "published": "2017-12-07T06:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/wacotrib.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/f9/cf999513-5b9f-5046-b339-b68b0c7d5000/5a28cbb4b5f91.image.jpg?resize=1051%2C630", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8e8ea7bae6c8c8776463821c98a0d8fcf49c253b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg89oFxZ.XV8iayU4WOunVN9Y7mBYeOegNVEAJe2eoIOyDpIVJ0MWdr8.sX6Qt81Mpi4YnyPuuy9VbtiWMra.QYLsF9cjwBI_F.MyWM85Q.QbjThJPez_tgrq.F10B0g8fTYPcF6rgs7QMXAU7D9vmaeTTTGnlBydk8a6gQd7CV_xwil9xzyYyv6bZ6JedFQrTNwYt4xq.CTHK3AOw96RriLx0uj7cpHzBA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "KRISTA PIRTLE krista.pirtle@wacotrib.com", "published": "2017-12-07T06:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Crawford, Mart meet Thursday for a trip to state semis", "text": "Save \nMart didn\u2019t wipe the slate clean. After the Panthers\u2019 season ended in the third round of the playoffs last year , at the hands of Crawford no less, Kevin Hoffman hasn\u2019t let his players forget it. \nMart tied the Pirates early in the fourth quarter, but Crawford answered with a 13-yard touchdown pass from Gage Pearson to Cade Johnson with a little under nine minutes left in the game. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about the loss last year since last year,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cThey knocked us out of the playoffs last year. We talked about it day one of two-a-days. We talked about it when we got in the playoffs. We talked about it this week. We\u2019re going to keep it in the back of our minds. They\u2019re the ones that got us. We don\u2019t want that to happen again.\u201d \nMart will try its best to keep history from repeating itself as the Panthers take on Crawford in the state quarterfinals at 7:30 p.m. Thursday at Waco ISD Stadium. \nIt\u2019s not just Hoffman and the Panthers who haven\u2019t forgotten what happened at Waco ISD Stadium a little over a year ago. Delbert Kelm remembers it, too. \n\u201cIt was a very, very, very tough and physical football game on both sides between two very good football teams,\u201d the Crawford head coach said. \u201cWe made a play or two more than they did. That was the difference in the game. It could have gone either way.\u201d \nWith the win over Mart, Crawford advanced to the state championship game where the Pirates fell, 23-20, to Refugio. It was tied with less than a minute to play before the Bobcat kicker nailed an 18-yard field goal with eight seconds left to secure the win for Refugio. \n\u201cWell, we always tell our team that last year\u2019s success can only take you as far as you allow it to take you,\u201d Kelm said. \u201cWe certainly have a different team this year that we had last year. Anytime you make a deep playoff run, it gives you a lot of extra practices. But if you don\u2019t do what you need to do to let that help you, it\u2019s immaterial. I think it allowed a lot of our young guys to get reps.\u201d \nFor all the hype surrounding this rivalry match-up, there isn\u2019t much history to it. According to lonestarfootball.net , the two teams have faced off on the gridiron six times with Mart holding a 4-2 all-time advantage. \nThe first contest between the two teams came in 1931, one the Panthers won 44-0. Mart won the next two contests in 1998 and 1999. The two teams didn\u2019t play again until they were in the same district in 2014-15 when each team won one contest. #TribFridayPhotos: Tag your Friday night pics on Instagram, Twitter \nMart comes into Thursday\u2019s game with absurd numbers. The Panthers have outscored 12 opponents by a combined total of 646 points. Excluding Mart\u2019s season-opening loss to Lexington (40-38), the Panthers have won 12 straight games by an average score of 60.9 to 7.1. \n\u201cAnytime you\u2019re playing a team that has the tradition of Mart, it\u2019s a big game because Mart is synonymous with success,\u201d Kelm said. \u201cThey\u2019re one of the most winningest football schools in the whole state of Texas. They\u2019re a very fine football program year in and year out. Anytime we play them we know it will be a big challenge.\u201d \nMart has five state titles \u2014 1957, 1969, 1999, 2006 and 2010. Crawford, meanwhile, has one in 2004. But beyond the hardware, these two programs are consistently the best in Central Texas. Both programs have had winning seasons every year but two since 1986. \n\u201cWe\u2019re two small Central Texas schools that have a lot of tradition and history,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to play in these types of games no matter what time of year it is. When you throw it in December, obviously there\u2019s a lot more at stake. Everyone knows what\u2019s at stake. Other than that, Crawford and Mart, everyone knows about both the schools.

All too often, an employee or partner takes issue with some part of a contract, no matter how minute, resulting in costly litigation for your company. \nThere are, however, ways to avoid contract disputes. You should know a few key strategies for avoiding potential lawsuits. This post goes over three tips for avoiding contract disputes that you can incorporate into your future contracts. \nThink ahead \nYou may be focused on creating a contract that addresses your current needs, but you should not limit your focus to the present. Try to think ahead and anticipate any variables that could arise in the future. Consider questions such as: How often will we renegotiate the contract? What circumstances could render the contract void? What if the signee goes out of business? What if one of the parties should die? \nAnticipating potential roadblocks is one of the most effective ways of preventing contract disputes. It will also save you the headache of having to continually adjust a contract every time you hit a snag. \nRequire contracts to be notarized \nNo, having a notary sign a document does not ensure its legality. It can, however, make the counterparty think twice about what they are about to sign. If the other party knows that a contract is going to be notarized, it may prompt them to take a long, hard look at the contract\u2019s details. In the event that you should go to court because of a contract dispute, it also prevents the other party from claiming that they did not sign the document. \nDouble-check their legal standing \nOne way to guarantee a messy legal battle is if it turns out that the counterparty is not who they say they are. That\u2019s why you should always verify the counterparty\u2019s identification. Otherwise, the contract could be rendered null and void.

No change in text.) By Jamie McGeever LONDON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The dark clouds of stagnant wages, widening inequality and chronic productivity across much of the Western world are shrouding one of the most remarkable and easily forgotten facts of the year - the world economy is booming. The value of all goods and services produced globally this year will be around $80 trillion, which is expected to grow by about 3.5 percent next year, possibly even nudging 4 percent for the first time since 2011. Annual global growth of 4 percent or higher was in fact fairly common in the pre-crisis years. In the 11 years to 2007 that level was reached in seven, with three of those over 5 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund. Growth of 4 percent next year would mean the creation of almost $3 trillion - the equivalent to the annual output of Britain, the world's fifth-largest economy - that has to be put to work. That's almost $3 trillion, over and above the near $80 trillion of wealth already being produced, for consumers to spend, investors to buy financial market assets, and businesses to expand, invest and hire. It's a huge sum, and dwarfs the large but diminishing stimulus being provided by central banks. Policymakers are increasingly confident that world growth is now self-sustaining, hence their gradual withdrawal from the monetary stage. \"The global economy is in the midst of a mini-boom that started in mid-2016,\" according to economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. They expect \"solid\" 3.8 percent global growth next year, up from 3.7 percent this year, with most major economies growing at or above potential. Their counterparts at Barclays are even more bullish, anticipating that the \"self-enforcing economic cycle\" will deliver 4.0 percent global growth next year. Good news, right? REALITY V PERCEPTION The trouble is for an increasing number of people, even those in countries where growth is strong and unemployment has rarely been lower, it doesn't feel like good news. People are in work, as record levels of employment in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and elsewhere show, but they don't feel rich, confident or secure. Wages are stagnant. Unemployment in the United States is 4.1 percent, down from a crisis-high of 10 percent in 2009. Annual wage growth in that time has averaged 2.2 percent and has never topped 3 percent, compared with a pre-crisis average well over 3 percent. Wages in the euro zone are rising at almost half that rate, and at 1.4 percent currently have rarely grown more slowly. Wages rose an average 2.3 percent a year pre-crisis and just 1.7 percent since, even as the unemployment rate has plunged from its 2013 peak. Thanks to a mix of low wage growth and a surge in inflation since the 2016 Brexit referendum, workers in Britain are mired in the longest fall in living standards since the Second World War. People are still feeling the effects of the deep austerity and spending cuts many Western governments pushed through after the 2008 crash in an attempt to repair their shattered public finances. Those at the lower end of the income and wealth scale have been hit particularly hard. While they may have jobs, many work on part-time, short-term or zero-hours contracts. Poverty levels among the \"working poor\" are rising. Not unrelated, by many measures wealth inequality is widening. According to a Credit Suisse annual report, wealth inequality has \"trended upwards\" in recent years, propelled in part by the rising share of financial assets. The richest 1 percent of the world's population now owns half of its wealth, up from 43 percent in 2008. There's no sign of that trend receding. Even in developing economies, where wealth creation is strongest. Emerging market economies are expected to expand by 5 percent next year, according to BAML, creating millions of jobs and increasing the spending power of billions of people. The world's poorest countries are getting richer. Some 230 million people around the world are set to move up to \"middle class\" status over the next five years, with two in five of those in China alone, according to Credit Suisse. Yet, again, it doesn't feel like it for many people. There's been a rapid increase in so-called payday loans in China over the past year and a proliferation in the number of companies providing them, especially over the internet. This is partly due to loose government rules in the past, which authorities are now trying to address. Beijing is taking steps to reduce corporate and financial risks by tightening credit restrictions and clamping down on borrowing. Its ability to implement these reforms without causing too much damage to growth next year will be tested. While BAML economists pencil in 5 percent growth across emerging markets next year, they note that large swathes of EM - Mexico, South Africa, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and India - will all grow below potential.

World | Press Trust of India | Updated: December 07, 2017 14:56 IST Share PRINT COMMENTS The discovery will inform about the universe when it was 5 percent of its age (Representational) Washington, United States: Scientists have discovered the farthest known super-massive black hole - a matter-eating beast that is 800 million times the mass of our Sun.Astronomers combined data from NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) with ground-based surveys to identify potential distant objects to study, then followed up with Carnegie Observatories' Magellan telescopes in Chile.Researchers identified candidates out of the hundreds of millions of objects WISE found that would be worthy of follow-up with Magellan.\"This black hole grew far larger than we expected in only 690 million years after the Big Bang, which challenges our theories about how black holes form,\" said Daniel Stern of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the US.For black holes to become so large in the early universe, astronomers speculate there must have been special conditions to allow rapid growth - but the underlying reason remains mysterious.The newly found black hole is voraciously devouring material at the centre of a galaxy - a phenomenon called a quasar.This quasar is especially interesting because it comes from a time when the universe was just beginning to emerge from its dark ages.The discovery will provide fundamental information about the universe when it was only 5 percent of its current age.\"Quasars are among the brightest and most distant known celestial objects and are crucial to understanding the early universe,\" said Bram Venemans of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany.The universe began in a hot soup of particles that rapidly spread apart in a period called inflation.About 400,000 years after the Big Bang, these particles cooled and coalesced into neutral hydrogen gas.However, the universe stayed dark, without any luminous sources, until gravity condensed matter into the first stars and galaxies.The energy released by these ancient galaxies caused the neutral hydrogen to get excited and ionise, or lose an electron. The gas has remained in that state since that time.Once the universe became re-ionised, photons could travel freely throughout space. This is the point at which the universe became transparent to light.Much of the hydrogen surrounding the newly discovered quasar is neutral. That means the quasar is not only the most distant - it is also the only example we have that can be seen before the universe became re-ionised.\"It was the universe's last major transition and one of the current frontiers of astrophysics,\" said Eduardo Banados, astronomer at Carnegie Observatories in the US.

This will help to conserve battery usage, and also prevent your phone from automatically get connected to certain open WiFi without your aware, which might be used to hack in your phone. Normally, there are fix places with WiFi that you will definitely want to use, to conserve your mobile Internet data quota usage. Those places include your home and/or your work place. This Automate flow will help you to automatically disable WiFi function of your phone after your leave your home, and automatically enable it back when you arrive your home. It will even inform you by voice so that you are aware when WiFi is automatically enabled and disabled by this flow. Enabling WiFi function does not guarantee a successful connection, because sometimes your access point (AP) or wireless router might have problem in establishing the WiFi connection. Therefore, after enabling WiFi, this flow will wait for 10 seconds, which should be long enough for normal WiFi connection to be established. It will then check if the connection is successful or not. If the connection is successful, it will log down the name a.k.a. SSID (service set identifier) of the AP or wireless router your phone has connected to. If the connection is not successful, it provides option for you to remain enable WiFi or to disable it. Regardless of your selection, you will still need to troubleshoot and find out why the WiFi connection cannot be established. It could be caused by your AP or wireless router is switched off, or hang, or WiFi function disabled, or DHCP IP address allocation full, or other possible issue. If your phone has never made a successful connection with the WiFi at the location before, or you have made your phone \"forget\" about it, the connection will also be not successful as well. Before you can use this flow, you need to tell it where is your home. This can be done by tapping on Block 12 \"When at location\". The following screen will come out. Tap on the \"Pick a location on map...\" button to bring out Google map. You can then search for your home by either tapping on the \"target\" icon if you are currently at home, or by tapping on the search (magnifying glass) icon and key in your home address for search, or by manually selecting the location by navigating the map and tap on the targetted place. When you are done, tap on the OK button below to capture the location's coordinate. The Radius setting determines the area that you consider your phone is at home. Normally, 50 meter radius as shown above is a good choice. You can set its value larger so that your WiFi is automatically enabled faster when your approaching home, and automatically disabled after you have travelled further away from your home. You can use this same flow for other places with fixed WiFi, such as your work place. Just go through the same steps able to set the location before running it. You might also want to change the word from \"home\" to \"office\" in Blocks 14, 15, 16 and 17 of the flow.

Sure, Live Oak was busy engaging in its standard 6 a.m. practices \u2014 they\u2019ve been a staple since the program began \u2014 but some players were admittedly going through the motions. After four straight trips to the state championship game entering the season, some of the Falcons just figured they could fall out of bed and win football games. \nThen they received a nasty wakeup call. \n\u201cWhen you have 30 guys come out and nearly a third of them aren\u2019t ready to go, it affects your depth,\u201d Live Oak coach Jordan Barker said. \u201cThere was definitely some complacency. \u2026 That\u2019s one of the negative aspects, I guess, of success.\u201d \nAfter a 60-14 loss to fellow TAPPS six-man powerhouse Austin Veritas on Oct. 13, Live Oak\u2019s record sat at 1-6. To say that\u2019s abnormal would be an understatement. The Falcons had dropped six games in the 2015-16 seasons combined. Live Oak had never suffered a losing season in its entire decade-long history, and had posted seven straight seasons of double-digit wins entering 2017. \nInjuries and a rigorous schedule compounded the problem. Live Oak played games against such UIL six-man stalwarts as Calvert and Blum. But when the Falcons looked at themselves in the mirror and were truthful about the main issue, they recognized it was self-inflicted. \n\u201cGoing into it, we expected, \u2018Hey, we won last year, we can just cruise through this,\u2019\u201d senior Cole Jahrmarkt said. \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t put our foot on their throats and really dig in.\u201d \nSenior running back Chase Hill, the 2016 Super Centex Six-Man Player of the Year , said he could sense trouble as far back as July. \n\u201cSome people weren\u2019t putting in the work,\u201d Hill said. \u201cWe had summer workouts all summer, and they didn\u2019t show up. We were like, \u2018Well, now we\u2019re suffering for it as a team.\u2019 It\u2019s just really effort. That\u2019s the big thing.\u201d \nThe players said that having to walk off the field after so many defeats was frustrating \u2014 even shocking. But those humbling losses at least served to shake the Falcons out of their doldrums. \n\u201cThere was also belief,\u201d Hill said. \u201cWe knew that on paper we were a 1-6 team, but in our hearts we were always a 12-0 team. We knew how good we are, we just didn\u2019t portray it. Once we figured out how to mesh with each other we turned it on and haven\u2019t looked back.\u201d \nIn the past six weeks, Live Oak has looked a lot more like Live Oak. The Falcons have won six straight games to reach the TAPPS Six-Man Division II state final yet again. They\u2019ll duel with Bulverde Bracken Christian (10-2) for the state trophy at 7 p.m. Thursday at Midway. #TribFridayPhotos: Tag your Friday night pics on Instagram, Twitter \nBarker said that the players started paying more attention to the seemingly little details in practice that coaches know aren\u2019t so small at all. \u201cIt was like, \u2018OK, let\u2019s not eat the elephant all in one day,\u2019\u201d Barker said. \nWhen the work increased, the winning followed. \u201cIt 100 percent increased,\u201d Hill said. \u201cYou can\u2019t make it to a state game in any division if you don\u2019t increase that workload.\u201d \nThe Falcons never expected to take such a bumpy journey to the state title game. But they certainly are appreciative of a shot at another state title, which would be the program\u2019s fourth if they were able to win it. When they were sitting at 1-6, such a proposition seemed dicey. \n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic,\u201d said senior quarterback Matthew Bailey. \u201cI could have imagined it any other way, especially after the past three years, having gone to the state game in all of them. It wouldn\u2019t feel complete if we didn\u2019t.\u201d \nIn a way, the Falcons are almost proud of those early-season losses now. Or they\u2019ve at least been able to glean a sense of purpose from them. Sometimes you\u2019ve got to take a few punches to remember how to fight back. \n\u201cI think we\u2019ve really matured, and those losses, while not necessary, were a good thing,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cBecause we were able to get better. We\u2019ve put in a lot harder work, I would say, than we would have if we\u2019d won.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jordan barker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chase hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cole jahrmarkt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew bailey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bailey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calvert", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bulverde bracken christian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "live oak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "falcons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oak falcons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin veritas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centex", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:38.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3890a72bc80e40e2ee040699479fff51d11afe00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYyoODA_sG6MMGxFh26nSAvLJ6w0UaF3CPvabZwKjyAdAAlt84u44SYL9SrDJwTtY1GgO5ZxiNixDQMQj1.1PzUEUvT1uPbC4orLPRDDCLFXci0gA7X582IjY31DObuKVUvdUScWqSlWg-", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.co.za", "site": "tripadvisor.co.za", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/ShowForum-g274684-i94-Czech_Republic.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Czech Republic Forum, Travel Discussion for Czech Republic -

temporary and permanent. Permanent death means the heart has stopped, clinically the patient has died but the brain is still working. In case of hyperthermia the brain is alive and the heart can be revived even after four hours,\" he added.Dr. Aggarwal further said in this particular case the mistake occurred when the child was declared dead, while her brain was alive, even though the heart had stopped.\"In this case, the mistake was they declared the child dead when the heart was dead, the respiratory was dead, but the brain was alive and therefore when the heart got revived, the child lived for another few days. So this is a basic mistake of diagnosing temporary death as permanent death,\" the doctor added.Speaking on another incident of medical negligence, where the father of a seven-year-old girl, who died of Dengue in Gurugram's Fortis Hospital has alleged that the hospital has offered a total of Rs 35,37,889 for assuring to stop his social media campaign against them, Aggarwal said, \"This is between the Fortis and the patient, but the matter is under investigation and this has to be tacked by whether this was a medical negligence or not.\"However, Dr. Aggarwal also said that IMA is proposing that there should be an independent financial audit, quality audit and social audit programme for private hospitals.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kk aggarwal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ani here.doctor aggarwal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aggarwal", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "india medical association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fortis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fortis hospital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pitampura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gurugram", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:39.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "896609bf12dfd5792f555945ecc6e7df364ea456", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFrxcz1ruaBJqq3uMmlXXpOGRN5poTgsuwUVzjP0IpUWT_JSqiPLYaVqzxbE6N69fpaFCq8BKxhPwF0_rXUeD5gu", "site_full": "gorish.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://gorish.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Gorish", "title": "Coil / Throbbing Gristle - Peter Christopherson in-depth interview circa 2009", "title_full": "Coil / Throbbing Gristle - Peter Christopherson in-depth interview circa 2009", "published": "2017-12-07T11:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/yZVHY8Ju-NSvAr1CYIeLVyRi1GUMKMvHMrJSDjhXNgaMltISU46pdjAU_-XUGQrSP1Ov8TTvzr4x2aeJ=w1200-h630-n-k-no-nu", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "896609bf12dfd5792f555945ecc6e7df364ea456", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFrxcz1ruaBJqq3uMmlXXpOGRN5poTgsuwUVzjP0IpUWT_JSqiPLYaVqzxbE6N69fpaFCq8BKxhPwF0_rXUeD5gu", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Exu (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "Coil / Throbbing Gristle - Peter Christopherson in-depth interview circa 2009", "text": "Coil / Throbbing Gristle - Peter Christopherson in-depth interview circa 2009 Posted by Exu at Click the Picture Bookmark us!
