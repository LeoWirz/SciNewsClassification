Room service was nice but would knock on the door to get you won\u2019t by 11. Okay, so the actual review now: the room sucked it was tiny I mean super tiny. We got a king bed but at least have a decent bathroom of the rooms gonna be tiny. The bathrooms were a total joke, there\u2019s a 1.5 foot by 6inch price of Rickety glass to hold any toiletries over the toilet of all places so you can easily drop your toothpaste in the toilet! (Mmhmmm yes I did :( ). Bathrooms were superrrr dated like 70s dated possibly a bit older. I\u2019d rather deal with original 1920-30s. The elevators were awful EXTREMELY stupid that they upgraded their system but they should at least have a weight sensor that knows when it\u2019s full. I swear we wanted 15 mins for a elevator. They fill and stop on EVERY floor on the way down. We decided to use the stairs from the 10th floor.

Labour MP John Mann says the remarks are \u201cappalling.\u201d \nLONDON \u2013 Philip Hammond has been criticised after linking low productivity rates to higher amounts of disabled people working in the UK. \nThe chancellor told MPs at the Treasury Select Committee that \u201cvery high levels of engagement in the workforce\u201d of disabled people \u201cmay have had an impact on overall productivity measurements.\u201d \nLabour MP John Mann, a member of the committee, said the remarks were \u201cappalling\u201d and \u201cignorant\u201d in a tweet. \nAnna Bird, director of policy and research at disability charity Scope, told HuffPost : \u201cThese comments are totally unacceptable and derogatory. \nAsked about a fall in productivity rates in 2017, Hammond replied that: \u201cThe consequences of high levels of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, will be felt for many, many years to come. \n\u201cIt is almost certainly the case that by increasing participation in the workforce, including far higher levels of participation by marginal groups and very high levels of engagement in the workforce, for example of disabled people \u2013 something we should be extremely proud of \u2013 may have had an impact on overall productivity measurements.\u201d \nMann tweeted: \u201cAppalling. Chancellor just linked low productivity growth to the labour market and specified the increased employment of disabled people. \n\u201cMy experience of employing disabled people is that they are brilliant employees. The chancellor\u2019s comments are ignorant.\u201d \nBird said the remarks \u201cfundamentally undermine the Government\u2019s policy to get more disabled people into work, and the ambition set out by the Prime Minister just a week ago. The Chancellor must urgently withdraw them and offer a full apology.\u201d \nLabour productivity measured by output per hour fell 0.1% between March and June, according to ONS figures . The fall came despite more people being in work and working more hours. \nThe government aims to get one million more disabled people into work over the course of a 10-year plan, halving the difference between employment rates for disabled and non-disabled people, which stood at 32% in 2016. \nLabour\u2019s shadow disabilities minister Marsha de Cordova tweeted that it was \u201cshocking that Philip Hammond is trying to blame disabled people for low productivity! \n\u201cDisabled people contribute enormously and disability employment gap has barely changed since productivity started to stall. Disgusting scapegoating!\u201d Since 2010 disability employment gap has been stuck at about 30 odd percent. Productivity will need massive investment strategy and education programmes. Not stopping people like me from working \n\u2014 Marsha de Cordova MP (@Marshadecordova) December 6, 2017 As a disabled person I am shocked and appalled that Philip Hammond is trying to blame me and other disabled people for the Tories' economic failure.

Google collaborated with MediaTek to ensure that Android Oreo (Go edition) works well on its line of processors, enabling a faster time-to-market mechanism for device manufacturers, and ensuring a quality Android smartphone experience that is both secure and affordable for devices with 512MB to 1GB of memory. This marks one of the first times that entry-level SoCs are ready to be used shortly after the latest version of Android, in this case Android 8.1 Oreo, has been released to the Android Open Source Project. \nWith Android Oreo (Go edition), Google has optimized its OS platform, first party apps and the Google Play\u2122 Store to improve the capabilities of entry level devices. Limited processing power and storage are top pain points for entry-level device users. Android Oreo (Go edition) was created to not only address these issues, but to also ensure that the devices are secure and that users have more control over data usage. \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) leverages the existing Google Play Store ecosystem to deliver apps that run smoothly on low memory devices. This improves the overall user experience with, and support for, devices that have 512MB to 1GB of memory, which results in significant bill of materials (BOM) cost savings. These savings enable device makers to provide the 400 million users who buy entry-level smartphones every year, a better option. \n\u201cEntry-level devices are the gateway to the internet for many people, and we want to make sure everyone has a great experience when they use these devices,\u201d said Sameer Samat, VP of Product Management, Android & Google Play. \u201cWe\u2019re excited that Android Oreo (Go edition) will significantly improve storage, performance, data management, and security.\u201d \n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement builds upon our existing work with Google, including our recent collaboration on Google\u2019s GMS Express to speed up the certification process,\u201d said TL Lee, General Manager of MediaTek\u2019s Wireless Communication business unit. \u201cWith Android Oreo (Go edition), we are partnering with Google to tackle the performance challenges of lower memory phones, improving the user experience of entry level smartphones for consumers in key markets across India, the Middle East & Africa, Latin America and South East Asia.\u201d \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) leverages MediaTek\u2019s acclaimed turnkey references and chipsets that are designed specifically to reduce product development time and compliance testing. A wide range of MediaTek SoC\u2019s supports Android Oreo (Go edition), including the MT6739 and MT6737 for 4G devices, as well as the MT6580 for 3G devices. This gives device makers the range of capabilities they need to develop devices for specific price points and markets. \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) smartphones powered by MediaTek will be available in world-wide market by Q1, 2018. \nFor more information about the program, please explore: https://www.android.com/ \n*Google, Android, and Google Play are trademarks of Google LLC. \nAbout MediaTek Inc.

This survey is the first of six areas to be acquired in a wider program totaling 200,000 line km across the Mexican Gulf of Mexico. Additional acquisition in the other areas indicated in the map below is planned for 2018. \nThe newly acquired Perdido Fold Belt data has shown an interesting correlation of significant discoveries along the flanks of basement topography. The data and interpretation will help explorers map crystalline basement, which is not well imaged by seismic, to construct an improved Earth Model. The airborne survey also collected continuous data through the 'transition zone' from the marine environment to onshore. The comprehensive interpretation, combining this new data set with available geologic and geophysical data, was undertaken by CGG's in-house interpretation team in Houston. A full geophysical interpretation report, which includes mapping of basement, sediment and any intrusives or salt which may be present, will provide important insights to exploration and de-risking of prospective areas by oil companies. \nGreg Paleolog, Senior Vice President, Multi-Physics, CGG, said: 'The results of this first survey in our wider airborne GravMag program offshore Mexico reinforce our belief that this extensive new program, when combined with our other seismic, geologic and satellite multi-client data in Mexico, will give the industry access to a unique geoscience library to support the future exploration and economic development of this high-potential area.' \nAbout CGG \nCGG ( www.cgg.com ) is a fully integrated Geoscience company providing leading geological, geophysical and reservoir capabilities to its broad base of customers primarily from the global oil and gas industry.

On Tuesday night, she was on Stephen Colbert\u2019s late night chat show, and discussed everything from changing her name to the ins and outs of Irish Catholicism Source: The Late Show with Stephen Colbert /YouTube \nA key part of Lady Bird is the fact that it\u2019s set in a Catholic school, so Colbert asked Saoirse about her own connection to the religion: \u201cI was raised Catholic, yeah. It\u2019s a much more cultural thing in Ireland \u2013 I mean there are very religious Catholics as well \u2013 I went to a Catholic school, made my first communion and confirmation and all that sort of stuff.\u201d \nColbert had to bring up a crucial and relevant plot point: In this movie you eat unconsecrated communion waifers as a snack. I mean, until it\u2019s consecrated it\u2019s just a piece of bread? \nSaoirse informed him of how that would go down in Ireland: \u201cThere\u2019s no way you\u2019d be let away with that in Ireland. There\u2019s no way. Still like, it\u2019s against the rules, God will be looking down on you and judging you Stephen\u201d \nSource: YouTube \u201cThat accent put a chill down my back just now. You\u2019re like a character from a James Joyce novel\u201d \nSource: YouTube She then, as is custom at this stage, addressed the difficulties of her name being pronounced in America \u2013 telling the story of a car waiting for her with the sign \u201cShelley Ronan\u201d \nSource: YouTube \nThat\u2019s the kind of thing that will catch on and be read out at the Oscars in the not so distant future.

\u2013 Polis menahan sepasang suami isteri dan kakak angkat mereka serta merampas dadah dan empat pucuk pistol bersama 151 peluru hidup dalam serbuan di sebuah rumah di Taman Idaman, Simpang Ampat dekat sini awal pagi semalam. \nPengarah Jabatan Siasatan Jenayah Narkotik Bukit Aman Datuk Seri Mohmad Salleh berkata pasangan suami isteri yang ditahan dalam serbuan pukul 3 pagi itu masing-masing berusia 33 dan 38 tahun manakala kakak angkat mereka berumur 59 tahun, dadah yang dirampas pula bernilai RM11,500. \n\u201cDadah yang dirampas hasil pemeriksaan ke atas rumah milik lelaki yang berada bawah pengawasan polis kerana kesalahan Akta Pencegahan Jenayah (POCA) itu, ialah heroin seberat 573.9 gram dan ketamin 26.7 gram,\u201d katanya pada sidang akhbar di sini hari ini. \nBeliau berkata polis juga menemui empat pucuk pistol semi auto jenis Barreta, Colt MFG, Compact Cz 75D dan Cz 2075 serta 151 butir peluru hidup pelbagai jenis dan tiga pasang gari serta kunci di rumah. \nSiasatan lanjut masih dijalankan termasuk mengetahui motif suspek memiliki pistol dan gari, namun tidak menolak kemungkinan ia mempunyai kaitan dengan jenayah serta kegiatan pengedaran dadah, katanya. \n\u201cKami percaya suspek bukan sahaja terlibat kegiatan jenayah di Pulau Pinang malah beberapa negeri lain dan tidak menolak kemungkinan dia menggunakan pistol dan gari untuk menyamar sebagai anggota penguat kuasa. \n\u201cKami juga sedang siasat bagaimana lelaki itu mendapatkan pistol, peluru dan gari namun tidak menolak kemungkinan ia dari negara jiran,\u201d katanya. \nMohmad berkata lelaki berusia 38 tahun yang dipercayai suspek utama dan turut memakai Peranti Pengawasan Elektronik (EMD) itu merupakan pengedar dadah yang aktif di sekitar Pulau Pinang sejak beberapa bulan lepas dan dia juga positif dadah. \nBeliau berkata lelaki itu yang mempunyai lima rekod jenayah berkaitan dadah dan jenayah itu dipercayai bergerak sendiri dalam kegiatan pengedaran dadah dan menjadikan rumahnya sebagai lokasi menyimpan serta membungkus semula dadah. \u2013 BERNAMA Loading...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities":

Google collaborated with MediaTek to ensure that Android Oreo (Go edition) works well on its line of processors, enabling a faster time-to-market mechanism for device manufacturers, and ensuring a quality Android smartphone experience that is both secure and affordable for devices with 512MB to 1GB of memory. This marks one of the first times that entry-level SoCs are ready to be used shortly after the latest version of Android, in this case Android 8.1 Oreo, has been released to the Android Open Source Project. \nWith Android Oreo (Go edition), Google has optimized its OS platform, first party apps and the Google Play\u2122 Store to improve the capabilities of entry level devices. Limited processing power and storage are top pain points for entry-level device users. Android Oreo (Go edition) was created to not only address these issues, but to also ensure that the devices are secure and that users have more control over data usage. \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) leverages the existing Google Play Store ecosystem to deliver apps that run smoothly on low memory devices. This improves the overall user experience with, and support for, devices that have 512MB to 1GB of memory, which results in significant bill of materials (BOM) cost savings. These savings enable device makers to provide the 400 million users who buy entry-level smartphones every year, a better option. \n\u201cEntry-level devices are the gateway to the internet for many people, and we want to make sure everyone has a great experience when they use these devices,\u201d said Sameer Samat, VP of Product Management, Android & Google Play. \u201cWe\u2019re excited that Android Oreo (Go edition) will significantly improve storage, performance, data management, and security.\u201d \n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement builds upon our existing work with Google, including our recent collaboration on Google\u2019s GMS Express to speed up the certification process,\u201d said TL Lee, General Manager of MediaTek\u2019s Wireless Communication business unit. \u201cWith Android Oreo (Go edition), we are partnering with Google to tackle the performance challenges of lower memory phones, improving the user experience of entry level smartphones for consumers in key markets across India, the Middle East & Africa, Latin America and South East Asia.\u201d \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) leverages MediaTek\u2019s acclaimed turnkey references and chipsets that are designed specifically to reduce product development time and compliance testing. A wide range of MediaTek SoC\u2019s supports Android Oreo (Go edition), including the MT6739 and MT6737 for 4G devices, as well as the MT6580 for 3G devices. This gives device makers the range of capabilities they need to develop devices for specific price points and markets. \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) smartphones powered by MediaTek will be available in world-wide market by Q1, 2018. \nFor more information about the program, please explore: https://www.android.com/ \n*Google, Android, and Google Play are trademarks of Google LLC. \nAbout MediaTek Inc.

Home / News / Qualcomm announces the processor Samsung will use in the Galaxy S9 Josh L. / 1 day ago \nQualcomm unveiled the Snapdragon 845, its latest high-end mobile processor, at its annual technology summit on December 6. The chip, which retains the same 10nm footprint as its predecessor, is believed to be on board the Chinese, North American and South American variant of the upcoming Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+. \nThat\u2019s not to mean Qualcomm hasn\u2019t made any improvements, though. The Snapdragon 845 features an all-new architecture, bringing a number of new features to the table, including 4K HDR video capture.

Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not yet approved for any use in the United States. \nIn August 2017, the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization for Cladribine Tablets, marketed as MAVENCLAD, for the treatment of adult patients with highly active relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) as defined by clinical or imaging features in the 28 countries of the European Union (EU) in addition to Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. In December 2017, Cladribine Tablets, marketed as MAVENCLADwas approved in Canada for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). \nThe clinical development program for Cladribine Tablets includes: \nThe CLARITY (Cladribine Tablets Treating MS Orally) study: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cladribine Tablets as a monotherapy in patients with RRMS. The CLARITY extension study: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study following on from the CLARITY study, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cladribine Tablets over an extended administration for four years. The ORACLE MS (Oral Cladribine in Early MS) study: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cladribine Tablets as a monotherapy in patients at risk of developing MS (patients who have experienced a first clinical event suggestive of MS). The ONWARD (Oral Cladribine Added ON To Interferon beta-1a in Patients With Active Relapsing Disease) study: a Phase II placebo-controlled study designed primarily to evaluate the safety and tolerability of adding Cladribine Tablets treatment to patients with relapsing forms of MS, who have experienced breakthrough disease while on established interferon-beta therapy. PREMIERE (Prospective Observational Long-term Safety Registry of Multiple Sclerosis Patients Who Have Participated in Cladribine Clinical Studies) study: interim long-term follow-up data from the prospective registry, PREMIERE, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cladribine Tablets The clinical development program of Cladribine Tablets in MS comprises more than 10,000 patient years of data with over 2,700 patients included in the clinical trial program, and more than 10 years of observation in some patients. \nAbout Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, chronic and inflammatory condition that affects the central nervous system (CNS) and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. Relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common form of MS, and around 85% of people with MS are diagnosed with this type. The exact cause of MS is unknown but it is thought that the body's immune system attacks myelin, disrupting the information flow along the nerves. There is currently no cure for MS, but treatments are available to help slow the course of the disease. \nAll Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, press releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the EMD Group Website.

You should also set security on your mobile device(s) so that no one can access it if they find it. One of the biggest things you can do to protect your privacy is turn off all the convenient features on your mobile device like location awareness. You do lose the convenience but you do gain a degree of privacy \u2013 though keep in mind that as long as your cell phone is on, you are trackable. \nConsumer reports has a list of 66 things you can do to protect your privacy. Try several of these to begin protecting your privacy. \nOne of the conundrums we face is who to let in to our \u201ccircle\u201d and who to keep out. When I got my new phone with fingerprint unlocking technology, I was excited. But my son pointed out that Google now has my fingerprint. \nAs a business / web site owner, it is important to recognize that your visitors all want and expect some level of privacy. But we all want to understand the details of WHO is visiting the site, WHY they are there and WHAT they want to accomplish. Google, with its Analtyics tool, hides demographic and other data from you if there is so little of it that you could begin to identify actual people. Their idea if to give you broad information to understand the demographic groups that come to your site. But wow, wouldn\u2019t it be cool to know that right now, Jim Adams, aged 39, with a wife, Naomi and two children in 1st and 3rd grade just clicked on a link in your web site \u2013 oh and by the way his phone number is ***. That info sounds great to business owners until they realize they don\u2019t want the sites they visit to know that information about them. \nIf you are struggling to determine how much data to collect, how to interpret it, or how to organize the data, give us a call.

The trial results were presented today at the International Diabetes Federation Congress 2017 (IDF 2017). [1]\n\"Millions of people with type 2 diabetes participate in Ramadan every year and we know that periods of prolonged fasting can increase the risk of hypoglycaemia,\" said lead investigator Dr Mohamed Hassanein of the Dubai Hospital, Dubai Health Authority, UAE and chair of the Diabetes and Ramadan International Alliance (DAR). \"This highlights the importance of people with type 2 diabetes preparing for Ramadan with their doctor and discussing treatment options for preventing episodes of hypoglycaemia.\"\nIt is estimated that worldwide over 116 million Muslims with diabetes may choose to fast during Ramadan. [2] Muslims with type 2 diabetes who fast during Ramadan have up to a 7.5-fold increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia. [3]\n\"This trial has shown that Ryzodeg \u00ae is not only a simple treatment option which can make daily life easier for people with diabetes. Ryzodeg \u00ae also reduces the risk of potentially dangerous episodes of hypoglycaemia in people with type 2 diabetes who choose to fast during Ramadan,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen , executive vice president and chief science officer of Novo Nordisk.\nThe trial was designed to investigate the effects of Ryzodeg \u00ae on blood sugar control and hypoglycaemia reduction versus BIAsp 30, both at the end of Ramadan and 4 weeks post-Ramadan. There was no difference in overall blood sugar control between Ryzodeg \u00ae and BIAsp 30. [1]\nAbout the trial\nThe Ramadan trial compared the efficacy and safety of Ryzodeg \u00ae twice daily and BIAsp 30 (NovoMix \u00ae ) twice daily in subjects with type 2 diabetes before, during and after Ramadan. The trial was a 28-week, international, open-label, randomised, treat-to-target trial involving 263 adults from five countries with large Muslim populations ( Algeria , India , Lebanon , Malaysia and South Africa ). The primary endpoint was change in HbA 1c from baseline to the end of the month of Ramadan (four-week period). Secondary confirmatory endpoints included rates of blood sugar confirmed, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia. [1]\nAbout Ryzodeg \u00ae\nRyzodeg \u00ae is a combination of two distinct insulin analogues (insulin degludec and insulin aspart in the ratio of 70% and 30%), making it the first combination of a basal insulin with an ultra-long duration of action and a mealtime insulin in one pen for people with type 1 and 2 diabetes.

I'll be curious if readers find it helpful.\nThe original post at the forum dealt with a few projects that had been modelled very far from Revit's Internal Origin/Startup Location. I looked at one of the project files and found the Survey Point and Project Base Point had been moved very far away while unclipped. The modelling started there, really far far away. They started to experience some of the negative symptoms that can occur and started looking for solutions...thus the original post.

The Joint Venture of Tin International AG and Lithium Australia NL reports today, that a maiden lithium Mineral Resource estimate has been completed for the Sadisdorf tin-lithium project, located in Saxony, Germany. The project is managed through Lithium Australia NL (ASX: LIT), a Perth-based lithium explorer and processing technology developer, who can earn up to 50 % of the project by spending a total of EUR 2 million on exploration.\nThe industry renowned consultancy firm CSA Global has estimated a JORC (2012) compliant inferred Mineral Resource of 25 million tonnes grading 0.45 % Li 2 O (0.15 % Li cutoff), based on re-analysis and re-interpretation of historical drilling and underground sampling at Sadisdorf.\nThis result substantially enhances the potential for progressing the historical Sadisdorf tin mine to a polymetallic deposit with value contributions from lithium, tin and tungsten, as well as potentially from a range of by-products such as potassium sulphate fertilizer and sodium silicate. With SiLeach (R) , Lithium Australia has developed an innovative hydrometallurgical technology which is able to produce such by-products and thereby unlock the full resource potential of the deposit.\nPreliminary SiLeach (R) testwork on the Sadisdorf outer greisen material returned encouraging results, with lithium leach extractions of zinnwaldite concentrates averaging 95 %.\nThis maiden lithium Mineral Resource estimate of the Sadisdorf project is in addition to the already existing JORC (2012) compliant tin Mineral Resource of 3.36 million tonnes grading 0.44 % Sn (0.25% Sn cutoff) whereby the modelled lithium and tin Mineral Resource estimates partially overlap.\nAdrian Griffin, Managing Director of Lithium Australia commented: \"Our previous testing demonstrates, that SiLeach (R) can unlock the potential of Sadisdorf as a true polymetallic operation, recovering lithium from the residues of conventional tin concentration processes. The size of the Sadisdorf resource is already significant, with the potential to feed a 25,000 tonnes per annum lithium carbonate plant for 10 years. Further exploration is likely to expand the resource significantly. It is noteworthy that Sadisdorf has similar grades to those of the nearby Cinovec deposit (Czech Republic) and is not far from the Zinnwald deposit of Deutsche Lithium GmbH.

That episode of Riverdale was bonkers! We didn\u2019t just get new info on the Black Hood mystery, we got an entire new mystery surrounding the third child and the group that helped him end the Riverdale Reaper! There was also some heartbreak and possibly the start of something new. Let\u2019s break it all down! \nArchie and Veronica. These two crazy kids just can\u2019t keep their hands off of each other. Jughead\u2019s theory is that they are using their physical affections to defy the Black Hood\u2019s dark shadow over the town. Could that be it, or is Veronica just too scared to talk about her feelings so she is hiding behind sex? Well, after Archie confesses his love for her and she doesn\u2019t say it back, we are starting to lean toward the feelings thing. \nFree FP! Yay!!! Everyone\u2019s favorite hoodlum DILF is out of jail! Juggie is thrilled obvi. He wants his dad to help him run the Serpents, but FP is ready to start his life on the straight and narrow now. Also, can we all just stop to appreciate the hell out of Alice Cooper and FP\u2019s crazy sexual tension? Amazing. We need more of that please! CW \nVarchie \u2013 the new Bughead. With Jughead focusing on his dad and Betty wanting some distance from the Black Hood, it\u2019s up to Veronica and Archie to pick up the investigation. Veronica and Archie are not on the same level as Riverdale \u2018s best teen detectives (Bughead), but they have a solid lead \u2013 the Devil\u2019s House. \nCheryl and Josie. What is up with these two? We know that Cheryl has taken quite a liking to Josie, but it is really starting to get weird. We love that they are exploring more of Josie and Cheryl, but Cheryl is taking this all to a new level of unhinged. If Cheryl is starting to develop feelings for Josie, we hope that she has the chance to explore it in a healthy, non-stalker way. She deserves that. CW \nDevil\u2019s House. Veronica and Archie head to the house where the grizzly Riverdale Reaper murders occurred. It\u2019s absolutely chilling to watch them recall the murder and to see the reenactment. Despite my deep, deep doubts, Veronica and Archie stumble on a clue (and a full case file) and get a break in the mystery! They figure out that there is a third kid that survived the murders, and he\u2019s closer than they thought. He\u2019s the janitor at the school, Svenson! \nDark Betty! Betty is ready to ditch her good girl vibes for her man. She is worried about Jughead and thinks that if she is closer to the Serpents, she can watch out for him \u2013 that\u2019s what she says anyway. Is this really all just an excuse for her to unleash her alter ego, Dark Betty? CW \nParty time. At FP\u2019s party, things get crazy, and I mean CRAZY. Veronica and Archie discuss their growing tension and sing a haunting duet. Veronica gets upset and storms off stage, but never fear \u2013 stripping Betty is here! In order to \u201cjoin\u201d the Serpents as a woman, Toni tells Betty how she needs to do \u201cthe dance.\u201d Betty decides to do it in her underwear on a stage in front of all the Serpents and a visibly upset Jughead. Oh! And when she finishes, FP runs on stage to announce he is not retiring. Is it because he really wants to stay or is he taking over the club so he can watch out for Jughead? \nThe Snake Charmer. We have our answer. While in jail, FP had asked Jughead not to get involved with Penny, but Jughead didn\u2019t listen. FP found out and that\u2019s why he isn\u2019t retiring. It\u2019s super sad and our hearts break for both of the Jones fellas. Will they ever catch a break? CW \nEverybody breaks up! Holy cow! Despite everything these two have going for them, Betty and Jughead break it off. (SOB!) And after the \u201cL\u201d word issue, Veronica and Archie are dunzo too. If that\u2019s not shocking enough, the end of the episode hints at a possible relationship brewing between Archie and Betty! We aren\u2019t sure how to feel about that one just yet. Come back and ask us after we have cried our Bughead and Varchie tears some more! \nMore mystery. During the craziness of everything and in the preview for next week, there is a photo that the janitor is holding. When he told Archie and Veronica about what happened the night his fam was murdered, he said that a group of guys helped him track down the murderer and kill him. But who was the group of guys? Is the entire group acting as the Black Hood? Is this some sort of cleansing of the town? Gah! The plot thickens! \nWhat did you think of the episode?

Joining SWV will be fellow New York natives: Allure on their first return visit to Australia since 2011. \n\nSWV came to public consciousness in 1992 with the release of their multi-platinum debut album: -It's About Time' which, boasted three of the biggest songs in R&B history, now considered classics, in: -Right Here,' -I'm So Into You' and -Weak.' Made up of Cheryl -Coko' Clemons, Leanne -Lelee' Lyons and Tamara -Taj' George, SWV took the music scene by storm in the early 90s and remain one of R&B's classic acts to this day. \n\nRecently honoured with the prestigious, -Lady of Soul' award at the annual -Soul Train Music Awards' for their continued work in R&B, SWV's influence on both female and male artists has been a mainstay in contemporary R&B. The group enjoyed subsequent releases on the -Above The Rim' soundtrack, their second album, -New Beginning,' which featured the hit -Tonight's the Night' with Blackstreet and their third and final release (before taking a hiatus to pursue solo careers) -Release Some Tension.' \n\nThe group returned to the spotlight in 2007 alongside R&B luminaries, Bobby Brown, New Edition and Blackstreet and in 2008 where they delivered an unforgettable performance alongside TLC and En Vogue during Alicia Keys' set at the BET Awards. Reuniting as a group in 2011 and featuring on the Chris Brown remix of -Right Here/Human Nature,' the ladies were recognised by VH1 in the -Top 100 Women in Music' list and by Billboard in both their Top 10 R&B Acts of the 90s list as well as being the number 2 top selling female group of the 90s. \n\nIntroduced to a new legion of fans in 2012 with a new album: -I Miss Us,' it was the launch of their own reality show -SWV Reunited' which saw the ladies attract millions of viewers and return to the consciousness of contemporary R&B fans with their most recent album -Still' released in 2016. \n\nAllure, made up of original members: Alia Davis, Lalisha Sanders and Akissa Mendez signed with Maria Carey's -Crave' label in 1997. Their debut single, -Head Over Heels' (featuring Nas) was both a club and chart smash. Their cover of -All Cried Out,' which featured 112, was a Top 10 smash hit in the USA, Australia and New Zealand and became one of the most loved R&B ballads of the era.

These microorganisms have the capacity to coordinately regulate specific sets of genes by sensing and communicating amongst themselves utilizing a variety of signals. This book examines the mechanisms of quorum sensing and cell-to-cell communication in bacteria and the roles that these processes play in regulating virulence, bacterial interactions with host tissues, and microbial development. Recent studies suggest that microbial cell-to-cell communication plays an important role in the pathogenesis of a variety of disease processes.

The meeting between two political leaders come at a time when Qadri is mulling to stage a protest to press the government for resignation of Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah and provincial Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif after release of Model Town inquiry report. According to sources, the PPP co-chairman had a telephonic conversation with the PAT chief on Wednesday night and assured Qadri of extending his support. The two leaders agreed to bring the people responsible for the Model Town massacre to justice, sources said. Opposition leader Khursheed Shah along with Qamar Zaman Kaira is expected to accompany Zardari during the meeting today. Earlier today, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan expressed his support to the PAT chief. \u201cWe will join Qadri, if he protests to seek justice,\u201d Khan said. Speaking to media a day earlier, Qadri called upon his party workers to remain ready for any sort of call from the party leadership. He repeated before the media  the important points of the Model Town report  in which the tribunal pointed fingers at Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah and Shahbaz Sharif. In light of Model Town inquiry findings, the PAT chief claimed that the transfer of IG Balochistan to Punjab showed that federal government led by then PM Nawaz Sharif was also involved in the massacre. Punjab government on Tuesday released the report of the judicial inquiry carried out into the 2014 Model Town incident hours after larger bench of the Lahore High Court (LHC) ordered the government to release the report regarding the incident which left at least 14 people dead and several others injured. Amongst other conclusions, the report said that Chief Minister Punjab Shahbaz Sharif did not pass the \u201cdisengagement\u201d order as he claimed before the judicial commission.

(AP) \u2014 The Latest on Southern California wildfires (all times local): 3:45 p.m. Firefighters have stopped the spread of a wildfire that has destroyed homes near the world-famous Getty museum in Los Angeles. Deputy Fire Chief Charles Butler says firefighters and aircraft stopped the growth of the 475-acre (192-hectare) blaze in the Bel Air neighborhood. There are currently few visible flames and crews are concentrating on the southwest corner of the fire. Butler says four homes have been destroyed and 11 damaged since the blaze erupted before dawn Wednesday in an area that includes many hilltop mansions. About 700 homes, an apartment building and a school have been ordered evacuated. Northeast winds driving the flames eased by afternoon but are expected to return in full force Wednesday night. Firefighters are struggling to ring the blaze before that happens. ___ 3:15 p.m. California\u2019s top firefighter says the state is in for the worst Santa Ana wind conditions it\u2019s ever seen. Ken Pimlott, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, says the wind wildfire threat to Southern California for Thursday is purple. The has color has never been used before, means there is extreme danger and that fires that erupt will burn uncontrollably. Below that is red, meaning high danger of fires that burn rapidly and intensely and are difficult to control. Pimlott says the winds could hit 80 mph (129 kph) and make it impossible to fight Southern California wildfires that have destroyed at least 200 homes and buildings. Five wind-driven flames continue to threaten homes in Ventura and Los Angeles. Some 200,000 people are under evacuation orders. ___ 1:25 p.m. The University of California, Los Angeles, has canceled classes for the rest of the day due to difficult traffic problems stemming from a wildfire. The university\u2019s website says many students, faculty and staff have been unable to reach the campus Wednesday, so classes from noon onward are canceled. The athletics department says a night men\u2019s basketball game and all other team workouts and practices are canceled. The fire erupted before dawn in the Sepulveda Pass, just up Interstate 405 from UCLA. The fire has destroyed some homes as it spread into the Bel Air area. ___ 10 a.m. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti says at least four and possibly six homes have been destroyed by a wildfire in the city\u2019s Bel Air area. The fire erupted before dawn Wednesday in Sepulveda Pass, a major commuter route\u2026 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eric garcetti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ken pimlott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pimlott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles butler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "butler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california department of forestry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of california", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "southern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sepulveda pass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bel air", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa ana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:34.062+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cc305fbb48e77cefe33d564deaaa84b0b906bbb9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.XCiLFD_78S7Yhls18GFgpFT1SwRZm18LT29DBHN0e9Kd7s8ivSUk0P", "site_full": "king-c0ck.tumblr.com", "site": "tumblr.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "king_c0ck", "title_full": "king_c0ck", "published": "2017-12-07T16:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "http://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_o6tssybe8V1vralbk_frame1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cc305fbb48e77cefe33d564deaaa84b0b906bbb9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.XCiLFD_78S7Yhls18GFgpFT1SwRZm18LT29DBHN0e9Kd7s8ivSUk0P", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T16:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "king_c0ck", "text": "kingpinnatedawg reblogged this from slutpornzone loveshornyladies reblogged this from spankswire and added: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:35.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0a6b571065fe2e05a134249029af378bf91aaeb9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/qp0TC1ajDjgYeZ177f4HOWMrd5dreVkRspbkuGu26MI9D3LzwatG6qfHdCfEwJH8TNC5UqYDUFQ-", "site_full": "67.227.255.239", "site": "67.227.255.239", "site_section": "http://67.227.255.239/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=22", "site_categories": ["adult", "business", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Off-Topic Discussion - NeoGAF", "title": "Three photos from YOUR 2017", "title_full": "Three photos from YOUR 2017 - NeoGAF", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "http://www.neogaf.com/forum/images/neogaf2/icon_social.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "73ca17f2f336fec355a6fea01b2706015ffe879b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/qp0TC1ajDjgYeZ177f4HOWMrd5dreVkRspbkuGu26MI9D3LzwatG6qfHdCfEwJH8J5hpJFgTNXq6Jo3swcyY.w--", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "Nick Hopewell", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "[Quote: =HarryKS;253095822]Why the apostrophe?
