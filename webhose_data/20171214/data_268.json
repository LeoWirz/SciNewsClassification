Now we've gotten together and come up with a plan. These are two of my closest friends and I do trust them so I don't believe there's anything to worry about regarding that.\nThe two of them are going to attend a local university while I stay at the apartment and work online like I have been doing for the past few years. I'm a freelance writer and I should be making a solid $200 per week to start off.\nHopefully my friends will land good part-time jobs, too. They're both receiving financial support from their families, I'm not.\nWhy\nIn my case I need to leave the toxic environment that is my house. My parents are completely inept and don't really give a shit about me or what I do anyway. Being able to have my own space to work and occasionally go out sounds amazing right now.\nAfter all, I never bothered with school because I was making so much money (for someone my age living in South Africa) working online anyway.\nWhen\nWe're planning to move there on the 20th of January or so. Not too long from now, but long enough for me to make at least $1000 by working and selling my old stuff.\nWhat\nLuckily my grandparents will provide me with a car. I guess until my friends get theirs, I'll have to drive them to school and they'll cover the fuel costs. Its not a long drive from the apartment we're planning to rent.\nIts a really nice 3 bedroom place in a secure complex with a big lounge, kitchen, dining room etc. Its either that or a similarly specced two-story house with 2 bathrooms as opposed to one. Both are reasonably close to the university, with the latter being the furthest at 15 minutes away. I'm sure fuel won't end up being much.\nIts supposed to cost around $500 per month (including water, electricity, sewrage, etc) , which split between the 3 of us (equally) isn't much. Especially for me. There might be a larger deposit first but I can easily cover that as it won't be much more than the first month's rent from my research.\nOnly other costs I can think of are food, internet (for my online work, probably like $50 per month for 1MBps uncapped because fucking monopoly ISP's in South Africa) and all that other stuff like toiletries and laundry. Also car insurance (my parents are forcing me to pay it, supposed to be around $100 per month) and I need to spend about $400 getting my license.\nProblem\nThe thing is, the work I do is so goddam inconsistent as I generally work with the lower end clients. I'm not a great writer after all so I can't charge quality rates.\nAlso, can you even rent an apartment at 18 anyway? I mean, how does that work? I don't even know how to pay taxes. My parents literally have told me nothing and barely know how to live life as adults themselves.\nI'm just a little lost here and I'm not sure what else to type. But you should get the idea from what I've said above. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

This ensures that you use less time and cash in the process. Resolve to the use of the internet which will show you names of dealers to decide on. Do not opt for one without doing a proper background check to ascertain whether the company is the right one to appoint.\n\nAnother option is to find out from mates and relatives who built at one time and required the services of the equipment. They may also know of some corporations which are favorable in hiring. Inquire to know if they were sold good quality before you also decide to buy. This ensures you use your money wisely hence you will be able to get good quality.\n\nThe sellers have different machines they trade to carry out different kinds of work. The seller you select ought to offer you the equipment you need for the task. The commonly available types are the hydraulic, steel sheet, hammer, piling rig, silent piles and others. You need to search for a corporation that has a variety so that you can easily select what you require.\n\nDetermine whether you want to acquire a used or new equipment. This is entirely dependent on the costs available. When you are looking to save on cash, you may go with a used one but make sure it is of quality. This prevents you from undergoing a loss. You may also choose to buy a new one that you will use for a long while.\n\nEnsure you deal with the reliable companies that are available. When looking for good standards, they can offer you this; hence you can enjoy what you buy. These organizations have provided equipment for a good amount of time hence know the importance of offering quality. Get to know the time frame operations have been carried out to be assured whether the company will offer you good standards.\n\nGet to know the amounts you ought to pay for the machine. Every seller has adopted rates they think are sensible. You have to do a good analysis to get the best trader asking for affordable charges. The best thing to do is an analysis. It will show you the different rates adopted by many sellers. You can then decide from there. Do not opt for one selling cheaply as they may not provide you with good standards.\n\nAll of the available machines function differently. You have to be aware of this so that you select something that is modernized. Many of them have auto controls that make tasks to be easy and effective. They may also have GPS control that guides for installation at the right depth, angle, and location.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are looking for the facts about a pile driver , visit our website today.

So if you are not an MVP candidate close to the end of the season, you aren't likely to be a 95.\nIf Richardson can just can remain healthy and consistent for a complete season, he'll undoubtedly enhance his rating. With the chance of being a true reserve, Sumner's rating may be as low as 65.\nNaturally, simply because a player begins with a minimal rating doesn't mean that's what the player will stay at for the rest of the season. In any event, a rating is merely a reflection of the way the general public perceives a player. See the remainder of the total player ratings below.\nWhat Everybody Dislikes About Nba 2k18 Ratings and Why", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.mmotank.com/Nba-2k18-Mt.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:56.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "054fdbf75baafcfaba09e4d013d59499d5d285f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.WMZ.dI08ZIBOAYFnaoLH9WnGop6QzBjGaE3HBU4GDs69PwgB3WlX_KeiCKve448wxu20TJrWLJhHFMiYYQIKAc_nR12p8wrfXzObYLI.SGIw--", "site_full": "kyraneko.tumblr.com", "site": "tumblr.com", "site_section": "http://kyraneko.tumblr.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Chaos Cat (loves this thing in particular)", "title": "\"That dismissal of romance as a genre is a political act.

It would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result\u201d. The well known saying: \u201cTo do the same thing and expect a different result defines insanity,\u201d is, of course, a valid principle, but only if we have a clear idea what is meant by the \u201csame thing.\u201d And so, we examine where President Trump is applying the saying, only to find ourselves sucked down the Alice rabbit hole. That's because the culprit responsible for the failure to reach a peace deal was never the waivers. The culprit was the Judeo-Israeli repeated sabotaging of the peace process because the Jews felt they were well served by the status quo, and did all they could to maintain it. Doing the same thing was letting Netanyahu play his game over and over again. Doing worse than the same thing is strengthening his hand, and allowing him to play an even more ferocious game. As to the nature of the game that Netanyahu has been playing and continues to play, you can discern two versions of it. One version applies to the Palestinians, and one to the Americans. What Netanyshu does with the Palestinians is negotiate a quid pro quo like this: \u201cWhat do I get in return if I give you this?\u201d When the Palestinians say what they will give, Netanyahu takes it by force of arms, and says to the Palestinians: \u201ccome and negotiate again what it is that you want in return\u201d. As to the game that Netanyahu plays with the Americans, it consists of saying to their President \u2013 and getting his surrogates to endlessly echo-repeat \u2013 that he can conclude a Mideast peace deal tomorrow if he'll do this or that for Israel. When the President of the United States gives Netanyahu what he asked for, the latter spits in the President's face and calls him a sucker. Netanyahu, more than any other Israeli Prime Minister did that to American Presidents. The most glaring example happened when Netanyahu commissioned the Israeli and American media to repeat that because former President Barack Obama visited Egypt and Turkey but not Israel, the Israelis felt so despondent, they were in no mood to discuss peace. But if Obama would visit Israel, a peace deal can be signed tomorrow. Obama bought and swallowed this Jewish pie of horse manure, visited Israel and got spat in the face. And so, Obama developed a well deserved hatred for Netanyahu. Now that Donald Trump has relinquished the leverage of the waivers he held in his hand in return for the promise that Netanyahu will not sabotage the upcoming negotiations \u2013 if and when they happen \u2013 the odds are that Netanyahu is beginning to see Donald Trump as his latest sucker. He'll spit in his face and ask: what else do you have that might be useful to me? This raises the following question: How will Trump react to this affront? Will he do what Obama did, which is to hate Netanyahu in silence and give him the cold shoulder? Or will he let his anger grow to the size of a King Kong, and retaliate in ways never seen before? While there is question as to how America will react, there is none as to how the rest of the world, especially the Europeans will. In fact, most Europeans \u2013 individually as nations and collectively as a European Union \u2013 have already restricted the Jewish ability to mess with their democracies. Now that they have a complete outlook as to how the Jews turned the American Congress and the Executive into a Jewish toilet bowl and a urinal, the Europeans will want to restrict the Jews even more. Thanks to Donald trump, the Europeans were given a redundant lesson on the perils of treating the Jews like responsible human beings.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netanyshu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judeo-israeli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "king kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:57.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b695468605dc2dc32060344e625e61423ebe4d73", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3LnwepCrBTCyu78ovyJHB26RGlTW74HUoKzlkRQ9BhqVpt7yHR5xRBTaoL3mpp1b1PagM5ArA_3KKIz4cR17GZo", "site_full": "ez-photo.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://ez-photo.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Beautiful Things In Life", "title": "Autumn in Kyoto | Kodai-ji", "title_full": "Autumn in Kyoto | Kodai-ji", "published": "2017-11-26T15:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "BN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "37025991ff4a6c3822d38e617cae9b7f80c85e0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3LnwepCrBTCyu78ovyJHB26RGlTW74HUoKzlkRQ9BhqVpt7yHR5xRBTaoL3mpp1b1PagM5ArA_3KEGl_zfB6Qti3nFbauCgpFU-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Rose World", "published": "2017-12-07T08:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "So called hotline!

Her messages and texts were VERY short, kinda like I was talking to a guy or something. She is VERY cautious, the most cautious lady I have ever seen. Asked alot of questions. Like were we were meeting. She changed the location to where the place was open. Wanted the hotel address but not the room number. Why we were meeting so early in the morning. Etc. But once we met I could tell she was very scared and cautious. So I broke the ice and took it very slow with her. The price was very cheap $. 5 for an hr so since she drove over an hr to see me, I told her I wanted 2 hrs with her. So total damage for 2 hrs was $$$ you could tell her life is hard, filled with bad luck and lots of death. I really enjoyed my time with her, we mainly cuddled and talked. Her body was damaged with kids and gun shot. I think she also told me, she was kicked in the face. I just wanted her to feel safe and loved. Well above average on the BBBJ, muliti pop DATY, great kisser, DFK, She is very self consious of her body, and I could see why, always quickly to put her clothes back on. I personally really enjoyed myself with her. Her personality was awesome, she was kind, we clicked really well. I was very gentle with her, and kissed all over her body, to show her, that she is beautiful and wanted her to be comfortable with me. She is not for everyone. But if your kind and love a reasonable priced lady. Then she is a good one to see. If your looking for young, tight body, spinner, ok, picky. Then she is not the one for you. I wasn't lucky enough to be born good looking so I don't judge people for the way they were born. You can't help the way you were born, everyone needs love. And I am happy to give it. She also has a lovely daughter that is into the same line of work. So you can easily get her daughters number too. Lexy is real and safe, just got to be slow and gentle with her.

However, most people can agree that their dog\u2019s general disposition falls into one (or more) major categories. Shopping for your pup and considering his or her personality can be fun for you and Fido/Fifi! \nIs your canine companion strong and independent? Mellow and low-key? A little high-strung? ( This article explains 5 major personality types in more detail.) No matter how your purebred or mutt is mannered, there\u2019s a special gift out there for them! \nBelow, find 5 paw-fect presents for every pup personality. 1. Confident Canine \nCanines like this are natural leaders and feel secure in their surroundings, commanding the attention of a room (or the dog park) and introducing themselves to everyone they meet. A \u201ctwo-player\u201d toy is a great gift for pups who love to initiate games with their new pals, plus confident dogs love showing off their skills! Each purchase also provides a toy to a shelter dog so that potential adopters can see their playfulness shine through. FlossyTossy\u2122, $12.99 . This product provides a toy to a shelter dog in need. 2. Independent Spirit \nSome dogs are great at keeping themselves entertained, and find little need to make new friends \u2013 their fierce loyalty to their families is enough. These dogs often prefer to be observers, and they seem to have the wisdom of an old soul. For pups who prefer to play solo, the Brite Bite Brushing Stick is a wonderful way to keep them entertained and healthy. This clever contraption allows dogs to \u201cbrush\u201d their teeth all by themselves: fill the grooves with delicious-tasting doggy toothpaste, and their teeth will be cleaned as they chew. Each purchase also supplies a toy to a homeless dog to help beat the shelter blues. \nBrite Bite Brushing Stick, $16.99. This product provides a toy to a shelter dog in need. 3. Laid Back Barker \nFor the dogs who are the \u201csurfer dudes\u201d of the canine world, everything is groovy, no matter where they are or who they\u2019re with. These puppers are almost always happy, whether they\u2019re snuggling, playing, hunkered down at home, or out on the town. Any mellow mutt would appreciate a plush toy to either cuddle or fetch, and this soft brown lion is the right toy for the task! Every plushie also represents a toy that\u2019s been donated to a shelter pet. Brown Lion Plush Toy, $11.99. This product provides a toy to a shelter dog in need. 4. Shy / Timid Tail-Wagger \nSome pooches simply aren\u2019t social butterflies, and that\u2019s okay! These dogs tend to be the most comfortable in familiar surroundings with their favorite people. Because of their endless loyalty, these types of tail-waggers can suffer from moderate to severe separation anxiety. While nothing can replace your loving presence, a snuggly toy that smells like you may help stave off loneliness until you\u2019re back home.

Using high-resolution manometry (HRM), this study aims to identify positional adaptations of pharyngeal physiology by evaluating swallowing pressure patterns in a series of inverted body positions. Ten healthy adults each underwent swallowing tasks with pharyngeal HRM at six body positions using an inversion table (0\u00b0[upright], 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0[supine], 110\u00b0, 135\u00b0, and 180\u00b0[fully inverted]). Repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess impact of position on pressure parameters, and pharyngeal-UES pressure gradients translate. Velopharyngeal pressures varied by position ( P < 0.001), with significantly higher pressures generated with inversion \u226590\u00b0, compared with upright and 45\u00b0. Change in position did not significantly affect common mesopharyngeal pressures or swallowing pressure durations. UES valving mechanisms were preserved during inversion, with subtle variations observed in integral pressures ( P = 0.011). Pharyngeal-UES pressure gradients changed with position ( P < 0.01), increasing with inversion > 90\u00b0 compared to upright and 45\u00b0. Mechanisms of deglutition may differ with position and relative direction of gravity, particularly when at > 45\u00b0 inclination. Increased palatal pressure is generated in the upside-down position to achieve nasopharyngeal closure and prevent regurgitation. While other classically measured pressures may not consistently differ with positioning, many individuals exhibit adaptations in pressure gradients when inverted, likely due to a combination of changes in pharyngeal driving force and UES opening mechanisms. Identification of these changes, relative to position, further builds on our understanding of the adaptability of the pharyngeal swallowing system.\n\n\nfrom #ENT via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2nzWiCa\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "hrm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ues", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anova", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:58.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6437c37704f88b8dd0f1b2736f2f616df90c7a9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgz_2WCFUvvxVUHwbOHKl3RovuqtFCAHMileTzLAILdV_kaOyKvYj2ObUSXZaNsy9xItWjwXxepNXnBCyOBZKhmYeb5fcTYYp5STqBzVqO6XYg--", "site_full": "freekabalance.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://freekabalance.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Ka Balance", "title": "Codice Analogue Dial Girls Watch (Combo of 8)", "title_full": "Codice Analogue Dial Girls Watch (Combo of 8)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:31:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6437c37704f88b8dd0f1b2736f2f616df90c7a9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgz_2WCFUvvxVUHwbOHKl3RovuqtFCAHMileTzLAILdV_kaOyKvYj2ObUSXZaNsy9xItWjwXxepNXnBCyOBZKhmYeb5fcTYYp5STqBzVqO6XYg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Freekabalance Blog (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:31:00.000+02:00", "title": "Codice Analogue Dial Girls Watch (Combo of 8)", "text": "\n\nAmazon has Codice Analogue Dial Girls Watch (Combo of 8) on sale.\nHow to get this deal Click  View Deal button button Add the Codice Analogue Dial Girls Watch (Combo of 8) to cart No Coupon Code required Make Payment of Rs.699 Shipping charges  Rs 80 \nDetails Buy Codice Analogue Dial Girls Watch (Combo of 8) at Rs.699 from amazon Shipping charges Rs 80 \n\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "codice analogue dial girls watch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "details buy codice analogue dial girls watch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:58.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fae3ea7e62dfbc4bbf7e32261d3edc6be13ea9ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmn0g01lOGrgBBen9om5Up4U_KTFluUvEn9Lk47hWp6V2522eRl8i82cAuUECtgg3RSk0o3NRGDPhw--", "site_full": "rhodycigar.com", "site": "rhodycigar.com", "site_section": "http://rhodycigar.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Good 5 Cent Cigar", "title": "Bragging rights restored: Rhode Island downs Providence 75-68", "title_full": "Bragging rights restored: Rhode Island downs Providence 75-68", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://rhodycigar.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/PC-over-all-action-e1512610431165.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fae3ea7e62dfbc4bbf7e32261d3edc6be13ea9ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmn0g01lOGrgBBen9om5Up4U_KTFluUvEn9Lk47hWp6V2522eRl8i82cAuUECtgg3RSk0o3NRGDPhw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sam Murray", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Bragging rights restored: Rhode Island downs Providence 75-68", "text": "December 7, 2017 Autumn Walter | Cigar \nDan Hurley and several Rhode Island players make their way toward the Rhody Ruckus after the buzzer sounds, with the fans surrounding and cheering for them. Hurley gives a salute to the crowd, showing his appreciation for the 7,959 fans that had their voices booming across the arena the entire game, second most in Ryan Center history. \nRhode Island had accomplished something they had not done since Hurley was given the keys to the program: beat Providence College. \nRhode Island, coming into the game at 4-2, had not been victorious over the Friars in seven years, dating back to when Jim Barron was the coach of the 2009-10 Rams. Providence, coming into the game at 6-1, looked to continue their decade of dominance over the Rams and pick up a quality win over one of the best mid-major programs in college basketball. \nFor Hurley and Ed Cooley, who don\u2019t think of this game as a rivalry, it didn\u2019t take them long to both pick up technical fouls as Hurley picked up his 5:01 into the game while Cooley pick up his with 5:37 remaining in the first half. Emotions were high, the crowd was roaring, and the title of the best basketball team in Rhode Island was at stake once again. \nProvidence jumped out to an 18-13 lead early in the first half, but after that the Friars looked like a deer in headlights and the Rams went on a 17-5 run and maintained a lead they would never lose again. \nThe Rams lead 42-31 at the end of the half, but the Friars got within three as Jalen Lindsey knocked down a three-point shot with 3:49 left in the game. Rhode Island responded with big shots from Jared Terrell, Jarvis Garrett, and three clutch free throws from Daron \u201cFatts\u201d Russel after drawing contact down the line. A turnover by Jared Terrell to walk-on Friar Tom Planek in the final minute almost jeopardized the Rams, but after Planek missed his free-throw the Rams regained possession and held onto their lead to win 75-68. \nFree throws and turnovers became the difference maker for both teams. Providence could not convert from the free-throw line and finished 10 of 21, while Rhode Island was 9 of 11 in the second half and 20 of 23 overall. Providence also had more turnovers than a Thanksgiving feast, committing 21 throughout the contest as opposed to Rhode Island\u2019s 11. This greatly benefited Rhode Island as they scored 23 of their 75 points off of the Friar\u2019s turnovers. \nCooley attested the turnovers and missed free throws to the hostile environment in the Ryan Center, and had nothing but praise for the Rhode Island faithful that showed up. \n\u201cI think Coach Hurley should buy everyone in this crowd a dinner,\u201d Cooley said. \u201cTheir student section did a really good job giving them a lot of energy. I think they helped [Rhode Island] win the game.\u201d \nHurley thanked the crowd for their effort show up and make the Ryan Center a mad house. Whether he will buy the 7,959 fans a dinner remains up in the air. \n\u201c[There is] not a better college venue when our place is packed,\u201d Hurley said about the Ryan Center. \u201cNot in Rhode Island, not in New England.\u201d \nRussell notched 20 points in his second consecutive game, shooting seven of 14 from the field and five of six from the charity stripe. Hurley said that Russell had the make-up and the confidence to be an x-factor against Providence, and it\u2019s safe to say Russell was more than that as Hurley called him \u201cnot your typical freshman.\u201d \n\u201cI try to be a spark in every game,\u201d Russell said. \u201cEvery time I come in I try and like help influence the game in our direction. That\u2019s my main focus in every game.\u201d \nAs for whether or not Russell was enjoying himself in his first rivalry game against the Friars, he was more than inclined to agree. \n\u201cThis is the funnest game I have ever played in,\u201d Russell said with a huge grin on his face and Hurley next to him laughing. \u201cI had a ball.\u201d \nGarrett had himself the best game of his season against the Friars, scoring 15 points while going three of five from beyond the arc while chipping in four assists. Perhaps the main contribution of Garrett\u2019s performance was his defense on Bob Cousy Watchlist recipient and star guard Kyron Cartwright, who last year had a game high 19 points and eight assists against Rhode Island. Garrett held Cartwright to two points on one of seven shooting and forced four turnovers, Cartwright\u2019s worst performance of the season by far. \n\u201cI wanted this matchup so bad,\u201d Garrett said about guarding Cartwright. \u201cHe got me last year, and he wasn\u2019t going to get me before I leave [URI].\u201d \nAndre Berry continued to be lethal from mid-range and shot of six of seven from the field good enough for 12 points, while Stanford Robinson hauled in a career high 12 rebounds while grabbing two steals. Jeff Dowtin cracked double digit scoring for consecutive games the first time this year, as he finished with 10 points while also dishing out four assists. \nAlpha Diallo hauled in 17 points for the Friars before fouling out late in the second half, while Rodney Bullock was held to 10 points on four of 10 shooting. Freshman Makai Ahston-Langford, who\u2019s rivalry with Russell will be a storyline to watch over the years, finished with 12 points before fouling out. Providence shot 55.1 percent from the field, their second highest all year and behind their 62 percent shooting against St. Louis when they prevailed 90-63. \nThe bragging rights in this historic rivalry have been restored to URI. For now, the road to college basketball superiority in Rhode Island runs through Kingston.

Replacing a shutter is not usually a big deal, unless the camera has depreciated to a small fraction of its original purchase price, which is exactly what has happened by the time the shutter goes, most of the time.\nMost likely the more the shutter is activated, the more other things are being used...control buttons and electronics for example. Shutter count (some what) can be an indicator of how much the camera has been used. Less so if the user shoots sports/action at high frame rates.\nSony doesn't include electronic shutter activations in the shutter count total in the EXIF. I have an a7RII with around 2 million activations (making synthetic slitscans), and the EXIF says about 150,000.\nI guess you're not a fan of that, and would like to see the whole 2,000,000+ activations counted, right?\nJim\n-- hide signature -- http://blog.kasson.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:59.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1da65e7ca73599eb7312ea17636a95def0158c28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8SN9il7cGGTt7g.TSvhBp_rg.gonE.pEcRM2dRaMvInDR9cVqbHQB", "site_full": "www.dpreview.com", "site": "dpreview.com", "site_section": "https://www.dpreview.com/forums/1061", "site_categories": ["photography", "hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Photographic Science and Technology Forum: Digital Photography Review", "title": "Why don't cameras display the shutter count?:", "title_full": "Why don't cameras display the shutter count?: Photographic Science and Technology Forum: Digital Photography Review", "published": "2017-12-07T13:51:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.032, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1469, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5e7eb6242eae0f5fc122e70460216d47a0abbd03", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8SN9il7cGGTt7g.TSvhBp_rg.gonE.pEcRM2dRaMvIpAWxgUaF2L2HKWUHciYN_NsFDr5sXzgYMHRdmpXNyI2", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Sympa", "published": "2017-12-07T13:51:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "It would point out to every user to the fact that a camera can wear out.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:59.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d9089e9f6f9a1898a462d13583137503ba3ce6a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRLZvaxC2_GQqo3NYOhB3Ejx9Qm3z8sZ05SXGcP0gg.BL56RkfVtvzpbJjTSezOcTkqXM099eyr244w_G7EFGqLTpUiZQM2q_8v.NdG9sPQ1oBxX6EE5jQCUX6xZk4BGmSNHjpT.siJizE5dD7Hjz9_SKKsDumHiAGJHPMiGAStUH8R82ljiae0wrys7CRpwJ1rLlu5bro_WWp2xYuSXsQl5_1lc765MxE-", "site_full": "karateshitoryuuk.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://karateshitoryuuk.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "2017 Junior and Senior British Championships Timetables Announced This is a great article written by https://t.co/LgINn8tyo0 \u2013 Karate Shito-Ryu", "title": "2017 Junior and Senior British Championships Timetables Announced This is a great article written by https://t.co/LgINn8tyo0", "title_full": "2017 Junior and Senior British Championships Timetables Announced This is a great article written by https://t.co/LgINn8tyo0", "published": "2017-12-07T11:31:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d9089e9f6f9a1898a462d13583137503ba3ce6a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRLZvaxC2_GQqo3NYOhB3Ejx9Qm3z8sZ05SXGcP0gg.BL56RkfVtvzpbJjTSezOcTkqXM099eyr244w_G7EFGqLTpUiZQM2q_8v.NdG9sPQ1oBxX6EE5jQCUX6xZk4BGmSNHjpT.siJizE5dD7Hjz9_SKKsDumHiAGJHPMiGAStUH8R82ljiae0wrys7CRpwJ1rLlu5bro_WWp2xYuSXsQl5_1lc765MxE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Karate Shito-Ryu", "published": "2017-12-07T11:31:00.000+02:00", "title": "2017 Junior and Senior British Championships Timetables Announced This is a great article written by https://t.co/LgINn8tyo0", "text": "2017 Junior and Senior British Championships Timetables Announced This is a great article written by https://t.co/LgINn8tyo0 : \nvia Twitter https://twitter.com/karatenewsuk \nFrom https://karateshito-ryu.tumblr.com/post/168284584961 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:31:59.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ddf0dd6d76f72148d5749a419730b8022e923498", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_msa_0mvgXuvPkZE4XEtaWVE", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/co/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/co/ - Comics &amp;

If you are worried about your credit info being breached but didn\u2019t freeze all three agencies, do that now.", "text": "Why this is important: With the recent Equifax breach, plenty of people have put freezes on their credit reports (for good reason). But if you only froze one, someone can now still take out a loan on your name if they have the rest of your info.\nWhat changed: Until recently, Fannie Mae required all three credit reports to actually report for them to buy a loan from a bank. The change now allows for your report to be frozen with one credit reporting agency, but the other two must be unfrozen.\nWhy this matters: Your local bank might sell the mortgages they originate to Fannie Mae. Many small and even moderately sized banks have investors they sell mortgages to. Fannie Mae is one of the largest investors here. The loan must be originated and underwritten to Fannie Mae\u2019s standards for them to purchase it. This means that Fannie Mae\u2019s guidelines impact your local banks\u2019 guidelines if they sell to them. This change means that other banks will now be allowing this same thing. So if you\u2019re worried about your credit but didn\u2019t freeze it with all three agencies, do that now.\nEdit: source\u2014I\u2019m a technical writer at a bank and am rewriting our internal procedures on what we accept based on the above as I type this.\nEdit 2: I\u2019m not suggesting Fannie Mae originates loans. The thing is that their decisions as an investor will impact how banks do business. Fannie Mae says they\u2019ll take loans that are riskier? Banks that sell to Fannie Mae will start originating those riskier loans because they know they can sell them. This is about Fannie Mae (being a large investor) saying they\u2019ll take loans with one frozen score, so some banks will start accepting that too and not require that it be unfrozen. All I was saying was, if you were concerned but thought freezing one or two was good enough, that\u2019s not necessarily the case.\n submitted by /u/poopsmitherson\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:00.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5bfdb9e864018d1a59a66ea81b74fd303cffbc6e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS4mlWRaQOV30AHBjwgH78HaLneCKktrsXSJfx6_ulzymPkO28pdl1W20_UOAGQz6_dI_5gU7EKO04COLI1t31WhwLmysaV8_15ZNLPkz2VYyQq4RLqJmL203dAJ1T2cTy", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "comments : personalfinance", "title": "StefanFabian comments on Heads up: Fannie Mae will now be buying and accepting loans made with one credit report frozen.

The mounting pressure on examination boards has led to calls for tighter surveillance and security on exam production and delivery.\nIntelliPAD\u00ae will address the above issues by delivering individual question papers to the right candidate at a set time, using candidates' biometric authentication. The six-inch e-ink device securely obtains the question paper and other relevant data from a family of interconnected devices linked to KenCLOUD, a private cloud-based service offered by Mindlogicx. The whole process is done with minimal human intervention.\nIntelliPAD\u00ae works with the KenCLOUD-powered connected devices, such as IntelliSYS and IntelliSENSE, by securely mapping data. It prevents impersonation and exam centre hijacking by establishing a geofencing zone, as well as marking attendance automatically and auto-destructing the question paper once the exam is complete.\nThe user-friendly ecosystem also encourages users to go green by completely eliminating the need to print question papers. Each device will create and operate its own private network and communicate with other linked devices to deliver question papers, and does not require an internet connection to do so. This enables exams to be conducted in urban and rural exam centres alike. The devices also have built-in security features that prevent tampering of any kind.\nThe IntelliEXAMS\u00ae software, which is integrated with the IntelliPAD\u00ae ecosystem, offers functions that span the entire assessment cycle; from candidate registration, fee management and ticket generation to the digitisation of handwritten answer scripts, on-screen evaluation and result processing. It has serviced more than 3.6 million students to date, with over 28.68 million question papers delivered.\nMr. Suresh Elangovan , CEO of Mindlogicx, said, \"Top universities and professional certification providers have seen an epidemic of exam fraud in recent years. We are pleased to have pioneered the world's first device-centric solution to this phenomenon, and believe that this heralds a new era in education and test-taking.\"\nMindlogicx is setting up a global technology delivery centre, called MNOC, in Singapore this month. The office will employ about 60 staff, of which about 50 are local, and will serve as a global delivery and R&D centre.\n\" Singapore is not only highly regarded as a financial and technological hub, but also represents a gateway to the fast-growing Southeast Asian market, which will serve as the ideal launchpad for our global rollout,\" Mr. Elangovan added.\nAbout Mindlogicx\nMindlogicx ( http://www.mindlogicx.com ) is a global knowledge engineering and technology delivery company.
