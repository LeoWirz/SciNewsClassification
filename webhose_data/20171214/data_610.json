Nigeria is my target and I will remain focused to move the country forward,\u201d Buhari said. \nHe said his administration would continue to accord priority attention to education so as to empower the youth, to enable them contribute their quota toward the development of the country. \n\u201cIf you educate people, you empower them. So we have to make sacrifice to prepare the youth for the future,\u201d Buhari said. \nHe expressed happiness over the wonderful reception accorded him and his entourage by the people of the state on their arrival in the state capital. \n\u201cI am overwhelmed by the massive turnout of people who left what they were doing to welcome me. This should be a clear message to the opposition. \n\u201cThe support has been consistent, so I don\u2019t have words to express my appreciation to the people of Kano state.\u201d \nThe President congratulated Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje for working very hard to improve the living standard of the people of the state through execution of projects that had direct bearing on them. \nHe described Ganduje as a good politician who worked closely with all politicians, particularly representatives of the state, at the state and National Assemblies. \nEarlier in his remarks, Ganduje said his administration had been able to execute a number of developmental projects, in addition to initiating various empowerment programmes for the women and youths. \nHe said as part of effort to address unemployment, the state government had awarded contract worth over N2 billion for the construction of a skills acquisition training centre, assuring that the centre would soon be completed and put to use. \n\u201cWe have a number of projects that are ongoing and we hope you will visit the state in near future in order to commission such projects,\u201d Ganduje said.

I count my blessings each day because for me this is the best of times. I do not lack the necessities of life. My fridge is full, I have health insurance, and I have clothes to stay warm in. I don\u2019t fear that my utilities will be turned off. \nFor the people that I encounter, it appears to be the worst of times. These are mostly good people who struggle for the simplest of things. For some people, they are not in good health. For others, hardships and/or poor decisions leave them struggling. This, the time of year that is supposed to be full of joy and all things that sparkle; it is difficult. \nWhat can we do? What is our responsibility? I think the individual has to decide that. I first try to remember that no matter the differences, show respect. Next, I think it\u2019s important to withhold judgment. It is not easy sometimes. Lastly, try kindness. It doesn\u2019t cost a thing. The emotional support to someone in need goes a long way. \nSo while we may look around this time of year and think about treating one another to gleaming baubles or fancy clothes, remember the people who are on the fringe. You don\u2019t have to open your wallet to provide a gift. You don\u2019t have to go without in order to help someone else. The simplest of gestures can be a ray of light. You may even consider volunteering. It will only cost you your time. I will guarantee you that you\u2019ll receive something in return.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christy huffman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:49.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8adf4a98e30954c627b5271f2876409ed2e297c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pkSOsKXlzaruRkldzhZ30O_ocMlK88cGh", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/o/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/o/ - Auto - 4chan", "title": "Where I live (in America) car-jackings are way up", "title_full": "/o/ - Where I live (in America) car-jackings are way up - Auto - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-04T07:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 172, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cf6a746071aa13cb37aae0622795deb7cb61bedb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pkSOsKXlzaruRkldzhZ30O4uroDaGzi.rm7W_C.tFQJU-", "ord_in_thread": 155, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-06T22:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>18318085\n>limited number of success routes and many bad routes\nThat trues for everyone, even Jews.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:49.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "da47ae37ffe0f8d4afd79a46c9acd66e29097c47", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVgFg1upPBCWHn7vgpLkpAwG4rHfNyH9AtS.CX6MvotcQy2OO3qVLGo1y2XHcPhaKrw1A4iXKpvFwTs499Uec_avbh4NCjTL4BrgYg1AvdLLky6pQvQUhOg-", "site_full": "www.expedia.es", "site": "expedia.es", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.es/Collierville-Hoteles.d55089.Guia-Viajes-Hoteles", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "213 Hoteles en Collierville baratos con Expedia.es", "title": "Vista Inn & Suites -Downtown- Memphis", "title_full": "Vista Inn & Suites -Downtown- Memphis (Memphis, Estados Unidos) | Expedia.es", "published": "2017-10-17T19:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26131, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "91c42680617a4bef910747c84803c76c615ec528", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVgFg1upPBCWHn7vgpLkpAwG4rHfNyH9AtS.CX6MvotcQy2OO3qVLGo1y2XHcPhaKrw1A4iXKpvFwTs499Uec_avbh4NCjTL4BrgYg1AvdLLXb8muM6Ts9bclTd3Umd8Qpu99PXbZAfyL4vDfW04w.0-", "ord_in_thread": 15, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-17T20:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "It is a good motel.

If they are leaving, you as a private citizen cannot shoot them as it is no longer a self-defense issue for your CCW permit. We had a case earlier this year where the black repeat offender finally got shot after the robbery assault by the private store owner. The store owner received the prison term because the assaulter robber was LEAVING. That made it no longer self-defense. Thus, the case became person with CCW using the gun in pre-determined assault with the intent to injure or kill. After the criminal conviction, the black robber also filed civil charges and it looks like the store owner will lose that case as well. He will probably have to sell his store in order to pay off the money owed to the black robber.

12/7/17 2:31 AM \nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Karl-Anthony Towns and the Minnesota Timberwolves were challenged by the Los Angeles Clippers in the fourth quarter. \nThis time, they held on. \nTowns had 21 points, 12 rebounds and four blocked shots, and the Timberwolves edged the sliding Clippers 113-107 on Wednesday night. \nMinnesota, which recently blew a couple of double-digit leads, went up by 19 early in the third quarter. The Clippers pulled within four in the fourth, but the Timberwolves responded. \n\u201cObviously you don\u2019t want to see a lead like we had go away that way,\u201d Towns said. \u201cWe knew we needed to stop the bleeding as soon as possible. We did a great job of staying at an eight-point lead and taming them down and stalemating it.\u201d \nJimmy Butler and Jeff Teague each scored 19 points for the Timberwolves (15-11), who placed six players in double figures. Andrew Wiggins and Taj Gibson had 16 apiece, and Jamal Crawford finished with 11 points. \n\u201cThey kept coming, and because of the way they can score, you are always concerned,\u201d Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. \u201cJust finding a way to win was probably the most important thing.\u201d \nLos Angeles dropped its fourth straight game despite an impressive performance by DeAndre Jordan, who had 18 points and 21 rebounds. Lou Williams and Austin Rivers each scored 23 points for the Clippers (8-15). \n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating. Nobody likes to lose. We\u2019re losing a lot of games.\u201d \nDanilo Gallinari returned for Los Angeles and scored seven points on 2-for-13 shooting. Gallinari had been sidelined since Nov. 5 due to a glute injury. \nTIP-INS \nTimberwolves: F Nemanja Bjelica remained out with a sprained left foot. He has missed eight straight games. \u2026 Wednesday marked Crawford\u2019s first game back at Staples Center since leaving the Clippers. Said Crawford: \u201cYou see these people every day for five years. It\u2019s just weird. Some of those relationships will last a lifetime.\u201d \nClippers: G Milos Teodosic (plantar fascia) remained out, but coach Doc Rivers said he is close to returning. \nGALLINARI RETURN \nGallinari had only two rebounds and no assists in 26 minutes. \n\u201cI wanted to be better,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to shoot the ball that bad. I was expecting to be better already, but I wasn\u2019t. I\u2019ll be better next game.\u201d \nUP NEXT \nTimberwolves: Open a five-game homestand Sunday night against Dallas.

If that were my own daughter (yes I have one) a knee to his balls would be an appropriate response along with some \"Strong\" words about being a gentleman towards women in general. I'd leave it at that.\nHe never denied it because it literally wasn't ever part of the allegations against him. Why would you deny doing something that nobody accused you of doing. It isn't like we say Charlie Manson is guilty of shooting JFK just because he didn't deny it, lmao.\nAnd yet he's accused of fondling a sleeping woman. One who says that she didn't approve it. That's exactly why this is an issue. Otherwise a gang rape of a drunk girl is also OK as long as she's passed out and didn't say no. No, it's not OK. You have to say yes (as a woman) and if you do it right its \"YES!, YES!, YES!\", then a nap.

You don't get to do unwanted touching no matter what, especially if someone is asleep. Is that clear enough for you?

And for good reasons, I am in search of a property to buy in your country, as I intended to come over to your country for investment. Though I have not meet with you before, but I believe that one has to risk confiding in someone to succeed sometimes in life.  My name is Mrs.Gloria Febian. My late husband deals on Crude Oil with Federal Government of Sudan, and he has a personal Oil firm in Bentiu Oil zone town, and Upper Nile city. What I have experience physically, I don't wish to experience it again in my life. Due to the recent civil an Ethnic war cause by our President Mr. Salva Kiir, and the rebel leader Mr Riek Machar. I have been Under United Nation refugee camp in Chad, to save my life and that of my little daughter.  I want to solicit for your partnership with trust to invest the $8 million dollars deposited by my late husband in Bank; this is because my life is no longer safe in our country. This is because the rebels are looking for the families of all the oil and gas business men in the country to kill, saying that they are the one that is making the country to dry. Though, I do not know how you will feel to my proposal, but the truth is that I sneaked into Chad our neighboring country, where I live as a refugee. I escaped with my little daughter, when the rebels bust into our house on 21/04/2016 and killed my husband as one of the big oil dealers in the country, ever since then, I have being on the run. I left my country and move to Chad our neighboring country with the little ceasefire we had, due to the face to face peace meeting accord coordinated by the US Secretary of State, Mr. John Kerry and United Nations in Ethiopia (Addis Ababa), between our President Mr. Salva Kiir and the rebel leader Mr. Riek Machar, to stop this war.  I will offer you 20% of the total fund for your help, while I will partner with you for the investment in your country which we will agree on what the percentage sharing will be for our partnership.  I will wait to hear from you, so as to give you relevant details and the necessary document. With love from Mrs.Gloria Febian ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gloria febian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john kerry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salva kiir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "riek machar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "under united nation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "abidjan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sudan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "addis ababa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bentiu oil zone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "upper nile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethiopia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:50.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "44302550cf836173ea9d0e8e06e2edccdb80d4e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pkSOsKXlzart6igChdwISgtovMEjugQLY", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/o/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/o/ - Auto - 4chan", "title": "What are some essential items that need to be insi", "title_full": "/o/ - What are some essential items that need to be insi - Auto - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T13:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "95da4c625a88255d4a6fc815818d66b9cfaec9fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pkSOsKXlzart6igChdwISgkeyblOiYexfhUNypN9ejIs-", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T13:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "gucci duffle full of cash and cocaine", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:50.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b7416bf23f9ff267a9255e0f8afaabefb7fb7ba2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ97t9zOlfJQtRCKx4ogtEajMjOZS7CD3CwrwWHJE9064vxgR2N4gfg9HTV2x5KHW3l0u0yQbvhkfw0kq.C3v_sklNKYRc6GwJU7VA2cowRisYL1N29lK_r", "site_full": "www.batimes.com", "site": "batimes.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Business Analyst | Short Quiz on Team Member Behavior - What Would You Do?", "title_full": "Business Analyst | Short Quiz on Team Member Behavior - What Would You Do?", "published": "2017-11-14T09:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.178, "main_image": "https://www.batimes.com/media/k2/items/cache/6eee54acabafb55700da2aa842894d9e_S.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b7416bf23f9ff267a9255e0f8afaabefb7fb7ba2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ97t9zOlfJQtRCKx4ogtEajMjOZS7CD3CwrwWHJE9064vxgR2N4gfg9HTV2x5KHW3l0u0yQbvhkfw0kq.C3v_sklNKYRc6GwJU7VA2cowRisYL1N29lK_r", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Neal Whitten Pmp", "published": "2017-11-14T09:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "Business Analyst | Short Quiz on Team Member Behavior - What Would You Do?", "text": "Tuesday, 14 November 2017 07:14 Short Quiz on Team Member Behavior - What Would You Do? (5 votes) \nTeam members are often in the dark on the behavior expected of them while working with others. Here are 9 important but common situations that team members are likely to encounter throughout their project. \nChoose the answer that best represents the behavior you expect from your team members or coworkers. \nThe answers are provided at the end of the quiz. Quiz \n1. What should a team member do if she believes that she cannot meet an already committed date? Work it out with the team leader and propose potential solutions Get help from her manager Work it out with the person with whom she has made the commitment Say nothing until she is 100% sure that the committed date will be missed Say nothing and do the best she can \n2. Team member A repeatedly says that he is on schedule to deliver a critical-path item to member B who has a dependency on that item. But the item is delivered three days late. This puts the critical-path schedule three days behind. What should member B do? Maintain his original duration commitment which means that the schedule will remain three days late Notify his manager Escalate to member A\u2019s manager Reasonably work with anyone and everyone to bring the team back on schedule Bad mouth member A at every opportunity \n3. What should a team member do if he has bad news to share? Share it as soon as possible Share it discretely, as appropriate Share it in as few words as possible Delay as long as you can to buy time in case things improve a, b and c \n4. A team member periodically does something helpful and noteworthy for the team leader, another team member or for the team itself. In terms of recognition, what should the team member do? Share the good deed with the team at the next available opportunity Inform his manager Remain humble and say and do nothing Request the benefitting party to inform his manager Advertisement \n5.

Let others ask the questions Make the best assumptions you can Test the waters with one question before asking more questions Ask the questions Obtain the person\u2019s permission to ask questions \n9. What can a team member do to discourage her meeting invitees from arriving late and leaving early? Yell at them Lock the meeting-room door Adopt the 10-minute rule Fine them $1 per minute they are late or leave early (money collected to be used on team snacks) All the above Answers \nI have promoted answers that my experience suggests represent the behaviors of the best teams\u2014high performance teams. It\u2019s possible, that for some scenarios, you don\u2019t agree with my answer or you may not favor any of the options from which you can select. If your answer is different than my recommendation, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that either of us is wrong. We may come from different company and country cultures that may influence our answer. We also may have had different experiences. But bear in mind that, if you and I don\u2019t agree on the best answer, all the more reason that that scenario should be discussed within your team to ensure that everyone has a common understanding of what is expected of them. The answer is c . Work with the dependent party to resolve the issue without causing harm to other members of the team. If problems result, immediately include the team leader in the discussion and propose potential solutions to remedy, or at least minimize, the harm that may occur. The team member may also need to inform her manager and, if needed, secure the appropriate support from her manager. The answer is d. Member B is responsible for doing what is reasonable to work at restoring the critical-path schedule to its original commitment. Member B should be creative and open to ideas and obtain help if it is necessary and available. The first priority is not placing blame, but to resolve the problem so that the overall team does not suffer. To that end, the team leader should typically be informed of the situation and may be instrumental in working with all affected parties to repair the situation. If appropriate, member A, who originally caused the delivery to be late, can be included in the resolution. The answer is e. We all find ourselves having to deliver bad news from time to time. It\u2019s never fun but it\u2019s part of the job. Always deliver bad news as soon as reasonably possible, with the appropriate level of discretion and using as few words as possible. \u201cAs soon as reasonably possible\u201d means that, in most cases, you attempt to resolve the problem before involving others\u2014especially higher-ups. If you believe that the bad news must be shared, do so quickly. The sooner the problem is addressed, the less harm may be incurred. Make sure you do not blindside anyone when relaying bad news. No one wants to be surprised by hearing about a problem from a third party or at an inopportune time. As for using few words, if the person you are updating needs more information, she will ask. The answer is b. The team member should inform his manager about his noteworthy deed. It\u2019s not only okay to toot your horn to your manager, it\u2019s essential. If you don\u2019t then your manager can never acknowledge and praise you for your admirable behavior, nor will you experience any appropriate benefit in your next performance review. However, do not run each time to notify your manager. Instead, use weekly or monthly status reports to your manager to include these types of items. Truly noteworthy and unique events can be communicated right away. Note, however, do not toot your horn to your coworkers\u2014doing so can show you in a less than favorable light. The answer is e. All individuals and groups are needed to ensure that the team\u2019s mission is completed successfully. If any of these stakeholders are having difficulty meeting their commitments, they must be appropriately worked with to ensure the issue is satisfactorily resolved. History shows that once one group or person is treated differently or so-called \u201cspecial,\u201d it\u2019s typically that group that becomes the Achilles\u2019 heel of the team. The answer is e. When you make a mistake\u2014and we all do\u2014it is recommended to admit that you made the mistake. Doing so can take the wind away from some people\u2019s proverbial sails and allow people to focus on solving rather than the blame game. Now state what you plan to do to correct the mistake\u2014this is called being accountable. Next state what you plan to do so the same problem does not reoccur\u2014this is called being a professional. Lastly, do not carry guilt with you about the mistake. Learn from the experience and move on. The answer is e. Don\u2019t allow others to define you. You choose your own attitude; nobody chooses it for you. A positive attitude can be contagious but so can a negative one. People will look forward to being around and working with you if you have a positive attitude. If others\u2019 negative behavior is undermining your ability to achieve your commitments, then you must take action. However, if the person with the negative attitude has no influence within your domain of responsibility, then you can choose to do nothing. If you are around the person frequently, you may choose to encourage a change in her attitude or at least try to better understand what is behind it. The answer is d. Ask the questions. Better to have the misperception of looking stupid than proving stupid because you failed to ask the necessary questions. Do what you believe is the right thing to do. When you ask questions and listen to what people have to say, you learn things that you otherwise would not know. What other people think about you should never be more important than what you think about yourself. The answer is c. Schedule all meetings to begin at 10 minutes after the hour so that attendees can arrive on time from their last meeting. Allowing at least 10 minutes between meetings gives attendees time to travel, make calls or check email, and relax for a moment. Additionally, end all meetings 10 minutes before the hour, or earlier, so that attendees have time to get to their next meeting on time that will likely start on the hour. \nThis quiz and its answers, when openly discussed among the team leader and team members, provide a venue to ensuring that these expectations are clearly articulated across the team.

You're basically saying that in some cases men can be justified in acting badly. And that is not something that can stand.

Even the one, actual woman who anyone has identified is no longer speaking out against Franken. So why the fark is everyone else? Oh, yeah. Because it's a bunch of republicans who are happy to draw attention away from their latest batch of cartoon villainy.\nIf Franken resigns right now, all it does is send a message that republicans can get any democrat to resign by pulling out enough \"Quote: s\" and accusing them of unethical behavior. If he resigns at all, he should wait until there's an actual ethics investigation - that's why they exist in the first place.\nAnd with regards to \"acting badly\", it isn't about justification. At no point has Franken or anyone else tried to justify his behavior. What Franken did do is say that he farked up, apologized directly to the one woman in the photo, and has supported women in general with his policy, votes, and rhetoric.\nLiterally everything about this is weaponized propaganda designed to distract the public from the ridiculous events that are going on, and possibly weaken the opposition party.
