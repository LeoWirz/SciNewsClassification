accused of trying to break into a sex offender's home after seeing a video of him molesting a girl were not just stopping by to borrow a cup of sugar, a jury heard on Thursday.\nThey were not \"politely knocking on the door for a chat\", the prosecutor Rebecca Christensen said.\nShe told the ACT Supreme Court jury the men were there with the intent of harming or threatening the 62-year-old man.\nBut barristers for the men said the Crown relied on a witness, the alleged victim, whose inconsistent accounts of what happened that morning raised doubts.\nThe trial has heard that one of the men, Paul Arthur Palmer, 39, had a video on his phone that the sex offender had filmed of himself molesting an underage girl.\nMr Palmer told police that he went to the man's home only to bang on the door, show the man he had the video and to educate him.\nAdvertisement He said police had the video days ago but had not done anything about it.\nThe Crown says that at about 7am on February 20, Mr Palmer, along with Daniel James Nicholas, 32, and Joshua Darcy Watson, 33, went to the house and, armed with a knife, tried to force entry to hurt or threaten the man.\nThey have all pleaded not guilty to one count of attempted aggravated burglary.\nIn her closing address, Ms Christensen said the men were frustrated by what they saw as the police's lack of action, though detectives were pursuing the case.\nShe said the Crown did not say the men should not feel upset, angry, or even livid about the sex offender's acts.\nShe said that explains why they did what they did.\nBut no type of vigilante justice was acceptable, the prosecutor said, and when people take the law into their own hands the law says it will not be tolerated.\nShe described damage to the front door that was consistent with people trying to break in, she said.\nThe knife police found outside the house had a bend in the tip consistent with being used in the lock, Ms Christensen said.\nThe alleged victim hid in his room and called triple-o, which was more consistent with people trying to break in, she said.\nThat the men tried to flee from police revealed their guilty mind, she said.\nBut barristers for the three men said there were inconsistencies in the victim's account, and a close look at the evidence would give the jury a doubt.\nBarrister for Mr Watson, Beth Morrisroe, said there was no damage to the lock despite allegations one man was using a knife and to try to open it.\nShe said the man never told the triple-o operator about a knife, but \"wouldn't a weapon be the first thing you'd scream down the line?\"\nBarrister Alyn Doig, for Mr Nicholas, questioned how a door with minor damage could show a serious attempt to enter the premises.\nHe said the man first told police he heard yelling for him to open the door, and there was a lot more reality in that than his different account months later.\nIt \"doesn't cut the mustard\", he said.\nAnd the barrister for Mr Palmer, James Sabharwal, suggested the alleged victim may have embellished what happened.\nHe questioned whether the alleged victim had really heard wire being used in the lock from his second floor bedroom.\n\"You might think he had bionic hearing,\" he said.\nThe jury retired to consider its verdicts about 1pm Thursday.\nThey will return on Friday to continue deliberating.", "highlightText":

A book club, gardening group and another playgroup were also on the cards.\nThe cottage will be managed by the Suburban Land Agency for three years for the Mingle program, spokeswoman Jody Gleeson saying a use beyond that yet to be decided.\nAdvertisement But Ms Gleeson said the cottage, refurbished by the government at a cost of $350,000 and owned by the Property Group, was heritage-listed so could not be demolished. It is one of the \"few remaining examples of tied housing, housing provided for a holder of a particular occupation and attached to or close by their workplace\".\nYou will now receive updates from AM & PM Update Newsletter AM & PM Update Newsletter Get the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy . \nThe bonhomie of Wednesday's event was a long way from the fractious times of 2008 when Jenni and Peter Farrell were controversially evicted from the cottage, their home of 26 years. The government evicted them to make way for infrastructure works associated with the development of Molonglo.\nThe cottage was slated for demolition but saved after a successful campaign led by the Farrells, who nominated it with the ACT Heritage Council.\nTime has since marched on with Ms Berry on Wednesday publicly praising Mrs Farrell for putting her life at risk to save the cottage from destruction by the 2003 bushfires.\nNine years after being evicted from her home, Mrs Farrell said on Wednesday she was thrilled to be part of the re-opening of the cottage.\n\"It's just wonderful,\" she said. \"We could have just gone and let it all go.\"\nMs Gleeson said the Farrells were part of the history of the cottage and it was \"very special\" to have them represented at the opening.\n\"Putting the eviction and everything behind us, we're moving forward,\" she said.\nAt the opening, Robyn Gowing (nee Vest), gave an entertaining account of growing up in the cottage during the 1940s and 1950s with her parents and four siblings, the building then a remote outpost, where \"town\" was Kingston, a place her mother would visit two or three times a year for provisions, the store JB Young's making deliveries to the home in between.\n\"I can still hear Tom McGrath coming through the gate calling, 'Groceries',\" she said.\nMrs Gowing also remembered there was a sawmill where the RSPCA is now, chooks and lambs in the yard, a chip heater in the bathroom powered by pine cones and many happy times playing under the nearby pines.\nBack in 2008, the Farrells had hoped to remain caretakers of the cottage until a community use could be found. Instead, the government evicted them and spent thousands of dollars on security for the building.\nWhen asked on Wednesday why it had taken nine years to find a use for the cottage, Ms Gleeson said there were several things that had to be achieved first.\n\"We had to go through a heritage assessment, a conservation management plan, we had to build a sewer because the septic was non-functioning so we had to go through the standard building processes of a DA and building approvals. We had to make the cottage accessible. We had to go through all the hazardous materials checks so it was safe for a public facility. And then going through the heritage and restoration process. So a lot of these gardens have been restored. We also ran a six-month work for the dole program with 76 participants for the gardens and built a new path out of old Canberra bricks,\" she said.\n\"So it's taken that time, rather than just getting it opened and not having it functional. It's got to a safe place the community can now make their own.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "megan doherty", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "yvette berry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamila toderas  the gibbs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kate leith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gibbs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gleeson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jenni", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter farrell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jenni farrell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ms berry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrs farrell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jody gleeson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robyn gowing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamila toderas  nine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamila toderas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jenni farrel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beth gibbs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "farrell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles gibbs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom mcgrath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coombs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrs gowing", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "farrells", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "property group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "act heritage council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jb young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rspca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suburban land agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metters canberra", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "stromlo cottage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marina neil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cotter road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "molonglo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western creek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kingston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:56.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dfa3b8a6c64ee069e98f9ccebd622dd5eea333a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8CboiWUn3MfrZZ515IXzv96sicYTcg3pisGL.gbSLivg--", "site_full": "www.qnetnews.ca", "site": "qnetnews.ca", "site_section": "http://www.qnetnews.ca/?feed=rss2", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "QNetNews.ca", "title": "91X Newscast: Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, 4 p.m.", "title_full": "91X Newscast: Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, 4 p.m.", "published": "2017-12-06T23:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.qnetnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/qnetlogo-300x300.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dfa3b8a6c64ee069e98f9ccebd622dd5eea333a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8CboiWUn3MfrZZ515IXzv96sicYTcg3pisGL.gbSLivg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "andyclark", "published": "2017-12-06T23:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "91X Newscast: Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, 4 p.m.", "text": "91X Newscast: Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, 4 p.m. December 6, 2017 at 4:39 pm \nBELLEVILLE \u2013 Matthew Morgan brings you the latest news from the Quinte region.

Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez once against defends the House justice committee as it continues hearing the impeachment case against Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno. Rappler file photo \nMANILA, Philippines \u2013 What politics? \nSpeaker Pantaleon Alvarez on Thursday, December 7, insisted that the impeachment case against Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno is a constitutional more than a political process. \n\u201cFor me it is a constitutional process. Because it\u2019s part of the checks and balances between the executive, legislative, and judiciary,\u201d said Alvarez in an interview with Pinky Webb on CNN Philippines. \nAlvarez was asked about the ongoing impeachment hearing on a complaint filed against Sereno by lawyer Larry Gadon. The committee on justice, tasked to process impeachment complaints, has been holding hearings to determine probable cause. \nSpeaking to Webb, Alvarez said it was Sereno\u2019s duty to stand before the committee, a chance which she had turned down, thus far. Sereno had wanted her lawyers to represent her before the committee, but it barred her counsels from participating in proceedings. \n\u201cYou but have that obligation, because when you took your oath of office, you said, you swore to defend and protect the Constitution and the laws of the Republic of the Philippines,\u201d said Alvarez, quoting another Supreme Court justice, Noel Tijam, who is set to be a witness in the impeachment hearings. \nAlvarez also said it was \u201cunfair\u201d for Sereno to think that committee members had already \u201c pre-judged \u201d her. \n\u201cThat\u2019s an unfair statement. You know why? Because if we had pre-judgment, we should have pushed the impeachment case right away,\u201d said Alvarez, who previously said that the case must be fleshed out at the House before it is brought up to the Senate. \nAlvarez said this is because he does not want a repeat of the \u201cunfair\u201d impeachment of the late chief justice Renato Corona. Under House rules, an impeachment case immediately reaches plenary if it is endorsed by at least one-third of the House. \nThe Gadon complaint had 25 signatories. \nIn a press conference on December 6, Alvarez had also defended the House justice committee, saying it was out merely to find the truth in the impeachment complaint. He also said that so far, the hearings show that Sereno\u2019s denials have no basis . \nThe committee is expected to vote on probable cause by January 2018. It will forward the committee report \u2013 on whether to reject the complaint or impeach Sereno \u2013 to the plenary shortly after. If one-third of the House accept a report proposing Sereno\u2019s impeachment, she will be deemed impeached. \nThe Senate will then convene as an impeachment court. \u2013 Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

Christmas traditions? Kwanzaa celebrations? \nThe holiday celebrations always involve a lot of sugar-, fat- and carbohydrate-laden sweets and high-fat goodies. It can be a challenge to take part in seasonal celebrations and still maintain a semblance of control over your diet and blood glucose. \nFeasts for the Holidays \nDuring Hanukkah, the Jewish eight-day Festival of Lights, eating fried foods rich in oil is a tradition. Latkes (fried potato pancakes) served with apple sauce and sour cream and sufganiyot (jelly doughnuts) are some of the treats you will find at many Hanukkah meals. \nChristmas celebrations have a multitude of food traditions from many cultures. Some favorites are roasted turkey and ham, fruitcakes (yes, some people actually eat them), plum pudding, fancy cookies and eggnog. \nKwanzaa, a seven-day celebration rooted in African traditions, begins on December 26. Foods served at the sixth-night feast\u2014 black-eyed peas, okra, greens and sweet potatoes\u2014connect African-Americans to their heritage. \nSo, What\u2019s a \u2018Pumper\u2019 to Do? \nThese holiday feasts are a good reason to use the extended or square wave or the combination bolus functions in your pump. Some people have had success with giving 20 to 30 percent of the bolus for the total carb count at the start of the meal and setting an extended bolus for four or five hours for the higher-fat and higher-protein foods. \nYou might be someone who needs to use an extended bolus for the entire meal, lasting four to five hours. Is the \u201cbolus as you eat\u201d method your best option? \nEveryone is different, and food choices will vary. Practice at home with a few favorite foods before having a holiday feast. \nYou should keep extra blood glucose test strips on hand to check more often and make corrections, if needed. Go ahead, have that piece of pie, but do some homework beforehand to find out the carbohydrate, fat and calorie amounts and the type of bolus you need for whatever you plan to eat. You might also commit to an extra walk or a half hour of dancing to burn off the extra calories. \nIf you are concerned about added calories, explore the many low-fat recipes available on the Internet or get an appropriate cookbook from your local library or bookstore. \nLatkes can be made with shredded zucchini as well as potatoes and can be topped with applesauce or low-fat sour cream. Try using pan sprays to help lower the amount of fat used when frying; they don\u2019t have to be deep fried. Add a green salad or vegetables to increase the fiber in your meal. Include foods with high water content\u2014broth-based soups, fresh vegetables. Eat smaller portions of calorie-dense foods like pies, cakes and eggnog. Kwanzaa foods do not have to be cooked with large amounts of animal fats. Experiment with other flavorings, lean pork products and vegetarian meat substitutes. \nYour registered dietitian might have suggestions for reducing the fat and carbs in your traditional holiday favorites. \nHappy Pumping for the Holidays!

its mark both locally and internationally\" \u2013 Saudi curator, Hamza Serafi Gems of Arabia Meet the Saudi national breaking boundaries in the Middle Eastern art industry. Here Buro 24/7's columnist Hatem Alakeel speaks exclusively to Hamza Serafi about art, upcoming exhibitions and the Louvre Abu Dhabi... \nH \namza Serafi is a visionary. A true pioneer of the arts, through Hamza's vision many artist's dreams have been realised. He's opened many doors for those that follow in his footsteps and he's unleashed many untapped opportunities for Saudi Arabian artists to display their works and shed light on their dreams and passions. \nHamza has pioneered the art gallery movement in Saudi Arabia as a Co-Founder of ATHR Gallery and one of the founders of the Saudi Art Council. The latter created the 21,39 initiative which brings an influx of regional and international contemporary artists to Saudi Arabia including Ahmed Mater, Manal Aldowayan, Nasser Assalem, Dana Awartani, Atel Adnan and Muna Hatoon. \nPassionate about furthering the Kingdom's talent (and subsequent reach), Hamza continues to support its art movement through his various roles. Here, he talks to Buro 24/7 Middle East about the future of art in the Saudi and beyond... \nHow does it feel to be among those responsible for showcasing the artistic side of Saudi Arabia? \nI consider myself to be very lucky and I feel very blessed to be associated with the dynamic creative world of young and developed artists that inspired us with their art. \nWe are entering a more moderate and dynamic Saudi. Are you excited to see what artists will come up with given the changing times? Do you feel that the style and mood of artists will also change? \nSpirits are lifted in a time of positive change, particularly those of the artist, so it is indeed an exciting time for Saudi Arabia but more so for the artists. More material is available for artists, which was not available before. Artists are normally spectators; they question and analyse and then express situations through their works and sometimes, good artists can actually foresee the future and that is what's most exciting. \nThe opening of the Louvre Abu Dhabi signifies a dramatic shift in the Middle Eastern art scene. Do you see something of this magnitude also coming to KSA? \nThe narrative of the Louvre and the pieces that have been curated is very broad and dynamic \u2014 it gives us a wealth of information and raises questions that teach us that we are not the only civilians on Earth. This unifies us as humans and helps us to understand different civilisations and sends the younger generation, and future generations to come, a very positive message. I think this will inspire all the other countries in the region to come up with their own creative museums, hence we expect to see more museums in Saudi Arabia. In fact, KSA has already started establishing cultural centres focusing on culture which will no doubt support the art movement and museums. The Louvre Abu Dhabi is most definitely a milestone and not only in the art movement in the Gulf area or the middle east. I think it has changed the way people interact with museums. Source: http://www.buro247.me/fashion/mens/robert-tateossian-kuwait-s-king-of-cufflinks.html \nWhat's in store for Athar and 21.39 in the coming years? \nOn December 6, we will hold one of the most important exhibitions that we work on every two years. It's called Young Saudi Artists. There is a selection process \u2014 from which we choose the best Saudi talent \u2014 called Pulse, which is a symbolic measure whereby we read the pulse of Saudi youth, 70 percent of which is below the age of 30. We go through their vision of dreams and identity and how they envisage the future by visiting their past - taking us through their artistic journey. \nAs for 21,39, this coming year there will be an initiative by the Saudi Art Council. I am not at liberty to discuss it at the moment but rest assured something very special is in store to highlight the new progressive and exciting days we are now all living in Saudi Arabia. \nAt Athar, the show is going to be curated by Maya Khaleel and it's going to discuss the quest for truth and how artists see the truth, how they perceive it and what is, in fact, true and what is not. This is just a small brief of what's to come! \nThere will be a complete program by the Saudi Art Council for 21,39 whereby Jeddah becomes the facilitator for the arts. The most important part of this initiative is the education program that has been established. Last year we had over 6,000 students that visited the exhibition. This is one of the missions and goals of the Saudi Art Council: to educate the coming generations on contemporary art and demonstrate to them how it's all about ideas and statistics and to teach them creativity and self-expression. \nAs a pioneer of the KSA art movement, how far would you say the art scene has come since it was first recognised? \nThe art scene in Saudi Arabia is relatively young \u2014 it dates back to the late '50s, early '60s so I think that in spite of its recent evolution, the Saudi art movement has most definitely made its mark both locally and internationally. There are Saudi artists in museums such as Tate Modern, Guggenheim, MoMA and most recently Louvre Abu Dhabi. I also believe the best is yet to come. \nYou are also an artist. When can we expect to see some of your own work? \nFor me now my main priority is to cultivate and promote talent. I may go back to becoming an artist when I retire but to be honest, I don't see that happening anytime soon. \nWhat makes an artist successful? \n\u200fWhat you should learn is how to reflect your creativity and give back with your own personality \u2014 to give back to this gift of beauty that has been offered to you by the creator. And what you should learn is how to digest that and give back in the most humble way. \nWhat is style to you? \nI think style is the freedom to be what you want to be and the most important element is that the standard that you have created for yourself makes you happy. \nLess is more or more is more? \nI belong to the school of the old saying: \"The one of knowledge is the one of minimalism.\" Less is more fits my style more but then again that is a personal opinion.

The Sens and the United Way announced \u201cThe Face Off Against Poverty\u201d challenge at a media event Wednesday morning. The challenge will see donors who give $1,200 or more will face off against the Sens in an exhibition game in the new year. Specific details surrounding the game are still being sorted out. The United Way says it hopes to get at least 25 people to donate that much. \n\u201cIf we could organize a fun activity for after the new year with new leaders, it might just be different enough that people would jump on board,\u201d said Melanie Cressman, director of fundraising for the United Way of Hastings and Prince Edward. \nThe Senators also announced that they would be donating $10,000 to the United Way. \nRob Mullowney, the chief operating officer of the Belleville Senators, said it was important to the organization that they know where the money they donate is going. \n\u201cIn this case, with this group, the money stays here in our community,\u201d he said. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve said publicly that our actions speak louder than words, and so we want to be supporting our community, and we are proud to do that,\u201d said Mullowney.

Although we have to wait for some more time before Priyanka Chopra announces her next Bollywood project, it seems that the actress is grabbing eyeballs yet again for featuring in the list of Asia\u2019s Sexiest Woman and that too for being ranked on top. \nThe Eastern Eye which conducted the poll recently announced that Priyanka Chopra has regained her first position as Asia\u2019s Sexiest Woman after holding it in the years 2014 and 2015. However, this means that the actress has dethroned the 2016 winner of the poll, actress \u2013 friend, Deepika Padukone this year. This comes as yet another good news for Chopra whose second Hollywood film A Kid Like Jake got selected for the Sundance Film Festival a week ago. \nTalking about the honour, Priyanka Chopra however gives the credit for featuring on the list to genetics and optics. The actress also thanked everyone who voted for her and further added that she was been told that she won the poll with record breaking numbers of all times. On the other hand, curator of the list Asjad Nazir was all praises for the former beauty queen \u2013 actress terming her as an incredible ambassador of India. While he appreciated her courage to often experiment with the unknown, he also called her as a symbol of girl power. \nAlthough Priyanka Chopra isn\u2019t looking forward to much of Bollywood next year, the actress continues with the third season of her popular crime drama \u2018Quantico\u2019 in 2018. Furthermore, she also has a couple of Hollywood projects in the pipeline besides A Kid Like Jake , which includes Isn\u2019t It Romantic? and Seth Gordon\u2019s next.

However, sick people still got treatment for their ailments. In this generation, Alternative Medicine Cobb County is providing treatment for chronic diseases such as cancer. The long battle between elective drug and sensible pharmaceutical has every one of the reserves of being over with the nearness of equal solution. Usually experts of coherent medication looked descending on elective medicines as casual. Meanwhile, many trade healers rejected experts of consistent pharmaceutical as grandiose, saved and uncompassionate. Today the two sides appear to have denoted a truce and are attempting to find imparted insight. This common view involves a tradeoff called correlative arrangement. In equal helpful treatment, restorative teachers allow elective practices as long as they don't hurt the patient. An instance of corresponding medication would be for an authority to empower a patient to think or use an imperativeness treatment earlier and after that a short time later surgery. Both approach are neither awesome nor unpleasant. As a tried and true rule, the surprising remedy can be used to keep up general prosperity yet with respect to honest to goodness cases it is continually judicious to contact a standard expert. Another sort of remedy been imagined called integrative pharmaceutical tends to join the two, impacting the best to out of the two school of thought. In addition, faultfinders of choice arrangement may also describe it as treatment, treatment and examination that may be performed truly by unlicensed specialists. Regardless, there are more steady and impartial definitions that are recognized by most. A significant parcel of which deal just on the prosperity and affectivity of the alternative medicine without the security on money related premiums, political viewpoints and turf affirmation. One such definition is that alternative medication is a field of recovering, treatment and conclusion that are not established on controlled examinations. There are however a couple of medications that were once secured by elective pharmaceutical that are by and by recognized inside the therapeutic gathering since they overlooked underwriting their affectivity. On the backwards, there were helpful practices that are at present insulted inside the restorative circles since there are no noteworthy affirmations that show their capability in repairing. Truth be told, the term elective medication is exceptionally misleading. The two faultfinders and promoters of the said practices reinforce this view. Some assistance Western helpful practices are the choice meds since they were gone before by old-fashioned practices, which is genuinely substantial. Spoilers on elective solution assert that it isn't worth as being recognized by the remedial circles since it needs parts that may be used to help its capability. However many proclaim that once elective remedy is totally attempted, by then there would be amazing spaces for wide affirmation. Many do this for basic access to pharmaceuticals as no cure is required if there ought to emerge an event of alternative meds. Reports have shown that the customers of this solution are at a rising even in made countries. All around when we tumble down with an illness we make a trip our way to an authority and he at most conditions recommend a pharmaceutical which routinely enhances us feel. In any case, there are once in a while conditions when the consistent solutions don't work for us or essentially they can't recover the issue.

The concerns the residents raised included safety, volume of traffic, privacy and drainage issues. \nThe committee\u2019s unanimous decision to deny the application for the project was met with a round of applause. \n\nWith files from Katie Perry, QNet News. \nVaters said his primary concern was the proximity of the planned parking lot to his home, and that his family would be bothered by \u201clights and the noise bouncing back and forth between the wall of the apartment and the wall of my house. And the exhaust fumes, if they backed into their parking places because of the created land, probably would have had my carbon monoxide detectors go off on a regular basis if I had my bedroom windows open.\u201d \nPotential drainage problems if land that now absorbs rainwater and snow were covered with pavement was another of his concerns. \n\u201cI was rather in awe that any builder would go to the expense \u2026 to deviate the lay of the land and put underground superstructure \u2026 that would carry all this water to the storm sewers. That would be millions of dollars,\u201d he said. But if that weren\u2019t done, he said, \u201cthey were going to dump (the excess water) in the ditch of my backyard and in all of our backyards along the stretch \u2026 It would have washed out the foundation of my house.\u201d \nVaters said he was happy to have neighbours who were \u201cquite capable and able to speak (at the planning meeting) and had done a lot of research on the facts and figures and have spoken to all of us.\u201d \nTammy Robson, who has lived on Moira Lea Court for 15 years, said she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d when she received a notice about the proposed construction. \n\u201cThe primary issue that was brought up by myself and other residents was the safety concern with the volume of traffic that is on Farnham Road currently, and a number of entrances that they were planning to put on that piece of property,\u201d Robson said. Moira Lea Court resident Tammy Robson said she was \u201cecstatic\u201d that city council\u2019s planning committee rejected the development. Photo by Cali Doran, QNet News \nAfter the committee\u2019s decision, she said she was feeling \u201cecstatic.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s exactly what we wanted. I didn\u2019t expect the entire committee to see things our way, so I\u2019m very happy that they went in our favour.\u201d \nAnother Moira Lea Court resident, who declined to give her name, said a new apartment building and three semi-detached homes would have been intrusive to existing households. \n\u201cThey would have a full view of our backyards,\u201d she said. \u201cThe parking would go right to some of our property lines and \u2026 create noise and lights. It just seems like a very inappropriate place to put an apartment building, based on the small piece of land.\u201d \nShe said the residents didn\u2019t get a lot of notice about the planned construction and she was happy and relieved after the committee\u2019s decision. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some people who have been here for a long time, and we also have some new move-ins who picked this location for various specific reasons. And they value their privacy.\u201d \nMike Keene of Fotenn Consultants was at the meeting to represent one of the developers, Geertsma Homes Ltd. He asked the committee to defer a decision on the project to give the companies more time to respond to the residents\u2019 concerns. \n\u201cI couldn\u2019t foresee the outcome,\u201d Keene said after the project was rejected. \u201cNow that we have a denial on the table, I don\u2019t know what our solutions will be.\u201d The audience cheered after the unanimous decision against the motion #qnetnews pic.twitter.com/vQCHI3F1nY", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "moira lea court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dariya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vaters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tammy robson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katie perry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark vaters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baiguzhiyeva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cali doran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike keene", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "geertsma homes ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fotenn consultants", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "belleville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "farnham road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maitland drive", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belleville", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:38:00.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bcbbc7434dd38ca36a8385289bfe211466be0bca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg93Ai8AfUnTTWWv6q.A_lmGAZ2nSnxgp7uT2gtgYXRkajBsTQFnRMt7E1NSf29vT14Z4_KNvH6B9Cic7OIx9vInZlqty_vJ5A6X_NY9tCFuXA--", "site_full": "www.ebay.com", "site": "ebay.com", "site_section": "http://www.watchinga.com/il/shopping/business.rss?utm_source=watchinga&utm_medium=categorypage&utm_term=gowatchinga_business&utm_content=shopping&utm_campaign=rssfeed", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Business Shopping on Watchinga", "title": "1884 Indian Head Penny No Reserve (IHL10M)", "title_full": "1884 Indian Head Penny No Reserve (IHL10M)", "published": "2017-12-07T05:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3NFgxMDgx/z/DwYAAOSwz~pZ9ehh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bcbbc7434dd38ca36a8385289bfe211466be0bca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg93Ai8AfUnTTWWv6q.A_lmGAZ2nSnxgp7uT2gtgYXRkajBsTQFnRMt7E1NSf29vT14Z4_KNvH6B9Cic7OIx9vInZlqty_vJ5A6X_NY9tCFuXA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T05:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "1884 Indian Head Penny No Reserve (IHL10M)", "text": "Image not available Photos not available for this variation View previous 1884 Indian Head Penny No Reserve (IHL10M) Condition:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:38:00.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c3ed68f4d3df92ef29b39041198c74891ab07cd4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0A6zwJJyUUNNqq2geZRoj7w8dPLlLoBI9H7Y5s42FErz7eZipoAKqP2a7DZetmbwZ9bC0Q.0AgXcCrfc01aGPjnCu1XFQbrI-", "site_full": "www.infosecurity-magazine.com", "site": "infosecurity-magazine.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["hacking", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "#BHEU Social Engineer Show How Get to Easy Cash -

In his example, he targeted users of a small ISP where he found multiple forum posts in which people had complained about email not working. So he posed as a member of staff from the ISP on a day when the target was known to expect a phishing attack, pretended to be from quality assurance and targeted the person needed to sign off a software update to move forward. \nCrumbaugh gave a number of tips to success, including creating an \u201cus versus the world\u201d scenario and to try to have teamwork and do cooperation, create a world, always have someone to blame (the my boss rule) and apologize for taking their time up. He said that he was ultimately able to achieve the trust of the target, and eventually get control of their PC \u201cas people are inherently lazy.\u201d \nThis culminated with Crumbaugh being invited into the company, where he was in a position to be able to compromise every machine, and he was able to walk into an open vault and take a selfie with a stack of money. \nOn the blue team side, he recommended creating a way for staff to identify a vendor, such as a passphrase to provide a way to for members of staff to identify them as a vendor. He also highlighted statistics which showed that users click on more educational emails than phishing emails, and sales people will typically click on phishing emails the most, so education should be tailored to be more effective. \nHe also recommended tailoring training using social media rules with short but effective messages, and integrate training everywhere to keep it at the front of mind and understand that \u2018mass customization\u2019 and the \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach doesn\u2019t work. \n\u201cSocial engineering is your biggest risk,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy be in the DMZ when you can be in user land?

On the contrary, it definitely takes a lot more than just making up your mind and creating an exercise regimen before you can actually say that you are in the process of achieving a physically fit lifestyle. Why do we need to work out? What\u2019s the harm in just enjoying the luxuries of life? After all, we are inclined to work our way towards a more facilitated, comfortable and less-exhausting life, right? Well, to live that \u201cluxurious\u201d life that every average person dreams of and strives for, you need to have health. You need to have the energy, the stamina and the endurance to live up to those beautiful moments that bring smiles and laughter even in your retirement phase. Whether it\u2019s your kids\u2019 graduation day, their high school prom, wedding ceremonies or your grandchildren\u2019s birthdays, the only way you will be able to enjoy those precious times is if you have the strength and vitality for them. Keeping in good shape and maintaining a healthy living are beneficial in a number of ways. Not only do exercise and activity boost your life expectancy but also help you thrive and feel less fatigued. In fact, your energy levels tend to go down at a much slower rate so you can still move around; being able to take a walk, participate in club activities and go for a swim or hike every once in a while. You can enhance your flexibility and control your weight by following an effective exercise and diet plan that fits into your daily routine. Since regular exercise and healthy eating habits tend to minimize your risks of various illnesses, you can bet that you won\u2019t have to face all those high end medical treatments and will be able to use your earnings for the sake of more productive investments. Your overall expenditures and cost of living are minimized to a great extent if you stick to a balanced diet and daily physical exertion. Your body is meant for everybody activity. You either \u201cuse it or lose\u201d. Having a healthy body is no doubt appealing to the eyes. Once you learn to stay fit and come to love yourself every time you look into the mirror, it boosts your confidence to a whole new level. You feel empowered the moment you achieve your target of running a certain number of miles or when you bench-press the weight you aimed for.

(Not that I usually can anyway).\n\nSo this is \"Theoretically\" my second unit of Punjabi Indians for the Back of Beyond. I still have 8 to paint. As yet I am not fixed on unit size so while there could be 3 units of 8 there could equally be 2 units of 12!

Around 30 per cent of that funding came from education property tax \u2013 taxes collected by municipalities from property owners and given to the local school boards \u2013 while the remaining 70 per cent came from the ministry. \nLocally, the Hastings Prince Edward District School Board received $185 million for the 2016-17 school budget and $192 million for the current school year, according to Kerry Donnell, the board\u2019s communications officer. \u201cSchool boards are funded on a per-student basis,\u201d she explained. \n\u201cIt\u2019s based on enrolment. Essentially there\u2019s a funding formula by the Ministry of Education and they factor in the number of students times various components of the funding factor, and that is what determines the school boards\u2019 budgets.\u201d \nThe report by Auditor General Bonnie Lysyk says that across the province, grants for special-education purposes are not always given in accordance with the number of students in the program. If the ministry gave special-education funding based on the number of students receiving special education, $111 million would have been distributed differently across the province\u2019s boards, it says. \nBased on this, 39 boards would have received on average $2.9 million more in funding, while 33 boards would have received $3.4 million less. \nLysyk\u2019s report also says that the ministry doesn\u2019t know if additional funding given to school boards because of their areas\u2019 socio-economic conditions, geographic location or cost of teachers\u2019 salaries is actually going toward its intended purpose. \nHer report also raises concern about a rise in the number of sick days being taken by school-board employees. Over the five-year period ending in 2016, there was an increase of 29 per cent in the number of sick days taken, it says. \nScott Marshall, president of District 29 (Hastings-Prince Edward) of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers\u2019 Federation, said that being a teacher is a very stressful job and often teachers come to work even when they\u2019re sick. \n\u201cIf you look at the statistics, you see that the number of stress-related diseases in the profession are much higher then elsewhere,\u201d said Marshall. \u201cThere are statistics supporting an increase of violence in the classrooms today. It\u2019s concerning that the number of illnesses are where they are at, but I would often say teachers come in when they are ill too. They are very dedicated to being there.\u201d \nThe report recommends that the ministry ensure school boards develop effective attendance-support programs. \nThat recommendation was one of 15 in the section of the report dedicated to school boards\u2019 management of financial and human resources. \nLysyk reports that math scores in the province remain under the provincial standard and suggests the ministry develop a plan of action to improve students\u2019 math skills. Students in the local public board have consistently remained below the average in Grades 3, 6 and 9 in provincial testing carried out by the Education Quality and Accountability Office. \nBut Marshall said the provincewide testing is limited in determining student achievement: \u201cAll the concerns about what standardized testing does are playing out as we see the EQAO in all the schools.\u201d \nThe final recommendation by the auditor general is that the Ministry of Education make sure taxpayer dollars given to school boards are used for their intended purpose.

This reason was followed closely by lack of time (15 percent) and sophisticated technologies (15 percent). \nLack of employee know-how does not appear to be a reason for the slow pace of digitalization in the midmarket. Just 8 percent of the SMEs found this to be the biggest challenge and only 7 percent see poor planning as a problem for their digital journey.

The internet controls the whole world is in constant communication. This communication is facilitated by various social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and one that is not very common which is blogging. Through multicultural food blog , one is able to share various methods of cooking and even new recipes. Blogging as a whole can be used in the discussion of various topics such as politics, science, gossip and even food ideas. This blogging has enabled people to share various foods from their cultures and also get thoughts from people around the world. Professional chefs have also been able to market their restaurants and recipes online especially by using photographic evidence. One of the things that do not allow the world to move in unison is racism. This can actually be brought to an end through food blogging. Every race is very rich with different recipes. In order to explore, one needs to develop a sense of respect for people of all races. You can actually learn a lot by discovering a lot about their food. This will actually cause love to develop among people worldwide. Food blogging also reduces racism a great deal. This is because if the blogging is multicultural, it includes professionals from every race all around the world. This will cause the interested people to put aside their hate if they want to get something useful from the post. Once you try what you learnt on your own, you see that people from the culture are not as terrible as you may have previously thought. The more food blogs you follow, the more appreciative you become of other cultures. This is because as they get to explain why they do the things they do and in turn you learn why they are the way they are. You get to understand them on a whole other level. When you understand why things happen the way they do, they cease to bother you and you get to see the positive side of it all. Food bloggers have also done a great job of bringing people from different cultures together. People are eager to learn and they all ask questions on the same blog without caring if they are of the same culture or not. No one is left out as they also get to contribute a little on how the same thing is done back in their country. Through interaction with different people on different blogs, culture is diversified. You can actually take different recipes and try coming up with new dishes. If you are an aspiring chef, you can actually come up with a whole new menu of a combination of different foods. You can be sure that everyone will appreciate the food and it will sell remarkably fast as long as you got the recipe right. People like trying out new things. Apart from all the above reasons why multicultural blogs are so great, there is also the fact that you get to discover a whole lot of new things. You may get to learn the uses of a spice that you did not even know existed.
