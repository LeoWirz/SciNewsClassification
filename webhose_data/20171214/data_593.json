Is it surprising that there has been no cabinet discussion of the final trade deal? Not if you accept the parallel I draw here between Brexit and Trump. Brexit is an expression of ideology or feeling, an act of faith. An impact assessment is therefore beside the point, and just dangerous to the project. I think you only get outraged by this if you haven\u2019t really accepted what the true nature of Brexit is, and how it came to pass. By this I do not mean why people voted for Brexit, but why a large section of the UK press and Conservative party made it their primary political project. The true nature of Brexit means that the normal rules of politics do not apply, and could not apply. \nI was surprised about Ireland. I did not realise until September [1] what it would require from Theresa May. Back in March as Article 50 was triggered I thought that would inevitably mean an open ended transition period (despite lots of talk about 2 years), and so the final destination of Brexit would not be decided until after the next election. If the Conservatives lost that, Corbyn would satisfy himself that the EU would not hinder his economic programme, and we would end up staying in the Customs Union and Single Market (CU&SM). [2] \nBut will the question of the Irish border change that? Those that constructed the Article 50 process understood that any country leaving the EU would be desperate for a deal, which is why there is a two stage process. The two stage structure maximises the chance that the EU will get the deal they want on the first stage issues. In terms of citizen\u2019s rights and the leaving bill that has proved correct. \nWhat the EU realised long before the UK was that Brexit involved a unique problem. The UK\u2019s only land border with the remaining EU could not be allowed to become a hard border without putting the Good Friday agreement at serious risk. Yet the EU requires a hard border, and the WTO would insist that the UK recognised that (again Brexiter talk of not building one is just nonsense). Ireland\u2019s most important priority was that there should be no hard border, and as a result the rest of the EU agreed to make that part of the first stage. \nOnce again, this shows you the nature of the Brexit project. Any Brexiter interested in reality would have realised that Brexit put the Good Friday agreement at serious risk, any would have at least thought about the problem. But Brexit is not a reality based project, and so they did not. We should be thankful that the Irish government made this a priority. \nIn simple terms there are therefore only two possibilities for Brexit that avoid a hard border. Either the UK stays in the Customs Union and Single Market (CU&SM), or just Northern Ireland does and there is a sea border between two parts of the UK. The UK government still wants to pretend that other possibilities exist: something technological or that the stage 2 agreement they come to will not require a hard border. But the Irish government quite rightly insists that if neither of those two happen, the UK government recognise that at least part of the UK will stay in the CU&SM. That in the agreement the UK almost signed a few days ago. \nIt was scuppered because the DUP quite rightly wanted to know which of these two arrangements the UK government had in mind. Above all else, the DUP do not want a sea border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, because they see that as making unification much more likely. I suspect the fact that whatever May said in her last minute phone call was not enough to satisfy the DUP means they will be prepared to bring down the government unless they get some sort of public guarantee that there will be no sea border. \nIn which case, May will finally have to call the Brexiters' bluff. Maybe she can convince them to keep faith in their rhetoric that there is a technological fix (there isn\u2019t ) or there will be a final trade agreement that deals with the problem (there won\u2019t be) and let her commit to no sea border in the eventuality that neither happen. If she cannot, their only other option is the nuclear one of trying to force May out. As the latest poll I have seen suggests the Conservative party membership\u2019s favoured candidate is Someone Else, that looks like a risky move. But if they take that risk, Ireland will indeed have made a difference. \nBut if they do not, and May does sign up to stage 2 on the basis of UK membership of CU&SM as the fallback position, does that change anything? You would think it should, but because it is the fallback position the UK government will start negotiations over a transition arrangement and a final trade agreement. After we officially leave May will then resign and the Conservatives will set about the task of trying to win the next election. Trade negotiations with the EU will be put on the back burner. We end up at in exactly the same place as I expected we would be back in March. \nThe only difference is that it will be blindingly obvious that this is all for show. Having signed up to staying in CU&SM as a default, the EU has zero interest in concluding any other kind of agreement, particularly as it will not safeguard the border. It will just be a matter of time before the arrangement whereby we stay in the CU&SM is formalised. But will any British politician that matters have the courage to tell the British people the truth? \nThe truth is that all their vote has achieved is that they will now have no say in the rules the UK has to follow. Instead whoever wins the next election will come back with some \u2018deal\u2019 over freedom of movement which few still care about because no one is coming to the failing UK economy. And of course the Brexiters will cry betrayal because we are, as far as they are concerned, still in the EU, and we will be back to where we were before the referendum, except with no say in the rules we have to obey. \nI would really like to think that this can be avoided. Perhaps before we formally leave the EU, enough Conservative MPs (and despite all the noise from some Remainers about Corbyn, it is Conservative MPs who matter) will put country before party and call for a second referendum. Ireland increases that possibility, but from the evidence so far I do not see it happening. \n[1] As someone told me, being ahead of the UK MSM on this is a very low bar. \n[2] For all those who insist that the Labour leadership wants to leave, you have to realise two things. First, by the time Corbyn takes over we will have left, and he has no interest in pursuing the sunny uplands of trade deals with countries like the US. Second, there is nothing in the CU&SM that really hinders his immediate economic programme. So why leave the CU&SM just after he gets elected? It would profoundly alienate those who voted for him and damage the economy on his watch.

BMW choosing to retain the upright, off-road look for the new G01 BMW X3 means that it\u2019s the only rugged looking player in the segment. \nThe second-generation Audi Q5 \u2013 also an evolution of a well-received original \u2013 has a more urbane, crossover style; ditto the Mercedes-Benz GLC , a newcomer that\u2019s now a fixture in the posh Bangsar-Damansara Heights enclave. \nAway from the Germans, the Lexus NX \u2018s super sharp origami design is an acquired taste, while the second-gen XC60 is distinctively Volvo. Anglophiles will be paying over the odds for the Jaguar F-Pace . Whatever your preference, there\u2019s a premium midsize SUV for you, but bear in mind that the Q5 and XC60 currently sold in Malaysia are previous-generation models on their last legs \u2013 both were launched here in 2009. \nThe same design concept does not mean that it looks the same, though. The third-generation X3 is the boldest and most dynamic looking one to date, and that\u2019s apparent once new and old are viewed side-by-side. \u201cPowerful and sophisticated, like a football player in a suit,\u201d is how G01 X3 exterior designer Calvin Luk sums up the new SUV in a sentence. \nIn our exclusive walk-around video with the man who penned the car, the young Australian talks us through the X3\u2019s bold new face (larger and higher kidney grille, deletion of the X-car signature \u2018third eye\u2019 fog lamp), squarish wheel arches, pronounced shoulder crease, sculpturing on the flanks and strong shoulders. \nAlong with the more imposing looks is a slightly larger footprint. The latest X3 is 60 mm longer and 10 mm wider than before, with 54 mm of the newfound length going into the wheelbase. \nRear-end highlights include 3D sculpted tail lamps, a downward-sloping spoiler and horizontal lines to emphasise width. The M40i\u2019s square tail pipes mimic the shape of the wheel arches. Luk also introduces us to what I feel is one of the most improved aspects of the G01 \u2013 the interior. \nPersonally, I\u2019m a big fan of what the 30-year old has done for BMW so far. He transformed one of Munich\u2019s ugliest ducklings into something palatable ( F20 1 Series facelift ) and is also credited with the current F48 X1 (a big shift in design and concept for the baby X) and the Concept Z4 that we saw in July, one of BMW\u2019s most stunning showcars in recent times. What do you think of the new X3\u2019s looks? \nThe G01 you see here is the new M40i range topper, an M Performance answer to the likes of Audi\u2019s SQ5 and the Mercedes-AMG GLC 43 . It\u2019s powered by a 3.0 litre inline-six engine with 360 hp and 500 Nm of torque from 1,250 to 4,800 rpm. Paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission and xDrive, it does 0-100 km/h in just 4.8 seconds with the help of launch control. \nAway from the M40i, BMW offers the X3 in usual 20i, 30i, 20d and 30d forms. The petrols are the latest 2.0 litre turbocharged units with 184 hp/290 Nm (20 Nm more, 0-100 km/h 8.3s) and 252 hp/350 Nm (7 hp more than old 28i, 0-100 km/h 6.3s). The ZF eight-speeder and xDrive are standard across the range, but the base petrol version that will surface in Q2 2018 can also be had without AWD (sDrive20i). \nThe G01 X3 isn\u2019t just a better drive, it\u2019s an all-round better SUV too, as you\u2019ll read about in our full review . Coming to Malaysia next year. \nGALLERY: G01 BMW X3 M40i in Portugal Research BMW Cars at", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "calvin luk", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "calvin l", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "luk", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "volvo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "audi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mercedes-benz glc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaguar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bmw", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "munich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portugal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bangsar-damansara heights", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:25.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "223a0bdbf36b915b5aa556c55b93b80b984f55b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AHhdzglx.ii.mTiwKTi.uO.pCoijqBrvAEkWlReLe718ARs.xtGQWrwHPEvOkLM9M3I9H2HdeWUn1M.tUN.y.eDcCT06H1JMWhAztYqBumYfM-", "site_full": "markets.financialcontent.com", "site": "financialcontent.com", "site_section": "http://finance.dailyherald.com/dailyherald/action/rssfeed?ChannelID=3241", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "Reuters: Top News", "title": "Luxury brands lifted by EU court backing for online sales ban", "title_full": "Luxury brands lifted by EU court backing for online sales ban", "published": "2017-12-06T14:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 86243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "223a0bdbf36b915b5aa556c55b93b80b984f55b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AHhdzglx.ii.mTiwKTi.uO.pCoijqBrvAEkWlReLe718ARs.xtGQWrwHPEvOkLM9M3I9H2HdeWUn1M.tUN.y.eDcCT06H1JMWhAztYqBumYfM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T14:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "Luxury brands lifted by EU court backing for online sales ban", "text": "December 06, 2017 at 07:09 AM EST Luxury brands lifted by EU court backing for online sales ban LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) -

It costs nothing, saves on mobile data, and is often faster when it comes to downloading. However, as much as we love the convenience, hackers love public Wi-Fi too, and for different reasons.\nNastassja Poorter, Enterprise Sales Director at DRS, a Cognosec AB company, says there are several ways cyber crooks can access an individual\u2019s private information, and even steal their identity or capture their banking logins through public Wi-Fi.\nOne of the ways in which they can do this, is through Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, during which a hacker intercepts communications between two parties. While they may think their communications are private, and that data is being shared directly between the server and the client, the link is in fact being intercepted by a 3rd party. The attacker can then alter the communication, and display, for example, a fake or phishing Website, or send a message of his own.\n\u201cPublic Wi-Fi is particularly susceptible to attacks of this nature, due to the fact that any HTTP site data being transmitted is unencrypted, effectively rendering your data public. Through compromised routers, attackers can steal reams of personal information, and give an attacker access to financial logins, private messages, user names and passwords. People should never, under any circumstances, do online banking transactions or share any personal information with others while using public Wi-Fi.\u201d\nSo what can users do? Check for secure sites, ones that have https:// instead of just http in front of them. \u201cCertificates denoted by the \u2019s\u2019 mean the Web site is more secure, and offers a decent level of encryption, so only use such sites when accessing personal information,\u201d says Poorter.\nThe next thing users of public Wi-Fi need to be aware of are \u2018Evil Twin\u2019, or fake, Wi-Fi connections. \u201cIn these attacks, a cyber criminal sets their service identifier (SSID) to be the same as an access point (AP) at the local hotspot or wireless network. He can then disrupt or disable the genuine AP by disconnecting it, directing a denial of service attack against it, or creating radio frequency interference around it. This is particularly cunning, as it bypasses any security systems a public Wi-Fi hotspot might have in place,\u201d she explains.\nShe advises users to be very suspicious should two network connections show up that have a similar name, and if possible, make use of a virtual private network (VPN). This will establish a level of encryption between the user and a Web site, so any data that could potentially be intercepted is unreadable to a cyber criminal unless they have the decryption key, which they don\u2019t.\nAccording to her, the next danger associated with public Wi-Fi is packet sniffing. \u201cEvery time there is data transmitted over the Internet, irrespective of whether it's an email, Google Search or retail transaction, the data is broken down into digital information that is sent in data packets. The packets are labelled and addressed with instructions explaining where they are going to. Millions of data packets move between destinations all the time, uninterrupted,\u201d she explains.\n\u201cHowever, and here\u2019s the caveat: If someone has installed sniffing hardware or software somewhere on the network, they can eavesdrop, snatch that data in mid-transmission just long enough to \u2018sniff\u2019 or inspect it, and if found to be interesting or valuable, quickly capture and copy it before sending it on its way. This is done without anyone being the wiser. Packet sniffing is like wiretapping for the Internet.\u201d\nPacket sniffers can read emails, see passwords, view your Web history, and more alarmingly, capture account information such as logins and credit card numbers in detail. \u201cAgain, I recommend turning to strong encryption, in the form of a VPN to avoid this scourge,\u201d says Poorter.\n\u201cAnother danger of public Wi-Fi is sidejacking, or session hijacking. In these instances, an attacker will essentially steal a user\u2019s access to a Web site by using a packet sniffer to get their hands on an unencrypted cookie that grants access to the site in question. This technique allows the cyber crook to impersonate the user, as the session cookie is already providing access to the Web site's content. Alarmingly, sidejacking bypasses encryption to some degree.\u201d\nPoorter says although attackers can\u2019t read a password through this technique, they could still download malicious software that could, and get their hands on enough information to make stealing your identity a breeze. \u201cAgain, make use of https:// and VPNs to secure against this type of threat.\u201d\nBy Nastassja Poorter, Enterprise Sales Director at DRS \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "poorter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nastassja poorter", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cognosec ab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:26.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "05dde5a656d6c1193de581925903bb7568fa9065", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJe2pyJcSHHJQLVbuEE5A_2dDpK7i6Lm9ijeOyMIyyAqSHCq3fnSaH.zdx1734wFJVNCF58XA849cQz0UXNHLE0FNEAB78BpQf", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Rugs-Area-Rugs/N-5yc1vZarjg/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "Unique Loom Monaco Beige 9 12 3134071", "title_full": "Unique Loom Monaco Beige 9 ft. x 12 ft.

Check for secure sites, ones that have https:// instead of just http in front of them. \u201cCertificates denoted by the \u2019s\u2019 mean the Web site is more secure, and offers a decent level of encryption, so only use such sites when accessing personal information,\u201d says Poorter.\nThe next thing users of public Wi-Fi need to be aware of are \u2018Evil Twin\u2019, or fake, Wi-Fi connections. \u201cIn these attacks, a cyber criminal sets their service identifier (SSID) to be the same as an access point (AP) at the local hotspot or wireless network. He can then disrupt or disable the genuine AP by disconnecting it, directing a denial of service attack against it, or creating radio frequency interference around it. This is particularly cunning, as it bypasses any security systems a public Wi-Fi hotspot might have in place,\u201d she explains.\nShe advises users to be very suspicious should two network connections show up that have a similar name, and if possible, make use of a virtual private network (VPN). This will establish a level of encryption between the user and a Web site, so any data that could potentially be intercepted is unreadable to a cyber criminal unless they have the decryption key, which they don\u2019t.\nAccording to her, the next danger associated with public Wi-Fi is packet sniffing. \u201cEvery time there is data transmitted over the Internet, irrespective of whether it's an email, Google Search or retail transaction, the data is broken down into digital information that is sent in data packets. The packets are labelled and addressed with instructions explaining where they are going to. Millions of data packets move between destinations all the time, uninterrupted,\u201d she explains.\n\u201cHowever, and here\u2019s the caveat: If someone has installed sniffing hardware or software somewhere on the network, they can eavesdrop, snatch that data in mid-transmission just long enough to \u2018sniff\u2019 or inspect it, and if found to be interesting or valuable, quickly capture and copy it before sending it on its way. This is done without anyone being the wiser. Packet sniffing is like wiretapping for the Internet.\u201d\nPacket sniffers can read emails, see passwords, view your Web history, and more alarmingly, capture account information such as logins and credit card numbers in detail. \u201cAgain, I recommend turning to strong encryption, in the form of a VPN to avoid this scourge,\u201d says Poorter.\n\u201cAnother danger of public Wi-Fi is sidejacking, or session hijacking. In these instances, an attacker will essentially steal a user\u2019s access to a Web site by using a packet sniffer to get their hands on an unencrypted cookie that grants access to the site in question. This technique allows the cyber crook to impersonate the user, as the session cookie is already providing access to the Web site's content. Alarmingly, sidejacking bypasses encryption to some degree.\u201d\nPoorter says although attackers can\u2019t read a password through this technique, they could still download malicious software that could, and get their hands on enough information to make stealing your identity a breeze. \u201cAgain, make use of https:// and VPNs to secure against this type of threat.\u201d\nBy Nastassja Poorter, Enterprise Sales Director at DRS \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:26.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "05dde5a656d6c1193de581925903bb7568fa9065", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJe2pyJcSHHJQLVbuEE5A_2dDpK7i6Lm9ijeOyMIyyAqSHCq3fnSaH.zdx1734wFJVNCF58XA849cQz0UXNHLE0FNEAB78BpQf", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Rugs-Area-Rugs/N-5yc1vZarjg/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "Unique Loom Monaco Beige 9 12 3134071", "title_full": "Unique Loom Monaco Beige 9 ft. x 12 ft.

The global calcium nitrate market stood at 15,215.40 kilotons in 2015.\nCalcium nitrate is a colorless salt produced by treating limestone with nitric acid. It also obtains during the absorption of nitrogen oxide by the milk of lime. Calcium nitrate is mainly used as a component in fertilizers but has other applications. Calcium nitrate prevents odor in wastewater by creating an anoxic biology, which stops the metabolism of odor-producing sulfates.\nBrowse detail report with in-depth TOC @ \nhttps://www.zionmarketresearch.com/report/calcium-nitrate-market \nThe calcium nitrate market is expected to witness noticeable growth is the years to come owing to gradually increasing global demand for grain crops coupled with strong demand for wastewater treatment in emerging economies is anticipated to fuel demand for calcium nitrate. According to the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), about 200,000 people are added to the world food demand every day. Water quality is emerging as an important issue in developing countries such as India and China. Thus, increasing demand for calcium nitrate in wastewater treatment industry is further expected to boost the market demand in the coming years. However, calcium nitrate may cause some problems because of its hygroscopic nature. Thus, its high hygroscopic nature coupled with increasing healthcare awareness regarding its hazardous properties may hamper the market growth in the years to come. Nonetheless, calcium nitrate has been used for past few years as molten salt in solar power tower. Growing CSP market is projected to open up new growth avenues in the near future.\nOn the basis of applications, the market can be segmented into fertilizers, concrete manufacturing, explosives, wastewater treatment, and other applications. Fertilizer was the leading segment and it held more than 50% share of total consumption in 2015. The use of nitrogenous fertilizers such as calcium nitrate in oilseeds and grains is rising owing to an increase in demand for grains and oilseeds such as soybeans, wheat, and corn. Wastewater treatment also expected to exhibit significant growth within the forecast period. Calcium nitrate is used to emit odor in wastewater by producing an anoxic biology, which impedes the metabolism of odor-producing sulfates.\nRequest Free Sample copy of Research Report @ \nhttps://www.zionmarketresearch.com/sample/calcium-nitrate-market \n(Purchase Single User License at $4199) \nThe calcium nitrate market was dominated by Asia Pacific with the largest share of the total market in 2015. The dominance of Asia-Pacific is expected to be maintained in the years to come on account of rising demand for food crops in emerging economies especially in China and India, which is anticipated to boost consumption of calcium nitrate-based fertilizers. North America held 18.5% of the market share in 2015, followed by Europe in terms of volume. This growth is mainly due to increase population coupled with the increase in per capita consumption.\nGlobal calcium nitrate is moderately consolidated in nature. Some of the key players in the market such as ADOB Chemical(Poland), Wentong Group (China), The Chemical Company (U.S.), URALCHEM (Russia), Airedale Chemical (UK), GFS Chemicals, Inc. (U.S.), SHANXI JIAOCHENG TIANLONG CHEMICAL INDUSTRY CO., LTD (China), Agrium (Canada), Yara International ASA (Norway), Haifa Chemicals Ltd. (Israel) and Sterling Chemicals (India) among others.

Too bad Republicans seem to act differently in their at least tepid support for Republican Roy Moore. Are Democrats shooting themselves in the foot by taking the moral high ground? I still say the problem is more about power than sexuality. There are also degrees of offense. It does seem like there is a lot of hypocrisy in each party. Do people's personal dealings measure up to their campaign rhetoric? In many cases I'm sure it doesn't. Lots of great politicians are lousy bosses. I wouldn't be surprised if many are lousy landlords, lousy drivers, folks with a heavy carbon footprint and so forth. How we live at the grassroots level is often not what we espouse.

This is a meta-analysis of the efficacy and tolerability of azapirones for schizophrenia based on randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (RCTs). English and Chinese databases were systematically and independently searched by two investigators. Data were extracted and analyzed using the RevMan software (version 5.3). Seven RCTs (n = 368) of azapirones (buspirone in 6 RCTs and tandospirone in 1 RCT) were identified and analyzed. Only adjunctive buspirone outperformed placebo regarding total psychopathology [standardized mean difference: \u22121.03 (95% confidence interval (CI): \u22121.91, \u22120.15), P = 0.02; I2 = 92%], but the significance disappeared in sensitivity analysis after removing two outlying studies, and in 10 of the 12 subgroup analyses. In 5 RCTs examining neurocognitive function of azapirones, only 2 RCTs found the superiority of buspirone in improving attention/speeded motor performance, verbal and performance intelligence. Adjunctive buspirone outperformed placebo regarding extrapyramidal symptoms [SMD:-0.51, (95%CI: \u22120.99, \u22120.02), P = 0.04; I2 = 0%]. Similar rates of discontinuation [risk ratio:1.06 (95%CI:0.54, 2.07), P = 0.86, I2 = 0%] and adverse drug reactions were found between both groups. Adjunctive buspirone and tandospirone failed to show efficacy for psychotic symptoms, but adjunctive buspirone may be associated with improvement in extrapyramidal symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Due to the preliminary nature of this meta-analysis, larger sample size and higher quality RCTs are needed to confirm these finding.\nKeywords:\nAzapirone, Buspirone, Tandospirone, Schizophrenia, Meta-analysis\nhttp://www.europeanneuropsychopharmacology.com/article/S0924-977X(17)31998-3/fulltext?rss=yes", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.europeanneuropsychopharmacology.com/article/S0924-977X(17)31998-3/fulltext?rss=yes"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:27.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f069b8c36d034dfc2303b5079436ddad50f7871d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqwVEBNS8V3ElHGwoqTRZLX9gaKXSdKIfiyOXqKKQ8c1WPs4fpmYQEJLLa_4nyKzhoEOR0dzn0ZAEA8U5BKAg0gpa_Kr3AUmfakeYODajnpVbc4N_iqe4EqhZRgV4eSfP6zWI4cDNrmicMMasnj_3BU27bbpX_.6mws1efBIV9.Jb", "site_full": "www.thesun.co.uk", "site": "thesun.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Sun", "title": "Rimac Concept One, Ford GT, Bugatti Chiron and Lamborghini Aventador \u2013 The Grand Tour car line-up with Richard Hammond crash in first episode", "title_full": "Rimac Concept One, Ford GT, Bugatti Chiron and Lamborghini Aventador \u2013 The Grand Tour car line-up with Richard Hammond crash in first episode", "published": "2017-12-07T10:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/rr-composite-cars.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=100&#038;w=750&#038;h=500&#038;crop=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2180, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 8, "comments": 0, "shares": 8}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f069b8c36d034dfc2303b5079436ddad50f7871d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqwVEBNS8V3ElHGwoqTRZLX9gaKXSdKIfiyOXqKKQ8c1WPs4fpmYQEJLLa_4nyKzhoEOR0dzn0ZAEA8U5BKAg0gpa_Kr3AUmfakeYODajnpVbc4N_iqe4EqhZRgV4eSfP6zWI4cDNrmicMMasnj_3BU27bbpX_.6mws1efBIV9.Jb", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Joe Finnerty", "published": "2017-12-07T10:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "Rimac Concept One, Ford GT, Bugatti Chiron and Lamborghini Aventador \u2013 The Grand Tour car line-up with Richard Hammond crash in first episode", "text": "The Ripsaw features in Fast & Furious 8 \nEpisode five sees Hammond in Dubai driving this high-speed tank from Fast & Furious 8. \nUnlike F&F8, he does donuts on a golf course.

Each stone she and her friends pelted made things difficult for Kashmir\u2019s security forces. Thanks to a constructive initiative by the authorities, that girl, Afshan Ashiq, now heads Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s women\u2019s football team, guarding the goal-post during matches. For Kashmir, this small turn of events has tremendous significance. For, it denotes a paradigm shift, howsoever silent. There is a reason for the whole nation to welcome this positive change.\nOf course, this has not happened all of a sudden, as we can understand. It happened through a patient communication which the authorities maintained with various segments of Kashmiri population over time. The effort was to win the hearts of those who were described to be disgruntled. Slow, steady talks, with no insistence on one or the other things, led to opening up of minds. Slowly and steadily, the official counselors could communicate to disgruntled elements how the Government had no malice and how it wished to build a strong Kashmir which could happen only if the people cooperated.\nThe story of Afshan Ashiq is an outcome of this patient effort over time in Kashmir, thanks to the parallel initiatives operated by the Central Government over the past three years. Many such stories are being scripted all over Kashmir at this particular juncture, slowly changing the social psyche, altering perceptions, and making the common Kashmiri people realise that there is no need for them to harbour a persecution complex.\nMuch to the contrary, the people of Kashmir with no political strings attached, are beginning to realise that it is in their best interest to be part of a nationalistic effort rather than of a separatist one. Thanks to the silent persuasion campaign launched by the Government\u2019s counselors, the Kashmiri people are slowly beginning to understand where wisdom is.\nThis was necessary in Kashmir where stone-pelting by commoners had become a serious malady for the security forces. Plastic bullets, water canons, or any other tough methods had their own use and effect. But on a parallel track, the Government decided to operate on the psychological component as well. The modus operandi was: Appeal to people\u2019s good sense, urge them to join the national mainstream, ask them to contribute positively to national good, push them to be part of a nationalistic campaign and stay away from separatist one.\nObviously, it worked even as the security forces launched no-nonsense anti-insurgency campaigns against terror outfits and eliminated their leaders and their structures ruthlessly. From time to time, the military authorities kept announcing their gains, but did not say anything about the positive campaign that had been unleashed on the parallel track.\nAs that track started operating successfully, the Government has now chosen to bring it up in the open for general public to know. This phenomenon of creating positive social connects, this opening up of channels of working together, this effort to bring the youths\u2019 enthusiasm into a creative field like sports is being appreciated everywhere, as reports have us believe.\nActually, this is the Kashmir of Indian people\u2019s dream. This is the Kashmir that we knew existed a few decades ago. And this is the Kashmir in the vision of the Government. It must be admitted that something very positive is taking place there that will protect the region from terrorism and separatism. Those in the Government operating on this campaign deserve a pat on the back for their patient and tireless work on a critical component of the Kashmir situation. May such good work expand. May Kashmiri people realise the power of love and not of bullets.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://comments.bharatiweb.in/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "afshan ashiq", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "central government", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kashmir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jammu", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:27.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "da567d30c9cb847aebf7050fb1e36695dc3a79da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTATMHqm0shb9FKZ9Szit5DmV5BpGODLrdQpJ.inrkjBshu5V2AJDLLS49EQHOjUHdB0gFsSDl1Bw--", "site_full": "gathering.tweakers.net", "site": "tweakers.net", "site_section": "https://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_topics/106", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Role-Playing Games - GoT", "title": "[Switch] Xenoblade Chronicles 2 - Role-Playing Games", "title_full": "[Switch] Xenoblade Chronicles 2 - Role-Playing Games - GoT", "published": "2017-12-02T11:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 38, "participants_count": 17, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5785, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "609e078918ea3a04b972f1dbb41f435a1f63f9f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTATMHqm0shb9FKZ9Szit5DmV5BpGODLrdQpJ.inrkjBshu5V2AJDLLS49EQHOjUHd7lTo8VZ.6uq0qH57XlQAA", "ord_in_thread": 38, "author": "RayNbow", "published": "2017-12-07T08:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Eerste unique monster dat me aanviel (en 2 levels of zo hoger was) heeft weinig indruk gemaakt ...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DQZbL-xVwAAFUBF.jpg:large", "https://twitter.com/ShinNoNoir/status/938537836176797696"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:27.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "32aa7888446f22d9852b4f3fe636139e4c355340", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ4aQPVvLuWJX7qPfA9nN3FdXVnSMtg0kHcM26WbRwrJHjPa2itkt5G74XGRWhEqFNB0mtDnq5E9Nu2iMYl8w_wZExYU6u3DNySipcvoxG7rg--", "site_full": "paultan.org", "site": "paultan.org", "site_section": "http://paultan.org/feed/", "site_categories": ["vehicles", "business"], "section_title": "Paul Tan's Automotive News", "title": "2018 Jeep Wrangler gains new hybrid turbo engine", "title_full": "2018 Jeep Wrangler gains new hybrid turbo engine", "published": "2017-12-07T08:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s2.paultan.org/image/2017/12/JP018_206WR6e32d4uq9tqrrbqefrti1aihbm-e1512627531279.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 3936, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 106, "comments": 0, "shares": 106}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "32aa7888446f22d9852b4f3fe636139e4c355340", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ4aQPVvLuWJX7qPfA9nN3FdXVnSMtg0kHcM26WbRwrJHjPa2itkt5G74XGRWhEqFNB0mtDnq5E9Nu2iMYl8w_wZExYU6u3DNySipcvoxG7rg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Matthew H Tong", "published": "2017-12-07T08:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "2018 Jeep Wrangler gains new hybrid turbo engine", "text": "Home \u00bb Cars \u00bb 2018 Jeep Wrangler gains new hybrid turbo engine 2018 Jeep Wrangler gains new hybrid turbo engine / 1 comment \nPreviewed for the first time last month, the all-new 2018 Jeep Wrangler finally makes its debut at the 2017 Los Angeles Auto Show. Yes, it\u2019s really a new-generation model (codename JL), even though its looks may suggest otherwise. That\u2019s because the Wrangler is one of the company\u2019s most iconic models, if not the most, and so keeping it unmistakably recognisable is Jeep\u2019s foremost priority. \nEven so, there have been several exterior design tweaks, including the rounded LED headlamps (Sahara and Rubicon only, with optional LED fog lamps) with encircling LED daytime running lights which now intersect the iconic seven-slat grille, harking back to the CJ model. \nThere are also repositioned LED indicators on the front fenders, optional square LED tail lights (now jutting out for a more three-dimensional effect), a lower beltline for improved outward visibility, body-coloured sport bars welded to the body and enhanced aerodynamics. A new fold-down windscreen has been added as well, with a header bar joining the A-pillars and staying in place (together with the rear-view mirror) even with the windscreen down. \nAs usual, the doors and roof can be removed, with the latter now available in a variety of options. The returning three-piece hardtop features lighter panels and improved latches for quicker and removal, while Sahara and Rubicon models get a body-coloured roof option. Also available is an improved Sunrider soft-top that\u2019s quieter and easier to retract, along with a new power Sky One-touch top coming later next year. \nTwo body styles are offered, with the two-door coming in three trims \u2013 Sport, Sport S and Rubicon \u2013 and the four-door available in an additional Sahara guise. A new half-door version will be introduced in 2019. All models get front and rear tow hooks, front and rear steel heavy-duty winch-ready bumpers with removable end caps and up to 762 mm of water-wading capability. \nInside, the theme is authenticity (of course, why not), but the cabin is completely redesigned and looks far more contemporary than before . New items start from the three-spoke multi-function steering wheel, brand new instrument cluster with a seven-inch digital LED display (base models get a 3.5-inch digital display), as well as a fresh new centre stack. \nThe air vents have also been redesigned, with the middle pair now positioned further up, just next to the new Fiat Chrysler\u2019s UConnect infotainment display that\u2019s available in three sizes \u2013 five, seven or 8.4 inches. The head unit also supports pinch-and-zoom capabilities, plus Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. We think it makes the dashboard look much neater, and accentuating this new styling is the body-coloured trim. \nOther new features include keyless entry, an engine start button with a weatherproof surround, adjustable seat bolster and lumbar support and longer armrests with handles under each one to facilitate door removal. Cabin materials have also been improved with soft-touch front door cards and a hand-wrapped dashboard with accent stitching on the Sahara model. \nElsewhere, the new Wrangler is fitted with new mesh door pockets, numerous phone storage spaces, 12 volt sockets, two front and rear USB ports and an optional 115-volt AC outlet to power select three-pronged electronics. Boot space is freed up by the relocation of the subwoofer, and there\u2019s also an optional Trail Rail cargo management system with easy access to cargo area contents, plus additional storage options. \nAs for engines, the North American market gets the all-new 270 hp/400 Nm 2.0 litre turbocharged and direct-injected four-cylinder engine with an eTorque mild hybrid system and a 260 hp/600 Nm 3.0 litre EcoDiesel V6, the latter introduced based on overwhelming customer demand. \nThe outgoing 2.8 litre petrol has been dropped, but the 285 hp/352 Nm 3.6 litre Pentastar petrol V6 with Engine Stop-Start (ESS) continues to be offered. Transmission options include a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic (the only kind in its class), and towing capacity is up to 1,587 kg (3,500 pounds) depending on the engine. \nFor the first time in the model\u2019s (still a body-on-frame vehicle) history, a two-speed Selec-Trac transfer case with full-time four-wheel drive and a 2.72:1 low-range gear ratio is fitted, but this is only available on Sahara models. There\u2019s a more robust Command-Trac 4\u00d74 system with next-gen solid Dana front and rear axles with a 3.45 rear axle ratio, offering full-time torque management for optimal grip in low-traction conditions. All-new 2018 Jeep\u00ae Wrangler Sahara \nThe Wrangler Rubicon, on the other hand, gets a heavy duty Rock-Trac 4\u00d74 system (also with torque management) with Dana 44 front and rear axles with a low-range ratio of 4:1. It also has improved articulation and total suspension travel versus the previous generation , as well as Tru-Lok limited-slip rear differential. Together with the six-speed manual (standard), it boasts an improved crawl ratio of 84.2:1, whereas the eight-speeder gets a 77.2:1 ratio. Either way, both options make scaling obstacles easier. \nOverseeing ride is the same five-link coil front and rear suspension setup as before, with the front featuring a lateral control arm and four longitudinal control arms. Full-width forged steel track bars are used to keep lateral movement of the axle in check, and the spring rates and shocks have been retuned for better ride comfort. The Wrangler\u2019s roll centre height is also raised. \nCrucial components such as the fuel tank, transfer case and transmission oil pan is protected by four skid plates and bars, while Rubicon models benefit from heavy gauge tubular steel rock rails to prevent potential damage to the body when challenged off the beaten track. \nTo reduce weight, Jeep used high-strength aluminum for the doors, door hinges, bonnet, fender flares, windshield frame and magnesium swing gate, as well as the employment of hollow track and stabiliser bars, aluminum engine mounts and steering gear, and a larger but lighter master cylinder. \nLast but not least, Jeep also paid much attention to the Wrangler\u2019s safety and security. The 4\u00d74 now offers more than 75 available active and passive safety and security features, which includes Blind-spot Monitoring and Rear Cross Path detection, ParkView reverse camera with dynamic grid lines, electronic stability control (ESC) with electronic roll mitigation and four standard airbags. \nProduction will take place in Toledo, Ohio, where over two million Wranglers have been produced since 1992. 1945 Jeep\u00ae CJ-2A and all-new 2018 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 1973 Jeep\u00ae CJ-5 and all-new 2018 Jeep Wrangler Sahara All-new 2018 Jeep\u00ae Wrangler Rubicon and All-new 2018

I am Dev, the founder of TouristGuide Asia. I do understand your frustration and me and my team sincerely apologize for all the inconvenience caused. But I believe the public should also know the other part of the stories which is not told here. You are supposed to travel on 2nd December 2017 but we did called you 3 weeks earlier and asked if you could travel one (1) week earlier or two (2) weeks later from your actual travel date. This was once we were informed by our supplier in Europe that they could not arrange the driver we wanted. We are very particular about driver because good drivers make your holiday pleasant and rude driver makes your holiday a nightmare. That was the reason we request if you can change the travel date. That moment you got furious and saying we are scam and requested for refund. You were not open for discussion and only wanted your refund. Although all our packages are non-refundable, we still process your request and refunded full amount paid to us within 3 working days. Regarding the flight ticket you were telling. We have booked your flight ticket in advance. You can check with other travel agent where travel agents have the accessibility to book the flight in advance and full ticket can be issued days before travel date. That is why we always advise our customers we will provide all details within 1 month of the travel date. We practice this because if there is any emergency where you need cancel or change the travel date, we can do it with minimal charges rather than forfeiting the whole ticket. In your case, we have absorbed the cancelation charges. We admit the mistake is from our side but it could have been solved smoothly if you are open for discussion. All you wanted was refund and we obliged to it. But it is not acceptable that you are calling us scam now rather I believe this is act of defamation. We also have tried contacting you through phone and Facebook, but there is no any response from your side. If there is still anything that you are not happy with us, please do contact us.

Stay Safe Never provide sensitive financial or personal information Do not release your social security number, bank account or PIN, PayPal, or credit card information. There is absolutely no reason why a recruiter or employer would require any such information from you. Never impart any financial information. You will eventually have to provide your social security number to an employer -- when you're completing a job application or employment contract -- but do so only after you have validated that the company is legitimate. Never agree to a wire transfer of any sort Any mention of a wire transfer -- or sending money to make more money -- should force an involuntary action to delete the message. No legitimate job opportunity is going to involve wire transfers. Be wary of any recruiter who asks for money from you upfront in return for finding you a job or providing job leads Legitimate recruiters get paid by the employers for whom they place candidates -- not from the candidates. Furthermore, most of the scammers who ask you to pay for job leads will provide you -- if they actually do so -- with the same ones you could find on a search of Indeed or other job-search engine. Carefully examine the email details of unsolicited job offers Emails that claim to be from a legitimate company (Google) but then have a return email address with a general (free) email site (such as This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. ) and not the company address (such as This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. ) are not to be trusted. Also carefully examine links in emails to guarantee they are linking to a legitimate Website (Google.com) rather than some fake site (http://scamsite.google.com/ or http://44.124.25.192/google/). Request more details from prospective employers who provide little or no details in their job postings or emails Vague promises can be very persuasive, but the truth lies in the details -- so request detailed information about the services they provide or the job they are hiring for. Request and review contracts carefully. Consult with a lawyer when you have serious concerns or questions. Don't be swayed by amazing testimonials or money-back guarantees These are simply marketing gimmicks designed to make you feel more at ease in falling for the scam. While testimonials can be real, even legitimate companies have been caught making them up. And money-back guarantees are worthless unless you have the time and money to sue -- if you can even find the scammers to do so. Get everything in writing Look at the contract carefully and make sure everything is in line with accepted labor practices. Ask in ESL forums if something you find in your contract is accepted or is typical of other schools\u2019 contracts. (You\u2019ll be surprised at how much you can learn in a short period of time). Protecting Yourself From Job Scams Never take a job outside your homeland without thoroughly checking them out. If you have any questions ask! Also ask for references from other people they have placed and do your homework. Spend some time in ESL forums and ask others who have been teaching for years if they know of the firm. You\u2019ll be surprised at how many other ESL teachers know of or have been scammed by them. Keep all written documentation and e-mails. Never go on something by word of mouth. Some Common Job Scams Used \u2013 How They Operate Often illegitimate recruiters will simply comb the job boards getting contact names etc. from the teachers who post their resumes. Then they will contact you saying they have a list of schools looking for qualified teachers like you. Wait it gets better. Then they\u2019ll ask you to check the names of the schools you\u2019d be interested in teaching for and ask you to send them your list. They then will tell you those that you choose are reserved for their \u201cpremium clients\u201d. How do you become such a client? Send in your hard earned money and watch it disappear. Very poor English If the standard of English in the advert is blatantly bad, this is often a sign that the person who wrote it was not able to ask a native speaker for help. If the employer is an English language school, you have to wonder why this is the case. Poor website imitations and strange domain name extensions Scammers often buy domain names with extensions such as .tl (East Timor) or .tk (apparently a free domain extension) to create poor imitations of a genuine school's website. A genuine school in the UK, for example, will normally have a UK domain extension (such as .co.uk or .org.uk), not a domain extension from East Timor or Norfolk Island! Strange addresses or postcodes A couple of examples are the best way to illustrate this: - A university in Cameroon advertises its address as \"Worldwide, Niagara Falls\" - A supposed employer in London adds a postcode of \"M1K 5DA\" - not a London postcode... not even a valid British postcode. Check out the school\u2019s website This is not a fail-proof way to vet a school, of course, since even a fraudulent school can create a website; however, it\u2019s a good first step. You can check for an actual physical address and specific contact info for the school. Test these\u2013 there should always be someone you can reach! Also see if the site has been updated recently and if you can you read about the school staff and actually contact them through the site. This is a also where you can link to the school\u2019s Facebook page, or look for professional affiliations or endorsements you can follow up on. Ask for references A reputable school will be able to provide you with the names of both past and present teachers you can email or call. You can also ask to be connected with students or perhaps corporate clients who take English classes at the school, for another perspective. Google the school or check a teacher's forums Teaching jobs can be just like any other \u201cproduct\u201d these days\u2013 people are happy to give online feedback and reviews of their experiences. An Internet search can pull up blog posts, personal reviews, news articles or complaints filed against a prospective school. Ask the school about the curriculum they use and about details like discipline policies, or how they assess/place students in different class levels These are great questions to ask during the interview, but they are also good ways to vet a school at any point before you go abroad. An established school will have a structured curriculum, and will probably use a textbook you can preview online, if you aren\u2019t already familiar with it. Quality schools have assessment measures in place for both in-taking new students and evaluating students\u2019 progress.
