(AP) - Closing arguments are scheduled in the sentencing hearing of a politically connected Florida eye doctor convicted of stealing $100 million from Medicare, one of the largest individual thefts in the program's history. \nProsecutors are expected to argue Thursday that Dr. Salomon Melgen deserves a 30-year sentence for convincing mostly elderly patients to undergo painful tests and treatments for diseases they didn't have. \nMelgen's attorneys will push for less than 10 years, saying the government's estimate of the amount stolen is exaggerated and the doctor's crimes were honest mistakes. \nU.S District Judge Kenneth Marra could give Melgen a life sentence but has wide discretion. Marra indicated Wednesday that he might not sentence Melgen immediately because he might need time to think. \nMelgen is separately charged with bribing New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez.

Tang Chhin Sothy/AFP A lawyer for the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces filed a complaint against former opposition leader Sam Rainsy for \u201cincitement\u201d today, one day after Prime Minister Hun Sen said Rainsy's comments encouraging soldiers to defy orders to fire on demonstrators amounted to \"treason\". \nVong Pheakdey, lawyer for the RCAF, told reporters that he \u201cfiled complaint against Sam Rainsy for inciting the armed forces to cause insecurity to the state\u201d.\nSpeaking outside of Phnom Penh Municipal Court, Pheakdey said the suit stems from comments \nmade in Paris on Saturday, which were later posted in a video to Rainsy\u2019s Facebook page on Tuesday.\nThe self-exiled founder of the now dissolved Cambodia National Rescue Party had urged the armed forces \"not to shoot and kill innocent people\" even if ordered to do so.\nHun Sen called the comments a \u201cdeclaration of war\u201d.\nToday, Pheakdey said the complaint was filed because Rainsy had encouraged forces not to obey \"leaders which are the legitimate government\u201d.\nThe complaint accuses Rainsy of threatening national security, but the word \"treason\" does not actually appear in the document.\n\u201cI would like to inform the prosecutor that in December 2017 Sam Rainsy incited the armed forces not to obey the orders of the legitimate head of the royal government,\u201d the complaint reads, adding that Rainsy\u2019s actions have \u201cimpacted state security\u201d. \n\u201cWe hope that the court will take action urgently,\u201d Pheakdey added.\nDespite the wording of the complaint, government spokesman Phay Siphan said it was still the government\u2019s position that Rainsy committed treason.\n\u201cWe do not take the law into our own hands,\u201d he said, explaining that it was up to the court to decide whether or not to charge him.\nFormer Deputy CNRP President Mu Sochua said the lack of a specific complaint related to treason \u201cshows even more they don\u2019t have a case\u201d. \n\u201cThey are not tolerant of any critics.\u201d\nUpdates to follow. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrew nachemson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam rainsy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam rainsy mech dara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phay siphan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mu sochua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tang chhin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hun sen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pheakdey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vong pheakdey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rainsy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rcaf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambodia national rescue party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal cambodian armed forces", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phnom penh municipal court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "phnom penh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:28.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f7bd18b9a10e5755c894dbda717c884084d01815", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pEJmYP03ByBEKT.1l08KV6sxzbVeN.M37", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/aco/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/aco/ - Adult Cartoons - 4chan", "title": "Jaiden Animations Thread", "title_full": "/aco/ - Jaiden Animations Thread - Adult Cartoons - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T04:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.02, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3b567fc2a5c2fc63d1c4c73e1542eef9f5278134", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pEJmYP03ByBEKT.1l08KV6jsbAKn6YRhVk3ozpFVNNVo-", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T13:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Shadowleggy and Jaiden", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:28.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d38f73ce6bca58032e3fb0f5b16f0bd4aeb962dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYDnVkslrnYvSV8maGLH.KRA", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp;

This study aimed to assess the influence of rainfall seasonality on the prevalence of Schistosoma haematobium infection among school-aged children in Kaedi, southern Mauritania.; Cross-sectional surveys (i.e. parasitological, malacological and observations on water-related human activities) were carried out in Kaedi between September 2014 and May 2015, during both the wet and dry seasons. A total of 2162 children aged 5-15 years provided a single urine sample that was subjected to S. haematobium diagnosis. Snails were sampled and checked for cercarial shedding. Water contact patterns of the local population were recorded by direct observation.; The prevalence of S. haematobium was 4.0% (86/2162, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.2-4.9%) with a geometric mean egg count per 10 ml of urine of 3.7 (95% CI: 2.8-4.3). Being male (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.78, 95% CI: 1.13-2.80), being at primary school (aOR 1.73, 95% CI: 1.04-2.87) and dry season (aOR 0.56, 95% CI: 0.35-0.89) were significantly associated with S. haematobium. Among 284 potential intermediate host snail specimens collected over the rainy and dry seasons, three species were identified: Bulinus senegalensis (n = 13) and B. forskalii (n = 161) in the rainy season, and B. truncatus (n = 157) in the wet season. No snail was shedding cercariae. On average, seven human water contacts were recorded per hour per observer over a 28-day observation period. Twelve types of water contact activities were identified among which, swimming/bathing was predominant (n = 3788, 36.9%), followed by washing clothes (n = 2016, 19.7%) and washing dishes (n = 1322, 12.9%). Females (n = 5270, 51.4%) were slightly more in contact with water than males (n = 4983, 48.6%). The average time spent in the water per person per day was 14.2 min (95% CI: 13.8-14.6 min). The frequency and duration of water contact followed a seasonal pattern.; Our findings demonstrate a low prevalence and intensity of S. haematobium among school-aged children in Kaedi. Appropriate integrated control measures, including health education among at-risk communities and snail control may help to interrupt transmission of S. haematobium in Kaedi.\n\nfrom #AlexandrosSfakianakis via Alexandros G.Sfakianakis on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2BQHyBZ\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexandros g.sfakianakis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "mauritania mauritania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaedi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:30.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d7b34bce87d42029149205c33ab5ec36277091e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYCXz1IyCXzxEvmRsvHZ3.O5", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp; Finance - 4chan", "title": "Dogecoin - Still relevant?", "title_full": "/biz/ - Dogecoin - Still relevant? - Business & Finance - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T13:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.234, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d7b34bce87d42029149205c33ab5ec36277091e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYCXz1IyCXzxEvmRsvHZ3.O5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T13:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Dogecoin - Still relevant?", "text": "/biz/, with all the talk of Crypto Currencies in the news this week it reminded me that I used to mine Dogecoin back in 2013.

(AP) - The Seminole Tribe of Florida is warning that an attempt by legislators to clear up the legal status of fantasy sports could result in the state losing millions in payments from the tribe. \nThe tribe runs several casinos in the state. This week the Seminoles sent a letter to top legislators regarding pending bills that would declare fantasy sports legal and not subject to regulation. A Senate committee is scheduled to take up one of the bills (SB 374) on Thursday. \nThe letter contends the legislation would violate the deal that allows the tribe to offer blackjack as well as slot machines at several locations. \nFlorida's attorney general in 1991 issued an opinion saying football fantasy leagues were a form of illegal gambling. But fantasy leagues have continued to expand since then.

I first decided to make Delightful (originally called Afewthings, weird I know :P) in 2014 while I struggled with my anxiety & depression about the future (I still struggle but I\u2019m getting better). I was in Mexico visiting my father after quitting my first job out of college & he encouraged me to pursue what felt right for me. I didn\u2019t grow up with my father as he was deported to Mexico when I was 3 years old. So each moment I had with him was special & I still remember every piece of advice he\u2019s given me. Unfortunately, sometime before this trip my father learned he had cancer & he unfortunately passed June 9th, 2016. I was fortunate to spend a week with him a month prior.\nI\u2019ve been on a journey these past 5 years and have explored many resources related to self-help trying to understand my place in this world. I\u2019ve realized it is creating products and content that can help people live more fulfilling lives even when things are hectic and we are facing impossible challenges. My plan is to attempt to make most of what I create in the future free and simple. I believe happiness should be free and we can create our own happiness with the right tools and support.

No one has been charged. \nDeltona spokesman Lee Lopez said that after a monthlong investigation into complaints of sick pedigree dogs being sold, animal control officers on Monday confiscated 33 adult dogs and eight puppies from two locations. \nLopez told the newspaper that one resident was breeding and selling sick Yorkshire terriers, Pomeranians and Yorkie-Pom mixes both domestically and internationally. He said some of the puppies were sold for $1,000 each. \nThe dogs were all taken to Halifax Humane Society in Daytona Beach to be examined for health issues. \nInformation from: Daytona Beach (Fla.)

While front desk folks can\u2019t always accommodate the request there nothing wrong with asking. TAILOR YOU\u2019RE SIGHTSEEING SCHEDULE: if you are an early bird then you can start your day by seeing big attractions first thing during the morning time. leaving the afternoon for activities like eating a leisurely lunch wondering through residential neighbourhood or kicking back in a park anything but trying to get through a massive roman ruin at 3.30 after you\u2019ve been walking all day. But if you\u2019re a person who tends to get off to a slow start in the morning then it is better to plan to save the biggest attraction for right after lunch when you\u2019re fully awake and well fuelled. VISIT ATTRACTIONS ON FREE OR DISCOUNT DAYS: practically in any city you visit you can find attractions that are free or heavily discounted in certain days. There are plenty of free museum or at least days where fees are waived. You just have to do your research in advance.

Is this what you dwell on at bedtime or when you look in the mirror? If you want to be happier, you have to learn how to love yourself. Improving your physical health and appearance is a good way to begin practicing self-love. In order to firm up and build yourself some muscles, check out the tips below.\nObtaining a workout partner can drastically improve your muscle-building results. Your partner can be a valuable source of motivation for sticking to your workout session, and pushing you to maximize your efforts while you work out. Having a reliable partner to work out with can also help keep you safe because you will always have a spotter.\nShort-term use of creatine supplements can help you build muscle with minimal risks. Creatine plays an important role in your body in that it is required to produce ATP, a basic and vital form of energy. Your body cannot function without ATP, and lack of creatine can cause muscle problems. Having a higher level of creatine will enable you to train more intensely, and for a prolonged period of time.\n\nTry to use caution when using creatine. If you have any kidney conditions, do NOT use creatine! Creatine can also bring on cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps and muscle compartment syndrome. People who are still growing are at the greatest risk of potential harm. Stick closely to the instructions when taking supplements.\nHave protein before starting a workout. Whether you have a sandwich with about 4 ounces of lunch meat, a protein bar or a shake, it\u2019s important to remember that protein synthesis is what is important for building muscle. Have your protein about half an hour to an hour before starting a workout for best results.\nHaving a dependable training partner is very important when building muscle. This partner can help spot you so that you can pump out those few extra reps that you could not do on your own. http://comicsyrup5ela.suomiblog.com/find-useful-info-on-a-strong-nutrition-strategy-4257989 can also help if your training partner is stronger than you because this can push you to work even harder.\nStretch for a few minutes after working out in order to facilitate muscle repair. If you are under the age of 40, every stretch should be held for a minimum of 30 seconds. However, if you are older than forty, you should try to maintain a stretch for about sixty seconds. This will work to prevent any injuries from happening after you have worked your muscles.\nWhat you eat is going to make a difference in the results that you get from muscle building. You must keep your calorie count up and increase the amount of protein that you consume, while reducing the levels of fat that are consumed. These changes will allow your workout sessions to be more productive and you will see results sooner.\nMake the \u201cbig three\u201d a part of your daily workout routine. These three exercises include: the deadlift, squat and bench press. These particular exercises are known to help build bulk, strength and condition your muscles each time they are done and should be included in your routine for maximum muscle building success.\nOnly workout your abs muscles two to three times per week. Many people make the mistake of doing abdominal exercises daily. This does not give the muscles enough time to recover and can ultimately limit their growth and could cause your body to become injured. Working out two to three times per week is sufficient to get lean abs.\nPush yourself hard while you are working out, to the point where you feel like you could not lift one more pound. You want to always be giving your maximum effort if you want to see a payoff. Hard work will equal the results that you are looking for.\nUtilize pyramid training. A single weight lifting regimen doesn\u2019t yield results forever. This is why you should attempt to pyramid your weight by using heavier weights throughout every set. Heavy sets allow you to build up your strength, and the medium weights maximize your muscle growth. This allows you to gain both strength and size in just one workout.\nTry to develop a better bicep curl. Most people don\u2019t move the barbell past the point where it is parallel to your body, thereby not getting the full results of the exercise. However, the strongest portion of curls is the upper part. This problem can be solved by simply performing barbell curls while sitting.\nThe proper information and advice can truly assist you in building muscle. If como emagrecer 7 kilos rapido apply the tips you just read, you can successfully build muscles over time. Simply incorporate the tips into your daily routines.

We sincerely believe that the local church is the hope of the world. In order for it to be that hope, it must be the local church that God designed. This means it must free itself from the harmful practices and structures that have infected the modern church. It must follow God's ways and not man's ways. This is a difficult thing to do in our modern times where most churches around us follow similar unbiblical patterns. Many people have great affection for their church, the people there, and the things that happen there. Our affection for God must overtake all of those things. Jesus said if you love Him you will obey Him. Obeying Him extends to how we operate as a church. \nToday in America, nearly every expression of Christianity that surrounds us has adopted many of the same corrupt practices. What appears to be normal is accepted as right. In order for the church to operate by God's design we must go through a process of deconstruction and then rebuild only that which we find in scripture. The Bible contains a sufficient amount of instruction for how the church is to be organized, led and operate. We do not need to make up our own ways. \nOver the last ten years we have developed a series of tools that are helpful for people that desire to live their Christian faith according to God's design. These tools will be outlined in this BLOG series. They will be presented in the order we see as necessary for you to engage in the Christian faith as God instructs us to in the Bible. We will start with outlining the history of the practices that have infected the church. We will call this the \u201cWhat not to do.\u201d We will follow that with instruction on being the church by God's design. Then a lesson in making disciples as instructed in Matthew 28:18-20, commonly called the Great Commission. We will continue with a focus on your own spiritual freedom and then how to become spiritually fruitful. At the end we will introduce you to our Podcast called The Resistance Radio Show. This tool helps you explore these topics more deeply. \n\nAll of the tools presented here are available free of charge. There is no denomination or organization to join. We are here to help you and unite you with others that are seeking to experience what they read in the Bible. Enjoy your journey.

They have tested it and that\u2019s why decided not to implement the feature. \n\u201c According to our tests, if we were to modify the partition layout via OTA there is a risk that devices will brick during the partitioning. We feel this poses too great a risk for our community of users, which is why we have decided not to implement Project Treble on current OnePlus devices ,\u201d the staff member adds. \nThe company, however, hopes that the functionality of Project Treble will improve with time so that it better supports the devices to get Android OS updates faster. \u201c\u2026 we look forward to the future of Project Treble, and how it will evolve to better support devices ahead ,\u201d he concluded.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "oneplus", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "satyendra pal singh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "project treble", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ota", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:34.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "be14214af396c9580e3e841bffc608a86314d7a1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCrHRZ4MmdtKQBQK.ZJx0pytYYrfYcC_tHbTjbsYwWOee6BA7G7fUK_7b_8a.M5ijK0-", "site_full": "bahar45.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bahar45.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "\u0628\u0647\u0627\u0631\u0622\u0632\u0627\u062f\u06cc", "title": "#\u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646# \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627\u062a\u0648\u0631: \u0627\u0645\u062a\u0646\u0627\u0639 \u0642\u0647\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0632\u0646\u0647 \u0628\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0632 \u062f\u0633\u062a \u062f\u0627\u062f\u0646 \u0628\u0627 \u0627\u0647\u062f\u0627\u06a9\u0646\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0632\u0646 \u0645\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0645\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u06cc", "title_full": "#\u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646# \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627\u062a\u0648\u0631: \u0627\u0645\u062a\u0646\u0627\u0639 \u0642\u0647\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0632\u0646\u0647 \u0628\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0632 \u062f\u0633\u062a \u062f\u0627\u062f\u0646 \u0628\u0627 \u0627\u0647\u062f\u0627\u06a9\u0646\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0632\u0646 \u0645\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0645\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u06cc", "published": "2017-12-07T12:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "be14214af396c9580e3e841bffc608a86314d7a1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCrHRZ4MmdtKQBQK.ZJx0pytYYrfYcC_tHbTjbsYwWOee6BA7G7fUK_7b_8a.M5ijK0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "fada namdar (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "#\u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646# \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627\u062a\u0648\u0631: \u0627\u0645\u062a\u0646\u0627\u0639 \u0642\u0647\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0632\u0646\u0647 \u0628\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0632 \u062f\u0633\u062a \u062f\u0627\u062f\u0646 \u0628\u0627 \u0627\u0647\u062f\u0627\u06a9\u0646\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0632\u0646 \u0645\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0645\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u06cc", "text": "\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:34.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bbd7216731ee6db474c15cdbb6eaf8ec331272d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_pozj1Z8NU88Qzypaqq3fGO3u9Uy6T5oDI0tGi9RUCFUWPhza7JPUxYDaDQkJxlqwQcnPNf8fIeeylRUTdV1XEGZD", "site_full": "investorshub.advfn.com", "site": "advfn.com", "site_section": "http://investorshub.advfn.com/Lithium-Amers-Corp-LACDD-18389/", "site_categories": ["investing", "stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "Lithium Amers Corp.

We received a letter this morning. The investigation will reveal whether money was collected from the guy or not,\u201d Mr Okesanmi he said. \nThe allegation against Mr Okesanmi came to light following the viral online campaign for the scrapping of the police\u2019s Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS, due to reports of the unit\u2019s brutality, rights abuses and extra-judicial killings. \nAs Nigerians recounted their mostly bitter ordeals in the hands of the SARS on social media, one Michael Asiwaju with the Twitter handle @Asiwaju_Limited posted a tweet about how Mr. Okesanmi allegedly extorted $2,000 cash from him, forced him to transfer N155,000 to one of his subordinates and seized his Samsung smartphone. \n\u201cOn Friday July 7th, the PPRO of the Kwara State police command took 2000$ cash from me and forced me to transfer 115k to one of his boys account, and he also seize (sic) my Samsung phone\u2026 He threatened to send me to jail if I tell anyone about the case,\u201d he tweeted. \nAttached to the tweet were the photographs of the Mr Okesanmi and a partly redacted copy of a bank debit slip. He did not, however, state what offence he was arrested for before the alleged extortion. Mr. Okesanmi denied he extorted money from Mr. Asiwaju. He told PREMIUM TIMES he arrested Mr. Asiwaju after he was accused of blackmail and rape by a female student of the University of Ilorin. \nHe said Mr Asiwaju was arrested at Bovina Hotel, Ilorin at about 1 a.m. and brought to the state police headquarters where the case was assigned one of his subordinates, a sergeant. He said he soon left the office as he needed to rush home to freshen up for an event he was billed to attend alongside the state commissioner of police that morning. \nThe spokesperson said to his \u201cutter shock\u201d when he returned to the state police headquarters later that day, the sergeant who was assigned to investigated the case told him Mr Asiwaju had escaped while he was being led to search his hotel room. \n\u201cWe took his statement and he confessed to the crime. We also took his phone because it contained the videos and picture he was blackmailing the student with. He escaped while he was being led to search his room in the hotel where he was staying. The incident led to some punishment being meted out to the police man. \n\u201cWe started looking for him. We wanted to blow up the incident but the girl, fearing that her image would be tarnished, pleaded that we should soft-pedal. We have travelled to Lagos to the addresses he wrote to get him arrested but we have been unable to arrest him,\u201d he said. \nHe added that he did not collect any money from Mr. Asiwaju and did not spend an extended time with him. \u201cIt is not in my character to do that. I never did that before and I will not do it. I will not even come low as doing that with a petty criminal like that.\u201d \nHe added that the investigation will reveal whether the sergeant, identified simply as Sunday, collected money from Mr. Asiwaju or not. He, however, said if Mr Asiwaju was sure that he transferred the money to him or gave him any cash he should come out and prove his allegation. \n\u201cThe matter is now in the public space he should be confident enough to come out,\u201d he added. Mr Asiwaju did not respond to PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 request to be interviewed, but he has been relentlessly tweeting about what he claimed happened on the night he was arrested. \n\u201cThe PPRO of Kwara State Police Command was the one that took 2,000 dollars from me and he was the one that told me to transfer 115k into Sunday\u2019s account. PPRO shouldn\u2019t try and put everything on Sunday,\u201d he wrote in one tweet. \u201cThe PPRO of said I run and left my phone in hotel and he later said he checked my phone and later said the phone was on password\u2026how did u check the phone on password? And later said he couldn\u2019t check the phone because it was on password\u2026\u201d he wrote in another tweet. \nWhile Messrs. Okesanmi and Asiwaju trade blame about what transpired on the night of July 7, the lady, who will be identified here by a pseudonym, Linda, because she does not want her real name used fearing that her parents would disown her and kick her out of the house if they found out what happened, explained how she was caught in a web of blackmail and an alleged rape after she met Mr Asiwaju on Instagram. \nThe 21-year-old 400-level student said after she met Mr Asiwaju on Instagram, they stated hanging out sometime in 2016 while she was doing her industrial attachment in Lagos. \u201cWhen I met him, he told me he wanted a relationship but he confessed that he has a son. He was a very nice person and we talked and we laughed a lot,\u201d she said.

Ganz oben auf dem Wunschzettel der meisten kleinen Racker steht \u00fcblicherweise das neueste Smartphone. Ab welchem Alter Kinder ein Handy bekommen sollten, ist nat\u00fcrlich Ansichtssache und liegt im Ermessen der Eltern. Doch wenn es soweit ist, sollten Eltern es selbst konfigurieren, um in Sachen Privatsph\u00e4re und Datenschutz auf Nummer sicher zu gehen. Und da nicht alle Eltern Profis im Einrichten von Handys sind, erl\u00e4utern ARAG Experten im Folgenden die wichtigsten Schritte. Das richtige Ger\u00e4t ausw\u00e4hlen Wird der Wunsch nach dem ersten mobilen Telefon bereits in der Grundschule laut, raten die ARAG Experten zu einem robusten und einfachen Handy, das auch gerne ein altes Ger\u00e4t der Eltern sein darf. Spezielle Kinderhandys sind viel zu teuer und gelten zudem unter den Kids oft als uncool. Vertrag oder Prepaid? Anders als bei einem Vertragsabschluss, haben Eltern bei einer Prepaid-Karte die volle Kostenkontrolle und einen genauen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber das Guthaben des Kindes. Zudem gibt es g\u00fcnstige Discount-Tarife, die die Kosten im Rahmen halten. Ohne WLAN und SIM-Karte einrichten Bevor man eingestellt hat, was mit dem Ger\u00e4t gesendet werden darf und was nicht, sollte die Einrichtung ohne SIM-Karte und Internetverbindung erfolgen. Ansonsten riskiert man, dass das Ger\u00e4t Daten versendet, bevor man Einschr\u00e4nkungen treffen darf. Fordert das Telefon dazu auf, die SIM-Karte einzulegen und sich mit dem WLAN zu verbinden, kann man diesen Hinweis mit der \"\u00dcberspringen\"-Funktion einfach ignorieren. Surfen verboten Soll der Nachwuchs auch anschlie\u00dfend gar nicht erst mit dem Handy ins Internet, kann man die Zugangseinstellungen unter dem entsprechenden Men\u00fcpunkt unter \"Einstellungen\" l\u00f6schen. Zudem sollten Eltern - wenn vorhanden - die Option \"Datenpakete\" l\u00f6schen, damit keine automatische Verbindung aufgebaut wird. Die ARAG Experten raten, den Mobilfunk-Anbieter zu kontaktieren und eine Drittanbietersperre einrichten zu lassen. So kann man verhindern, dass aus Versehen ein Abonnement oder \u00e4hnliche Verbindlichkeiten abgeschlossen werden, die meistens mit hohen Kosten verbunden sind. Telefonbuch und Anrufeinstellungen Im Telefonbuch des Ger\u00e4tes sollten nur Notruf- und die wichtigsten privaten Nummern gespeichert sein. Wenn man diese Nummern als Kurzwahlen einrichtet, k\u00f6nnen die jungen Nutzer mit einem Klick w\u00e4hlen. Sind fremde Telefonnummern per Werkszustand enthalten, sollten Eltern diese aus dem Speicher l\u00f6schen, da sie manchmal kostenpflichtig sind. Um zu verhindern, dass Kinder von unbekannten Anrufern angerufen werden, k\u00f6nnen Eltern die Anrufeinstellungen so konfigurieren, dass unbekannte Nummern automatisch abgelehnt werden. Nur noch Anrufer mit angezeigter Nummer kommen durch und lassen sich im Zweifel zur\u00fcckverfolgen. Die besten Einstellungen f\u00fcr den Start Um Einstellungen vorzunehmen, muss das Zahnradsymbol auf dem Startbildschirm angeklickt werden. Die ARAG Experten empfehlen folgende Einstellungen f\u00fcr den Anfang: Das Ger\u00e4t sollte \u00fcber PIN oder Passwort gesch\u00fctzt sein, da Mustereingaben nicht als sicher gelten. Zudem sollten Standortdienste deaktiviert werden, ebenso wie Bluetooth und NFC, damit eine drahtlose Daten\u00fcbertragung unterbunden wird. NFC (Near Field Communication) ist ein neuer Funkstandard, mit dem beispielsweise eine Bezahlung mit dem Handy m\u00f6glich ist. Sollte das Ger\u00e4t nicht schon ab Werk verschl\u00fcsselt sein, kann man dies im Bereich \"Sicherheit\" nachholen. Apps Auf Kontakte, Standort, Telefon und SMS sollte keine App ohne plausiblen Grund zugreifen k\u00f6nnen. Daher m\u00fcssen die Zugriffsrechte von Apps entsprechend eingeschr\u00e4nkt werden. Es ist zudem ratsam, vorinstallierte Apps, die Kinder nicht unbedingt ben\u00f6tigen, zu deinstallieren. Stattdessen gibt es eine Menge Apps, mit denen Kinder altersgerechte Inhalte konsumieren k\u00f6nnen und die vor Erwachsenen-Inhalten gesch\u00fctzt sind. Je nach Alter sollten zus\u00e4tzlich Filter eingesetzt werden. Damit Kinder nicht ungewollt App-K\u00e4ufe t\u00e4tigen, k\u00f6nnen Eltern im Play-Store eine Gutscheinkarte hinterlegen statt einer Bankverbindung. Es ist auch m\u00f6glich, Eink\u00e4ufe im Play-Store mit einem Passwort zu sichern. Doch der wichtigste Tipp der ARAG Experten hat weder mit Ger\u00e4te-Einstellungen noch mit technischem Know-how zu tun: Wer es schafft, mit seinem Kind im vertrauensvollen Gespr\u00e4ch zu bleiben, kann das Bewusstsein f\u00fcr den sicheren Umgang mit dem Smartphone sch\u00e4rfen.

Staff Photo by Matt Stone prev next comments After one drive last night when he was fouled by Kyrie Irving , Dennis Smith Jr. started woofing, shouting at the back of the Celtics guard\u2019s head.\nIrving, who had rejected the Dallas rookie with a come-from-behind block roughly two minutes earlier, impassively walked away without looking back at his young, almost brazen opponent.\nBut the moment reminded Irving of his young self, and the pride he took in attacking the biggest names in the game.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the unique opportunity to play well against some of the best point guards and struggle against them as well,\u201d Irving said after the Celtics\u2019 97-90 win over the Mavericks. \u201cThey\u2019ll use some veteran savvy in order to kind of take you out of your game. You just learn from that. The mix-ups in the games, that\u2019s always part of it. People bumping, trying to prove something, that\u2019s always fun. It stays within the game.\n\u201cSo you understand that. It\u2019s a competitive streak,\u201d Irving added. \u201cAnd then from that point it becomes who\u2019s going to continue to stay within the game plan. You can get caught up in (the) emotions and that\u2019s just the way the game flows sometimes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird to call them young guys because I\u2019ve been watching. When I was coming up, I knew about these guys when they were in middle school and high school. I\u2019m just an avid YouTube watcher, an avid studier of people\u2019s games. So I\u2019ve been watching him since he was in high school when he was doing windmills on his AAU team in North Carolina. Like, so, I\u2019ve been studying for a while. And to play against him now as a 25-year-old is awesome. \u201c\nIrving isn\u2019t just a YouTube watcher, though. He watches video of young prospects on the level of a league scout.\n\u201cI\u2019m scouting all the time,\u201d Irving said. \u201cEspecially young guys that are coming in that are highly touted as I once was in their position being a top-three, top-five recruit and being labeled as the next great point guard. And the steps that you have to take in order to do that, it\u2019s a long journey. So you just have to appreciate it. And when you play against them, just give them your best shot.\u201d\nLarkin changes tide\nBrad Stevens said he likes to send Shane Larkin into a game when the score is headed in the wrong direction, and once again the veteran point guard helped change a precarious situation.\nFirst, Larkin had to get well, though, after absorbing a hard fall on Nov. 22 in Miami, when he landed on his tailbone.\n\u201cI have had a sore back for maybe 10 or 12 days, but today I felt good and as soon as I started feeling better coach was like, \u2018All right, get in there. Let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got,\u2019 \u201d said Larkin, who hit a 3-pointer to go along with two assists and two rebounds in the fourth quarter. \u201cAnd I felt good, so I\u2019m glad I could impact the game tonight. All movement stuff \u2014 picking up my left leg, sitting down, cutting, all that was painful for like 8-10 days. The last couple of days I\u2019ve been feeling better but not 100 percent.

December 7, 2017 \nMy mom asked me recently what I wanted for Christmas, and I jokingly said that as the mom of an infant, all I really want is an afternoon where I could sit on the couch in silence for a few hours. She laughed and asked if there was anything else that I wanted that might fit under the tree better. I got to thinking about it though, and it actually is the perfect gift idea \u2013 not just for me, but for any friend that would love a cozy winter day of hibernation and relaxation. I\u2019m not cool enough to use the term Netflix and Chill , but this my friends, is definitely a Netflix and Chill kit. Here\u2019s what I put in it in my hibernation-themed gift: Instruments of Coziness. Hibernation rule one: you must be cozy. A warm throw blanket for couch lounging is key, and a pair of the fluffiest socks available for optimal snuggling. There are so many cute holiday socks that I had trouble picking the perfect pair! A nice set of pajamas would be great to include in the kit too. \nDelicious Delivery. I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that we\u2019re not leaving the couch, right? Maybe we\u2019ll get up to answer the door for delivery though. Even though I love to cook, I adore getting some indulgent take out on the weekends. Indian food, Italian food, or maybe just a gigantic order of French fries delivered to my door? The world is my oyster. I put a Grubhub gift card in the hibernation kit so that we\u2019ll have plenty of rations for our day of lounging. Grubhub has adorable gift card design options, and you can even upload your own photo to customize them \u2013 what about adding a photo from your favorite binge-watching TV show, or a picture of the meal from your favorite take out place? You could get real creative with these gift cards . They\u2019re a perfect gift for all of the friends and siblings on your list that have stumped your gift-giving abilities! Entertainment . Your Netflix password might be the greatest gift you could bestow on someone, right? Add a holiday card with a list of binge-worthy show suggestions to your gift, and tuck in extra long iPhone charging cord so your gift recipient can scroll through social media for hours on end. A little DIY spa kit is another good addition. I tucked in a pretty nail polish , some festive nail files , and face masks for couch-side facials. Sweet Sips . No judgment here if you want to pop a nice bottle of pinot noir for your day of couch lounging. Nothing is better than a glass of wine by the fireplace! I do find though that a cozy winter weekend at home is the only time of year where you get to indulge in hot cocoa topped with an obscene amount of marshmallows. Finding a nice cocoa mix and some festive marshmallows , or marshmallow stir-sticks , is the perfect addition to the hibernation kit.Wrap it all up in a basket and you\u2019ve put together the most useful holiday gift for your sister, brother, best friend, cousin, or secret Santa! I wouldn\u2019t mind receiving one, hint-hint ! SHOP THE POST \nPlease note:   Grubhub . All opinions, ideas and images are my own.
