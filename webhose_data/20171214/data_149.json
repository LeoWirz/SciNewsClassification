I personally believe power-wise the top demons are stronger than the top godess clan members. That means Mel, Zeldris and Estarossa individually are stronger than any of the four arch angels. The same goes for Cusack and Chandeler.

The internet is a very powerful tool. It is powerful enough to connect billions of people all over the world. Regardless of their races, religions, and status, everyone could use it.\n\nThat is if you can position your videos correctly. You need to get some amazing talents too. Look for some gimmicks to attract your clients. Voice is important. That also goes to look. Of course, beside than these, there are other more ways to impress your audience. To get high end materials, hiring the Music Videography Texas would certainly help. This town will be able to supply you amazing video experts. They could help you shoot your music video using the highest quality of materials. They are very artistic, primarily, in fulfilling their duties and roles. You better speak to some of them. Do not just hire somebody without knowing and measuring their potential.\n\nIt will highly decide your faith. Therefore, work it out. Determine the right person suited for the job. You should know who they are. Use your connections. Certainly, in this endeavor, you would have tons of enemies. That is true. Hence, you should be prepared enough to face them. Despite that fact, though, never ever forget the presence of your friends.\n\nWithout any connections, it is hard to reach the top. If this is your weakness, you could just start building one right now. Whatever the circumstances could be, no matter how tall the wall or difficult the huddle, you should be creative and strong enough to overcome it.\n\nJust like other candidates, though, various measures should be conducted to prevent their debut from going down. You are still in the field of competition. As early as now, every artist should know what this field truly looks like. This is necessary. In this field, you are not allowed to rest. You need to watch your actions and words.\n\nAs described from it, you could certainly see how demanding and hard this industry could be. If you let your guard down for a very long time, some newbies might devour you. Of course, it can be done by a veteran too. Therefore, start watching and evaluating your actions. You certainly know and understand what are the things that are placed at stake.\n\nIt is not alright to just listen. Review how true and competitive their claims could be. Stop rushing things. Set that aside for now. If you like, think about of doing some inquiries. Talk to their agents. See if they could show you some samples of their previous works. Try not to get stuck on that matter, though.\n\nUsing these qualities, expect that you will find some credible tips and answers regarding the subject. Vote with your team. Aside from reconsidering the competitive edge of every prospect, analyze and understand how interesting their piece could be. It should be alluring both to the ears and the eyes.\n\nThat is why stop deciding things immediately. Compare and assess your options. Perform some rational observation. It does not mean that a specific firm has an attractive advertisement or promotion, you are going to choose them immediately. Life does not work that way. Therefore, despite how hectic your schedule could be, stay rational.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nYou can find a list of the advantages you get when you use music videography Texas services at http://www.fbgdv.com/services right now. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joseph richardson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:46.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d957323cce796bde32d132b5cf1925716c4aedfa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSxMObmQyY.CuXAnWwhz5m4g-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d957323cce796bde32d132b5cf1925716c4aedfa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSxMObmQyY.CuXAnWwhz5m4g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "2006,46,97,97,0.04124\n2006,47,97,97,0.06957\n2006,48,115,97,0.06569\n2006,49,137,115,0.05357\n2006,50,112,137,0.04132\n2006,51,121,112,0.06154\n2006,52,130,121,0.02586\r\n\t\r\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVR\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n#Importing data\ndata = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\ndata = data.as_matrix()\n\n#Random data generator\n#datar = np.random.random_sample((7,21))\n#inputdatar = datar[:,0:4]\n\ninputdata = data[:,0:4]\noutput1 = data[:,4]\n\nsvr_rbf = SVR(kernel='rbf',gamma=1)\nsvr_rbf.fit(inputdata,output1)\npre = svr_rbf.predict(inputdata)\naxis = range(0,data.shape[0])\n\nplt.scatter(axis, output1, color='black', label='Data')\nplt.plot(axis, pre, color='red', label='Regression')\nplt.show()\r\n\t\r\n# For SVR we need Feature Scaling\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nsc_x = StandardScaler()\nsc_y = StandardScaler()\n# Scale x and y (two scale objects)\nx = sc_x.fit_transform(x)\ny = sc_y.fit_transform(y)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "svr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:46.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "32e13fa78828ff2856da3bcf5e9c3bbcd9871571", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXNTKqqcqY1opQfdps_ce3aptMKvYnfZ.e4xpsWu8IJeVS.NY9cHr46RYu6zBFgcEqvh8NqHZCsTjkWX5LzuUjjtodseL7lTqHrcSWWdZ24DRiw602apavsfF6GksFSCmOcvbqZjJ13NHGBsqSdCAbOF70dzIjAjmcgX3QzzWs.OYg--", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com", "site": "tripadvisor.com", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g187496-i43-Catalonia.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Catalonia Forum, Travel Discussion for Catalonia, Spain - TripAdvisor", "title": "Where to stay in salou with 2 children - Salou", "title_full": "Where to stay in salou with 2 children - Salou Forum - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-06T11:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 189, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4925a2bc4ea9f18fd98ecdfe4db62dc35b1ee576", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXNTKqqcqY1opQfdps_ce3aptMKvYnfZ.e4xpsWu8IJeVS.NY9cHr46RYu6zBFgcEqvh8NqHZCsTjkWX5LzuUjjtodseL7lTqHrcSWWdZ24DRiw602apavsfF6GksFSCmOcvbqZjJ13NHGBsqSdCAbOF70dzIjAjmcgCtPITI3D7JztT0QdvSo1A", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "MartinGAston", "published": "2017-12-06T16:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Look at Calypso, Jamie 1, San Diego , Oasis Park and San Francisco .\nIt will be very busy.

You\u2019ll be able to scan individual computers, ranges of IP addresses, or complete subnets. There are over 1200 vulnerability plug-ins with Nessus, which allow you to specify an individual vulnerability or a set of vulnerabilities to test for. In contrast to other tools, Nessus won\u2019t assume that explicit services run on common ports; instead, it will try to exploit the vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nAmong of the foundations for discovering the vulnerabilities in the network are:\r\n\r\nKnowing which systems exist\r\nKnowing which ports are open and which listening services are available in those ports\r\nDetermining which operating system is running in the remote machine\r\nOnce you login to Nessus using the web interface, you will be able to see various options, such as:\r\nPolicies\u2013Using which you can configure the options required for scan\r\nScans\u2013for adding different scans\r\nReports\u2013for analyzing the results\r\nThe basic workflow of Nessus tool is to Login, Create or Configure the Policy, Run the Scan, and Analyze the Results.\r\n\r\n\r\nXSS --> Cross Site Scripting\r\n----------------------------\r\n\t1.

despite being told it must close for the remainder of the festive period. \nTendring Council said the seasonal sale of Christmas items, a Santa\u2019s grotto and a miniature train are being run without planning permission at the St John\u2019s Plant Centre site in Earls Hall Drive, off St John\u2019s Road. \nOfficers visited the site on Tuesday and issued a stop notice, which means the unauthorised use must cease immediately and for 28 days. \nBut a message posted on Christmas Wonderland's facebook page on Wednesday night read: \"Our Elves have been working tirelessly and we will be open in the morning as normal. \n\"Again we apologise for any inconvenience caused and look forward to seeing you all soon.\" \nThe move to close the site happened after Essex County Council highways bosses lodged an objection to a planning application stating that in the run-up to last Christmas there were numerous complaints about traffic. \nIn response to the message from Christmas Wonderland, a spokesman for Tendring Council said: \"The council will continue to monitor the situation at Christmas Wonderland and will be visiting the site today to see if it reopens. \n\u201cShould it do so, we would have to consider what, if any, action we need to take.\u201d \nMore than 3,700 people signed a petition within a matter of hours to keep the site open. \nMum Kerry-Ann Cradick, of Clacton, hit out at the council for forcing the attraction to shut. \nShe said: \u201cI went with my nieces and they loved it. I had my baby last year and wanted to take her to see Santa next week. She\u2019s excited but now and I have to let her down. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think the traffic is a big issue \u2013 it hasn\u2019t been before when there are roadworks or when the airshow is on and traffic is bad. \n\u201cWhy do they want to stop a magical event for kids? It\u2019s not fair for the kids who want to see Santa and it is unfair on the business.\u201d \nEssex County Council had said that Earls Hall Drive is of insufficient width to allow two vehicles to pass, which has led to queues of traffic in St Johns Road and increases the risk of collisions. \nPlans were submitted in July for improvements to the road, but the application was refused. \nSt Osyth Parish Council said it had concerns the volume of traffic would cause \u201cabsolute chaos\u201d as in previous years. \nTendring Council said it received a planning application for the temporary use on October 16, just as the attraction opened for this winter. \nTendring Council enforcement boss Fred Nicholls yesterday said the authority had decided to take immediate action with the stop notice. \nHe said: \u201cThere are reports of lengthy queues on St John\u2019s Road this year from residents and it was reported to us that last weekend congestion was causing significant delays by vehicles trying to access the site. \n\u201cThis action is felt necessary due to the potential risk of serious injury \u2013 or worse \u2013 due to the congestion at this particular site.\u201d \nHe said the council wrote to the operators a week ago asking them to stop the unauthorised activity, but they continued trading.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "clacton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred nicholls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kerry-ann cradick", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st osyth parish council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tendring council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "essex county council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earls hall drive", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st johns road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clacton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st john\u2019s plant centre", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:47.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8361535b9f15bf8fd41e7b496086544b85456f83", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Xfpz6gAhW74pa6x4W.LZ8ferZRvUodOLp5bTNayK11T.plerQxzxfvQ4x.qHheOMwmYpHvAlSzWF.RF7Wg.hSDDJ0QCYsFmVLX8Dnddqpdg--", "site_full": "www.bankingtech.com", "site": "bankingtech.com", "site_section": "http://www.bankingtech.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Banking Technology \u00bb Banking Technology", "title": "Viola plans to pull strings with $100m fintech fund", "title_full": "Viola plans to pull strings with $100m fintech fund", "published": "2017-12-07T11:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8361535b9f15bf8fd41e7b496086544b85456f83", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Xfpz6gAhW74pa6x4W.LZ8ferZRvUodOLp5bTNayK11T.plerQxzxfvQ4x.qHheOMwmYpHvAlSzWF.RF7Wg.hSDDJ0QCYsFmVLX8Dnddqpdg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Antony Peyton", "published": "2017-12-07T11:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "Viola plans to pull strings with $100m fintech fund", "text": "Written by Antony Peyton 8 hours ago Israeli investment group Viola has tuned up nicely with an initial closing of $100 million toward a target of $120-$150 million for its new global fintech fund. \nThe fund is backed by banks, insurance companies and asset managers from North America, Europe, APAC and Israel, including Scotiabank , the Travelers Companies, Inc and Bank Hapoalim . \nIgnacio (Nacho) Deschamps, group head, international banking and digital transformation at Scotiabank, says the partnership \u201cwill allow us to access Israel\u2019s innovation ecosystem, including well-established cybersecurity and anti-fraud expertise\u201d. \nViola says it has over $2.8 billion in assets under management.

But Huawei's next P-series model, which will most likely be called P11, is rumored to feature not two, but three cameras on the rear. \nThis setup, according to some information originally uncovered by reliable leaker Evan Blass , would enable 40MP images and a high-quality 5x zoom. Is the next Huawei P-series going to be an imaging powerhouse? A digital artist at one of the company's creative agencies added these \"PCE Series\" ads to their portfolio -- claiming 40MP, 3 lens rear (5x hybrid zoom) + 24MP selfie, all Leica-co-developed. pic.twitter.com/t8w3VlL55L \u2014 Evan Blass (@evleaks) December 6, 2017 \nThe camera module is said to capture 100 percent more light than the current variant, and allegedly comes with a \"Pro Night Mode\" that allows for high-quality night shots without the need for a tripod. As with the brand's current flagship smartphone, the camera module would again carry a 'Leica' label. \nAs you can see from the embedded tweet, this information was allegedly leaked by a digital artist at one of the company's creative agencies, who included promotional material for the device in their portfolio. As leaks go, this feels like a legitimate \"oops,\" but as usual, it is impossible to say anything for sure until Huawei releases the P11 into the wild. \nNonetheless, computational imaging is still in its infancy, and it's only a matter of time before engineers will increase the number of sensors and lenses on smartphone cameras to three (or more).

(1) \n\u201cThis is the first phase III trial to report on the combination of chemotherapy, antiangiogenic treatment and immunotherapy as first line treatment for advanced non-squamous NSCLC,\u201d said lead author Professor Martin Reck, chief oncology physician, Department of Thoracic Oncology, Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf, Germany. \u201cThe trial met its co-primary endpoint of PFS and the preliminary results of the co-primary endpoint of overall survival (OS), although immature, look encouraging.\u201d \nThere is a scientific rationale to support the combinations that have been explored in the trial. Bevacizumab may enhance the ability of atezolizumab to restore anti-cancer immunity by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-related immunosuppression and other mechanisms while chemotherapy may induce immune responses. The chemotherapy used in the trial was carboplatin plus paclitaxel. Atezolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), while bevacizumab is a biologic antiangiogenic drug. \nIMpower150 enrolled 1,202 patients who were randomised to one of three arms: A) chemotherapy plus atezolizumab; B) chemotherapy plus atezolizumab plus bevacizumab; or C) chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. \nThe PFS survival comparison was made between arms B and C and showed that the combination of atezolizumab, bevacizumab and chemotherapy was superior to bevacizumab and chemotherapy alone with a median PFS of 8.3 versus 6.8 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52, 0.74; P < 0.0001) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) wild type (WT) population, which excluded patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) rearrangements. \nThe corresponding median PFS in the Teff-WT population, which included patients with defined expression of a T-effector gene signature in the tumour tissue, was 11.3 versus 6.8 months (HR 0.51; 95% CI 0.38, 0.68; P < 0.0001). PFS benefit was seen regardless of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry status, including PD-L1\u2013negative pts (TC0/IC0: HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.61, 0.99). (2) \nThere were no new safety signals with the combination therapy. Due to prespecified testing hierachy, Arm A versus C has not been formally tested yet. \nReck said: \u201cThere was a significant and clinically relevant improvement in progression-free survival favouring the addition of atezolizumab to bevacizumab and chemotherapy. The results show that there is a way to improve the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC. There were no new safety signals or toxicity issues with this combination so it appears to be a feasible approach for this group of patients.\u201d \nCommenting on treatment for advanced non-squamous NSCLC for ESMO, Professor Solange Peters, Head of Medical Oncology, Department of Oncology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV), Lausanne, Switzerland, said: \u201cImmunotherapy is a standard of care treatment after platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. Frontline immunotherapy alone is beneficial in those with a high PD-L1 expression, who make up less than a third of NSCLC patients. (3) The combination of immunotherapy and platinum-based chemotherapy showed positive response rates in unselected non-squamous patients (without PD-L1 selection) in a hypothesis-generating phase II trial, which led to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.\u201d (4) \n\u201cIMpower150 is the first phase III randomised trial to formally evaluate the combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy versus chemotherapy frontline,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe backbone therapy includes bevacizumab which might, by targeting VEGF, facilitate the immune response and the trafficking of T cells. Median PFS for the immunotherapy arm in patients without EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements had a promising hazard ratio of 0.62 and a median PFS improvement of a little less than two months.\u201d \nPeters said the benefit of immunotherapy is best observed at later time points. \u201cWhen you look at the 12-month PFS, you double the number of patients who have not progressed from 18% without immunotherapy to 37% when you add the immunotherapy,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is very, very promising. Doubling PFS at one year is something we have not seen with any targeted therapy in unselected patients to date.\u201d \nEven more important was that the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy was beneficial regardless of expression of PD-L1 or a T-effector gene signature. It was also beneficial in patients with alterations in EGFR and ALK, who usually do not do well with immunotherapy. Peters said: \u201cWe know that for immunotherapy monotherapy, we need to highly select patients for PD-L1 expression. This trial shows that by combining chemotherapy and immunotherapy you completely delete any need for patient selection according to a particular biomarker. This strategy has the potential to benefit large numbers of patients with advanced NSCLC without the practical difficulties of biomarker testing.\u201d \nPeters concluded: \u201cThese exciting results pave the way for a new standard of care in advanced non-squamous NSCLC. The initial overall survival data looks encouraging, but we must wait for it to mature. We will also need to understand the impact of this combination in patients who have already received other immunotherapies. In the next year, other trials will report results in frontline treatment-na\u00efve NSCLC patients using the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy or the combination of two immunotherapy drugs. The challenge will then be to judge which strategy is the best.\u201d -END- Notes to Editors \nPlease make sure to use the official name of the meeting in your reports:   \nOfficial hashtag: #ESMOImmuno17 References and notes Abstract LBA1_PR \u2018Primary PFS and safety analyses of a randomized phase III study of carboplatin + paclitaxel +/\u2212 bevacizumab, with or without atezolizumab in 1L non-squamous metastatic NSCLC (IMpower150)\u2018 will be presented by Martin Reck during the Proffered Paper session \u2018Combining immune checkpoint inhibitors and VEGF targeted therapies in cancer treatment\u2019 on Thursday, 7 December, 18:15 to 19:15 (CET) in Room A .

Bev may further enhance atezo efficacy by inhibiting VEGF immunosuppression and promoting T-cell tumour infiltration. IMpower150 evaluates the addition of atezo to carboplatin (C) + paclitaxel (P) \u00b1 bevacizumab (bev) in chemo-naive patients (pts) with non-squamous (NSQ) mNSCLC. \nMethods: 1202 pts received atezo 1200 mg + C AUC 6 + P 200 mg/m 2 (Arm A) or atezo + bev 15 mg/kg + C + P (Arm B) vs bev + C + P (Arm C) IV q3w for 4 or 6 cycles per investigator (INV) discretion, then maintenance atezo, atezo + bev or bev, respectively. Co-primary endpoints assessed at this data cutoff (15 Sep 2017; minimum follow up, 9.5 mo) were INV-assessed PFS in the ITT-WT ( EGFR or ALK negative) population and in WT pts with expression of a tumour T-effector gene signature (Teff-WT; centrally assessed), and OS in the ITT-WT population, for the Arm B vs Arm C comparison. Due to pre-specified statistical testing hierarchy, Arm A vs Arm C has not been formally tested yet. \nResults: 356 pts in Arm B and 336 pts in Arm C were enrolled in the ITT-WT. Median age was 63 y; 60% were previous smokers (both arms). 61% and 62% were male, and 39% and 43% had ECOG PS 0 in Arms B and C, respectively. The HRs for INV-assessed PFS in Arm B vs C were 0.62 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.74; P < 0.0001) in the ITT-WT and 0.51 (0.38, 0.68; P < 0.0001) in the Teff-WT populations. Median PFS in Arm B vs C was 8.3 mo vs 6.8 mo and 11.3 mo vs 6.8 mo in the ITT-WT and Teff-WT populations, respectively. PFS benefit was seen regardless of PD-L1 IHC status, including PD-L1\u2013negative pts (TC0/IC0; HR, 0.77 [95% CI: 0.61, 0.99]). Landmark PFS and ORR are shown (Table). Arm B had a comparable safety profile to Arm C; treatment-related serious AEs were 25% vs 19%, respectively. \nConclusions: IMpower150 is the first Ph 3 study to show a statistically significant and clinically meaningful PFS benefit with atezo + bev + chemo vs bev + chemo in pts with 1L NSQ mNSCLC. \nTable: LBA1_PR IMpower150 Primary PFS Analysis, landmark PFS and ORR \nDOR, duration of response; HR, hazard ratio; ORR, objective response rate; PFS, progression-free survival; Teff, T-effector; WT, wild-type. a WT populations exclude patients with EGFR or ALK driver mutations. b Unconfirmed ORR. c n = 353 in Arm B and n = 331 in Arm C. d n = 153 in Arm B and n = 127 in Arm C.NCT02366143 \nLegal entity responsible for the study: F.

In addition to that, it is dependent on ideas focused on hidden forces which are applicable for maintaining life. It has been assumed that if those aspects are disturbed then you become vulnerable to damages and other analogous dangers, but its increase cause happier states.\n\nIts designer warned you to follow ethical notions if you centralized on promoting serenity, peace, and harmony. Because you apprehended basic notions which are associated with self acceptance workshop CA , its ends and advantages are widely delivered. Similar to falls moving, it moves in which energies are almost depleted for broadening and cleansing avenues as the result of its emergence.\n\nIt was packed with its highlight to treat emotional, physical, spiritual, and cognitive elements that result in different health profits that include peace, harmony, and serenity. It referred to more simplified, safer, and natural for self improvements and spiritual actions that you can use. Its services are indicated to be suitable as medical procedures that treat negative impacts and inspire harmony.\n\nIn connection with that, your capacity to perform those practices is not educated thru common platforms, yet is instilled by activities. It is educated amid attunements which are shortened by coaches, thus enabling them to acquire the existence of life forces to strengthen your wellbeing and routines. Its usages are not based on any spiritual growths and mental abilities which are attainable for you.\n\nDespite its spiritual properties, it was stated that its connections with religious ideas and principles are mistaken, but you are not advised to praise entities. Because of this, its structures are not dependent on those aspects that are applied, despite of your differing perspectives. While it may not be called as procedures related to those aspects, it is essential that you maintain your compliance for harmony.\n\nIt was incapable of ordering for health evaluations and medical analyses to read about which abilities have to be improved and molded. Unlike other types of basic meditative and meditation techniques, capable specialists are not warned to waste time, energy, and effort during those cases. For its attention is not pointed on those themes, it failed to offer numerous harms.\n\nAmid roughly all other situations, you need to position your hands over agitating parts. It has the capacity to inspire natural healing practices that lessen blood loss, swelling, inflammation, and pain altogether with services delivered for treating burnt skins. Next, emotional trauma is identical to physical concerns.\n\nYour pressures, tensions, and frustrations about practices centralized on medical contradictions are removed. If your susceptibility to burns, sprains, bruises, bites, and cuts are noticeable then its competency escalates. Because trauma appears, it became functional in alleviating damaged places which lead to soothing ends.\n\nBut thru focusing on those practices, your minds and bodies are relieved from those issues. Because its benefits are endless, it is globally provided which allows you to experience the best stages of comfort, relief, and ease. Searching for medical techniques that meet your demands, preferences, and conditions is needed.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nFind a summary of the benefits of attending a self acceptance workshop CA area and more info about upcoming workshops at http://www.peaceandwellnessproject.com/workshops today. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "martha fox", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:49.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b2c5e66b7b28244404c1436ab12f4878fdbd8e0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Xfpz6gAhW74pa6x4W.LZ8ferZRvUodOKC7H4CGzJitaRVANZiGPwjnP6rG57q3g5GdISpUZcB3IeIDPA2jR2TQZr7.zKrFFwqAf35tbZNMg--", "site_full": "www.bankingtech.com", "site": "bankingtech.com", "site_section": "http://www.bankingtech.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Banking Technology \u00bb Banking Technology", "title": "The missing link: the supply side of cryptocurrency", "title_full": "The missing link: the supply side of cryptocurrency", "published": "2017-12-07T02:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b2c5e66b7b28244404c1436ab12f4878fdbd8e0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Xfpz6gAhW74pa6x4W.LZ8ferZRvUodOKC7H4CGzJitaRVANZiGPwjnP6rG57q3g5GdISpUZcB3IeIDPA2jR2TQZr7.zKrFFwqAf35tbZNMg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Banking Technology", "published": "2017-12-07T02:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "The missing link: the supply side of cryptocurrency", "text": "9 hours ago Clay Wilkes, Galileo Processing: make no mistake, crypto is here to stay Supply and demand are the bedrock of market-based economics. To achieve economic equilibrium, supply and demand must be in balance. If one is too high or too low, the system is in a state of disequilibrium, associated with inefficient allocation of goods \u2013 not a healthy state. \nIt\u2019s easy to think about supply and demand in terms of what our microeconomics textbooks used to call \u201cwidgets\u201d. But, the law of supply and demand applies to intangibles, too. Everyone knows the example of the stock market. The value of stock is what someone is willing to pay for it, so when demand is high and supply is low, stock prices rise; when the situation is reversed, stock prices fall. \nA more topical example is Uber. Uber fares rise and fall with rider demand and driver capacity. When ride demand outpaces supply, Uber\u2019s \u201csurge\u201d pricing corrects the imbalance. Other digital age companies \u2013 like Airbnb, Task Rabbit, Craigslist and more \u2013 also use dynamic, supply and demand-based pricing to create what economists call \u201cefficient\u201d markets for their services. \nThe law of supply and demand also should apply to the cryptocurrency market. But today, it doesn\u2019t. We see this disequilibrium in the radical swings in cryptocurrency value, which \u2013 while benefitting those who bought Bitcoin , for example, in the $800s earlier in the year and have ridden the rollercoaster to its current $4,000+ value \u2013 make it a poor currency replacement. \nCryptocurrencies\u2019 state of disequilibrium: it\u2019s all about demand \nThink what you like about cryptocurrencies, but the genie is out of the bottle. There has been too much investment and growth for cryptocurrencies not to be a part of the future of payments. One estimate puts VC investment alone in cryptocurrency start-ups at about $2 billion, and that doesn\u2019t include funds raised through initial coin offerings (ICOs). Last quarter, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase achieved unicorn status by closing another funding round, giving it a $1.6 billion valuation. \nMoving forward is inevitable, but there are three key factors keeping cryptocurrencies in a state of disequilibrium and, therefore, not benefiting from an efficient allocation market. Scale \nAccording to Coinschedule, token sales in about 140 initial coin offerings have topped $2 billion this year. With \u201cat least a few ICOs typically beginning every day\u201d, some predict the yearend number could be as much as $4 billion. \nHowever, despite tremendous growth, cryptocurrencies haven\u2019t yet scaled to achieve price efficiency; i.e., the marketplace has yet to mature. Referencing an example above, Airbnb, in its startup days, experienced significant housing mispricing until there was sufficient supply to make its pricing efficient. \nThe immature market also introduces confusion and adds to the speculative environment of cryptocurrencies. \nAnd, ironically, there\u2019s a flip side to the coin involving too much scale; that is, the ability for the underlying blockchain technology to efficiently handle even relatively small number of transactions is well known. Rational investors \nEfficiency assumes rational investors, but we can\u2019t, in my opinion, assume the bulk of today\u2019s cryptocurrency investors meet that criterion. Reasons for investing in (or buying) cryptocurrencies are varied. Some are lured by get-rich-quick possibilities, some by the cool factor and some by the opportunity to transact virtually anonymously. \nI don\u2019t believe we can yet say that the bulk of cryptocurrency investors are acting on their belief in the need for a universal currency without regulation or oversight by a sovereign nation or central bank, or on their need for a faster, more cost-efficient way to transact \u2013 in other words \u201crational investors.\u201d Absence of \u201csellers\u201d. \nWithout a critical mass of merchants and other payments recipients that accept cryptocurrencies and convert those cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies (i.e., \u201csell\u201d the cryptocurrency to run their businesses), the cryptocurrency market remains a one-sided demand market. Again, this fuels a speculative marketplace characterized by big run-ups and drops in valuation. This is not a stable way to sustain a currency in which value can be exchanged for goods and services in a predictable way. \nIn sum, in its current state, today\u2019s cryptocurrency market is asymmetrical. It\u2019s all about demand. And, that asymmetry means the cryptocurrency market is, for the average person, illiquid \u2013 cryptocurrency exchanges, which are slow and expensive, notwithstanding. \nUnlocking liquidity through a more efficient cryptocurrency market \nThe clearest path I see to greater cryptocurrency liquidity is unlocking the available supply to promote scale and, over time, attracting more rational investors \u2013 leading to a cryptocurrency market that approaches equilibrium and is, therefore, more efficient. By unlocking available supply, I don\u2019t mean creating more coins. I mean actually using cryptocurrency as currency; thereby increasing its velocity or the rate at which value is exchanged from one transaction to another. \nThe key to this approach is encouraging and supporting major retailers and other high-volume acceptors of payments, like utilities, to accept cryptocurrencies. If these types of businesses are paid in cryptocurrencies, they will convert these payments to dollars so they can then pay their suppliers.

This unlocks the supply side, with the added benefit of a multiplier effect throughout the supply chain. \nThis is easier said than done, of course, but it\u2019s clear that retailers and other high-volume payments acceptors are the key because of the current disequilibrium between cryptocurrency supply and demand, and the consequent lack of liquidity.

Last night was our WI Christmas Entertainment Party and we had the most fabulous evening.  Our group is so talented.  Our WI choir sang quite a few numbers and we also had a couple of songs from a member who used to be a professional singer in her youth. One lady performed a rap, a couple of others performed a sketch as two angels one wearing an L plate signifying she was a trainee angel.  I could go on forever telling you all the acts .  We all provided a plate for the buffet and the tables were groaning with food, and some fabulous cakes.  Well after all we are talking about the WI so providing cake was a no brainer!   Today is the start of the Christmas Tree Festival we are organising in the church so we have two trees to decorate - a traditional Christmas tree and an alternative tree from our Craft and Laugh Group made from lamp shades.

Since there are specific purposes to visit a place, its wise to have a comfy, safe and budget friendly ride. One can say that it concerns amiable staffs, fully functional air conditioners and relaxing seats which passengers will simply enjoy and wish to experience.\n\nPlanning to visit unfamiliar places without plans or guides can only instigate trouble to travelers. But when they choose to travel via luxury motor coach , their travel experience wold become good and exceptional. Such vehicle takes in a form of bus and is used for tours, educational field trips among many others. Just like how you come up with plans on some other vehicles, its smart to figure out several pointers which could serve as the key to land with an ideal option.\n\nBusiness Reputation. Renting a bus involves getting to know the service providers. You should make sure that you are dealing with the reliable ones. Start doing your research. Figure out which among the prominent companies received high ratings and reviews from customers. Word of mouth from friends and families might also help you define and narrow down your choices.\n\nVehicle Size. When traveling in large numbers, its crucial to pick a type of bus that can handle a lot of people. Ask questions to your service representatives regarding the maximum capacity that the chosen bus can handle. Knowing the seating capacities would make it easier to make decisions on buses to rent. Eventually, you would need to individually inspect the vehicle.\n\nSafety Attributes. Safety would remain to be pivotal. Regardless of the distance to cover, its vital to guarantee the safety of people on board. Make sure to choose buses that are equipped with warning signs and protective device to reduce the likelihood of accidents to occur. Select smartly, so you would not shoulder the emotional burden of worries coupled with frustration.\n\nRules on Board. While its crucial to follow the rules that are implemented on the buses, its also wise to prepare your own rules and regulations that every passenger should strictly obey and take into account. Under no circumstances should you agree to run a vehicle when rules are not discussed with everyone. Do this first and rest assured problems can be minimized along the way.\n\nServices. Expert service providers have the willingness to present a service which is customer friendly and laudable. Find and interview some clients whom you could inquire plenty of questions and concerns. Hear the advice and recommendations provided by the customers. In such way, you would be aware whether you end up with a good service or not.\n\nCost. It is wise to calculate the specific rates to spend on renting a motor coach. Ask if the total calculated cost includes the extra rates and hidden charges. You must guarantee to pay the correct amount and not the overpriced one.\n\nRenting such vehicle should be done seriously. Even if the distance to travel is short, never take anything lightly. Do not be reluctant to talk things together with some companions to make smart decision.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nYou can find a detailed overview of the reasons why you should purchase a luxury motor coach at http://www.powerhousecoach.com right now. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christopher campbell", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:50.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d7b0b9fa8e974c45cec433894b353cdd5a4c8387", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9D2Qkpp6vWSMwMM8NxS2qQ4nMVF4sMvv9Bob7v5bEBIrUg0DFOM3zdfarAJa7LyplYGF.hnQyoU.55ALQHMtVzBDc0lAzS2MGDYBAO0cazSfeJERxUy69r", "site_full": "www.lse.co.uk", "site": "lse.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.lse.co.uk/share-chat.asp?page=217", "site_categories": ["united_kingdom", "travel", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Share Chat on London South East.

It was a really good environment when it started out.\u201d \nHe began working at Rolls-Royce, which he says helped him build up an active social life in the new place. \nHarvey retired in 1990 after 25 years service, which gave him more time to fill with various organisations. \nJohn Currie, who was one of his managers at The Rolly, decided to start up the Kilbryde Burns Club and enrolled Harvey straight away. \nHarvey was surprised at first but ended up as chairman of the group. \nHe remembered: \u201cAt first I said \u2018you can\u2019t do that\u2019 but I really enjoyed it.\u201d \nThe Westwood Parish Church member said he could always tell if he liked a club after a couple of sessions and highlighted the speakers club as one of his favourites.

I loved the descriptions in this book! It starts off capturing your attention and I just had to find out what would happen. No sparkly vampires here (thank god). Just ripped, sexy and mysterious vamps.\nWhen Abby moved in with her friend Natalie (an actress) in the Hollywood hills, never in her wildest dreams did she think about meeting the man next door. It happened by accident when she went looking for her friends cat. She wandered into his back yard and found him getting out of the pool naked as a the day he was born. His name was Caleb and was a huge celebrity movie maker. One of the movies he made was called Viper.\nI love the characters in this book. I adored reading about Abby! I love her personality and her inner strength and fire that she has but doesn\u2019t show very often.\nFor me it was a very enjoyable read!\nI would recommend this book to readers who love Vampires and other supernatural creatures with a heavy dose of sexuality.\n \nBlurb: (from Goodreads )\nWhat turns me on? YOU.\nCaleb Crane is a ripped and protective vampire who knows exactly what he wants. And what he wants is the sexy young lawyer, Abby March, who just showed up in Hollywood.\nAnd then something shocking emerges from Abby\u2019s past that changes everything. A secret so dark, she can\u2019t hide from it or run away any longer.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \n\u201cFACING FRANKENSTEIN\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s a self-help book that has pride of place on the Brendan Rodgers bookcase. \nTo summarise, facing your \u201cmental monster\u201d, chapter after chapter of exercises and techniques designed to improve psychological toughness. \nThe Celtic boss has his own horrific consequences to confront after performing surgery on a side that has become a domestic savage. \nBut the nuts and bolts of his 19 months of work is the creation of a team that has the grotesque irony of being far too good for Scotland but not fit for purpose in Europe. Brendan Rodgers has to work out how he can get his side to raise their game in Europe (Image: SNS) Read More Celtic players must prove Brendan Rodgers wrong and show they CAN cut it in Europe says Scott Brown \nThere\u2019s also a disturbing subplot to their Champions League shockers, just how badly do the club\u2019s failings reflect on Scottish football on a broader context? \nWednesday night\u2019s loss to Anderlecht may have allowed our champions to stumble into the Europa League but it also piled up some statistics that should have Hoops fans hiding behind the curtain. \nCeltic have not won in the group stages at home since a 2-1 victory over Ajax in October 2013. It\u2019s been a downward spiral that has inflicted five defeats on the bounce and continues a worst ever run in the competition at a stadium that was once a 12th man. A dozen Champions League games have passed since they last kept a clean sheet at their own ground. \nIn fairness, Rodgers deserves all the praise going for giving life to the stadium after a rejuvenation from Ronny Deila\u2019s reign but it was always going to be a transplant done on the cheap. Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now \nAnd so it has been proved with each and every time this Celtic side is asked to take a step up in class. There needs to be separation from their Scottish achievements and European failings if credit is going to given to where it\u2019s due. To go 67 games unbeaten is incredible testament to consistency and focus from a side that Rodgers refuses to allow to drop their standard. \nIt comes at a price. The longer it goes without any of our clubs laying a glove on Celtic, the greater the depreciation and devalue of our game. \nWhen Rodgers was Liverpool boss, Dr Steve Peters was the sports psychiatrist he had his players working with at their Melwood training ground. That\u2019s all well and good when you have a Luis Suarez. The Hoops dominance on the home front is testimony to what Rodgers has brought to the club (Image: PA) Read More Watch as Lisbon Lion legend Bertie Auld belts out traditional favourite in car karaoke \nBut strengthening your mental faculties is all but gobbledygook if the bottom line is you\u2019re just not good enough. \nRodgers hoped his players who have shown against Anderlecht that his is a side learning how to cope with the requirements on this stage but was only left disappointed. \nHe said: \u201cSome of them think they are Champions League players but this is a good leveller for some of those guys to reflect on the performance and be better. \n\u201cIt was a poor performance. Our technique was poor. The players could not play quickly enough and needed five or six touches on the ball.\u201d \nThen came the caveat and he was right to claim a triumph for guiding a Scottish club into European competition beyond Christmas. Celtic's destruction of Aberdeen proved how far ahead of everyone in Scotland the Hoops are Read More Brendan Rodgers hails 'brilliant' Europa League achievement but knows vast improvement is needed \nEuro millions have been banked but it has disguised little. Look closer and you could detect that same dismay displayed by Derek McInnes last month when his pretenders to the Premiership throne were dismantled by the champions in a 3-0 win that took them clear points clear at the top of the table. It\u2019s a look of resignation which can easily be forgiven when a bridge too far is confronted. \nHow to cope with swatting away every domestic challenge until sides of the calibre of Atletico Madrid, CSKA Moscow, Arsenal , Villarreal, AC Milan or Lazio come calling on Euro duty in February. \nIt\u2019s a hideous dilemma.

I spotted this one in a local bottle shop alongside the brewery\u2019s raspberry version of the beer and was tempted to pick that one up as well but opted to see how this one goes before grabbing that one as well, so hopefully this one turns out to be as good as the last beer from the brewery that I tried.\n\nAppearance (4/5): Dark ruby with an almost purple hue in places and topped with a quarter-inch foamy head that took a fairly aggressive pour to form and is a light brown colour with purple hues through that as well. It is patchy towards the centre but I don\u2019t have too many complaints given the strength of the beer.\nAroma (8/10): Surprisingly fruity to begin with, there is obviously a lot of the blackcurrant and blackberries coming through in the early going with a subtle hint of cherry too. The beer seems fresher than I\u2019m used to for an imperial stout with some good sweetness and tart notes in the early going as well. There are followed up by the salted caramel advertised on the can as well as some lighter fruits that give the beer a juicy aroma to it. There\u2019s some milky notes further on with some darker malts and roasted notes seeing things out but it\u2019s a lighter smell than expected from such a strong beer with the fruits dominating for the most part and it is certainly something different too.\nTaste (7/10): Slightly darker than the nose with lactose and milk flavours coming more to the front alongside the berries from the nose and the blackcurrant too. It\u2019s again sweet and fresh, very juicy too with and little caramel towards the middle that only added to the sweetness before some of the tart from the nose started to come through and eventually eclipsed what was showing on the nose. Again it was an unusual beer for an imperial stout and definitely something different to what I\u2019m used to, it was enjoyable as well which was nice but I\u2019m not totally convinced by it in truth.\nPalate (3/5): Medium bodied and definitely a little lighter than you would expect from a 10% abv. beer but at least it wasn\u2019t a thin offering. The beer was fruity with some nice sweetness and tart showing in both the nose and the taste plus there was good variety to the beer whilst the balance wasn\u2019t too bad either; it was perhaps a little too sweet at times but it remained drinkable throughout anyway. Despite coming through at 10% abv. and being labelled as an imperial stout, the beer was surprisingly light on alcohol flavours and grain, the rest of the fruits seemingly masking the alcohol content completely.\nOverall (14/20): Quite an unusual beer here, this one is labelled as an imperial stout but at times seemed closer to a sour or fruit beer with plenty of blackcurrant and berries coming through in the early going, accompanied by some caramel and milk flavours but both of these definitely seemed to take a back seat to the fruits. The alcohol content of the beer in particular was well hidden and it was surprisingly easy to drink, although the sweetness did seem a little overdone at times sadly. It was a varied beer with a lot going on and it was unlike anything I\u2019d tried before but I\u2019m not convinced that it would be a beer that I\u2019d rush back to again I\u2019m afraid since there is already a lot of better imperial stouts out there waiting to be tried.\nBrewed In: Kippen, Stirling, Scotland\nBrewery: Fallen Brewing\nFirst Brewed: 2017\nType: Imperial Stout\nAbv: 10.0%\nServing: Can (330ml)\nPurchased: Good Spirits Co.

I don\u2019t know what it is, but somehow underneath all the layers of knits and scarves, a pretty lace bra can certainly lift spirits\u2026wait, did I just make a pun? I have a special place in my heart for black lace\u2026and I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s probably because I was always told black was too sexy as a teenager \u2013 which actually makes zero sense to me because in my mind it leaves a lot more to the imagination than say, nude or pink. And what\u2019s wrong with feeling sexy anyway!? I seem to have a lot of suppressed feelings on this topic.I\u2019m curious to know how many of you enjoy lingerie shopping as much as I do? Obviously there\u2019s the annoyance of finding the perfect fit (when it comes to bras anyway), but picking out new underwear is somehow a lot more fulfilling than trying to find a pair of jeans\u2026and much more affordable too! Sometimes I feel like when I get that urge to shop (ladies, you know the feeling), a pop into Victoria\u2019s Secret is much easier on the wallet \u2013 and I always feel immediately satisfied too. On top of that, there\u2019s nothing to break in (the worst) . If you\u2019re reading this post via mobile, lucky you, I\u2019ve made my top picks easily shop-able with the help of RewardStyle! If not, well I hope you enjoy the pretty pictures\u2026speaking of which, these were taken at the cutest little Airbnb called The Apartment Upstairs in Portland which was seriously the cutest (and perfect for a couple of girls obsessed with pretty spaces to take photos in). \nxx -b.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "portland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victoria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "airbnb", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:54.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3869ed9a1f9ada75b3120a936401e62aa8b5c3e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.CtWGBCQ5SYfyGpKoy2hG2_qe99NKfQaNTjcBOmadOLmJj7VmCw4O34rCvoY7Vu8s-", "site_full": "www.mumsnet.com", "site": "mumsnet.com", "site_section": "http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/conception", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Conception | Mumsnet Discussion ", "title": "2ww", "title_full": "2ww | Mumsnet Discussion", "published": "2017-12-07T06:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "/images/logo/mn-logo-square.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6762, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e673cd3dd912d74a00aaf6de18033b298bd61e99", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.CtWGBCQ5SYfyGpKoy2hG2_qe99NKfQaNTjcBOmadOLmJj7VmCw4O3HYPaxUwzWp0_foQgoHfdLKw8linepdce", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "dancingunicorns123", "published": "2017-12-07T16:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "@Allcrossed well good luck!

The house has passed HR 38 on to the senate. This is the national concealed carry reciprocity bill. If it passes into law you will be able to carry your gat in New York or Illinois while traveling thru if you have a permit from elsewhere, or if you live in a state that does not require a permit to carry. Another good thing the Republicans have done recently. Now the bad news, another tragic and stupid accidental death. A five-year old in Anchorage found a loaded gun in a night stand and managed to kill himself with it in the wee hours of Wednesday morning.
