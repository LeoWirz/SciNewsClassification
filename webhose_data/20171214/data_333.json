This article offers a lot of information pertaining to wine. There is a lot to learn about the ways wine can benefit your life. This article is a great way to learn right now.\nIf you are new to wine tasting, you should know that true connoisseurs actually spit the wine after tasting it.

Be sure you know which wine you\u2019re looking before to avoid getting overwhelmed by brands, varieties, and prices. Certain wines fit dinners and others better fit large parties. Knowing which simply click the up coming article suits your needs can help you choose a better wine than browsing and choosing something on a whim.\nGet some Windex ready if you accidentally spill wine on your shirt. Windex will rid your shirt of the stain better than the traditional soap and water method. You must get to the stain immediately, however. If it is allowed time to set in, the stain becomes impossible to remove.\nLearn the pronunciation of all of the wines that you serve so that you sound as professional as possible when you are around your guests. This can go a long way if you are having a party or get together with friends in your house. There are http://www.chicagotribune.com/dining/sc-food-italy-big-three-wine-1013-story.html for wine, so get acquainted with the lingo.\nIf you have a lot of wine in your cellar, you may want to invest in an inventory management system. This will track the types of wine that you have in your cellar and how old they are at a given time. Compartmentalizing wine into a database can make your storage capabilities very efficient.\nThe longer you keep the white wine in the fridge, the more the coldness will affect both its smell and taste. Therefore, it is best to only chill wine for several hours prior to serving. This will maximize the taste and enjoyment that you will receive from each bottle you drink.\nMake sure that the temperature is perfect when serving your wine. For example, a red wine should be served at sixty degrees. In order to let the wine warm in the glass, start it at 58 degrees. Serve white wines at around 47 degrees. If it is served warmer, it may result in a dull tasting wine.\nAvoid over chilling white wines. Many wine drinkers will buy a bottle of their favorite white and return home to pop it in the fridge. While chilling whites is important, too much cold will diminish flavors in the wine; sometimes the most important ones. Target a temperature around 60 degrees up to 68 degrees to achieve the prime flavor.\nTake notes on any wine that you try out. You aren\u2019t going to really know what you are doing at first. However, over time, you will start noticing specific trends in your notes and reactions. You might even see that your reaction to particular wine\u2019s changes as you drink more of them.\nWhen cooking with wine, remember that the alcohol will evaporate during the cooking process, leaving behind the true taste of the wine itself. For this reason, it is wise to choose a wine that you enjoy the flavor of. If you are cooking with a wine that tastes bad to you, you wouldn\u2019t want to flavor your recipe with it, right?\nMost people cannot afford a wine cellar in their home, but that does not mean you cannot create an atmosphere that is conducive to storing a few great bottles of wine. Try to store you wine in a darker location where the temperature will remain fairly consistent. Doing this will preserve the quality of your bottles of wine until you are ready to drink them.\nA good tip when purchasing wine at the supermarket is to know how to pick out the right wine. In the wine aisle, you\u2019ll often find a lot of huge jugs of wine. This type of wine isn\u2019t very good so you\u2019ll want to cross all of those off your list.\nOn your next restaurant outing, avoid paying too much for a bottle of Chardonnay. It is America\u2019s favorite wine, and restaurants often take advantage of its popularity by charging more than it\u2019s really worth. Consider affordable and other great-tasting alternatives such as Gr\u00fcner-Veltliner or something less popular like Riesling.\nDon\u2019t be afraid to try something new. Once a particular wine catches on with the public, it is often found in mass on the market. It can be hard to find a good wine when there are so many sub-par labels on the shelves. To combat this problem, try wine from lesser known regions. You may be surprised at the quality.\nTake digital photos of wine labels and store them with your notes. Your wine hobby will take you to dozens of tasting and hundreds of wines. At some point, it\u2019s going to get a bit overwhelming and confusing. These photos \u2013 when paired with notes- will help keep your knowledge on track.\nNo matter, how much you enjoy a particular type of wine, do not purchase a whole case of it.

It is also anticipated to register CAGR of 2.9% during the forecast period between 2017 and 2026. The global wax market is also expected to bring in US$ 11,017.7 million revenue towards the end of 2026. There are different types of waxes being used for various applications. For instance, the fossil-based wax is being largely used for making candles, coatings and polishing, and in packaging. Meanwhile, paraffin wax which is derived from various processes of crude oil refining is being used in beauty and cosmetic care industry as it is safe to use.

Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

Ulyukayev who is on trial for allegedly taking a $2 million bribe is expected to deliver... \nBy NATALIYA VASILYEVAAssociated Press \nMOSCOW (AP) - Wrapping up one of Russia's most high-profile trials of the year, a former economic development minister charged with bribery on Thursday accused an oil executive of setting him up and apologized for \"turning back on other people's misfortunes.\" \nAlexei Ulyukayev, the highest-ranking Russian official to be arrested since 1993, was detained last year at the headquarters of Russia's largest oil producer, the state-owned Rosneft, after a sting operation by Russia's main intelligence agency. Prosecutors say he accepted a $2 million bribe from Rosneft's influential CEO, Igor Sechin, for giving the company the green light for privatizing another oil firm. \nThe circumstances of the case have ignited speculation that Ulyukayev was caught in a Kremlin power play against Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin. \nIn his final argument on Thursday, Ulyukayev pleaded not guilty and accused Sechin of setting him up. \n\"A horrific and cruel provocation has been perpetrated against me,\" he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies. \nSechin, whose testimony was the cornerstone of the case against the former minister, was summoned to testify in court four times but he did not show up, citing urgent matters of business. \nReferring to a common perception of Sechin as a dark force in Russian politics, Ulyakayev said in court on Thursday that the key witness \"disappeared - what was left was a whiff of sulfur in the air.\" \nUlyukaev went to Sechin's office in November last year to discuss Rosneft's affairs, and was arrested as he was leaving the building with a bag full of cash that Sechin had given him. Ulyukayev told the court that he thought the bag contained a bottle of wine and a basket filled with sausages. \nIn wire tapes played out to the court earlier in the trial, Sechin was heard telling Ulyukayev to take the bag with the sausage. Russian media has reported that Sechin has a tradition of gifting people baskets of sausages from his own butcher's shop. \nUlyukayev could face a lengthy prison term if found guilty. Prosecutors have asked the court to send him to a high-security prison for ten years, arguing that Ulyukayev's actions \"are undermining the authority of the government.\" \nUlyukayev told the court on Thursday that he is not guilty of \"those absurd accusations but guilty of a different thing: I often compromised. I was a hypocrite. I love taking gifts and giving gifts.

According to the DMC, Salim Ahmad was referred by a tout to undergo a medical fitness test at the Neutech Medical Centre at Taimoor Nagar in south Delhi. The hospital reported him to be a case of HIV+. Ahmad had applied for a job in Dubai and the test was part of his fitness requirement. But two subsequent tests in Gurugram and Uttrakhand reported him to be HIV- and perfectly fit. The Executive Committee of the DMC examined a complaint from Ahmad, forwarded by the Medical Council of India, alleging negligence in the preparation of HIV test report by the Medical Centre, said the letter, a copy of which is with IANS. The letter says that despite repeated notices sent to the Superintendent of the Neutech Medical Centre, it failed to submit a written statement and medical records pertaining to the treatment, tests and investigation of Ahmad. \"This recalcitrant attitude of the medical centre is highly deplorable and reflects poorly on the management... Pprima facie it appears that the complainant has been victim of incompetence of the Neutech Medical centre as he has been wrongfully reported to be having HIV positive and declared unfit vide their report Feb 1, 2017 and made to suffer because of that,\" said the letter to the DGHS. The DGHS was urged to \"take stringent action including closure of the Neutech Medical Centre as it is apprehended that such a centre may not be equipped or have proper qualified doctors to run lab tests\", the letter added.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "salim ahmad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmad", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "the directorate general of health services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delhi medical council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medical council of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "executive committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dmc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neutech medical", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ians", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medical centre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uttrakhand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neutech medical centre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gurugram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taimoor nagar", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:24.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ab992a9d7b705e2bab12143f3fea4f1d9e1629c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg81IbguFbrLh1xku1.m.y9RImpYs3Oto_ba4kpCpl4JgwvOKHp_7KIe7G4XsdeQxsE9jFvLFt9yDMzyLCKeM36_eR0UgE07qlR_4efLPmtTxFOL.SqdiRwIIDthf5Co9kbY6oEoJWw42640QGNPr1M3sY0sZZOrT_U-", "site_full": "www.watfordobserver.co.uk", "site": "watfordobserver.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/rss/", "site_categories": ["media", "business", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Watford Observer | Sport", "title": "In Passing: Why an illustration may have boosted Blissett\u2019s aerial belief", "title_full": "In Passing: Why an illustration may have boosted Blissett\u2019s aerial belief", "published": "2017-12-07T08:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/7149690/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ab992a9d7b705e2bab12143f3fea4f1d9e1629c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg81IbguFbrLh1xku1.m.y9RImpYs3Oto_ba4kpCpl4JgwvOKHp_7KIe7G4XsdeQxsE9jFvLFt9yDMzyLCKeM36_eR0UgE07qlR_4efLPmtTxFOL.SqdiRwIIDthf5Co9kbY6oEoJWw42640QGNPr1M3sY0sZZOrT_U-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T08:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "In Passing: Why an illustration may have boosted Blissett\u2019s aerial belief", "text": "9 comments \nI was reminded about that key element in all footballers and teams: confidence. In chatting behind the stage during the recent launch of the book Rocket Men, that quality was mentioned frequently and my mind went back to Ian Bolton\u2019s interview, which I subsequently turned into one of the four sections in the book. \nBolts had commented on Luther Blissett \u2019s initial ability in the air and how Luther\u2019s head was akin to a rugby ball. You had to hit it at exactly the right spot, otherwise the ball would go all over the place. \nLuther himself, when emerging from the Old Trafford dressing-room after heading two goals in the League Cup against Manchester United, confirmed that. \nUp until then Luther had been the darling of the reserve-team faithful who delighted in his raw, random, rangy game and cheered with delight when one evening he headed home an angled attempt at the Vicarage Road end. \nI can remember that header as if it were yesterday, yet it was perhaps 42 years ago. \nThe reason was the roar of delight emanating from the sparse numbers at the ground for the Mid-Week League fixture. \nIt was clear he was something of a favourite for they loved his haphazard relationship with the ball, his speed, his style, his bull-at-a-gate approach and his enthusiasm. \nI remember our first conversation, held in a buffet car on the way back from a first-team away game. \nDennis Bond, perhaps Pat Morrissey, certainly Laurie Craker and the usual suspects were necking the beers and I turned and noted Luther was standing alone behind us. I thought the 18-year-old looked as much of an outsider as I was (because he was young and not a boozer), so I stepped back and we had a little chat. \nRacism was general and implicit in those days. I remember one Watford player telling me that Luther favoured the opponent when Muhammad Ali was attempting to regain his heavyweight title. \u201cI said to Luther, you can\u2019t like that black b d. Then I realised what I had said.\u201d \nRacism was rife, a part of everyday life back then and people trotted out the old prejudices and jokes without ever stopping to think. That players such as Luther should have bananas thrown at them during games is as mind-boggling now as it was par for an unpleasant course back then. Luther treated it outwardly as a joke, picking up the odd banana and taking a bite and giving the thumbs up. That it should ever have come to that. \nSoon it became a question of whether you should describe Luther as coloured or black. \u201cI\u2019m black: that television is coloured,\u201d he said succinctly. \nHe occasionally made the first-team squad in those days but manager Mike Keen was generally dismissive claiming: \u201cLuther prefers to play with the sun on his back.\u201d The manager believed Luther was not keen on cold days or nights home or away and that limited his potential. \nI had not heard such an observation before on other players but then we had not deployed many black players in the previous Watford squads. \nBack in the 1970s, black players were still an unknown quantity and I remember at Swindon one evening, a Fleet Street reporter opined that black players don\u2019t want to know when the hard tackles come in because they have \u201ca yellow streak\u201d. \nMy cartoonist friend, Terry Challis, nodded his head sagely and agreed: \u201cYes it was well known that Joe Louis, Cassius Clay and company didn\u2019t like it when it became rough.\u201d \nIt took a minute for the sarcasm to sink in. The Fleet Street reporter probably sussed it when he heard the giggles among the colleagues in the pressbox. \nLuther and company had to battle through that unfounded stigma and a whole load of others en route to their position in the football firmament. In the process, he probably did more for race relations in Watford than a platoon of the well-intentioned. \nYet it must have been an additional load with which to deal as he attempted to make progress in his chosen career and years later he was to suggest that the colour of his skin prevented clubs from selecting him as their next coach or manager. \nBut in the early days, that heading and indifferent ball control also clouded his horizons as he tried to break through. \nLater, Graham Taylor would argue that Luther\u2019s less-than-perfect ball control was in fact an asset. \n\u201cThe defender behind a striker, knows he is going to control the ball and prepares himself for the next move,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Luther does not always control it perfectly and the ball shoots off. It is a surprise to the defender and Luther but Luther reacts so much quicker and with pace. He is off and running with the wrong-footed defender in his wake.\u201d \nHe certainly had a point but it was Tom Walley, in 1977, who had advised Graham not to allow Luther to leave on a free transfer as Mike Keen had intended. Later, Graham loved to watch Luther run and loved the name. He repeated it several times, when they first met, rolling his tongue round the words Luther Blissett and said it would look good in lights. \n\u201cI have seen it all before,\u201d said Graham after Luther came on in 1978 and, along with Keith Cassells, helped Watford knock Newcastle United out of the League Cup. \nTaylor was looking for consistency but some of the old reserve team followers thought the manager was out of order. Their adopted son had done well and should be praised, they reasoned. \nWhich brings us back to Old Trafford and those two headed goals to send United out of the League Cup. Luther acknowledged it was quite bizarre. After coming out of the dressing room following the game, he said: \u201cYou know me Oli. Two headed goals. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d \nIndeed it was but a week later in the Sunday People, the illustrator and artist Trevallion, showed why Luther was so lethal in the air in a series of depictions.

The Proof of Concept will run for a six-week period with a focus on learning and understanding what Police need from a notes application. The findings will inform future decisions for a digital notebook capability in an operational environment. \n\"In an increasingly digital environment, Police mobility services are critical to the efficient and effective delivery of Police operational activities. The ability to capture and share notes digitally will extend the current functionality, as it will facilitate an electronic and centralized database of notebook entries to continue to support staff being \u2018more street than station',\" says Superintendent Cochrane. \nSceneDoc's mission is to redefine the role of mobile technology in public safety. \n\"We are thrilled to be working with NZ Police on this initiative. NZ Police is regarded as one of the earliest adopters of mobile devices at enterprise scale, integrating mobile hardware and software as part of core police operations. It's a real honour to have the opportunity to collaborate with such pioneers,\" says company CEO, Alex Kottoor . \nSceneDoc was recently awarded the coveted \"Motorola Solutions Award for Public Safety Technology,\" named as a leading innovator of public safety solutions that helps build safer cities and thriving communities. \nAbout SceneDoc \nSceneDoc is public safety's trusted data collection platform. By modernizing with the SceneDoc Platform, agencies operate with higher levels of clarity and control, with fewer moving parts, capturing data and reporting at the point of need. SceneDoc Collect , the platform's flagship product provides public safety professionals with a 'mobile first' solution for field-based reporting saving every officer an hour per shift. The platform's newest product delivers a 'mobile first' solution for eCitations , saving agencies 50% of administrative work, resulting in more time in the community so officers can do what they do best. Agencies can share information and collaborate in near real-time, from any internet-connected device, making potentially lifesaving intelligence only a tap away.

While some had completely defaulted, others are owing sizeable balance of the money.\n\nThe investigation further revealed that 32,305 houses were captured by the Committee on the Sale of Government Properties while 24,345 were eventually sold to beneficiaries.\n\nHowever, civil servants in some government agencies notably OHSCF and the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) have allegedly turned the policy into a shoddy business with the aim of defrauding the federal government.\n\nICPC also found out that some public servants and government agencies were concealing government properties and collecting rent on same without the consent of the federal government, which allegedly flouts the intent of the policy that primarily focuses on divesting government\u2019s interest from providing housing for its employees.\n\nFurther discovery by ICPC has shown that staff in OHSCF allocated some of the houses to undeserving beneficiaries who were not public servants at the time of the exercise and some of the properties are yet to be allocated.\n\nThe investigation has so far yielded fruitful result with the recovery of N18, 031,000 from some civil servants and a host of companies including Montgomery & Campbell Ltd and SICCONS, which has been paid into the coffers of the government.

Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio, left, and Keith Gregg, the county's Chief Information Technology Officer, right, speak at a press conference Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, at the Government Center about t... \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

Prosecutors say he accepted a $2 million bribe from Rosneft's influential CEO, Igor Sechin, for giving the company the green light for privatizing another oil firm.\nThe circumstances of the case have ignited speculation that Ulyukayev was caught in a Kremlin power play against Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin.\nIn his final argument on Thursday, Ulyukayev pleaded not guilty and accused Sechin of setting him up.\n\"A horrific and cruel provocation has been perpetrated against me,\" he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies.\nFormer Russian Economic Development Minister Alexei Ulyukayev waits for a hearing at a court in Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017.

(AP Photo/Ivan Sekretarev) Sechin, whose testimony was the cornerstone of the case against the former minister, was summoned to testify in court four times but he did not show up, citing urgent matters of business.\nReferring to a common perception of Sechin as a dark force in Russian politics, Ulyakayev said in court on Thursday that the key witness \"disappeared \u2014 what was left was a whiff of sulfur in the air.\"\nUlyukaev went to Sechin's office in November last year to discuss Rosneft's affairs, and was arrested as he was leaving the building with a bag full of cash that Sechin had given him. Ulyukayev told the court that he thought the bag contained a bottle of wine and a basket filled with sausages.\nIn wire tapes played out to the court earlier in the trial, Sechin was heard telling Ulyukayev to take the bag with the sausage. Russian media has reported that Sechin has a tradition of gifting people baskets of sausages from his own butcher's shop.\nFormer Russian Economic Development Minister Alexei Ulyukayev waits for a hearing at a court in Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017.

I was a hypocrite. I love taking gifts and giving gifts. When you're doing all right, you shamelessly turn your back on other people's misfortunes.\"\nUlyukayev asked for \"people's\" forgiveness and pledged to devote rest of his life to \"defending

Shortly after arriving the man became violent and started lashing out. \nAs well spitting blood, he punched Mr Ormerod in the face smashing his glasses and leaving him with spinal injuries. \nAn off-duty police officer stopped to help and enabled Mr Ormerod to use his radio to alert colleagues who informed the police. \nAn ambulance arrived minutes later and while trying to diffuse the situation a second paramedic, John Liddle, was also attacked and left with a fractured hand. \nPolice arrested the man and despite his behaviour the ambulance crew continued to treat his hand injuries. \nOfficers are now investigating the incident. \nCommunity leaders said the incident was 'concerning' especially in the run up to Christmas when demand on the ambulance service increases. \nMr Ormerod, 42, of Brockhall Village, Langho, described the experience as 'extremely traumatic, shocking and unacceptable'. \nHe said: \"I was working a 12-hour shift and was called out to a category one emergency which is determined as an immediate threat to life. \n\"The nature of the job came through as a young man lying in the road who was full of blood and not responding. \n\"So as you can imagine, this man could have been been hit by a car, or become unresponsive with a head injury, or been subject to an assault. \n\"But as I got to the scene I saw that this man was staggering around in the road. \n\"I went to make an approach to the patient and got him to sit on a wall at the side of the road, then crouched down and introduced myself. \n\"I said my name and managed to get his first name but then his body language started to change, so I decided to stand back. \n\"As I backed off from him, he then jumped up and started to attack me. He was punching and spitting at me. \n\"He then grabbed hold of me and I continued to be subjected to an assault in the road. \n\"As we were rolling around in front of the rapid response car, it was very fortunate for me that an off-duty police officer from Greater Manchester came to assist me. \n\"I managed to press the panic button on my radio. \n\"My colleague John hastily made his approach to the scene, and as he was trying to assist me and the police officer to get the man on the stretcher, he ended up with a broken hand. \n\"We didn't realise we'd been injured until after the attack.\" \nFollowing the incident the pair drove to hospital and sought treatment. \nMr Ormerod suffered spinal injuries and numbness in his forearm, while Mr Liddle sustained a fractured hand. \nMiraculously, Mr Ormerod has been able to return to work, but Mr Liddle is expected to be off for at least six to eight weeks. \nThe pair are now calling for their attacker to be prosecuted, with Mr Ormerod concerned there has been a rise in assaults on paramedics in recent years. \nHe fears that things could get worse with Christmas just round the corner. In the last 12 months alone, there have been 68 reported assaults on ambulance staff in Lancashire. \nHe said: \"I've been able to return to work but in the control centre, as currently I'm unable to drive the rapid response vehicles due to my injuries. \n\"There has been a rise in attacks on ambulance staff although it\u2019s hard to say what the reason is for this. \n\"December and the festive period is always a busy month where paramedics can be more prone to assault. \n\"I'd like to see the man behind this attack prosecuted, as what has happened is wholly unacceptable and shocking. \n\"We work on the frontline to help others and should not have to be subjected to such assaults.\" \nIan Walmsley, sector manager at North West Ambulance Service (NWAS), said: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely abhorrent that our staff have been subject to such vile and disgusting behaviour by a member of the public after arriving to help. \n\"We fully support the staff members involved and will push for prosecution. \n\"This treatment will not be tolerated.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ian walmsley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew ormerod", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ormerod", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bacup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burnley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:28.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "df127948cd88449c61b0f217c9660fa5f7781979", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvcIM99duwIPlFbCRbswfuJaddLNHX3AJvy2rIZr.gQtuPhTtONVK1IBpNepj5mqiomGJrca2eO5yYSLmNugPywojh_CFjMhptcyRI.kYO10IXmB690pdW6bPAR4Hk1RD_h52bFzDQa6uRfmNK9VkFwYSq7e3i5oc-", "site_full": "www.benzinga.com", "site": "benzinga.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.benzinga.com/benzinga/press-releases", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Press Releases", "title": "Cell Medica Announces Appointment of Industry Leader Dr Annalisa Jenkins as Chair", "title_full": "Cell Medica Announces Appointment of Industry Leader Dr Annalisa Jenkins as Chair", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23263, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "df127948cd88449c61b0f217c9660fa5f7781979", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvcIM99duwIPlFbCRbswfuJaddLNHX3AJvy2rIZr.gQtuPhTtONVK1IBpNepj5mqiomGJrca2eO5yYSLmNugPywojh_CFjMhptcyRI.kYO10IXmB690pdW6bPAR4Hk1RD_h52bFzDQa6uRfmNK9VkFwYSq7e3i5oc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Business Wire", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Cell Medica Announces Appointment of Industry Leader Dr Annalisa Jenkins as Chair", "text": "December 07, 2017 4:00am Comments Share: Cell Medica (or \u2018the Company'), a leader in next generation cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, today announced the appointment of Annalisa Jenkins, MBBS, FRCP, as Chair of the Board of Directors.

People on Medicaid are prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But a new survey says that\u2019... \nBy RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVARAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - People on Medicaid are more prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But that's not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge. \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" \nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n- Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n- Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n- Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C. \nFor the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point. For Medicaid recipients, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points.

Capital flight had been seen as a major risk for China at the start of the year, but a combination of tighter capital controls and a faltering dollar helped the yuan stage a strong turnaround, bolstering confidence in the economy. Reserves rose $10 billion in November to $3.119 trillion, compared with an increase of $700 million in October, central bank data showed on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had expected reserves to rise by $11 billion to $3.120 trillion. It was the first time that China's reserves have climbed for 10 months in a row since June 2014, and brought its stockpile -- the world's largest -- to the highest since October last year. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange said the appreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies and changes in asset prices were the main reasons behind the rise in forex reserves. The yuan has gained about 5 percent against the dollar this year, following a drop of 6.5 percent in 2016, its biggest annual drop since 1994. China's foreign exchange reserves dropped by nearly $1 trillion from a peak of $3.99 trillion in June 2014 to $2.998 trillion in January this year as it sought to shore up the yuan and reduce capital outflows. But reserves have since climbed by $121 billion. A Reuters poll found that long positions on the yuan held by investors in Asia by end-November rose to the highest since September, as the dollar continues to falter in global markets. . Some analysts believe more stability in the yuan and less pressure on outflows could prompt authorities to lighten their hand on regulations. \"It therefore seems like an opportune time for (China's central bank) to take further baby steps toward the long-held goal of exchange rate liberalisation, most likely starting with a widening of the renminbi trading band,\" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China Economist at Capital Economics. The slide in the yuan and foreign exchange reserves last year prompted China to restrict capital outflows, including a clampdown on \"irrational\" outbound investments in property, hotels, entertainment, sports clubs and film industries. On Monday, Chinese financial news outlet Yicai quoted Pan Gongsheng, head of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, as saying that China has \"basically exited\" from curbs on firms' irrational outbound investment deals. Valuation effects due to the dollar's drop against major currencies such as the euro and yen are also behind the rebound in China's reserves. The dollar tumbled 1.6 percent against major trading currencies in November. The yuan's surge this year has helped increase foreign purchases of Chinese bonds and stocks but authorities might have got a bit queasy as Beijing has long stated that it seeks two-way fluctuation in the Chinese currency. Net foreign exchange buying by both China's central bank and commercial banks rose to multi-year highs in October, marking a policy victory for the authorities after a long battle to stabilise the yuan, although analysts say capital flows are likely to remain volatile as the economy slows. The value of gold reserves rose to $75.833 billion at the end of November, from $75.238 billion at the end of October, data on the PBOC website also showed.

These reasons lie in both admiration for the recent campaign and a sincere feeling that Paisley so richly deserves the renewal that could result from being chosen.\nThe campaign was so high-energy and positive, with huge community involvement at the grassroots, that it was inspiring even to non-Buddies across the UK. Just as the UK City of Culture would confer benefits on Paisley, Paisley\u2019s campaign has exemplified all that is good about the concept of having a UK City of Culture. All five places shortlisted before today\u2019s decision have seen hard times and deserve support. Few will be unaware of how badly Paisley has suffered from unemployment and deprivation but the Buddies have shown a desire for change and a willingness to put the shoulder to the wheel.\nPaisley\u2019s great past is seen all around in its magnificent buildings. Its present sees an engaged grassroots and a thriving cultural community. Its future could be bright, and the boost from becoming UK City of Culture (an estimated \u00a3172 million in investment and nearly 5,000 jobs over 10 years) would do such a lot to take it forward.\nWe wish the other contenders well but we are backing Paisley.

According to the National Crime Records Bureau's (NCRB) latest report released on November 30, a total of 2,272 fake notes of Rs 2,000 denomination were seized in 2016. Since the Rs 2,000 note -- along with the new Rs 500 currency -- was introduced only after November 8, 2016, it means that those counterfeiting the notes got into the act very quickly. In just 53 days between November 8 and December 31 last year, police and other government agencies seized 2,272 fake Rs 2,000 notes -- at a time when people across the country were struggling to get hold of the new currency. The maximum number of these Rs 2,000 fake notes were seized in Gujarat (1,300), followed by Punjab (548), Karnataka (254), Telangana (114), Maharashtra (27), Madhya Pradesh (8), Rajasthan (6) and Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh and Haryana (3 each). Jammu and Kashmir and Kerala accounted for two fake notes each. One such note was seized in Manipur as well as in Odisha. The Rs 2,000 notes were part of the 281,839 fake notes of various denominations recovered from different locations across India. When Modi announced the note ban, he said it was being done to end black money, counter terror financing and do away with counterfeit currency. Among other fakes, 82,494 notes of Rs 1,000 and 132,227 of Rs 500 denomination were also seized last year along with 59,713 notes of Rs 100 and 2,137 notes of Rs 50, said the annual publication of NCRB released by Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh. In a number of raids across the country, police forces, the Income Tax department and other government agencies also recovered 184 fake notes of Rs 20, at least 615 notes and coins of Rs 10 and 2,001 notes of Rs 5. Also seized were 196 fake coins of Rupee 1 denomination -- between January to December 31 last year. According to the data, the face value of the total fake notes found in 2016 is Rs 101,222,821. In terms of value of maximum fake notes, Delhi (Rs 56,521,460) topped the list. The national capital was followed by Gujarat (Rs 23,724,050), West Bengal (Rs 23,295,800), Andhra Pradesh (Rs 9,280,000), Karnataka (Rs 8,009,136), Telangana (Rs 7,600,905), Uttar Pradesh (Rs 5,013,700), Maharashtra (Rs 4,799,700), Punjab (Rs 4,239,750), Bihar (Rs 3,736,800), Tamil Nadu (Rs 3,342,540), Kerala (Rs 2,057,200), Madhya Pradesh (Rs 1,626,890), Chandigarh (Rs 1,499,000), Rajasthan (1,035,100), Assam (Rs 800,050), Jharkhand (Rs 706,000) and Uttarakhand (Rs 666,400). At 114,751, Delhi also topped the chart in terms of maximum seizure of fake notes, followed by Gujarat (39,725), West Bengal (32,869), Andhra Pradesh (14,541), Karnataka (14,228) and Telangana (12,667). Among all the states and union territories, Goa accounted for just 21 fake notes having a face value of Rs 17,000.

Lykos is a rescue from Cyprus who is now in a foster home in Hastings whilst he looks for his forever family. Here is a little about him. Lykos is a very loving, gently, friendly boy who loves people of all ages. He also adores a cuddle and being entertained by or playing with children. Of course we would always recommend that young children are not left unsupervised with dogs. \nLykos is also great with other dogs. He loves to play with them and would not mind sharing his home with another dog. However Lykos would not like to share his home with a cat as he likes to chase them. This is all part of the high prey drive associated with Huskies. \nLykos enjoys trips in the car especially if it leads to an exciting walk! Lykos is also highly trainable and loves to please. He would almost sell his soul for treats and does not have a bad bone in his body. He walks well on the lead and his recall is improving (although being a teenager in doggy years he can sometimes have selective hearing!). He loves his food and has excellent manners around food. At night he is very happy to sleep in his own bed which after the time he spent in the Cyprus dog pound on a concrete floor must seem like heaven to him! One of his photos shows him in the cage at the pound and the others are of him now happy in his foster home. \nLykos will make a fabulous family pet and will be incredibly loyal to his forever family. He has been vaccinated, neutered and microchipped. Minimum adoption donation \u00a3275.
