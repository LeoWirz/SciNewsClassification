The [ICT Procurement] Taskforce found there was no coordination in the way government procures ICT services. Agencies are there creating their own systems and duplicating processes unnecessarily.\u201d \n\u201cIf anyone feels like they\u2019re being too harsh about the way we do procurement, don\u2019t be. Because that report was written by government to government, and we were critical of ourselves,\u201d he said. \nSharing his first-hand experience, Wayne Gerard, the founder and chief executive of Redeye, said the Digital Marketplace may have had good intentions, but it\u2019s not tailored for startups. \n\u201cI signed up for it and I look at it all the time, but there has not been one opportunity that has been relevant for a startup to actually want to put a solution to a problem through that process,\u201c he said. \nIndustry department deputy secretary Elizabeth Kelly said that while there was no denying the Digital Marketplace had faults, it is a platform the department has used regularly to since it was launched just over a year ago. \n\u201cWe use the Digital Marketplace very frequently, and we found it opening up a different style of firms to us, with ease\u2026you have a broad range of small to medium enterprises out there, and so it\u2019s really a question of ambition from public servants to tap into that,\u201d she said. \nThe Digital Marketplace offers opportunities for government to proceed in the right direction in being a \u201cbetter buyer\u201d, especially when compared to traditional tender panels, such as Austender, she said. \n\u201cPanels are just too easy, and they will always be the first thing public servants go to because they manage the compliance issues,\u201d said Ms Kelly. \n\u201cBut from industry perspective, it\u2019s very clear that panels that are not refreshed regularly exclude new ideas that come from SMB sector. Reforming the role of panels is absolutely critical.\u201d \nGavan Mackenzie, partner at legal firm Maddocks, agreed saying \u201cthe marketplace isn\u2019t that bad\u201d, with belief as more small to medium enterprises (SMEs) compete to win government contracts, it will encourage \u201cmore dynamic innovation in the marketplace\u201d. \nMr Mackenzie also argued that by making lower value contracts no more than $150,000 available in the marketplace, it will open the door for SMEs to \u201cpunch above their weight and it also means the big boys won\u2019t go near it, because to them it\u2019s not even a crumb on the table.\u201d \nMr Alexander said the DTA envisages the Digital Marketplace will \u201cend up like a bazaar where you can go and there are providers in the marketplace, there\u2019s catalogues that will be available, you can select and compare particular products in the marketplace, prepare contracts with flexibility, engage and talk \u2026 all of these things are on our radar.\u201d \n\u201cWe need to make the platform better, and we are getting feedback and doing a lot of user research with SMEs to make the marketplace better,\u201d Mr Alexander said. \nThe government recently celebrated the Digital Marketplace awarding nearly $38 million of its total $50 million in technology contracts to SMEs or startups. \nInnovationAus.com hosted Open Opportunity Canberra 2017 at the National Press Club on Thursday November 30.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peter alexander", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maddocks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexander", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elizabeth kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wayne gerard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ms kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mackenzie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gavan mackenzie", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "innovationaus.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digital transformation agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ict", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national press club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ict procurement taskforce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digital marketplace", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:03.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5b3abf63d916e117f549d48d8bc57c4619067ba8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQBt.zJBM7pyqAnpFZ8mbo7DspoLXjBnUZi9_h6qWi5yNXM5vDCGkDoyQLLyyDA76uUrSZiaRPcfyC4mJVvU63JewAZL5KZZveW5iekQ48ifvt89.hmmeZL", "site_full": "forums.macrumors.com", "site": "macrumors.com", "site_section": "http://forums.macrumors.com/forums/-/index.rss", "site_categories": ["mac_support", "tech"], "section_title": "MacRumors Forums", "title": "2017 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar keyboard issue", "title_full": "2017 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar keyboard issue", "published": "2017-12-07T10:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forums.macrumors.com/styles/macrumors/xenforo/avatars/avatar_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1213, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5b3abf63d916e117f549d48d8bc57c4619067ba8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQBt.zJBM7pyqAnpFZ8mbo7DspoLXjBnUZi9_h6qWi5yNXM5vDCGkDoyQLLyyDA76uUrSZiaRPcfyC4mJVvU63JewAZL5KZZveW5iekQ48ifvt89.hmmeZL", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sultanoflondon (invalid@example.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "2017 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar keyboard issue", "text": "nobitasan17 said: \u2191 Well I have similar issue as well.

Is this a just a passing trend, though, or is it a shift in philosophy that's here to stay? To determine the answer, I believe we need to look at who makes up the bulk of the travel market, and why they travel. \nMillennials Making WavesStatistics from Mintel show 83% of millennials took a leisure trip during 2016 , compared with only 75% of all U.S. consumers[ 1 ]. They are also spending more on vacations than in previous years, with almost 25% expressing their interest in using \"economy\" services such as shared accommodations. This makes millennials a major target audience, who prefer to travel affordably without the extra cost of unnecessary frills. The primary factors driving this change in demand are: Highly educated and more experienced travelers, who avoid generic brand experiences and \"sameness.\" The proliferation of digital content, particularly social media, which promotes the value of unique experiences delivered by authentic, hyper-local and destination-specific travel. Price is a huge purchasing factor, which leads travelers to seek out cost efficiencies wherever possible. \nWith the disruption caused by the sharing economy (e.g. AirBnB) and the ongoing popularity of immersive experiences\u2014evident in the excitement surrounding virtual reality and 3D films\u2014hotel brands have no choice but to look for new ways to enthrall the traveler.A Shift in PhilosophyThe opportunity to have hyper-local experiences specific to a destination is a significant factor in the popularity of accommodation options. Guests want to interact with the local community and experience a sense of belonging. \nMany lifestyle hotel brands have realized this and incorporate it into their offerings, with restaurants, bars and even lobbies targeting local residents as much as travelers. In the world we live in, however, these attractions need tempering with assurances of relative personal safety. \nExperiences backed by the reputation of an established hotel brand therefore offer a higher level of confidence for travelers, which is one reason the rise of shared accommodations has not really affected the hotel industry.The New RealitySo, what will be next and what is the future for the lifestyle hotel concept? I believe it's a mix of personalization and simplicity, with a healthy dose of technology. \nTravelers no longer want the most popular option, they want the one that's right for them. Oftentimes, this means clearing out the clutter and giving guests a downsized experience that enables them to simply lie on a beach for 10 days. Too many entertainment options can make a trip \"touristy\" and impersonal, so scaling back on the commercial activities (and their costs) could be a winning formula. \nBuilding relationships with local (vetted) tour operators who are confidently recommended may be a better option than organized excursions or activities. The ability to browse or search for activities on a mobile device using an app over free WIFI is far more effective with this target market than brochures on the front desk.The Dawn of DataThe collection and mining of data, of course, is going to be the pivot on which the market turns. With most hotels now using electronic systems for almost everything, gathering information on consumer preferences has never been easier. The hotel industry has been slow to embrace big data, however, and that needs to change\u2014fast! Artificial intelligence will enable brands to personalize their offering more fully, often without the need for human intervention. Lifestyle's Long-Term ProspectsGeneral consensus in the travel industry tells us that whatever the new trend towards authentic experiences may end up being called, it is here to stay. Building connections with the community is as important as having an interactive, social lobby area. Hotels are no longer simply a gateway to a destination, or merely a place for travelers to lay their heads. \nNavigating between achieving simplicity and offering a personalized, immersive experience will be challenging for brands, but with lifestyle hotels already comfortable with \"being different\" from traditional brands, this segment is perfectly poised to become ground zero for future travel. \n[1] Source: Lightspeed GMI/Mintel Marketing to Millennials \u2013 U.S., May 2016", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "court williams", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "zac brown band", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "court williams   differentiating lifestyle hotel brands", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "moxy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mintel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hvs new york  comments", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marriott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lightspeed gmi/mintel marketing", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:04.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d635e8c8a86ab8d355e83046080b58ac4dd8c766", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLttQ.TkyOebktVp03GUsFpuarVbJLfXz5fN30t0_2WZ1dByeWf2qCpwt5fCoLesZRbxUdEFJonfxQa.TNiXL8v8o-", "site_full": "floridastate.forums.rivals.com", "site": "rivals.com", "site_section": "https://floridastate.forums.rivals.com/forums/tribal-council-club-level.34/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Tribal Council - Club Level | Warchant.com", "title": "Scribblings and Second thoughts", "title_full": "Scribblings and Second thoughts | Warchant.com", "published": "2017-12-04T18:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 39, "participants_count": 22, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.113, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3057, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4fc1ed901c3ecafe3f47bcf290c4c02034b1b688", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLttQ.TkyOebktVp03GUsFpuarVbJLfXz5fN30t0_2WZ1dByeWf2qCpwt5fCoLesZRbxUdEFJonfxQ3c_.BDh.SGQrWYtg.p19dA--", "ord_in_thread": 25, "author": "JohnnieHolmesNole", "published": "2017-12-05T14:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:04.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "14eafae3902a449f79601164c4d6d44d72f336f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gT.AZYqr_NjcG7hR90hCOdM-", "site_full": "us.battle.net", "site": "battle.net", "site_section": "https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/1011638/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Story Forum - World of Warcraft Forums", "title": "Elunarian Life- Implications?", "title_full": "Elunarian Life- Implications? - World of Warcraft Forums", "published": "2017-12-01T14:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "/forums/static/images/social-thumbs/wow.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 462, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f2428b63980f9034687c988b3f257201b11ec7ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gT.AZYqr_NjcUOAg.Xg84PSsRtqQXtQGng--", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "Reignac", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "12/06/2017 06:43 PM Posted by Caelus It could be Ysera.

Written by Jaideep Ghosh Read Time: 2 - min Indian and Pakistani players share a laugh after the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 final. \u00a9 Twitter \nMatches between India and Pakistan in almost any sport spur massive upheavals of emotions on both sides and cricket is paramount on this front. Every match between the two arch-rivals sees the fans on either side engaged in trolling battles on social media and the result of the match adds even more spice to the exchanges, with the winners having a field day as the losing side faces the music. However, some moments have made these exchanges immortal as rivals as star players like Team India captain Virat Kohli has made overtures towards some Pakistan players which have become extremely popular on both sides of the border. \nThe International Cricket Council has chosen one such event as the one of the best moments of the 2017 in its 'Spirit of Cricket' campaign. It is a video, on ICC's official Twitter handle, shows Indian and Pakistani players sharing a laugh after the ICC Champions Trophy final in England on June 18, 2017. \nThe much-hyped final was one of the biggest moments in the international cricket calendar of 2017. India had won the league match and were strong favourites to win the final as well. \nHowever, Pakistan had the last laugh as they beat India by 180 runs to lift the trophy. \nBut as the video shows, Kohli and Yuvraj Singh are seen having a laugh with Pakistani veteran Shoaib Malik and bowling coach Azhar Mahmood among others, showing that there is no ill-feeling among the cricketers. \nKohli had also made waves by acknowledging Pakistan fast bowler Mohammed Amir as one of the best in the business. \nAmir had reciprocated by saying that he had become a better bowler by bowing to batsmen like Kohli. \nKohli had praised Amir earlier too and had last year gifted the 25-year-old pacer a bat before the India-Pakistan contest in the World T20 in 2016.

In 2015, the Henn-na Hotel in Japan was the first and only hotel that is almost entirely operated by robots. In March 2017, the Henn-na Hotel celebrated opening of its second location in Tokyo and plans to expand domestically as well as internationally within the next five years by addition of 100 more properties. In June 2015, the Ghent Marriott Hotel in Belgium introduced its new concierge staff member \"Mario\", a humanoid robot. \"Mario\" can speak 19 languages, answers guest's questions, and entertains with dance moves. Marriott International has also incorporated room service delivery robots in multiple locations of its other brands. Hilton McLean Hotel in Virginia adopted \"Connie\" powered by IBM's human mimicking Watson computer (Hilton and IBM Pilot). Implementation of robots takes away so much from the guest's \"experience\" due to the lack of human interaction and the robot's inability to understand emotions. \nSome hotels believe robots would enhance efficiency, security, and performance; however, implementation of robots would be the most unwise decision a hotel can make as it would kill what hospitality is about, decrease efficiency, and security. Robotic Technology Disadvantages Robots Kill What Hospitality Is About: \nWords hospitality and service are used interchangeably and thought of as complimentary or interlinked by mistake (Golubovskaya et al.). There is a fine line between hospitality and service. Hospitality is about looking out and making an effort to understand others rather than looking in. The ability to make people feel welcomed, valued, expected, and included is hospitality. Service is what you do for someone such as serving a meal; however, hospitality is how your behavior makes the guest feel after you served the meal. In order for hotel staff to be considered hospitable they need to demonstrate caring for the guest's happiness and quality of experience (Golubovskaya et al.). A combination of hospitality and service impacts the guest's experience; however, a great service is never recognizable without the hospitality aspect as that is what brings emotional connection, valued by humans, to the experience. A facial expression as simple as a smile can make a difference in the guest's experience and satisfaction level (Otterbring, 284). Robots can efficiently perform the service portion by checking guest in/out, answering questions, and delivering room service but they can never interact hospitably with the guests due to their lack of emotion. \nA welcoming mindset is essential and demonstrative of what is expected of a hospitable behavior. The welcoming mindset elements are openness (willingness to deal with challenges and come up with an efficient alternative in a limited time), curiosity (interaction with the guest to build a relationship and make relative recommendations), being non-judgmental, humility (demonstrate the extent a guest is being valued), respect, presence, and dialogue (developing a conversation to understand the guest's needs and emotions). In hospitality, everything evolves around how well emotions are interpreted and responded to. Robots fall short on demonstrating the welcoming mindset, as they are only highly sophisticated computer programs yet unable to make emotional connections on human level. \nImplementation of robots at hotels would not only kill what hospitality is about but also diminish service efficiency and security. This is an undesired outcome for both the guests and hotels that decide to implement robots in their operations. Robots Decrease Service Efficiency and Security: \nHow do you feel when the hotel's ATM machine does not work and you are late to your tour bus? \nWe have all experienced malfunctions with electronic devices, ATMs, vending machines and etc. Usually, the issue gets resolved by asking a specialist for assistance. In fully robotic operated hotels, guests do not have access to any staff member. A malfunction in any of the robots will turn into a frustration and hassle for guests that ultimately affect their \"experience\". The inconvenience guests have to experience due to robots malfunction as well as the unavailability of staff for assistance would negatively affect service efficiency. \nGuests should be able to order room service based on their preferences, however, cannot make special orders with robots due to lack of comprehension. No matter how high-tech a robot is, its intelligence is still bounded with limited programming; however, humans are capable to intelligently understand one another requests and respond accordingly. Limitations in programming describes the fact that robots operate based on what they are programmed and nothing more; that exhibits why robots fall short in service efficiency. \nReiterating on the fact that hospitality is the ability to understand other's emotions and respond accordingly; hotel staff are responsible to constantly monitor guest's emotions, body language, and behaviors. The hotel staff report suspicious behaviors and activities to prevent violence, crimes, and terrorist attacks. During emergencies, the hotel staff are the initial point of contact for the guests. Also, when emergencies arise, since hotel staff are trained they will direct people to safety and seek medical attention if necessary. Robots do not have the ability to comprehend suspicious activities and cannot be a source of help to provide direction during emergencies. For example, when an emergency occurs a hotel staff calls 911 to report and meanwhile assists to make the guests calm; however, in a fully robotic operated hotel there is no staff to report emergencies that leaves guests responsible for their own safety. Considering the horrifying Las Vegas attack, the guests inside the Mandalay Bay were directed with safety procedures by the hotel staffs and the police. At times of emergencies people need to be able to communicate with a human to find out about the situation and get emotional support. A robot cannot satisfy that need because it does not have the human-level comprehension. A fully robotic operated hotel decreases security and allows more room for violence, crime, and terrorist attacks. Robotic Technology Advantages Robots Enhance Efficiency and Security: \nHenn-na Hotel has implemented robots in ways that increase efficiency and security. Replacement of staff with robots has cut costs by \u00be and cost efficiency has enhanced as a result. Instead of a bellhop an electric porter will carry luggage and leads the way to the guest's room while showing a movie on its screen that entertains the guest. Robots deliver room service and give a call once they are at the door that increases time efficiency. Self check-in kiosks are equipped with facial authentication enabling keyless entry that increases security. Henn-na hotel has also implemented a high tech system that would monitor how hot or cold the guest is to change the room temperature accordingly. Working at a hotel, I have encountered times when the bellman is not available and the guest is left to carry his/her own luggage to the room. The electrical porter leads the way to the guest's room that resolves the issue of confusion and makes the service smoother. Guest's are not always willing to talk to room service to place an order due to language barriers; so, the delivery robot enables them to order digitally and get a phone call when the order is at the door. The temperature monitor is also an excellent service that positively affects guest's experience. All of the features mentioned above in regards to what robots bring to hotels are evident of an increase in service efficiency. \nRoom security is enhanced since keycards are no longer in use the entrance to the guest's room will be impossible without the facial recognition. Working at a hotel, we are constantly monitoring our systems to correctly input the check-in/check-out dates into the keycards to prevent unauthorized entry to any of the rooms. The facial recognition makes room entry personalized and secured. With the face recognition feature, intruders would no longer have a chance to enter a room with stolen keycards. The increased security provides guests with the peace of mind to leave behind their valuable items at the hotel rooms. Robots Enhance Performance: \nRobots enhance hotel's performance by reducing the long wait time in lines, collection of interesting customer behavioral patterns, less likelihood of making errors, and AI improvement opportunities that are on the rise. Faster operation by robots compared to humans will reduce the wait time in lines for check-in/check-out. Robots can collect data about the customer's behavioral patterns. Hotels can benefit hugely by making alterations to the operations to match their customer's behavioral patterns. Robots are less prone to errors than humans. The AI improvements enable hotels to honor preference-based requests of repeat guests such as rooms with specific views, extra towels, and etc. The recognition of special requests is an example of great service. \nThe enhanced performance by implementation of robots translates to great service that is a contributing factor to the guest's experience. Refute \nThe opposing views claim that implementation of robots enhances efficiency, security, and performance. One cannot deny that implementation of robots enhances cost efficiency by cutting on labor costs. Even though it seems like hotels save money by replacing staff with robots it raises two implications. The money saved on labor will negatively affect the guest's experience because robots do not have emotions to demonstrate hospitable behavior. Ultimately, the dissatisfaction turns into lower revenues in the long run as guests would not come back. Implementation of robots comes with high initial purchasing costs, high maintenance costs, and short life span. The costs hotels are saving on labor are reinvested in robots and at times they have to spend more than what they are saving. For example, the room service delivery robot costs about $73,088 and has a life span of 8 years. \nAt the same time, service efficiency is increased by addition of great features such as electric porter, robot room service delivery, and the high-tech air conditioning. On one hand, security is improved through implementation of face recognition instead of keycards that prevents unauthorized entries with stolen keycards. On the other hand, implementation of robots severely impacts security, as robots cannot comprehend emotions, body language, and are not capable to detect suspicious behaviors to report to 911. There are many tradeoffs to be considered before deciding to implement or not implement robots in the hotel industry. \nNevertheless, all the advantages that robots can bring to the hospitality industry are outweighed by the lack of human interaction that negatively affects guest's \"experience\", overall satisfaction, and likelihood of returning. Performing check-in/checkout, robotic room service delivery, and electric porter features are all undervalued and merely considered as service components due to robots inability to demonstrate the expected hospitable behavior. Hospitality and service go hand in hand and absent of one would ruin the guest's hospitality experience. As a result, it comes down to the true meaning of hospitality that can only be demonstrated through human interaction in which emotions exist. Robots do not have emotions, cannot comprehend human interactions, and their performance is limited to what they are programmed. Replacement of robots with staff would cause feeling of loneliness due to the lack of human-interaction. Therefore, replacement of robots with staff is the poorest decision a hotel can make as it ruins the guest \"experience\" and overall satisfaction of the stay. Conclusion \nUse of robots is the worst decision a hotel can make as it takes away emotion and human interaction both of which are essential to creation of a memorable hospitality experience. What brings guests back to a hotel is not the solely the service but rather the \"experience\" they had at a hotel. The \"experience\" is how the guest felt during their stay based on the behavior he/she encountered of the staff. Implementation of robots simply cannot create that \"experience\" for the guests as they lack emotions and are unable to interact on a human-level. Robots can be interesting for guests the first time; but as guests try to interact with the robot and face the lack of comprehension it changes people's perception of robots. \nContact",

That being said, are all these internships worth their salt? \nWe\u2019ve all seen the internship and graduate job descriptions brandished under the alluring title \u2018opportunity\u2019 that incorporate the key phrases \u201centry level\u201d, \u201cmust have X number of years experience\u201d and \u201cunpaid\u201d. It would seem the reward is heavily disproportionate to the skills the intern would be providing the company. It\u2019s a Catch 22 scenario \u2014 you\u2019re applying for something to give you the experience, but are being denied the opportunity because of your lack of experience. \nNot only this, but The Sutton Trust reports that 31% of university graduates work as unpaid interns and a six month unpaid internship will cost a minimum of \u00a35,556, excluding travel costs for a single person living in London. As many of the most prestigious internships are in London, it simply is a case of having to give these jobs to those who can already afford to comfortably live. \nThe Sutton Trust reports that 31% of university graduates work as unpaid interns and a six month unpaid internship will cost a minimum of \u00a35,556, excluding travel costs for a single person living in London \nThese roles are almost integral to landing a great job in the future, but unpaid internships are an automatic deterrent for enthusiastic, driven students who simply cannot afford to not get paid for their work. It denies the student access to a greater career path, but also denies the employer a larger talent pool. Alan Milburn, Chair of the Social Mobility Commission said unpaid internships \u201chave become a route to a good professional job, but access to them tends to depend on who not what you know and young people from low income backgrounds are excluded because they are unpaid.\u201d \nThe most notorious culprits of the unpaid internships lie within media, marketing and performance arts, but ultimately with an influx of graduates, it\u2019s sure that even more industries may begin to use the exploitative strategy of the unpaid intern. \nOf course, a short-term work experience stint may be beneficial \u2014 it could gain you essential skills, perhaps place you in a professional working environment for the first time and help land you a job upon graduation\u2026 but anything too extensive is taking advantage of their intern. Is the company really valuing their employees if they\u2019re expecting them to work for free? \nPaid interns will ultimately get a greater experience \u2014 not only is it paid, but their employers will make sure they get their money\u2019s worth, resulting in more rewarding experience for the intern. \nAfter all, a great CV and and experience do not pay the bills.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rebecca owen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan milburn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sutton trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social mobility commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:05.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d39425718826b7435c7f870e64d4ea78837af0a8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_UVWikx0ufohLxnPA0h0KsjHz5.RfmTWVt7lB_L0ZxLrFlazhKkku.jAV.HGTqqZaQay0zFny9SKr6gUBGPuDeJ2yHfoYW0qJZBwIjtZYH1wbM6GE9n2dJ_dqEqBS1MLmYlKTd_opFI7Py.XgAjDKAyCT.FBh3_gS9r443BtpF6JLIZrpwWWARLMeXq1cFgcQ0UYB6YQdu.5b9aX6bKV5e3IS6NVqdqHj7NEGHgM8ANOOHH0EU1GNJ", "site_full": "www.ifa-asso.com", "site": "ifa-asso.com", "site_section": "http://www.ifa-asso.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["computer_networking", "tech"], "section_title": "IFA", "title": "Le FRC propose des amendements pour une nouveau code de gouvernance des entreprises Britannique", "title_full": "Le FRC propose des amendements pour une nouveau code de gouvernance des entreprises Britannique", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d39425718826b7435c7f870e64d4ea78837af0a8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_UVWikx0ufohLxnPA0h0KsjHz5.RfmTWVt7lB_L0ZxLrFlazhKkku.jAV.HGTqqZaQay0zFny9SKr6gUBGPuDeJ2yHfoYW0qJZBwIjtZYH1wbM6GE9n2dJ_dqEqBS1MLmYlKTd_opFI7Py.XgAjDKAyCT.FBh3_gS9r443BtpF6JLIZrpwWWARLMeXq1cFgcQ0UYB6YQdu.5b9aX6bKV5e3IS6NVqdqHj7NEGHgM8ANOOHH0EU1GNJ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Le FRC propose des amendements pour une nouveau code de gouvernance des entreprises Britannique", "text": "Le FRC propose des amendements pour une nouveau code de gouvernance des entreprises Britannique 07 d\u00e9c. 2017 Le FRC propose des amendements pour une nouveau code de gouvernance des entreprises Britannique   Administrateur   Entreprises innovantes, PME / ETI, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s cot\u00e9es Sujets : Codes, Parties prenantes Type d'actualit\u00e9 : Actualit\u00e9s r\u00e9glementaires The UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) has been in place since 1992. The Code has successfully helped to raise standards of governance in the UK, which has instilled confidence in our equity capital markets and underpinned domestic and overseas investment. The UK\u2019s approach has been copied and adapted by other major economies. Over the last few years, governance within the largest companies has been subject to heightened public scrutiny due to their impact on a wide range of stakeholders globally, nationally and locally. In some high-profile cases the quality of governance has been poor. Now is the right time to undertake a comprehensive review to ensure that the Code remains fit for purpose and continue to promote improvement in the quality of governance. We are not starting from scratch. We are retaining those elements of the current Code that are still relevant today, and adapting others to reflect the changing economic and social climate to ensure that UK-listed companies achieve the highest standards of governance. The revised Code complements legislation and underpins improvements in best practice. It retains the flexibility that allows a company\u2019s specific circumstances to be taken into account. The Principles set out high-level requirements. The more detailed Provisions are generally \u2018comply or explain\u2019. This consultation document and the Code emphasise that the Principles are to be applied in line with the Listing Rules requirements that companies report on them in a manner that shareholders can understand. The revised Code acknowledges that the activities of companies have a wide-ranging impact and it is important that boards consider the way their companies interact with the workforce, customers, suppliers and wider stakeholders. To achieve a wider stakeholder focus we have drawn on our Culture Report. The findings of this report demonstrated the importance of aligning company purpose, strategy and values in order to achieve long-term success. Successful companies should be open and accountable to their workforce. The revised Code is clear that two-way dialogue is necessary to achieve good governance, with companies putting in place practices and processes to achieve that. We have also taken account of the Hampton-Alexander Review and Parker Review reports on diversity to ensure that the Code challenges directors to consider the composition of not only the board, but also the management pipeline. Effective policies in this area will benefit companies and increase trust in management practices. We are also consulting on specific changes to the Code as requested by the Government\u2019s response to the Green Paper Consultation on Corporate Governance Reform. These are: for companies to have a method of consulting with their employees; extending recommended minimum vesting and post-vesting holding periods for executive share awards from three years to five years; that chairs of remuneration committees should have at least 12 months\u2019 previous experience; and specifying the steps companies should take when they encounter significant shareholder opposition to executive pay policies and awards. The relationship between the board and investors is also very important. The UK Stewardship Code sets a framework for responsible engaged investors to work alongside company executives to achieve the long-term success of companies.

As per its import general manifestation, the imports were made by the United States Army Corps of Engineers Services, the report said.\nThe imported material reportedly included a power generator of 22 megawatts, and a large quantity of cold- and hot-rolled steel sheets. Other equipment, such as plastic injection molding machines with standard accessories, also were supplied from different world ports.\nCamp is used for training\nBut U.S. Army Captain Tom Gresback, the public affairs director at NATO mission headquarters in Kabul said, Camp Shaheen is not a new camp, and it has been used as an ANDSF (Afghan National Defense Security Forces) training facility for many years.\nHe told VOA the United States routinely works alongside local and international contractors who support sustainment and construction projects throughout Afghanistan.\nIn the case of Camp Shaheen, there is an ongoing plan to save costs and reduce pollution by moving the base away from generated power to a grid power system, the spokesman explained. \nThe United States and allied forces mostly rely on ground and air lines of communications through Pakistan for transporting supplies to about 13,000 foreign soldiers in landlocked Afghanistan. The numbers are expected to increase to more than 16,000 in the wake of pledges to implement a U.S. and NATO troop surge following President Donald Trump's new Afghan strategy, which was announced in August.\nCamp Shaheen is located in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif and serves as the headquarters for the Afghan army's 209th Corps. In April, the facility was the scene of the deadliest attack the Taliban have conducted on an Afghan military base during the past 16 years.\nAttacks on Camp Shaheen\nAt least 10 heavily armed insurgents, wearing uniforms and driving military vehicles, stormed Camp Shaheen, killing about 150 soldiers,although local media put the death toll at more than 250. At least 160 other soldiers were injured.\nTwo months later in June, seven American soldiers were shot and wounded by an Afghan commando during a training session at the same base.\nOfficially referred to as insider or so-called green-on-blue attacks have posed serious problems for the NATO-led coalition that is made up mostly of U.S. soldiers. Taliban infiltrators or sympathizers have carried out such attacks that have claimed dozens of lives of American army officers.\n\nSource: Voice of America\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom gresback", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taliban", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "209th corps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "voa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states army corps of engineers services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "voice of america", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karachi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "camp shaheen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mazar-i-sharif", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kabul", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:06.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb94d0680bd9f452957a6bbc9ca590c43f0f1bd7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS9NacbLX6PSRDzJfDlgKRFY-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb94d0680bd9f452957a6bbc9ca590c43f0f1bd7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS9NacbLX6PSRDzJfDlgKRFY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "import random\n\nvalues = ['0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','10','11','12','13','14','15']\nvalue_dict = [['A','10'],['B','11'],['C','12'],['D','13'],['E','14'],['F','15']]\nstart = \"#\"\n\ndef contrastcolour(colour):\n    if colour[0] == '#':\n        colour = colour[1:]\n    rgb = (colour[0:2], colour[2:4], colour[4:6])\n    comp = ['%02X' % (255 - int(a, 16)) for a in rgb]\n    return ''.join(comp)\n\ndef startcolour():\n    colour = \"#\"\n    for i in range(6):\n        x = values[random.randint(0,len(values)-1)]\n\n        for thing in value_dict:\n            if x == thing[1]:\n                x = thing[0]\n        colour = colour + x\n    return colour\n\nbase = startcolour()\ncontrast = start + contrastcolour(base)\n\nprint(\"The colours: {0}\".format([base, contrast]))\r\n\t\r\nThe colours: ['#2EF7F3', '#D1080C']", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:06.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e3205bec01a54251a5b844c9399318f55d23789b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisaGDq2UlHqrZpCpXL61UWvvcjFgSjAr1C9Ej63zesXaF9VSiiH8_OVBirvfogRW7.w--", "site_full": "www.forexfactory.com", "site": "forexfactory.com", "site_section": "https://www.forexfactory.com/forumdisplay.php?f=11", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Trading Discussion @ Forex Factory", "title": "Auction Market Value Theory & Analytics - Page 64", "title_full": "Auction Market Value Theory & Analytics - Page 64 @ Forex Factory", "published": "2017-10-10T03:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn-assets.forexfactory.net/images/misc/ff_fb_logo.gif?v=0.1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2596, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "59fc6144d39f302ca83e0893c306650d7a135c20", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisaGDq2UlHqrZpCpXL61UWvvcjFgSjAr1C9Ej63zesXaF9VSiiH8_OVBoAoDSdDW0dQ0dKpZ5EdxiDv9dcxgo7X0-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "dljonesFan", "published": "2017-12-07T11:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hi is somebody able to program the net flow of all pairs with one click solution (from the extracted data)?

What a joyous time of year! \nAnd, then there is the holiday shopping experience \u2026 This is how I see it. I get in my car. About a mile from the mall I begin to experience heavier-than-usual traffic. Not just a little heavier, but sometimes it seems like worse than rush hour. Is there an accident? No, there's a traffic jam at the mall. Once I'm at the mall, I experience the search for the parking spot. Then there's the crowded stores, the lines to check out, and then the reverse commute to get home. How to Deliver Better Customer Service During the Busy Holiday Season | By Shep Hyken \nNow, I'm not a curmudgeon who throws out the words, \"Bah Humbug!\" around the holidays. I really do love the holidays ; I just don't like going to the mall during the holidays. Yes, Amazon and other online retailers are my salvation. \nAll of this is a set-up for the lesson. Stressful times for customers means stressful times for employees. They must be more empathetic and patient as the stress of the holiday shopping experience causes customers to behave in abnormally strange \u2013 often referred to as rude \u2013 ways. \nSo, what is an employee to do? How should they handle these customers? What's the secret to making it through the busy season with tact and diplomacy? In reality, it doesn't matter if it's the holiday season. It could be any busy overly busy time for your business. \nHere are four ways that companies and individuals can manage the busiest and most stressful times\u2026 Hire Right: As an employer, hire the right people , to begin with. If you are going to be hiring new people, realize there are people who love stressful customer situations. They thrive on it. They are resilient and love the drama. Yet they seem to be masters at \"calming the storm.\" If you plan to put people into positions of stress, be sure that you hire a personality that can deal with it. Staff to Meet the Demand: This is obvious. Staff properly. If you're a retailer, you know that holidays are busier than the rest of the year. So, plan for it. Same goes for any business that has predictably higher-than-usual volume than any other time of year. Don't Take It Personally: A customer who's experiencing stress, inside or outside of your business, may take it out on you (or one of your employees). Don't take it personally. If you are truly customer-focused and are doing everything right, then it's not your fault the customer is having a bad day. But, it's your opportunity to start to turn that bad day around. While you don't take it personally, you do own it and do your best to deliver an experience that is frictionless and stress-free. Let Good People Do the Job They Were Hired to Do: If you've hired good people, let them do their job. Don't make them go to a manager to get approval for things they know will get approved. This causes stress for everyone; the employee who is uncomfortable bothering the manager, the manager who is going to approve the request anyway, and the customer who is forced to wait. \nThe holidays are intended to be a joyous time of year, filled with spending time with friends and family. This can also be the season that causes the most stress. As a retailer of any kind, be aware of this and go above and beyond at this time of year to make things easier for the customer. If you can please a customer during the busy times, which is hard to do, it's likely that this same customer will be more likely to shop with you the rest of the year as well.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shep hyken", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "customer ser", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shep hyken  now", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "better customer service", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:06.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d635e8c8a86ab8d355e83046080b58ac4dd8c766", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLttQ.TkyOebktVp03GUsFpuarVbJLfXz5fN30t0_2WZ1dByeWf2qCpwt5fCoLesZRbxUdEFJonfxQa.TNiXL8v8o-", "site_full": "floridastate.forums.rivals.com", "site": "rivals.com", "site_section": "https://floridastate.forums.rivals.com/forums/tribal-council-club-level.34/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Tribal Council - Club Level | Warchant.com", "title": "Scribblings and Second thoughts", "title_full": "Scribblings and Second thoughts | Warchant.com", "published": "2017-12-04T18:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 39, "participants_count": 22, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.113, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3057, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb89490c7bc87fcb5e44a5674445e69622c2983f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLttQ.TkyOebktVp03GUsFpuarVbJLfXz5fN30t0_2WZ1dByeWf2qCpwt5fCoLesZRbxUdEFJonfxQ3c_.BDh.SGQ9u3gPzbEQsA--", "ord_in_thread": 39, "author": "seminole72", "published": "2017-12-05T16:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:06.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "92de3191568010952ac93379271138feab3d7e3f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR5mgGFUIPiBNlZvir7JVkh4GoQGN_s3IBy2CU0kw4HzmoDHP7ilkpzPdeXc5BKUw3VOqeN19PIgobjVqnw6XeNxuz14rv8a4Y-", "site_full": "www.browncafe.com", "site": "browncafe.com", "site_section": "https://www.browncafe.com/community/forums/ups-union-issues.39/", "site_categories": ["logistics", "business"], "section_title": "UPS Union Issues | BrownCafe - UPSers talking about UPS", "title": "supervisor harassment | Page 3 | BrownCafe - UPSers talking about UPS", "title_full": "supervisor harassment | Page 3 | BrownCafe - UPSers talking about UPS", "published": "2017-12-07T05:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.browncafe.com/community/data/avatars/m/67/67427.jpg?1507820212", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8cd2acbf781415b27d170a6ca160c6620cf41797", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR5mgGFUIPiBNlZvir7JVkh4GoQGN_s3IBy2CU0kw4HzmoDHP7ilkpzPdeXc5BKUw3VOqeN19PIgobjVqnw6XeNR1TnpLRDYsLq9AIxbc_ZX9.Qj6W81u5U", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "DRporch", "published": "2017-12-07T05:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Brownslave688 said: \u2191 Buddy of mine a few years back went out with 250+ stops in a p57.\nIt was 3 pm before he could open the bulkhead door.

It is important that your hotel website takes this into consideration and ensures it will be present and ready for the holiday rush. \nWhilst seasonal SEO is a highly debated topic, there is a lot of merit in making sure your site is optimized for the season. The season is fleeting, and it takes time for your optimization efforts to be noticed and taken into consideration, so why go through the trouble? \nTrue, proper SEO can be time-consuming and laborious, and your whole index and ranking won't change overnight thanks to a few mentions of Santa on your homepage. That said, there is a good chance that if you put the work in, you'll be able to give yourself the upper hand over competition and increase both your visibility and traffic this Christmas. Here is a checklist to get you ready for the holiday season: 1. Create Relevant Content \nCreating content surrounding the holidays and your hotel, will not only help give more information to guests about what you offer but also provide an outlet for keyword-rich pages. An increase on your site of these holiday-specific keywords will help you to bring in valuable and targeted traffic. Consider creating an entire subsection of your site or creating a microsite to cater to this specifically and increase your standing. 2. Clean Up Duplicate Or Outdated Content \nNothing kills SEO quicker than a high bounce rate. Cleaning up old and outdated content will decrease your chances of a high bounce rate and improve your user engagement. This is equally true for duplicate content which will also incur a damaging penalty. 3. Update Google My Business \nYour Google My Business listing is one of the first things a customer will see when they search for your property. Make sure this is up to date with hours (if you close over the holiday period or your restaurant hours change), and that amenities are catered to in the information section. Information that is clear and current will help improve both your bounce and click-through rates. 4. Plan Your Marketing Strategy Ahead Of Time \nHaving a clear idea of your marketing message, what platforms you will be present on and with what frequency will help you to maintain a concise and consistent message throughout the season. Avoid the last-minute scramble and start early. Again, it takes time for your efforts to take effect and pay off, so the earlier you start, the better. 5. Review and update Metadata \nWhilst this will not necessarily make or break your holiday SEO, it will play a role in the way search engines will judge your website and content. Your metadata during this time should reflect the content on the page in question and make good use of the keywords you've used within. Don't forget though, it's all about quality over quantity. Pick a few out that you want to focus on, rather than throwing them all in just once. 6. Build your links \nLinks are liquid gold in the SEO world, so ensuring your website has the right outbound and inbound links built will be a key player in your success or failure. Most important in the link world are inbound links. Your search engine results ranking will rely heavily on what links are pointing to you, so get in touch with important websites, databases, and platforms who can help you spread the word and link back to your content. \nWith all of these tips checked off, your SEO should see a cumulative boost this holiday season. We hope you profit from lots of bookings and a successful season! \nFor more of our expert's SEO hacks that should be used throughout the year, check out this blog .

The police are cooperating with us.\"\nDuring the Saturday discussion, Khan severely criticized the government for allowing thousands of hard-liners to gather, protest and shut down the capital for more than two weeks, according to local media reports.\nThe demonstrators, belonging to a radical religious group, demanded the resignation of Pakistan's law minister after accusing him of committing blasphemy over an omitted reference in a parliamentary bill to Islam's Prophet Muhammad.\nThe sit-in turned violent when security forces tried to disperse the protesters in Islamabad, which led to a series of demonstrations in other cities.\nEventually, the government surrendered to the religious group's demands after Pakistan's army helped the government and the protesters reach an agreement.\nDespite raising his voice against extremist ideologies, minority rights and blasphemy laws in Pakistan, Khan also was a proponent of friendship between Pakistan and India, and he was an active member of a group called Aghaz-e-Dosti (Beginning of Friendship), which seeks to promote peace between the archrivals.\nNearly 1,500 cases\nKhan's disappearance comes at a time when, according to statistics submitted recently by the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances to the Apex court, about 1,498 cases of enforced disappearances remain pending with the government.\nMehdi Hasan, a prominent human rights activist based in Lahore, condemned Khan's abduction, and said it was evident who was behind such heinous acts in a country like Pakistan.\n\"When you are a progressive activist, and criticize the military and the government, you have to pay a price.The basic violations of human rights are committed by the government's agencies in this country, who must have been behind Khan's abduction,\" Hasan told VOA.\n\"Until the courts charge somebody with harmful activities toward the state, how can you arrest or abduct someone like this?\" Hasan asked. Such forced disappearances, he said, demonstrate \"that there is no rule of law. I believe the mainstream political parties need to focus on the issue and come up with a solution.\"\nCivil rights activists in Pakistan fear Khan's abduction is another effort to silence the growing dissent in the country. They noted the mysterious disappearance and reappearance earlier this year of a number of liberal social media activists.\nThe activists were blogging about political awareness and raised their voices against human rights violations, religious intolerance and extremism in Pakistan. They were blamed for committing blasphemy during the time they went missing, and they had to take refuge in foreign countries after being set free.\nTwo bloggers, Aasim Saeed and Waqas Goraya, later blamed Pakistan's intelligence agency for their forced disappearance and interrogation.\nPakistan's armed forces have denied involvement in these disappearances. \n\nSource: Voice of America\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hamid nasir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hasan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raza khan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prophet muhammad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aasim saeed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waqas goraya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mehdi hasan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "islam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "voa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "voice of america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commission of inquiry on enforced disappearances", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lahore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "urdu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:07.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "978b3043ae03e1b23eca228d6fc82cfe3f6c910d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTZvBAVuY.YJNse_pILLG95RPvcoEr2MME5yXsrVXdIK92eyIabsQJKiVsPiGgaBzw5rtl1wmTDzMrS4WdxCA.h6A65BKzbw69meDAtEghorVpeM7_71OiI9VCnyKcyo4w-", "site_full": "asianetpakistan.com", "site": "asianetpakistan.com", "site_section": "https://asianetpakistan.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "AsiaNet-Pakistan", "title": "Afghan Peace Body Offers Kabul Office for Taliban Talks", "title_full": "Afghan Peace Body Offers Kabul Office for Taliban Talks", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "978b3043ae03e1b23eca228d6fc82cfe3f6c910d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTZvBAVuY.YJNse_pILLG95RPvcoEr2MME5yXsrVXdIK92eyIabsQJKiVsPiGgaBzw5rtl1wmTDzMrS4WdxCA.h6A65BKzbw69meDAtEghorVpeM7_71OiI9VCnyKcyo4w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "AsiaNet Pakistan", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Afghan Peace Body Offers Kabul Office for Taliban Talks", "text": "ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN War-torn Afghanistan's official peace-negotiating panel offered Wednesday for the first time to let the Taliban open a representative office in Kabul or in a country of its own choice, for initiating a peace dialogue. The Taliban promptly rejected the offer, however, saying their rivals are \"American occupation\" forces who have installed the Kabul regime.\nThe foreign presence in Afghanistan is the \"real problem,\" the insurgency's main spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, told VOA. \"We do not need to open an office in Kabul because more than half of Afghanistan is under our control and the entire Afghanistan is our office,\" he said.\nThe Taliban has been unofficially running its so-called \"Political Office\" in Qatar since 2013. However, the Afghan government has refused to recognize the facility. Lately, President Ashraf Ghani has pushed authorities in the Gulf state to shut down the insurgent office in the face of intensified attacks by the Taliban across Afghanistan.\nA senior member of the government-formed High Peace Council unveiled the new offer to reporters Wednesday in the Afghan capital. Mohammad Akram Khapalwak said they are ready to enter into the peace process without any preconditions and \"through whatever mechanism\" is proposed by the Taliban.\nKhapalwak called on insurgent leaders residing \"in Qatar, or in other countries, or in Pakistan\" and facing difficult conditions in exile to respond positively to and come to the negotiating table for an \"honorable\" dialogue to end miseries the conflict is inflicting on Afghans.\n\n\"If they want to open an office, and in any other country, and require any facilities before starting peace talks, the Afghan government and the High Peace Council is ready to facilitate it,\" Khapalwak said.\nTerritorial advances\nThe Taliban has made significant territorial advances since U.S.-led international combat forces left Afghanistan in 2014.\nCommander of U.S. troops and NATO's Resolute Support mission in the country, General John Nicholson, said last week the Afghan government controls about 64 percent of the population, the Taliban controls about 12 percent of the population, and the other 24 percent live in contested areas.\nThe U.S. military has intensified airstrikes against Taliban insurgents and other militant groups, including Islamic State, in support of Afghan ground forces since President Donald Trump unveiled his new war strategy three months ago.\nThe Taliban has long wanted to engage in direct peace talks with Washington, saying the U.S. administration and not the Afghan government is the authority on deciding the fate of the conflict. A U.S.-led military coalition invaded and ousted the Taliban from power in 2001 to punish the group for sheltering al-Qaida leaders blamed for plotting the 9/11 attacks on U.S. cities.\nU.N. officials have warned that Afghan civilians continue to bear the brunt of the escalation in the Afghan armed conflict. The number of civilian casualties this year has risen to record levels.\n\nSource: Voice of America\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "khapalwak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zabihullah mujahid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammad akram khapalwak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashraf ghani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john nicholson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "taliban", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "voa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "voice of america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "high peace council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.n.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kabul office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qatar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kabul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:07.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2baef65a8bf5be8b15df045f7c247f1cecd85fd5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaZNK3VrlpO_TGWjQNec1PKlUqmx6F_Pb7", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "RAI vs IOTA ?? : CryptoCurrency", "title_full": "RAI vs IOTA ?? : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2017-12-07T05:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.778, "main_image": "https://www.redditstatic.com/icon.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2baef65a8bf5be8b15df045f7c247f1cecd85fd5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaZNK3VrlpO_TGWjQNec1PKlUqmx6F_Pb7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T05:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "RAI vs IOTA ?? : CryptoCurrency", "text": "Featured Subreddit: /r/Best_of_Crypto Welcome \nWelcome to /r/CryptoCurrency .

The technician measures the neck angle / height and chooses the right thickness of bridge from a parts bin to get the correct geometry.

Did that/those get removed after the clamps were removed?\nIf the bridge is adequately glued, there is no reason to remove it again. It is unlikely that the glue joint/how it was glued has altered the tone, given that you used Titebond. Also, you don't want to remove anymore of the top wood. Unless absolutely necessary, leave it alone.\nAs an aside, if a guitar top has runout, and most do, then the runout will be oriented in opposite directions on one half of the top compared to the other. When removing a bridge, that means one usually approaches the removal from opposite directions on each half of the bridge. That about half of the bridge has a fair bit of top attached to it, while the other half does not, suggests that, perhaps, you didn't approach it that way. (The half with top stuck to it, was removed in the opposite direction than it should have been.)\nIt is possible that a blob of glue in the saddle slot prevents the saddle from sitting flat. This would be an issue for an under saddle pickup, but wouldn't likely change the un-amplified tone much, if any. \"Levelling\" the slot isn't appropriate, if the problem is a blob of glue in one specific location. One of the most difficult things to learn is to correctly identify a problem area and work only that area, and not everything around it. Working the entire area, rather than addressing the specific problem, often makes matters worse, not better: one hasn't addressed the cause of the problem.\nNone of the things you've mentioned are likely causes of a significant change in the sound of the instrument.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:07.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6248e67ffe5593e74d745c1f936e2e23907e26cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTZvBAVuY.YJNse_pILLG95MQqYLKLZqfvSEpNM4IlT4oFt.XXRGIZx9Wbzb3Uxfi9gTn9ihJKwXqVi0MDdqDvOo7B6L27oTXPm_UT9R_6C66lWEXVpMUI1kSMDBQTG3ivWshHgjnjyDw--", "site_full": "asianetpakistan.com", "site": "asianetpakistan.com", "site_section": "https://asianetpakistan.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "AsiaNet-Pakistan", "title": "FBI Agent: Saudi at Guantanamo Admitted Helping 9/11 Plot", "title_full": "FBI Agent: Saudi at Guantanamo Admitted Helping 9/11 Plot", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6248e67ffe5593e74d745c1f936e2e23907e26cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTZvBAVuY.YJNse_pILLG95MQqYLKLZqfvSEpNM4IlT4oFt.XXRGIZx9Wbzb3Uxfi9gTn9ihJKwXqVi0MDdqDvOo7B6L27oTXPm_UT9R_6C66lWEXVpMUI1kSMDBQTG3ivWshHgjnjyDw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "AsiaNet Pakistan", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "FBI Agent: Saudi at Guantanamo Admitted Helping 9/11 Plot", "text": "A Saudi Arabian being held at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp has admitted to helping with flights and finances for seven of the 19 men who hijacked planes in the September 11, 2001, attacks on the U.S., one of his interrogators testified at his trial. \nMustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi, now facing a war crimes tribunal, spoke to interrogators over four days in January 2004 as they showed him evidence of his involvement in the terrorist attack. \n\"He indicated he was very happy to have been able to support the brothers who carried out the attack,\" retired FBI Agent Abigail Perkins testified Wednesday, providing the most detailed account so far of evidence prosecutors intend to use in a case that has unfolded incrementally over nearly six years.\nThe agent described the conversation as cordial, professional and nonthreatening.

The 45-year-old filmmaker says 1960s saw films by Bimal Roy and Hrishikesh Mukherji, who highlighted social problems in their films, and these issues were dealt with utmost care on celluloid just how he has stayed honest to his story. In an interview with PTI, Kashyap says, \"We grew up in a time when we made socio-political films, filmmakers like Bimal Roy, Hrishikesh Mukherji, Raj Kapoor made films that dealt with elements in society about casteism, widows, unwed mothers etc. These films were appreciated by the audience but then we stopped making them but again that trend has come back (in films). \"Our film is about boxing, so we have to be honest to our story, it is about where do boxers come from, what is the status of boxing in society and the like.\" The film traces the story of a boxer from UP, named Shravan Singh, played by Vineet Kumar Singh, who belongs to a low caste and falls in love with a Brahmin woman. Things go south when he lands a punch on boxing federation head and politician-gangster, Bhagwan Das, part essayed by Jimmy Shergill. How the underdog Shravan fights - both for his rights and love - is what \"Mukkabaaz\" is about. Producer of the film, Aanand L Rai questions the parameters of development in today's scenario. \"Tomorrow, if a filmmaker wants to make a story like 'Prem Rog' which was about child widow, will I be allowed to say (the story) now or will I be stopped? Similarly will I be allowed to keep the name of the character Ganga with a film like 'Ram Teri Ganga Maili'? \"...understand where are we going? Are we progressing? Is it progressive space for us or is it taking us backwards? It is not about makers or audience or media, we as country what is happening to us... Are we together to bring the change or are we accepting that?\" he asks. The upcoming sports drama film received a standing ovation at this year's JIO MAMI Film Festival and Kashyap says the response the film has garnered at several international film festivals is overwhelming. \"I was surprised that there is an audience for a film like this in the West. This is my third experience (with international audience). Every time I have gone out (to film festivals) with a film, we have got good response be it 'Dev D' or 'Gangs of Wasseypur' or 'Mukkabaaz. \"Every time I have stemmed out and set out to thinking I want to make a story - not complex but relevant - that reaches out to audiences everywhere, it has worked. They have become bigger hits at the festivals,\" says the filmmaker. Kashyap says he fails to understand how the international audience understood the various elements of boxing in India from \"Mukkabaaz\". \"I recorded the reaction of the audience of an international festival and my team was amazed. They (referring to international audience) did not understand the context (of the film) but they enjoyed it. However, they did ask what the context was towards the end. Here, at MAMI, the reaction was extraordinary because they understood the context.\" \"It is high time our audience becomes a part of the global audience. You can't keep them aloof. You have to raise the audience to that level,\" he adds. \"Mukkabaaz\" marks the first collaboration between Kashyap and Rai as director and producer respectively. The duo next have \"Manmarziyan\" in the pipeline, with Taapsee Pannu and Vicky Kaushal in the lead. Talking about their maiden outing together, Rai says Kashyap and him are quite similar as creative people. \"I know Anurag likes to tell stories and same is the case with me. I want to work with like-minded people as it makes your life easy. I had this story which I wanted to pitch to Anurag and I was looking for an opportunity where I will get Anurag to do something. I wanted to see him make one story. \"We both are not that money-minded we came together for love of the story. He was working on a story 'Mukkabaaz' and I was working on 'Manmarziyan'. So we went ahead with 'Mukkabaaz' and then we decided to go ahead with the other film. While Kashyap on a lighter note reveal that all directors usually end up meeting each other during each other's birthday parties and that is how the \"Gangs of Wasseypur\" helmer met Rai. \"We (Rai and I) were done with our creative business in ten minutes.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kashyap", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "teri ganga maili", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anurag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bimal roy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raj kapoor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shravan singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mukkabaaz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aanand l rai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taapsee pannu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anurag kashyap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vineet kumar singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shravan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hrishikesh mukherji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimmy shergill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhagwan das", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ganga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prem rog", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vicky kaushal", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kashyap films", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "mami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:08.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "44956f0087c7df50aef9dade84e981c85c43d1ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8RjMYmHraOQLOqC8We0m5xbPDsE8Zjx6vJZ9m5Pn81VCGghVeRdRyiM152Nfc7XwJHIbXSO_cwHFFmagDI8G2j", "site_full": "www.acousticguitarforum.com", "site": "acousticguitarforum.com", "site_section": "http://www.acousticguitarforum.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=44", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Build and Repair - The Acoustic Guitar Forum", "title": "Bridge re-glue affected tone.

Did that/those get removed after the clamps were removed?\nIf the bridge is adequately glued, there is no reason to remove it again. It is unlikely that the glue joint/how it was glued has altered the tone, given that you used Titebond. Also, you don't want to remove anymore of the top wood. Unless absolutely necessary, leave it alone.\nAs an aside, if a guitar top has runout, and most do, then the runout will be oriented in opposite directions on one half of the top compared to the other. When removing a bridge, that means one usually approaches the removal from opposite directions on each half of the bridge. That about half of the bridge has a fair bit of top attached to it, while the other half does not, suggests that, perhaps, you didn't approach it that way. (The half with top stuck to it, was removed in the opposite direction than it should have been.)\nIt is possible that a blob of glue in the saddle slot prevents the saddle from sitting flat. This would be an issue for an under saddle pickup, but wouldn't likely change the un-amplified tone much, if any. \"Levelling\" the slot isn't appropriate, if the problem is a blob of glue in one specific location. One of the most difficult things to learn is to correctly identify a problem area and work only that area, and not everything around it. Working the entire area, rather than addressing the specific problem, often makes matters worse, not better: one hasn't addressed the cause of the problem.\nNone of the things you've mentioned are likely causes of a significant change in the sound of the instrument. Excellent info. I didn't even think to consider the runout on the top. Is there a way to identify why direction the runout goes prior to removing a bridge?

I don't quite understand Well you removed wood in the proceas of pulling the bridge. It happens. If you just merely sand the area smooth you'll create a recession in the area. So either a) you end up with a thicker film if glue than necessary at that point, or b) you cranked the clamp enough to force the join closed, and when you remove the clamps the resulting tension forces the bridge to warp slightly, possibly enough to warp the bottom of the saddle slot. In this scenario I may actually create a fissure of constant depth where the tear out was, tapering it to zero and fitting it under the bridge footprint, then gluing material hopefully of the same wood and leveling that out to the surrounding area.\nProbably b is the likely scenario which can be checked. The slot can be trued but likely a new saddle would be needed. I don't think fully gluing the bridge in did harm, a lip is usually left by manufacturers to ensure a clean bridge install. But I think full bridge gluing considered more an improvementthan anything else.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:08.040+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5999817e40c9cfe42a8383da5802a84a241bc54f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSdwCx9ebqzePSygD34acFN45D3FCXr6Ilw8MJ.wkWvLMtXsKtjI4JP0DtWW4sd0xcvN8_q9MLi_G4E6fq_1uERg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "\ud83c\udd71lack People Twitter", "title": "Theta Blood Beta", "title_full": "Theta Blood Beta : BlackPeopleTwitter", "published": "2017-12-06T20:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 156, "participants_count": 118, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.166, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4d5ad6368c3c15d113812fd8a0aa0a4565ccbec9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSdwCx9ebqzePSygD34acFN45D3FCXr6Ilw8MJ.wkWvLMtXsKtjI4JP0DtWW4sd0xcvN8_q9MLi_E5CQXEGYBcxgPLBo9PLLjUbqfr5mtPxkk-", "ord_in_thread": 154, "author": "JornBerg", "published": "2017-12-07T10:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Upvoted for you being the \"whitest user on this entire sub\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:09.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c9c133459de3cab287d54ea87110cb5b8e4fc375", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9D2Qkpp6vWSMwMM8NxS2qQ4nMVF4sMvv9Bob7v5bEBIiZGAzw.Y2i2CMuZXRehESrOhxofVcK4ccnEAakuTUp2yliv_XcRaQuIJ3ugPi6aZ2eVNXQWNIbA", "site_full": "www.lse.co.uk", "site": "lse.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.lse.co.uk/share-chat.asp?page=201", "site_categories": ["united_kingdom", "travel", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Share Chat on London South East.
