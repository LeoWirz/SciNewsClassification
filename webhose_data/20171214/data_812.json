You must submit your licence application by this date or you will no longer be able to provide condo management services. \nWhat happens until January 29, 2018? \u201cDeemed\u201d Transitional General Licence : if you have provided condo management services in the previous year and have two or more years (2,920+ hours) of experience within the previous five years, you hold a \u201cdeemed\u201d transitional general licence. Note: in order to qualify for a general licence or transitional general licence, you must hold a \u201cdeemed\u201d transitional general licence. \u201c Deemed\u201d Limited Licence : if you have been providing condo management services within the previous year but do not have two or more years of experience, you hold a \u201cdeemed\u201d limited licence. \u201cDeemed\u201d Condo Management Provider Licence ( Management Companies ): to hold a \u201cdeemed\u201d condo management provider licence, your company must have provided condo management services on October 31, 2017. \nThese \u201cdeemed\u201d licences expire on January 30, 2018. If you require an extension, apply to the Registrar now . \nWhat happens after January 30, 2018? You receive your certificate of licence. OR The Registrar refuses your application. You will receive written notice setting out the reasons for the refusal. You will have 15 days to send the Registrar and the Tribunal a request for a hearing. The request must be delivered either personally, sent by registered mail or sent by another manner that provides a receipt. The Registrar and Tribunal refuses your application at the hearing .

He sent the information, which included employees\u2019 names, addresses, bank account details and salaries, to newspapers and also published it online. \u2018Vicariously liable\u2019 \nThis incident shows how complex liability can be regarding data breaches. Morrisons is both the victim \u2013 having been awarded \u00a3170,000 in compensation against Skelton \u2013 and vicariously liable. \nMr Justice Langstaff said : \u201cI hold that the Data Protection Act (DPA) does not impose primary liability upon Morrisons,\u201d adding that the supermarket had not been proved to be at fault by breaking any of the data protection principles, other than in one respect that did not cause loss. However, he rejected the argument that \u201cno vicarious liability can be established\u201d. \nNick McAleenan, of JMW Solicitors, which represented the claimants, said: \u201cEvery day, we entrust information about ourselves to businesses and organisations. We expect them to take responsibility when our information is not kept safe and secure.\u201d \nHe added: \u201cThis private information belonged to my clients. They are Morrisons checkout staff, shelf stackers, factory workers \u2013 ordinary people doing their jobs. \n\u201cThe consequences of this data leak were serious. It created significant worry, stress and inconvenience for my clients.\u201d \nThis ruling is worrying news for organisations, as it\u2019s hard to stop an employee intent on sabotage. Skelton needed access to sensitive information to carry out his job, but after being accused of dealing in legal highs at work, he decided to cause \u201csome real damage\u201d. \nMorrisons argued that there was nothing it could have done to prevent the data breach, and that Skelton alone was liable. However, the court ruled that the supermarket entrusted the data to Skelton, and was therefore indirectly responsible. Improve your legal position in the event of a data breach \nThe result of this case, the first data breach class action in the UK, has potential implications for every individual and business in the country. It comes just months before the DPA\u2019s successor, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into effect, which gives data subjects the right to compensation for breaches of the Regulation. \nArticle 82.3 qualifies this, saying: \u201cA controller or processor shall be exempt from liability [\u2026] if it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.\u201d However, the stringency with which liability was determined in this case suggests that it will be very hard for organisations to prove that they are completely free from responsibility. \nAll organisations that handle EU residents\u2019 personal data should be preparing for the GDPR. Failure to comply could be incredibly costly, as supervisory authorities have the power to issue strong fines and enforcement actions. When you add compensation for affected individuals, a data breach could be devastating. \nImplementing the Regulation\u2019s requirements will be a long, challenging process, but organisations that are already certified to the information security standard ISO 27001 will have a much easier job. \nISO 27001 is the international standard that describes best practice for an information security management system. It provides guidance for implementing appropriate measures to mitigate data security risks, and its recommended technical measures are in line with the requirements of the GDPR. \nCertification to ISO 27001 enables organisations to demonstrate they have taken reasonable measures to protect themselves from a data breach, and improves their legal defensibility in the event of a breach.

And while these PCs are powered by Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 835 processor, which is also available on mobile devices, not the full feature set is being offered, as the chipset has been specifically optimized for desktop computers. As Neowin discovered, one of the features missing from PCs powered by the Snapdragon 835 chip is 802.11ad Wi-Fi, as the integrated Wi-Fi + WCN3990 companion chip offers 2x2 802.11ac with Mu-MIMO peak speed at 867 Mbps. Then, there\u2019s no wireless charging, a change that more or less makes sense on a laptop, though it would certainly come in handy with the proper hardware, and no fast charging, as Qualcomm has apparently removed Quick Charge 4 support from the chipset. NFC nowhere to be seen but it\u2019s there A bit more surprising is that NFC support is also missing from the official spec sheet, but Qualcomm told the cited source that this feature is available, only that it\u2019s not included in the official documentation. On the other hand, the Snapdragon 835 chipset available on Always Connected PCs supports Bluetooth 5, with a peak speed of 2 Mbps, as well as 6 different satellite systems for location services, namely GPS, GLONASS, Beidou, Galileo, QZSS, and SBAS. The rest of the specifications are pretty much the same with the mobile sibling, with X16 cellular model that can reach 1Gbps download speed, Kyro 280 CPU that tops at 2.45 GHz, and Adreno 540 GPU. The chipset, however, has been optimized for long battery life, and Microsoft claims that devices powered by the Snapdragon 835 and running Windows 10 can achieve one week of battery life per charge. On average, these laptops offer around 20 hours of active use per charge, but this obviously depends on a lot of factors, including the software that\u2019s running on the computer.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "qualcomm", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kyro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "galileo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gpu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asus", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "beidou", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:23.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a4c1934e08020a46428300c0bc50f5bd8f47ced", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9tj.R1dPVNZf.dv7vkCN_Uxs4dmIbG4WoSCrrZGnRDcGaEVGF6CeE8XByp.eGDWHFWi4mqU42dekk5FAY2jW9tw.F5ZLq99lgZKilTLAe6Cw--", "site_full": "www.complaintsboard.com", "site": "complaintsboard.com", "site_section": "http://www.complaintsboard.com/lastcompanieslist/", "site_categories": ["media", "shopping"], "section_title": "Complaints Board - Consumer Complaints, Reviews, Information | Last Companies", "title": "Makro Online - Order no# MAK720548, 949959", "title_full": "Makro Online - Order no# MAK720548, Review 949959 | Complaints Board", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "https://www.complaintsboard.com/thumb.php?src=makro.jpeg&wmax=200&ahmax=200&quality=90&crop=1&bname=123735", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20893, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8a4c1934e08020a46428300c0bc50f5bd8f47ced", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9tj.R1dPVNZf.dv7vkCN_Uxs4dmIbG4WoSCrrZGnRDcGaEVGF6CeE8XByp.eGDWHFWi4mqU42dekk5FAY2jW9tw.F5ZLq99lgZKilTLAe6Cw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bukxsa", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Makro Online - Order no# MAK720548, 949959", "text": "Ordered on 24/11/2017 online/Black Friday-still not received\nHad to track to know what's happening.

The game was halted for several minutes as the 25-year-old was strapped to a backboard, carted off the field and taken to the hospital for tests amid fears of a spinal injury.

Not long after, Cincinnati safety George Iloka punctuated a game-tying touchdown catch by Pittsburgh star Antonio Brown with a late, high hit. (Iloka and Smith-Schuster have been suspended one game for their actions).\nPittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, when asked to assess the brutality of the night in the immediate aftermath, offered a chilling assessment: \u0093AFC North football.\u0094The Steelers\u0092 comeback from 17-0 Ben Jones Jersey down in a prime-time game bursting with playoff implications should have been the topline, but the reaction from NFL insiders spoke volumes.\nFor a league that\u0092s made a strategic effort to persuade the public that it\u0092s a worthy Dejounte Murray Jersey American pastime and not merely a vehicle for gratuitous violence, this was hardly a banner night.

What\u2019s the scale of the tilapia industry in Guatemala? \nGuatemala\u2019s tilapia production is estimated to be 15,000 tonnes and about 40 million fingerlings per year. Twenty percent of this production is exported to the USA as fillet and the rest is for domestic market, mean harvest weights are between 8 oz and 1 lb. Tilapia broodstock are distributed internationally from Spring Genetics' Miami HQ \n\u00a9 Spring genetics Describe your relationship with Acu\u00edcola Maria Linda, including some details on the numbers of tilapia they\u2019re importing from Spring Genetics each year. \nAcuicola Maria Linda is the exclusive distributor of Spring Genetics stock in Guatemala, they receive dissemination groups from the latest improved generations on a yearly basis from the Spring Genetics breeding nucleus in Miami. Each shipment contains about 20,000 broodfish. What traits do you select for in the stock you send to Central America? \nSpring Genetics operates an advanced family-based breeding programme for Nile tilapia, selecting stock for key traits such as fast growth, survivability and yield. More recently we\u2019ve also been breeding for increased resistance to Streptococcus iniae and S. agalactiae . The selection for disease resistance is based on controlled challenge testing of nucleus families. Additional key traits such as resistance to other pathogens, improved feed conversion ratios (FCRs), tolerance to salinity and high/low temperatures are also currently being assessed for implementation. Why is a tolerance to Streptococcus agalactiae so important and is this a health issue that\u2019s limited to Guatemala/Central America? \nStreptococcus infection is one of the most devastating diseases in tilapia farming, affecting most of the countries in Latin America. It can cause massive mortalities of large fish and causes farmers heavy economic losses. Methods for prevention and control of this disease include vaccines, management strategies and antibiotics. Spring Genetics has recently launched a pioneering and complimentary preventative approach, introducing selection for S. inae and S. agalactidae resistance in the breeding programme. \nSpring Genetics exports around half a million tilapia broodstock a year to Mexico, Brazil, Guatemala and Asia and we are currently looking for distributors in other key markets around the world What are the alternatives to using Strep-resistant strains and what are the drawbacks of these alternatives? \nGood management practices are a key factor to reduce Streptococcus infections but in many production systems \u2013 in particular net pen farming \u2013 it is not possible to control factors like water quality, temperature and disease. Other alternatives are vaccination (not 100 percent efficient) and currently the logistics are complicated, especially in cage production and antibiotics, but these are often used with no prescription. Tilapia fry, which are destined to be gown on to become broodstock, arrive in Guatemala \n\u00a9 Spring Genetics How many tilapia do SG produce annually, and where are these distributed to? \nSpring Genetics\u2019 nucleus in Miami mainly produces tilapia broodstock, shipping around half a million a year. We have multipliers in Mexico, Brazil, Guatemala and Asia and are currently looking for distributors in other key markets around the world. Do other markets look for specific traits other than Strep-resistance? \nYes, resistance to other diseases like tilapia lake virus (TILV), Francisella, Columnaris, tolerance to low temperature and high salinity are some of the other traits that producers look for. Spring Genetics has many of these traits in our development plans. We have a special team that discuss the main traits, depending on the demands on the global market the traits are defined by priority. Do you collaborate with Norwegian partners as part of the development process? \nSpring Genetics\u2019 breeding programme is designed and supervised by Akvaforsk Genetics , a leading provider of genetic improvement services to aquaculture industries worldwide, in Norway. Akvaforsk has extensive experience from more than 20 large scale selection programmes, covering 15 species of fish and shrimp across Europe, Asia and the Americas. Akvaforsk conducts all relevant data analyses and genetic evaluations for Spring Genetics and also hosts the central SQL database, which contains all essential data for the breeding programme.

In general, this feature is not about interview suits for women , which should be as classic and basic as you get \u2014 instead, this feature is about the slightly different suit that is fashionable, yet professional. \nI\u2019m really loving Hobbs suits lately! I like the piping on the jacket, as well as the colorblocking on the dress \u2014 it\u2019s interesting, flattering, and not at all Star Trek-y or \u201cbudget\u201d looking. If the high neckline of the dress gives you pause, I\u2019d either do a short, round necklace just above the crew neck (such as a pearl necklace), or \u2014 especially for the holidays \u2014 consider pinning a brooch to the lapel of the jacket or the collarbone-area on the dress. The jacket ( Marlene Piped Wool-Blend Jacket ) is $335, and the dress ( Marlene Color-Blocked Wool-Blend Dress ) is $295. \nPsst: This suit is included in the Bloomingdale\u2019s Friends & Family sale today, where they\u2019re offering 25% off a large selection of items (this suit is included!) \u2014 and on everything else, Loyallists get a $25 gift card on every $100 you spend. Great time to consider buying a big handbag or other purchase that will not likely go on sale! \nLooking for a similar option in plus sizes? This option from Le Suit has similar piping, while this affordable plus-size blazer and sheath dress set has a similar sedate, sophisticated vibe. (The affordable set also comes in regular sizes: jacket , dress , pants .) \nThis post contains affiliate links and Corporette\u00ae may earn commissions for purchases made through links in this post.

The situation was a little different few years ago when only a handful organizations were following through QA processes. Instances where tech-developers were asking \u2018Why do we need a quality assurance team?\u2019 were not uncommon. Even today, certain QA positions seem underestimated compared to those belonging to developing experts.\nPeople who think that the answer to the question above is just \u2018testing software\u2019 probably fail to evaluate the main goal and responsibility of quality assurance. Let\u2019s have a look at QA tools\u2019 basic importance for tech companies.\nQA tools are essential Many software engineers would know that it is near to impossible coding something that is 100 per cent perfect. You can never be too sure if an app would run smoothly until you hit the update button and the code to see if it does what it is supposed to do. Hence, testing is a vital part of building and improving the work of products these days.\nA global renowned tech entrepreneur, innovator, and investor, Marc Andreessen, declared in 2011 that Software Is Eating The World, but after a few years, in 2016, he updated his analysis to claim \u201cSoftware Is Programming The World\u201d . It is gravely important, in this context, that your small business has a comprehensive testing methodology and that you aim to automate it as much as possible to get the best results.\nAutomated software testing has now become an essential part of all successful programming and development projects. In the past, automation was considered an affordable luxury for start-ups, however, as more and more software testing tools pop-up, its cost has considerably reduced becoming less of a barrier for smaller organizations.\nIn a country like Ireland, QA testing is increasing in demand as more and more companies are looking into filling positions in this area. However, one of the challenges is that there are not enough people to apply for these positions. A QA Software Placements recruiter, Laura Boland, explains:\n\u201cWe have some great candidates here in Ireland, but not enough for all the roles we are trying to fill. Some foreign companies opening their IT HQ\u2019s here in Ireland far outweigh the amount of available IT workers.\u201d \nWhy software companies should use one If the software you developed is buggy and difficult to use because you didn\u2019t take the time to test it, there is a good chance your company could lose customers post-launch. Skipping QA can even result in fewer efficacies, especially if your app was built to improve internal processes.\n1. Product launch Having software quality problems will compel you to rework on the product if anything. The refixes and backtracking is the most taxing stage. It tends to become pricier depending on how late in the process the error emerges: do you recognize it at the start, during the design phase or do you only catch it later on?\nFor your company and the customers\u2019 sake, it should best be the initial stage when you\u2019re setting the basic requirements. Since with each following phase, the cost of mending a software error rises fast; it should be dealt with in the early stages. The majority of the product can be re-built using the correct specifications. Indeed, there will be some extra work involved, but it is better than detecting the problem after the product has been shipped out to the market. That is when the customer complains; orders are returned/rejected, and your brand reputation takes a dramatic dip.\n2. It\u2019s not only about finding bugs Quality assurance is not just about doing the \u2018negative test.\u2019 It also has to make sure a product/software performs its supposed duty. This is as essential as discovering issues while looking at the invention through the consumer\u2019s eyes. Can you get to the area without meandering through the bumps, jumping through too many loops? Does the final upshot look nice or is it too much for the eyes to handle?\n3. Customer specifications Carefully recording each step in the manufacturing and quality process is a basic part of software development. The QA team documents the machined parts against the customer specs and adds the information to the company\u2019s database. Usually, the certified documentation is electronically attached to the product throughout the process; with the ERP system providing experts with all the traceability options needed from raw material receipts to finished product shipment. Software companies like btechsolutions documents workflow, timelines, and testing verification simultaneously.\n4. Avoid the failure costs You can save your company the cost associated with bad product quality by putting in the necessary effort up front to track customer software development. Apt methods for quality assurance and automation are all important parts of the equation.\nUndoubtedly, these trials cost extra investment of resources: understand how software quality is scaled and measured, get the right tools to do it, work with QA experts who know what they\u2019re talking about.\nFollow the things mentioned above, and rest aussred you will be able to save heaps of money in the end; ensuring that you don\u2019t have to spend a large portion returning and rebuilding a flawed software product after development.\nCreating a high-quality tech programme is expensive, but it is less costly than creating a low-quality one.\n5. Reducing risks The program advancement risks can be both automatic and specialized; that is, dangers that the online space or programming won\u2019t execute as expected to or will be excessively entangled, making it impossible to change, utilize or keep up, while the dread that the task will exploit the time or cost are automatic risks.\nThe principal objective of QA apparatuses is to diminish the probability of these dangers. Coding norms, for example, are made to guarantee the conveyance of value code. If there should arise an occurrence of no set standards, the code winds up plainly open to insurability hazard, and inevitable revamp by the QA team. In any case, if set tenets are contrived however there is no express technique for guaranteeing that all codes meet the standard, there is a desperate danger of the base not satisfying the necessities.\nThe quality affirmation process is vital for a product advancement cycle to diminish the risks, building up quality in both the final-built item and work process. To have no QA devices implies expanded hazard for an organization and the arrival of unsuitable codes.\nConclusion Many developing experts think QA is the last step of a manufacturing process, or even after the launch take it as a means to find and fix bugs. As a software company, get to know your product and customer requirements first, building quality assurance around the exact needs of the consumer base. QA tools ensure a reliable, well-worked final product by gathering requirements through product delivery.\nGuest article written by: Erica Silva is a blogger who loves to discover and explore the world around her.

Herald photo by Chris Christo comments Prosecutors and public defenders are the lifeblood of the criminal justice system, but a new bill being considered in Washington could push aspiring attorneys away from the low-pay, high-stress work and set off a public safety crisis.\nThe so-called PROSPER Act, introduced by U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) and U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.), would immediately eliminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. That program erases student debt for those who work for qualifying employers after making payments for 10 years.\nBay State district attorneys and the Committee for Public Counsel Services use this financial carrot as a way to retain experienced attorneys and recruit law school graduates. With starting wages hovering around the $50,000 mark for both offices, the program is a vital way to appeal to attorneys who are often saddled with six-figure debt.\n\u201cThis program is a piece of the puzzle to solve our salary issues. Getting rid of it would absolutely be disastrous,\u201d said Anthony Benedetti, chief counsel for CPCS. \u201cI think it\u2019s a public safety issue. It\u2019s a due process issue.\u201d\nThe concern is that new attorneys will increasingly join the private sector or go it alone in hopes of finding a job that can help chip away at debt. Seasoned professionals who are nearing the 10-year mark could also leave, fearing that the promise they signed up for may not be there.\n\u201cThis is demanding and necessary work, and there is this bonus you get after 10 years if you dedicate your life to it,\u201d said Victoria Ranieri, 35, a supervising public defender in Lawrence who has been with CPCS for seven years. \u201cI think we would lose a lot of qualified, talented people.\u201d\nA spokesman for the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, which introduced the bill, said \u201cno current borrower would lose eligibility for loan forgiveness programs under the PROSPER Act.\u201d\nBut in a March court filing, an Education Department attorney wrote that borrowers couldn\u2019t rely on approval letters for Public Service Loan Forgiveness as a final determination of eligibility.\n\u201cThey are taking the tools away that we need to have experienced prosecutors,\u201d said Norfolk District Attorney Michael Morrissey, who also heads the Massachusetts District Attorneys Association. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\nFor Ranieri, who says she still lives with her parents and just recently paid off her trusty Honda Accord, what remains is an uncomfortable waiting game.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to overstate how much this program means to me and my colleagues,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt could absolutely be a crisis if it goes away.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bob mcgovern", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mcgovern", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bill", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brett guthrie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia foxx", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony benedetti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ranieri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victoria ranieri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael morrissey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cpcs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "education department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts district attorneys association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house committee on education", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "committee for public counsel services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "public service loan forgiveness", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bay state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lawrence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norfolk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:25.067+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6b7ff562abfaff9c10e4183deeedb3b67b64fc84", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacVx.i.t2y1pAssbUKZQnp5TH.x6OtzCH5O5YFxzqAw1U-", "site_full": "www.nairaland.com", "site": "nairaland.com", "site_section": "http://www.nairaland.com/phones", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Phones - Nigeria - Nairaland", "title": "The Xiaomi Thread.

This interview will be divided into two parts. When did you finish school and how much did you owe then? I finished school in 2008 and I think I owed about $150,000. My federal loans were consolidated at 2% while my private loans were on a variable interest rate which were between 4-7%. Which schools did you attend? I went to a relatively low-ranked law school. Then I got a Tax LL.M. at one of the schools on this list . Where did you work when you first graduated? I did very well academically at my Tax LL.M. program, so I thought I had a shot at a major law or accounting firm. But I graduated just at the start of the recession. And firms are still picky about where you went to undergrad and law school. I ended up working for a solo practitioner where the primary clients were small businesses and individuals. The firm was focused on tax litigation and tax dispute resolution. It\u2019s not the job I had in mind when I graduated, but I learned a lot of useful skills. http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2017/12/how-a-solo-tax-lawyer-paid-off-150000-in-student-loans-in-7-years-without-biglaw.html", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:25.084+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "03c5a9af8273ca28ff56e47b79c4fc37969a1ac9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg92paSvURTmQFvhXL_upPg9fPV7TcSTOJdMzk1EGPzU2fkMCEvjazYIAxGPzRpjW3ynShLG8aXwO_DeLj3SUigP1vw7HwVUFJg-", "site_full": "wincoin.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://wincoin.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Win Coin", "title": "Google Alert - virtual currency", "title_full": "Google Alert - virtual currency", "published": "2017-12-07T12:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "03c5a9af8273ca28ff56e47b79c4fc37969a1ac9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg92paSvURTmQFvhXL_upPg9fPV7TcSTOJdMzk1EGPzU2fkMCEvjazYIAxGPzRpjW3ynShLG8aXwO_DeLj3SUigP1vw7HwVUFJg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Stan Reichenbach (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "Google Alert - virtual currency", "text": "virtual currency As-it-happens update \u22c5 December 7, 2017 NEWS Japanese FSA gets increasing number of enquiries about virtual currencies FinanceFeeds (blog) According to the data, the FSA's Counseling Office for Financial Services Users received a total of 685 investor enquiries about virtual currencies in the quarter to September 30, 2017.

But I thought the Season 6 writing in particular in the troughs of the Spuffy hook ups were incredibly well developed on an individual episode level. To me what was missing in s6 was the Joss like overreaching arc we got in s2-5 where each little building block gives way to the bigger picture story. Click to expand... Yes this is why I believe that Buffy's arc in S6 is probably the best thing about that season. It's the only thing that really holds it together because it is developed almost all the way through. Without it the season just falls apart because we don't have those well thought out building blocks that feed into the overall picture, just very disparate threads. You could argue in its favour that this structural disconnect is reflective of the disconnect between the characters, but IMO that's a weak argument because it's perfectly possible to have tight interweaving narrative threads while giving us an overall story of individual isolation. This season just failed to do that.\ndcai0830 said: \u2191 At the end of the day we saw little to no impact of the A/R to Buffy's character. Click to expand... dcai0830 said: \u2191 If Buffy in Season 7 was meant to be embracing her humanity, I'm sorry but I didn't get the memo. Buffy in Season 7 was more slayer than ever before. If that was the idea for the execution of the metaphor, over overcoming the darkness of the Slayer and embracing her humanity, then in my opinion it was not relayed in the writing or on the screen. Click to expand... I think Grace summed up my answer perfectly:\nGrace said: \u2191 In Season 7, I don't see Buffy as embracing her humanity. I see her as embracing her slayer power and largely cutting herself off from the other parts of herself. But her slayer power has now been infected with Buffy's own goodness, in a way, and what Spike ultimately gives back to Buffy is the strength to get through her falling out with the Scoobies and then to figure out a way to stop being *the* slayer altogether. This is why Spike has to die, in my view. If Spike, as I see him, represents Buffy's singular slayer power in Season 7, then he has to die at the end because Buffy is destroying the myth of one girl in all the world and choosing her own story. Click to expand... But I wonder what this means when you take into account the events of S4 regarding the Scoobies? S7 is about power, and specifically the power of the Slayer, but in S4 we see Buffy take on the powers her friends provide in addition to her Slayer strength. The end of that season seemed to be a statment on how Buffy's strength partly derives from her support structure of friends and yet S7 seems to enact another isolation off the back of S6. I haven't got to 'Empty Places' yet, so I can't remember the season's build-up to the kicking-out moment (still trying to get round to watching 'Same Time, Same Place') but I wonder if you guys with better memories think that S7 ended up working against that element of Buffy's ties to humanity?\ndcai0830 said: \u2191 The fact that both of them have become parents, have responsibilities of running a household, taking care of baby/teen as well as fulfilling their sacred duties means they are in uncharted grown up territory. And therefore, whoever each of them are in a relationship with (or trying to start a relationship and failing miserably at it - see Cangel) (or having sex with - see Spuffy) will undoubtedly feel more adult. That is a more a product of the setting and less a commentary on the relationship itself. Click to expand... Yup.\nGrace said: \u2191 But when I said \"Buffy rejecting her darker slayer side and embracing her humanity plays out in concert with the darker side being imbued with humanity (Spike getting a soul),\" I meant specifically that at the end of Season 6, we see Buffy reject Spike, then she almost dies and ultimately she has to climb out of the grave again, but this time she brings Dawn, her humanity, with her. I think we're meant to see that as her putting her depression behind her -- at least the crisis stage, which began to be resolved when she chose her Sunnydale life over the asylum in Normal Again -- essentially she was no longer suicidal at that point. She chooses life/humanity/Dawn over the darkness. And that's played out against the background of Spike getting his soul. Click to expand... Do you guys feel that this recovery came too quickly though? S6 was supposed to be about the weight of life and the 'reality' of trying to trudge through it and yet near the end we have a sudden shift back to the magic and demonyness of everything. I wonder whether Buffy's recovery by the end was just a bit too easy?\nOn a different point, if Spike does represent death/embrace of death, then Buffy's rejection of him specifically by stating she doesn't love him work nicely as a refutation of his FFL 'you're just a little bit in love with it'. Not that I think there isn't a truth to what he says there, but it's a partial truth.\nGrace said: \u2191 Spike is just starting his journey, and it's not until he gets away from Buffy entirely on AtS that he makes any true progress on that score. His sacrifice in the Hellmouth is his first step, though I think even that is him trying to prove to Buffy that he's worthy, that her belief in him hasn't been wasted. To me, it's a shame the way his development was handled in the comics, because I think there was a lot of interesting stuff to explore post-Season 5 of AtS, Click to expand... This is what I love about AtS. If you think about it every character who moved to that show experienced huge character development now that they were no longer tied to Buffy's story: Cordy, Spike, Faith, Wesley, heck even Harmony. On the other thread someone said that they felt Angel faded into the background when Faith came on to the show, but I actually think that's one of its strengths. The show provides that space for individual character development and I think it's great that DB as lead is willing to step back and allow others to take centre stage. I think it fits in well Angel's mission statement of helping the helpless. In order to help like he did with Faith, he has to back down from his own story and devote himself to furthering someone else's.\nBuffyBot22 said: \u2191 I find Darla and Angel's relationship fascinating. It's complex, dynamic, interesting, but very far from healthy (good). I like to watch it, dissect, understand it. Click to expand... This is why I disagree with people who say Angel and Darla should have been a couple/would have made a good couple post-soul. Their deep connection is precisely what makes them wrong for each other IMO, because it goes too far back and too deep. They are reflections of each other in the rawest sense so I don't think it's possible for them to not look at each other and see their whole rotten history together and that's just not healthy.

The end of that season seemed to be a statment on how Buffy's strength partly derives from her support structure of friends and yet S7 seems to enact another isolation off the back of S6. I haven't got to 'Empty Places' yet, so I can't remember the season's build-up to the kicking-out moment (still trying to get round to watching 'Same Time, Same Place') but I wonder if you guys with better memories think that S7 ended up working against that element of Buffy's ties to humanity?

I would need to rewatch to be sure, but my impression is that S6 and S7 suffered from the same problem, which is that they established some interesting concepts and then got stuck on them in the middle of the season, only to end with a big rush of events that didn't end up feeling quite earned. Having two seasons focusing on Buffy's isolation from the Scoobies and only really repairing it at the very end was pretty unsatisfying, although I do enjoy Chosen quite a bit.

S6 was supposed to be about the weight of life and the 'reality' of trying to trudge through it and yet near the end we have a sudden shift back to the magic and demonyness of everything. I wonder whether Buffy's recovery by the end was just a bit too easy? Click to expand... I never saw Buffy recover. I saw Buffy get a temporary break. Which can happen a lot, false breakthroughs. Spike was gone from early S7 and that summer (so was Willow) so Buffy focused on Dawn and with Xander they made a nice little family unit. Buffy seemed to be doing ok. But one by one the things from S6 come back, namely Willow (the one who pulled her out of heaven) and Spike (and that whole messy relationship). Things start to slowly fall apart and then comes Giles with a whole new set of pressures. Buffy falls apart again and in order to get through the day she clings to Spike (just like S6) and out of it comes a weird co-dependent relationship. But I never bought her recovery. It doesn't work like that. Depression doesn't just disappear.\nThis is what I love about AtS. If you think about it every character who moved to that show experienced huge character development now that they were no longer tied to Buffy's story: Cordy, Spike, Faith, Wesley, heck even Harmony. On the other thread someone said that they felt Angel faded into the background when Faith came on to the show, but I actually think that's one of its strengths. The show provides that space for individual character development and I think it's great that DB as lead is willing to step back and allow others to take centre stage. I think it fits in well Angel's mission statement of helping the helpless. In order to help like he did with Faith, he has to back down from his own story and devote himself to furthering someone else's. Click to expand... I think it's due to Angel's nature. He's a restrained and subdued character which makes it easier to let other characters share the spotlight. Spike taking over BtVS is in large part due to the flashy-ness of the character and James acting as if he's on stage in a play instead of in front of a TV camera. He literally stands out. People responded to that so he got more and more focus, to the detriment of other characters. Not so with Angel on AtS.\nLook I have no problem with a Spuffy type thing ala S6 in general. I have problems with the storytelling. That darkness theme has been there since S1 but Buffy was too young to explore it and I'm fine with that. They did it in S3 with Faith except her darkness had more to do with her personal life up until she became a slayer. How she used that power to deal with her issues is again not really related to the power itself, it's just an outlet she uses. S4 was too comedic and light in tone although they could have gone there if they wanted. S5 sort of goes into that when Buffy wants to know more about her power. But the darkness was explored through the wrong character because it was unrelated to the slayer power itself. And that character was Riley. That whole thing of 'Buffy needs a monster in her man' was BS because there was no proof for it. Buffy didn't love Riley enough (from his POV) and he thought it was because of her previous relationship with Angel who was a vampire. So he decided to see what all the fuss was about and to change into what he thought she wanted. Except he had no understanding of their relationship or Buffy. Buffy didn't love Angel because he was a vampire and all the darkness that comes with it.\nWhen Buffy comes back from heaven and depression sets in, I have no issues with her living it out via a S&M relationship. Delving into that darkness that she felt is all well and good. My problem will always be that she went there with a soulless vampire. Spike or some other vampire, it doesn't matter. The vampire darkness is fundamentally different from human darkness. I never saw Buffy's darkness in S6 as a slayer power darkness, because Buffy was still human with a human soul. Her issues were all coming from that. If Buffy had come back without a soul or some kind of altered state were the soul is repressed, then it would make more sense as the latent demonic slayer power could be coming forth in such a scenario. Then it would make sense to go to a soulless vampire. But she is human with a soul and any soulless vampire can't relate to the struggles we have because they literally lack the tools to do so.\nIt should have been Buffy with another human that struggles with their own darkness. A human would be able to understand why she is in her state and where it's coming from.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:26.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6b7ff562abfaff9c10e4183deeedb3b67b64fc84", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacVx.i.t2y1pAssbUKZQnp5TH.x6OtzCH5O5YFxzqAw1U-", "site_full": "www.nairaland.com", "site": "nairaland.com", "site_section": "http://www.nairaland.com/phones", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Phones - Nigeria - Nairaland", "title": "The Xiaomi Thread.

Buffy falls apart again and in order to get through the day she clings to Spike (just like S6) and out of it comes a weird co-dependent relationship. But I never bought her recovery. It doesn't work like that. Depression doesn't just disappear.\nI think it's due to Angel's nature. He's a restrained and subdued character which makes it easier to let other characters share the spotlight. Spike taking over BtVS is in large part due to the flashy-ness of the character and James acting as if he's on stage in a play instead of in front of a TV camera. He literally stands out. People responded to that so he got more and more focus, to the detriment of other characters. Not so with Angel on AtS.\nLook I have no problem with a Spuffy type thing ala S6 in general. I have problems with the storytelling. That darkness theme has been there since S1 but Buffy was too young to explore it and I'm fine with that. They did it in S3 with Faith except her darkness had more to do with her personal life up until she became a slayer. How she used that power to deal with her issues is again not really related to the power itself, it's just an outlet she uses. S4 was too comedic and light in tone although they could have gone there if they wanted. S5 sort of goes into that when Buffy wants to know more about her power. But the darkness was explored through the wrong character because it was unrelated to the slayer power itself. And that character was Riley. That whole thing of 'Buffy needs a monster in her man' was BS because there was no proof for it. Buffy didn't love Riley enough (from his POV) and he thought it was because of her previous relationship with Angel who was a vampire. So he decided to see what all the fuss was about and to change into what he thought she wanted. Except he had no understanding of their relationship or Buffy. Buffy didn't love Angel because he was a vampire and all the darkness that comes with it.\nWhen Buffy comes back from heaven and depression sets in, I have no issues with her living it out via a S&M relationship. Delving into that darkness that she felt is all well and good. My problem will always be that she went there with a soulless vampire. Spike or some other vampire, it doesn't matter. The vampire darkness is fundamentally different from human darkness. I never saw Buffy's darkness in S6 as a slayer power darkness, because Buffy was still human with a human soul. Her issues were all coming from that. If Buffy had come back without a soul or some kind of altered state were the soul is repressed, then it would make more sense as the latent demonic slayer power could be coming forth in such a scenario. Then it would make sense to go to a soulless vampire. But she is human with a soul and any soulless vampire can't relate to the struggles we have because they literally lack the tools to do so.\nIt should have been Buffy with another human that struggles with their own darkness. A human would be able to understand why she is in her state and where it's coming from. Click to expand... I don't think Buffy wanted someone to understand where she was coming from. I think in a sense Spike was what she \"needed.\" I used needed in a crutch type of sense (like for example some sort of drug.) . Buffy was depressed and used Spike (her drug) to cope. She didn't want her drug to understand her or relate to her on any level because then she might just have to face how she is actually feeling. With Spike, she didn't have to face it or even think about it. So Spike works in this sense. The writers just did not execute this the right say.

made only from flour, salt, yeast and water - to create pizzas that have made the Italian city one of the culinary capitals of the world.\nThe spinning motion - called schiaffo - extends the dough to ensure the perfect base: a charred deep-dish traditionally topped with tomato, fresh mozzerella cheese, basil and olive oil.\nImage: The botega, where pizza is made and eaten, is place for community gathering \"It is the hands, heart and soul of the pizzaiuolo which allow us to make magic,\" master pizza maker Enzo Coccio said, describing schiaffo as \"a love and passion that we transmit to others\".\nHe joined celebrations in the streets of Naples on Wednesday, as locals anticipated the decision by feasting on the delicacy and doling out slices of free pizza in the city.\nImage: The dish is blasted in a wood-fired oven The art competed against 34 candidates to join the UNESCO list of more than 350 heritage art forms, which include a Mongolian coaxing ritual for camels and the Turkmen performance of stories about legendary hero Gorogly.\nThis year a whistled language unique to Turkey and a wall-decorating technique perfected by Saudi women also made the cut.\nImage: Mozzerella, tomato, basil and olive oil is a traditional topping The award -

S6 to me was like a minor chord in music that never truly resolved. It is terribly frustrating. Click to expand... That's a good way of putting it. Though I believe we did get Buffy back at the end - the very end, i.e. 'Chosen'. If you go back to the beginnings of her anxieties in S5, remember she's worried that being the Slayer is making her cold and heartless and that she can't say 'I love you' to Giles or Dawn in a genuine way. I think that her 'I love you' at the end of 'Chosen' can be seen as indicative of her recovery from that. We can argue back and forth about whether she meant it in a romantic or platonic way, but IMO the important thing was that she was able to genuinely say the words again with conviction, which was the resolution of the thread that had been running through from S5.\ndcai0830 said: \u2191 No. Grumble grumble. Click to expand... Hehe. I hear you. I'm not by any means trying to equate Buffy and Cordy's perceptions of Angel. Just meant that even Cordy (puttinng aside her lack of understanding of his dark side and the S4 crap for the purposes of thsi argument) saw him from a kind of 'now' perspective. Whatever else, she did think of him as a friend and a good person.\nGrace said: \u2191 I would need to rewatch to be sure, but my impression is that S6 and S7 suffered from the same problem, which is that they established some interesting concepts and then got stuck on them in the middle of the season, only to end with a big rush of events that didn't end up feeling quite earned. Having two seasons focusing on Buffy's isolation from the Scoobies and only really repairing it at the very end was pretty unsatisfying, although I do enjoy Chosen quite a bit. Maybe having the big rupture in Empty Places come earlier and allowing the ending to build more slowly would have helped. Click to expand... Yes, big complex ideas, questionable execution. Structure definitely seems to be an issue for those seasons.\nRomanticSoul said: \u2191 But she is human with a soul and any soulless vampire can't relate to the struggles we have because they literally lack the tools to do so.\nIt should have been Buffy with another human that struggles with their own darkness. A human would be able to understand why she is in her state and where it's coming from. Click to expand... No I think going to Spike made absolute sense as a metaphor. First of all he exists completely outside her friendship circle - in literal darkness - so the symbolism is obvious there. Spike doesn't fit in, and in S6 Buffy doesn't feel like she belongs either and so she uses him, like @BuffyBot22 says, as an escape.\nSecondly, it's not really about him relating to her state (it's clear that he doesn't truly understand), but him - even simply the image/idea of him - confronting her with her darker desires. As a vampire Spike enjoys the rush of the kill, and embraces that fine line between pleasure and pain. Since 'Dracula' Buffy's been aware (if not yet struggling) of the same sort of impulses that drive her. She does kill, and just as Faith points out, a part of her does enjoy it, so Spike by his very nature represents that part of her Slayerness that she has not yet come to terms with. I think 'Dead Things' distils the situation down to what its really about when she beats him up, calling him an evil 'thing'. She sees him as something monstrous, but fears that it in turn makes her monstrous for continuing to go back to him. The scene mirrors that with Faith in 'Who are You'.\nEntering that kind of relationship with a human just wouldn't have been possible because there's not way Buffy could have treated someone like that because:\nA) a human just wouldn't be able to take that kind of abuse on a physical level, unless perhaps it was another slayer\nB) there's no way would Buffy have been able to stay a hero in the eyes of the audience if she did. She got a lot of hate anyway for the way she treated Spike. No way could she do that with someone souled.\nC) Buffy is a good person and I don't think she would do that to another human - she can do that with Spike precisely because he is a soulless being. That's the crux of her dilemma in the season: she desires him, but knows he's evil. He can hit her and cause her pain and she both hates and physically enjoys it so she thinks there's something wrong with her, that she came back wrong. When she finds there's nothing physically or mystically 'wrong' it shatters her even more because it means she's doing these things entirely out of choice rather than by there being something missing from her, or controlling her. The previous morals she's held herself to are now completely broken down.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:26.024+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "28de1f11fbdd516dcba9c7c643f852176a88963a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSAgDui1SQTVZHI7PbRZcsgvqr90aCJJSKDVGUU1ommg_GiQ1sZbUKt79sbi.y4OylDR_Cjc2w.iA--", "site_full": "buffy-boards.com", "site": "buffy-boards.com", "site_section": "https://buffy-boards.com/forums/close-your-eyes-a-bangel-fan-club.374/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "investors_and_patents"], "section_title": "Close Your Eyes: A Bangel Fan Club | Buffy-Boards", "title": "The Spuffy Question", "title_full": "The Spuffy Question | Buffy-Boards", "published": "2017-12-06T16:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.018, "main_image": "https://buffy-boards.com/data/avatars/m/14/14125.jpg?1510252425", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "12d3ff8ba9943ebdb414610fc32c49f33be1ecfc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSAgDui1SQTVZHI7PbRZcsgvqr90aCJJSKDVGUU1ommg_GiQ1sZbUKt79sbi.y4OynZXDmETdyV0R67IpJcg9xs", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "dcai0830", "published": "2017-12-06T19:51:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "RomanticSoul said: \u2191 Her issues were all coming from that.

Not sure what if anything Angel had to do with that. I don't really understand her inability to say those words or how that relates to her humanity/slayer dynamic. But Christos seemed to talk about this in the s11 Q/A. He thinks those issues are now resolved with the spuffy ILY, which indicates that maybe there was some discussion from Joss/writers about how those issues were not previously resolved until to s11. I don't believe the Spuffy ILY in s7. I do believe the Spuffy ILY in s11 - hands down.

Subscribe 24/7 Live - Subscribe to the Pulse Newsletter! Back to Article news Dear Bukky, I am writing you from Ibadan. There is this girl I have been dating for 10 months now who I have caught in series of lies. Most are caught due to the fact that I checked her phone and after some reflections on my part I've decided it's not the best thing to do and I want to stop doing so. But I'm afraid of going to bed while there is fire on my roof. Example of such lies are: she cleared chats with a guy she claims has interest in dating her after I told her not to clear chats as it makes it seem like she's hiding something from me. Without asking her she told me her dad subscribed for her, but I later discovered that her lecturer who studies abroad did that for her. She claimed to be talking to her brother on WhatsApp call after her not picking my calls, only for me to discover that she was actually video calling this same lecture. She also lied about number of people she's dated without me asking about them in the first place. As much as most of these things she lied about are insignificant, I\u2019m still afraid of trusting her fully. I love her deeply and she was remorseful and apologized for her action. I hope not checking her phone won't come back to bite me in the ass. Dear reader, I think it is not enough to be sorry for being untruthful. You can\u2019t remain in the relationship just because she shows remorse every time she lies. I admire a forgiving spirit and having one is actually great. But there\u2019s only so much forgiveness one can do. Her remorse is incomplete and her apologies hollow if she\u2019s just going to turn around and repeat the same thing every time. Yes, what she\u2019s lying about might be insignificant but the act of lying is not. Constant, willful dishonesty is not something you want to overlook in a partner. About checking her phone, I think you should stay off that. What you don\u2019t know won\u2019t kill you. I know that\u2019s going to be difficult given how the seed of distrust has been sown by the things you saw earlier but just try to stay off her phone. However, keep your eyes open. I advise you stay in the relationship with the hope of change and also with a readiness to bolt if it turns out that she has refused to change. Don\u2019t be too blind to things that you\u2019ll regret later.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dear bukky", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "ibadan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:26.037+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9ec3e3a9f54ce9bbea5eb1c99c8d255cb90bd69e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRaOz_gjtpUmMsya5mFvNmrUqAIPItUJ973b4kHjTQHV7INelFuWcEK_WmNFnW_PwJKrfpNeSe.4m5diUnru4v5PnkkgBTksEk-", "site_full": "www.flyertalk.com", "site": "flyertalk.com", "site_section": "https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/trip-reports-177/", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Trip Reports - FlyerTalk Forums", "title": "Sarajevo To Dubrovnik", "title_full": "Sarajevo To Dubrovnik - FlyerTalk Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T08:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5203, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4cdf860db1e193a289ba7b2ec8ca35b0bb0eae06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRaOz_gjtpUmMsya5mFvNmrUqAIPItUJ973b4kHjTQHV7INelFuWcEK_WmNFnW_PwJKrfpNeSe.4m5diUnru4v5k2bJsH9NJlI.hQyuE_45UG7pDuNmEq9b", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "DanielW", "published": "2017-12-06T08:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Fluffy white clouds below as we make our way west.\nSarajevo International Airport (SJJ) was relatively small and we were the only flight disembarking on arrival.
