Together with this team the\ncandidate will develop new methods to compute close approximations\nof the Graph edit distance on large graphs. This research activity will\nbe based on a formulation of the Graph edit distance as the minimization \nof a quadratic functional. From this point of view, the Graph edit \ndistance is quite similar to error correcting graph matching. The\ncandidate will be encouraged to propose his own improvements of this\nexisting framework. Possible research directions, include the design\nof efficient parallel bipartite graph matching methods (to be included\nin quadratic minimization schemes) and proposals of new quadratic\nminimization schemes.

It displayed some great examples of items that can be reused and recycled. \nPupils and staff attended the CRNS conference at Dunblane to receive their award from conference host Fred MacAulay. \nChairman of Highland Council\u2019s people committee, Councillor Alasdair Christie, said: \"Well done to Applecross Primary for their wonderful video which displays creative ideas on reusing and recycling in a fun way. They are an inspiration to us all.\" \nThe CRNS third schools challenge tasked both primary and secondary schools throughout Scotland with creating and producing a brief commercial explaining the difference between reuse and recycle to the general public. \nCRNS asked pupils to imagine this commercial was going to be aired during prime time television on a Saturday evening, and their aim was to get their message over clearly to viewers so that those watching understood the difference. \nHead teacher, Robert Gill said: \"I am so proud of all our pupils. This was a great opportunity for them, learning about the environment and how we can reuse and recycle. \n\"Creating the video covered so many aspects of the wider curriculum and it was a great experience for them going to Dunblane to receive their prize from Fred MacAulay. \n\"I would like to thank our Teacher Tom O\u2019Halloran for all his hard work alongside the children in developing their skills in planning, filming and editing such a creative piece of work. \n\"Both Tom and the pupils have shown how a small, but strong school with a brilliant community spirit and support can achieve great things.\" \nHe added: \"The children have now decided to use the prize money to buy a more sophisticated video camera, where they can develop the use of digital film as a really powerful and fun way to learn. \n\"They will add sound next time with the purchase also of a microphone!\" \nThe youngsters\u2019 commercial has been uploaded to YouTube and can be viewed at www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiLO7RwwsIY&feature=youtu.be", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hector mackenzie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "applecross", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alasdair christie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wester ross", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom o\u2019halloran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred macaulay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert gill", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "highland council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "applecross primary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "dunblane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:16.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0b4e9cc32ead222bfa07d139a8c17ba940708afb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jeLg99X3y7GVVDwW.65pMp3IKGN35yV.xB8yfklpvMXHOA6sKgfU9AOch.NisE7yEE-", "site_full": "cdn.appshopper.com", "site": "appshopper.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "App Shopper: Foz do Iguacu Travel Guide (Navigation)", "title_full": "App Shopper: Foz do Iguacu Travel Guide (Navigation)", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.127, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19807, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0b4e9cc32ead222bfa07d139a8c17ba940708afb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jeLg99X3y7GVVDwW.65pMp3IKGN35yV.xB8yfklpvMXHOA6sKgfU9AOch.NisE7yEE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "App Shopper: Foz do Iguacu Travel Guide (Navigation)", "text": "Foz do Iguacu Travel Guide iOS Universal Own Wish Buy Buy * Universal compact app for iPhone 6 / iPhone 6 Plus / iPhone 5 / iPhone / iPod / iPadFOZ DO IGUACU OFFLINE TRAVEL GUIDE with attractions, museums, restaurants, bars, hotels, theaters and shops with TRAVELER REVIEWS and RATINGS, pictures, rich travel info, prices and opening hours.

The opposition meanwhile said that a vote on the matter was rushed through the D\u00e1il in a \u201cdeeply cynical\u201d move. \nSo, today we\u2019re asking you: Do you want Ireland to sign up to the EU defence deal? \nPoll Results:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sean murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pesco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cabinet", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:16.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b1db8e10004e34926aae471cb88ce4395e0aaca1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQIBHA4FFAxs5n9r7daKeqMkG5Vluw_HB7xrGHdGp8CbI1Jm1cY.5Wdel61ptro2Oh0EukQ3fxRR3v6vvS268JBVNjtyaQuxV3.hjQ2CdQdeKG4CgfRlao7.eD9WKwZi8sXFEx0Z1LBJA--", "site_full": "tanzaniajobs.club", "site": "tanzaniajobs.club", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["job_search", "jobs"], "section_title": "", "title": "Assistant Professor in Medical Statistics and Epidemiology (Mwanza, Tanzania) | Tanzania Jobs Club", "title_full": "Assistant Professor in Medical Statistics and Epidemiology (Mwanza, Tanzania) | Tanzania Jobs Club", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.888, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b1db8e10004e34926aae471cb88ce4395e0aaca1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQIBHA4FFAxs5n9r7daKeqMkG5Vluw_HB7xrGHdGp8CbI1Jm1cY.5Wdel61ptro2Oh0EukQ3fxRR3v6vvS268JBVNjtyaQuxV3.hjQ2CdQdeKG4CgfRlao7.eD9WKwZi8sXFEx0Z1LBJA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Assistant Professor in Medical Statistics and Epidemiology (Mwanza, Tanzania) | Tanzania Jobs Club", "text": "Login to bookmark this Job \nLocation : Mwanza infections, and other conditions of public health importance, in Tanzania.

Google collaborated with MediaTek to ensure that Android Oreo (Go edition) works well on its line of processors, enabling a faster time-to-market mechanism for device manufacturers, and ensuring a quality Android smartphone experience that is both secure and affordable for devices with 512MB to 1GB of memory. This marks one of the first times that entry-level SoCs are ready to be used shortly after the latest version of Android, in this case Android 8.1 Oreo, has been released to the Android Open Source Project. \nWith Android Oreo (Go edition), Google has optimized its OS platform, first party apps and the Google Play\u2122 Store to improve the capabilities of entry level devices. Limited processing power and storage are top pain points for entry-level device users. Android Oreo (Go edition) was created to not only address these issues, but to also ensure that the devices are secure and that users have more control over data usage. \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) leverages the existing Google Play Store ecosystem to deliver apps that run smoothly on low memory devices. This improves the overall user experience with, and support for, devices that have 512MB to 1GB of memory, which results in significant bill of materials (BOM) cost savings. These savings enable device makers to provide the 400 million users who buy entry-level smartphones every year, a better option. \n\u201cEntry-level devices are the gateway to the internet for many people, and we want to make sure everyone has a great experience when they use these devices,\u201d said Sameer Samat, VP of Product Management, Android & Google Play. \u201cWe\u2019re excited that Android Oreo (Go edition) will significantly improve storage, performance, data management, and security.\u201d \n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement builds upon our existing work with Google, including our recent collaboration on Google\u2019s GMS Express to speed up the certification process,\u201d said TL Lee, General Manager of MediaTek\u2019s Wireless Communication business unit. \u201cWith Android Oreo (Go edition), we are partnering with Google to tackle the performance challenges of lower memory phones, improving the user experience of entry level smartphones for consumers in key markets across India, the Middle East & Africa, Latin America and South East Asia.\u201d \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) leverages MediaTek\u2019s acclaimed turnkey references and chipsets that are designed specifically to reduce product development time and compliance testing. A wide range of MediaTek SoC\u2019s supports Android Oreo (Go edition), including the MT6739 and MT6737 for 4G devices, as well as the MT6580 for 3G devices. This gives device makers the range of capabilities they need to develop devices for specific price points and markets. \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) smartphones powered by MediaTek will be available in world-wide market by Q1, 2018. \nFor more information about the program, please explore: https://www.android.com/ \n*Google, Android, and Google Play are trademarks of Google LLC. \nAbout MediaTek Inc.

The incident occurred in 2013 during a Denver stopover on the singer's Red tour when Denver DJ David Mueller assaulted Swift by grabbing her backside during a backstage meet-and-greet. \"I figured that if he would be brazen enough to assault me under these risky circumstances and high stakes, imagine what he might do to a vulnerable, young artist if given the chance,\" the 27-year-old told TIME. \"It was important to report the incident to his radio station because I felt like they needed to know.\" \"When I testified, I had already been in court all week and had to watch this man's attorney bully, badger and harass my team including my mother over inane details and ridiculous minutiae, accusing them, and me, of lying,\" she told the magazine. \"My mom was so upset after her cross-examination, she was physically too ill to come to court the day I was on the stand. I was angry. In that moment, I decided to forego any courtroom formalities and just answer the questions the way it happened.

After the 2017 legislative success of LB 88, which removed hurdles in over 30 areas of employment for military spouses and included other supportive legislation for our military community, Blood has been motivated to create new legislation to continue to remove barriers to employment and create policy that supports the well-being of service members and their families. \n\u201cIt is important to highlight the base\u2019s estimated 1.7 billion local economic impact on our surrounding communities and why we must work hard to keep this base here in Nebraska,\u201d stated Senator Blood. \u201cAs we look to make Nebraska one of the most military-friendly states, we must also continue to enact and revise legislation covering licensure and employment protection, consumer protection, family law, child care and protection, voting, education, healthcare, state judicial systems and disposition of human remains. Some of these issues do not require legislation, but need active partnerships with outside organizations to make it happen. This is a bipartisan issue that we should all be able to support and move through the process without hesitation.\u201d \nThis initiative includes the following: Military Civil Relief Consumer Protection Act Physical Therapists Interstate Compact Advanced Practice Registered Nurses Compact Military Spouse Realtors Licensing Accommodation Military Medicaid Waiver (for transitioning special needs military family members not covered by TRICARE) Military Spouse Attorneys Licensing Accommodation (Initiated process with Nebraska Supreme Court-See OWH Midlands Voices 11/29/17) Pro bono legal representation for service members and families (Working with Nebraska Non-Profit to provide these services) Military Representation on Certain State Boards and Councils that pertain to mental health and early childhood development councils (Working with Nebraska organizations to encourage Military presence on these types of boards/councils) \n\u201cI know this is a very bold initiative, but it is only the tip of the iceberg of what we can and need to do here in Nebraska,\u201d Blood explains. \u201cWe talk a LOT about the next round of BRAC and we need to remember that part of that formula is not just about the runway and missions, although a paramount factor, but also about how we embrace and protect our service members and their families. I have a fire in my belly and will continue to push for these types of policies over the course of my tenure in the legislature.\u201d \nSenator Blood has been working closely with the USA4Military Families Department of Defense State Liaison Office since June 2017 to insure that Nebraska Legislation is competitive with other states and to craft the most effective legislation possible. \nLearn more about this DOD program at: http://usa4families.militaryonesource.mil \nFor Additional Information: \nSenator Carol Blood, Dist. 3 \nNebraska Legislature", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "initi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "carol blood", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "military families initiative   03:32 am est district", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "nebraska legislation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nebraska legislature", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "military representation on certain state boards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nebraska supreme court-see owh midlands voices", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa4military families department of defense state liaison office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dod", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "nebraska", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:17.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f91f37c96e8d14beee233df90b4d5b9253443708", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtbLXzObJGQpp.93ISAF8bP", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/lgbt/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/lgbt/ - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, &amp; Transgender - 4chan", "title": "Repression success?", "title_full": "/lgbt/ - Repression success? - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T10:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 36, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5852426ff4a931866b03ed5389484f7ea2c399ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pM8XOAg6dqUtbLXzObJGQpqLPNx2pz0rAT0R9mY0GSac-", "ord_in_thread": 34, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T13:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>9250978\n>>9250961\nI'm 23", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:17.036+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5de4208f03de6fc1c71479231841b78dedf9aecb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQFWjyhRV5eYiL4pPUjNQwkCIdmFXHrOO1SGXv6.ECrKmWTROq1Hbf37gl1Q_9Ge7JZISLoK0Wa0bhiLm_3lKe2VInPgdoqJvLqzrw7.9VrP5a5e9pAxh_4zBY.5AY4BLM-", "site_full": "bestlovedsite.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://bestlovedsite.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "How Hiring Agencies are Helping Companies with its Staffing Needs \u2013 bestlovedsite", "title": "How Hiring Agencies are Helping Companies with its Staffing Needs", "title_full": "How Hiring Agencies are Helping Companies with its Staffing Needs", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5de4208f03de6fc1c71479231841b78dedf9aecb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQFWjyhRV5eYiL4pPUjNQwkCIdmFXHrOO1SGXv6.ECrKmWTROq1Hbf37gl1Q_9Ge7JZISLoK0Wa0bhiLm_3lKe2VInPgdoqJvLqzrw7.9VrP5a5e9pAxh_4zBY.5AY4BLM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "royloves", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "How Hiring Agencies are Helping Companies with its Staffing Needs", "text": "Does your company needs short-term or long-term resources or team members? Most of the employers think that \u201cgood resource is hard to find\u201d because, nowadays finding right fit for company is challenging and time consuming due to high competition. Employers can make the hiring process simple with the help of staffing or hiring agencies. Hiring solutions come in all sizes like full time, temporary or contract based etc. Whatever your hiring needs, a professional hiring agency helps you with filling up the vacancies by providing you highly skilled professionals. There are many recruitment and staffing agencies providing services throughout the world like CIEL HR , Teamlease etc in the market to help companies with their staffing needs. \n \nWondering how hiring agencies are helping companies with its staffing needs? \n\nThe working principle of these agencies varies from agency to agency. \nProvide full time employees In case clients requires a full time resource, Agencies provide them the required support. Agencies will post job offers and they hire suitable employees as per clients requirement and provides to clients. Companies gives full benefits to the employee in case of permanent employees, this can vary for fixed-term contracts. \nProvide temporary employees In case of temporary or short term projects, companies need to hire temporary employees. In Such case, companies need to hire on flexible basis. Here staffing agencies can help these companies by providing flex staffs with high skill set. \nHere, clients make a contract with employees and pay them based on the amount of time employees work. For example, CIEL HR provides Flex staff with varied skill-sets on its payroll across multiple locations. \nContract based employees Hiring agencies also provide contract based employees based on client\u2019s requirement. Contract based employees are hired for a specific job at a specific rate of pay. A contract employee does not become a regular addition to the staff and is not considered as a permanent one. \n \nTo provide permanent staffing, temporary staffing or contract employee, first the agency need to post job opening to get more suitable candidates resume. Next the expert professionals from the agencies will find candidates with suitable skill for the job. Selection procedure also vary from agency to agency. Staffing agencies reduce the gap between job seekers and employers by providing them end to end support and assistance. These HR agencies makes both employers and employees happy with their standardised services.

On Wednesday, Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to take that position, capping a steady, if unlikely, evolution for a billionaire who had no experience dealing with the perilous politics of the Mideast when he first launched his presidential bid. The decision reflects the influence of powerful allies in Trump's inner circle, including Vice President Mike Pence and Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, men determined to coach Trump on the issue and its importance to conservative Jews and evangelical Christians. It comes despite widespread criticism from allies in the Middle East and Europe, and concerns from some members of his own Cabinet. \"Today we finally acknowledge the obvious: that Jerusalem is Israel's capital,\" Trump said from the White House. \"This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It's something that has to be done.\" LATEST SFGATE VIDEOS Behind the scenes: \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" sfgate Star Wars: The Last Jedi (official trailer) sfgate Muni bus and streetcar collide sfgate Time lapse of Bay Area traffic sfgate Mountain lion and kitten spotted for first time since fire sfgate Santa Rosa firefighters headed south to fight LA blaze sfgate The best views in Russian Hill sfgate Ventura resident shows view of massive fire sfgate Oakland city workers go on strike sfgate Smoke from Creek Fire smothers Lake View Terrace in Los Angeles sfgate It is not something any other president has followed through on, despite similar campaign promises. Trump was drawn to the idea of breaking with that presidential precedent, seeing the chance to issue an order that both his predecessor Barack Obama, a frequent Trump target, and previous Republican presidents were reluctant to issue, according to two advisers familiar with the president's thinking. Administration officials are braced for blowback but insisted the move would not upend efforts to forge peace between Israelis and Palestinians. But Trump's gambit appeared to be driven less by diplomatic strategy and more by the president's wishes to fulfill a campaign promise that was hard to imagine two years ago. Appearing before a forum organized by the Republican Jewish Coalition, an influential lobbying group largely funded by Adelson, Trump was asked a delicate, but predictable, diplomatic question: Did he believe Jerusalem was the undivided capital of Israel? The presidential candidate, who prided himself on candor and straight talk, dodged. \"You know what I want to do? I want to wait until I meet with Bibi,\" Trump said, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A smattering of boos erupted from the audience. But as Trump's candidacy took off, he began courting pro-Israel American Jews and evangelical Christians. Adelson, a Las Vegas casino magnate, consistently raised the topic in nearly all of his phone calls and meetings with the president, according to a person with knowledge of the Trump team's thinking. In 2016, Trump indeed vowed to recognize Israel's claim to Jerusalem and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv, aligning himself with most mainstream Republican presidential hopefuls. Other influential voices urged Trump to follow through on that promise in the final months of the campaign and after the election, including Pence. The person familiar with the Trump team's thinking also called David Friedman, who worked as a lawyer for Trump before becoming U.S. ambassador to Israel, an \"unsung hero\" in keeping the process on track. During the presidential transition, Trump and his advisers discussed making an announcement on Jerusalem and the status of the U.S. Embassy on Inauguration Day or shortly thereafter. One option Trump advisers discussed was converting the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem into an embassy and having Friedman work from that post, while keeping the bulk of U.S. officials in the much larger facility in Tel Aviv, according to aides. But the Trump team backed down amid intense pressure from the State Department and Pentagon, where career officials raised alarms about the prospect that it would inflame the Middle East, according to a person familiar with the discussions. In subsequent months, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defense James Mattis continued to urge caution, according to U.S. officials. The officials, Trump aides and the person familiar with the team's thinking all insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the internal deliberations. Aides said the issue never fell off the president's radar. Steve Bannon, his former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. Conservative faith leaders, like Faith & Freedom founder Ralph Reed, also pushed the cause to senior aides. Wednesday's announcement was praised by those who have been advocating for White House action. \"This sends a clear message, a very important message, that we will not allow threats of terrorism to determine policy. It's not just words this time,\" said Morton Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America. Trump's decision was immediately denounced by Palestinian Authority head Mahmoud Abbas, who said in a televised statement that the U.S. move \"is a declaration of withdrawal from the role it has played in the peace process.\" Trump officials recognized the risks to the peace process, but have made a deliberate calculation that the outrage will blow over and the impact will be limited. The U.S. officials most heavily engaged in the discussion are Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, and special envoy Jason Greenblatt, who has made multiple trips to the region. Both Kushner and Greenblatt supported the president's decision even though they anticipated it would upset the Arab world, according to a White House official. But because the men had already not anticipated presenting a plan until sometime next year, they believe the anger over Jerusalem could subside before negotiations begin, the official said. ___ Lemire reported from New York. ___ Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire and Pace at http://twitter.com/JPaceDC Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

DEWs are guns that produce a beam of concentrated electromagnetic power. There are basically two kinds of DEWs: top powered lasers and microwaves. DEWs are anti-personnel as they are able to purpose insupportable burning of a space within the frame and blindness, and anti-material as it may be used to wreck missiles, ships, UAVs and fry circuitry of kit deployed in a battlefield. \nWhile knowledge isn\u2019t to be had on whether or not India is growing microwave guns, DRDO examined a 1KW laser weapon system fixed on a truck at Chitradurga in Karnataka against August finish. \u201cThe laser beam hit a target located 250 metres away,\u201d an legit mentioned. \u201cIt took 36 seconds for it to make a hole in the metal sheet.\u201d The take a look at was once performed within the presence of then defence minister Arun Jaitley, the individual mentioned. \nThe subsequent step is to take a look at a upper powered laser, 2KW, fixed at the truck towards a steel sheet situated at a distance of one km. Two DRDO laboratories \u2014 Centre for High Energy Systems and Sciences (CHESS) and Laser Science & Technology Centre (LASTEC) \u2014 are recently running on growing the supply for producing the laser, officers mentioned. At provide, the supply of the laser, which is the \u201cheart of the system\u201d, is imported from Germany. \nOther demanding situations come with growing a cooling mechanism for the system that heats up when the laser beam is fired, making sure a centered beam against a far away goal and optoelectronics, or optronics, involving lenses to create that focal point, they mentioned. \u201cThe weapon is not ready yet and it will take years for it to happen,\u201d mentioned an legit. DRDO didn\u2019t formally reply to a questionnaire at the topic despatched by means of ET to it as of press time Wednesday. \nPrivate firms too are taking a look to input DEW house. A senior legit at Kalyani Group mentioned Kalyani Centre for Technology and Innovation is within the \u201cinitial stages\u201d of growing DEWs. \u201cWe are identifying two segments: \u2018lethality\u2019 to kill and \u2018survivability\u2019 aimed at destroying incoming missiles,\u201d the individual informed ET. \u201cWe will initially be working on the latter and are setting up a lab in Pune.\u201d \nRolls-Royce\u2019s world strategic advertising director Ben Story, in a dialog with ET had just lately mentioned that there are \u201cconversations\u201d taking place between the corporate and India on DEWs. \nA unencumber by means of Press Information Bureau again in December 2013 had showed that DRDO\u2019s CHESS and LASTEC had been researching on DEWs and laser generation, respectively. A 2015 DRDO bulletin titled \u2018Technology Focus\u2019 said that LASTEC with the assistance of a collaborator had advanced a unit of 1kW \u2018single mode fibre laser\u2019 and paintings was once on for growing 5kW and 9kW fibre laser assets. \nLASTEC has additionally advanced a 10kW Chemical Oxygen Iodine Laser (COIL) and is operating on growing a 30-100 kW vehicle-mounted COIL system, assets mentioned.

There are a number of options for the land including the delivery of a luxury retirement scheme, delivery of student housing, or working in partnership with local hospitals to provide either much needed office space, or a step-down facility, which allows patients to leave hospital but still receive full time medical care. \nThe development occupies one of London\u2019s most sought after sites, on the border of Regent\u2019s Park and adjacent to the world-famous Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground. Additionally, the Wellington Hospital Platinum Care Unit is less than 500 metres away. It benefits from excellent transport links with the West End easily reached by road and tube. \nSimon Brooks at Investec Structured Property Finance commented: \n\u201cDespite wider market uncertainty, we continue to be proactive in supporting our clients where they see opportunities. By leveraging our long-standing relationships, moving quickly and being innovative, we are able to offer clients both certainty and commerciality. \n\u201cThe opportunity to collaborate once again with Westbourne Capital Partners on this transaction complements this approach and we look forward to working with them to take the scheme forward through the planning process next year and delivering London another exciting development.\u201d \nJohnny Sandelson, Partner at Wellesbourne Capital Partners, added: \n\u201cWe are pleased to be acquiring a site which offers huge potential for a number of different land uses and which we are confident of being able to extract considerable value. The importance of having a Bank alongside us that really understands the intricacies of acquisition and planning finance is key on a scheme like this and Investec fits this bill perfectly.\u201d \nThis is the second WCP scheme that Investec has financed, having earlier this year provided a \u00a355mn facility for the development of 55 later life residential apartments and in excess of 30,000 sq ft of state of the art amenity space in Chelsea, South West London.

But it began, as great social change nearly always does, with individual acts of courage. \n'The actor who went public with the story of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein's \"coercive bargaining\"; in a Beverly Hills hotel suite two decades earlier. \n'The strawberry picker who heard that story and decided to tell her own. \n'The young engineer whose blog post about the frat-boy culture at Silicon Valley\u2019s highest-flying startup prompted the firing of its founder and 20 other employees. \n'The California lobbyist whose letter campaign spurred more than 140 women in politics to demand that state government \u201cno longer tolerate the perpetrators or enablers\u201d of sexual misconduct. \n'A music superstar\u2019s raw, defiant court testimony about the disc jockey who groped her.' \nTheir 'galvanizing actions,' he noted, 'along with those of hundreds of others, and of many men as well, have unleashed one of the highest-velocity shifts in our culture since the 1960s. Social media acted as a powerful accelerant; the hashtag #MeToo has now been used millions of times in at least 85 countries.' \nOn the cover of the Time POY edition are actor Ashley Judd, singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, Susan Fowler (who spoke out about the sexual harassment at Uber), farm hand Isabel Pascual (whose name was changed to protect her identity), lobbyist Adama Iwu and a strategically cropped arm. \nTime explained, 'It belongs to an anonymous young hospital worker from Texas -- a sexual harassment victim who fears that disclosing her identity would negatively impact her family. She is faceless on the cover and remains nameless inside TIME 's red borders, but her appearance is an act of solidarity, representing all those who are not yet able to come forward and reveal their identities.' \nMeet all the Time Person of the Year 'Silence Breakers'. Ashley Judd Actor Ashley Judd had spoken up against Harvey Weinstein's sexual misconduct towards her as soon as it happened in 1997. But no one listened then.That changed in October when she went on record -- the first big star to do so -- in the explosive The New York Times story exposing Weinstein. Photograph: @ashley_judd/Instagram Rose McGowan Artist and activist McGowan, along with Judd, was also one of the first famous people to come out against Weinstein; she has accused him of rape.There is much anger over the fact that she is missing from the Time POY cover. Photograph: @rosemcgowan/Instagram Selma Blair Actor When dozens of women accused director James Toback of sexual harassment -- which he denied -- Blair added her powerful voice to theirs.Since then, more than 300 women have spoken up against him. Photograph: @therealselmablair/Instagram Terry Crews Actor The Brooklyn Nine-Nine actor is suing his agent Adam Venit and the agency William Morris Endeavor for sexual assault.Crews has accused Venit of groping him at an industry event and has questioned why people have responded to the accusation by asking him why he didn't beat up Venit.'Why is nobody questioning him,' he said in his Time cover story interview. Photograph: @brooklyn99fox/Instagram Alyssa Milano Actor As the stories of sexual assault and harassment survivors began being told in October this year, it was Milano's tweet resurrecting the decade-old #MeToo hashtag that gave the movement its name.She tweeted, 'In 2017 women stood up and said #MeToo. We overcame our fears to #BreakTheSilence. Technology and social media have connected us all. We can\u2019t turn away from each other\u2019s pain. We are connected to it. We are connected to each other.' Photograph: @milano_alyssa/Instagram Tarana Burke Activist Having worked with survivors of sexual violence for decades, Burke created the Me Too movement in 2006. She hoped to encourage women to support each other and take the stigma of shame out of the equation.This year, her movement spread to all corners of the world.

Keep the personalities away from the issues", "text": "Negotiations \u2013 Separate the people from the problem \nVery often negotiations can get personal. Personal and therefore emotional. Once emotion creeps in the logical thinking process for a win win deal tends to go out of the window.\nThis is not helpful for the achievement of goals and people then start thinking about what they are going to get compared with what you are going to get.\nThe issue with this is that value is a perception and it is hard to value anything. Value is only what someone will pay for it at as given time.\nI have been involved in negotiations where the issue is valuing shares in private companies. The valuation will always be subjective and no matter what expert \u201cprofessional valuers\u201d, you bring in they will have different opinions. There are always different processes of valuing the business or the assets.\nA business could be valued on an annual multiple of profits, on a turnover basis or what similar businesses have changed hands for recently.\nSo if there is different interpretations of value, then the goals has to be to maximize the value for both parties and worked together to that goal. Rather than argue amongst each other, letting personal prejudices creep in and even jealousy.\nOften in partnership breakups this is what happens. People have got on for a number of years building a successful business. Then one of the party\u2019s life situation changes or one person has different ambitions to the other person and they fall out.\nThe most difficult issues can happens when marriages break up. I heard a story once where the main assets of the marriage were shares in a private company. So the valuation was a huge negotiation and a judgment. When they finally came of a settlement, the legal bills was \u00a3520,000 on assets of \u00a31.4million. Hardly a win win win.\nGetting hung up on what each other has done, and who is going to get what, rather than concentrating on the problem and trying to solve it.\nThe Negotiation Speaker \u2013 Mr Negotiator\nThe post #Negotiations.

Christensen, Patrick A. Tresco\nNerve cuffs have been used to anchor and protect penetrating electrodes in peripheral nerves and have been used as non-penetrating electrodes for neural recording and nerve stimulation. The material of choice for such applications is silicone, an inert synthetic biomaterial which elicits a minimal chronic foreign body response (FBR). While histological studies of solid silicone cuffs are available, to the best of our knowledge a comparison to other cuff designs is not well documented. Here, we describe the FBR and morphological changes that accompany nerve cuff implantation in the rat sciatic nerve by comparing a metallic mesh with and without a parylene coating to one made of silicone. Two months after implantation, we observed that such implants, irrespective of the cuff type, were associated with a persistent inflammatory response consisting of activated macrophages attached to the implant surfaces, which extended into the endoneurial space of the encapsulated nerve. We also observed foreign body giant cells in the epineurial space that were more prevalent in the mesh cohorts. The mesh cuff groups showed significant changes in several morphometric parameters that were not seen in the silicon group including reductions in nerve fiber packing density and a greater reduction of large diameter fibers. High magnification microscopy also showed greater evidence of foamy macrophages in the endoneurial space of the mesh implanted cohorts. Although the precise mechanisms are unknown, the results showed that mesh style nerve cuffs show a greater inflammatory response and had greater reductions in morphometric changes in the underlying nerve compared to silicone in the absence of a penetrating injury.Statement of SignificanceWhile traditional silicone cuffs have been in use for decades, the inflammatory and morphometric effects of these cuffs on the underlying nerve have not been deeply studied. Further, manipulation of the foreign body response to nerve cuffs by using various materials and/or designs has not been well reported. Therefore, we report the inflammatory response around nerve cuffs of various materials and designs, as well as report morphometric parameters of the underlying nerve. These data provide important information regarding the potential for quantitative morphometric changes associated with the use of nerve cuffs, and, importantly, suggests that these changes are associated with the degree of inflammation associated with the cuff.\n\nGraphical abstract \n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2k48lTg", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael b.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christensen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick a. tresco", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:22.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9da65223cc591025164096292e7a49f77acf85f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApu_XjOrbqzoWa1yo9sMHZ_ebm8qVtFqMjDrisa6J40zuOxAj9W9mkqL4vj2DE4EO67GlTVT_5Opjw--", "site_full": "masarucircus.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://masarucircus.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "MASARU CIRCUS\u3000\u9ad8\u9808\u8cc0\u512a", "title": "Today's dream 3", "title_full": "Today's dream 3", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "JP", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9da65223cc591025164096292e7a49f77acf85f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApu_XjOrbqzoWa1yo9sMHZ_ebm8qVtFqMjDrisa6J40zuOxAj9W9mkqL4vj2DE4EO67GlTVT_5Opjw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "\u9ad9\u9808\u8cc0\u512a Masaru TAKASUKA (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "Today's dream 3", "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2017.12.7) ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:22.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4f548f44639e462b5fc43dbcc421949fb7389f9d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpTs_AXppk.KNAZPjKZbHcOvkaU0QRAjlxsPWBXoIXS_f8yn2OlrQJ7I9FEDBegvm1HKKxSxznrJa6ADinlYxRDGmRT2GSqKznjVOPTSsGg9I4OXVJR_wrRhEfYi16pxFAM-", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "https://www.hotukdeals.com/tag/audiovisual?page=4\n", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Audiovisual Deals \u21d2 Cheap price, best Sale in UK - HotUKDeals - page 4", "title": "Wooden Headphones Bluetooth / wired \u00a323.99 @ Amazon - Sold by ADM-LC and Fulfilled by Amazon", "title_full": "Wooden Headphones Bluetooth / wired \u00a323.99 @ Amazon - Sold by ADM-LC and Fulfilled by Amazon - HotUKDeals", "published": "2017-12-04T00:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.011, "main_image": "https://images.hotukdeals.com/threads/thread_full_screen/default/2847117_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1864, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3f56b027f86ff59701c3aced14e47a256080ab1c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpTs_AXppk.KNAZPjKZbHcOvkaU0QRAjlxsPWBXoIXS_f8yn2OlrQJ7I9FEDBegvm1HKKxSxznrJa6ADinlYxRDGmRT2GSqKznjVOPTSsGg9I4OXVJR_wrRhqCS7CvL0ulZuRnCwy7iMdg--", "ord_in_thread": 10, "author": "webhose.io", "published": "2017-12-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Wood should help the bass of course.

If you're not ready (if you have to ask and know you're unconfident, that's the first red flag); why waste your time and money. It's around 60 quid for a test plus car fees (instructors will usually charge the equivalent of 2-3 hours; which SHOULD include a pre-test lesson to get all of the stupid out of your system). And if you fail (I hope not, no matter what you do, of course) then you're rebooking it from that point and that's a couple of months more at least. I'd move it to Feb personally whilst you still can; and get a new instructor immediately, if you're still not ready come mid-Jan, feb can become march. march can become april and so forth. My initial test was September, three weeks before my exam I didn't feel comfortable taking it and my instructor agreed with my decision to push it forward; wasn't money related, but he's got a good pass rate and he likes telling his students \"Got another pass today\" (which for me, was surprisingly motivating to hear; I'm sure after he dropped me back at work for the last time he told his next lesson about me). It is 100% worth the wait .\nIf you were fresh; whilst I hate intensive courses (they are designed to get you to pass, not to actually teach you to be a consistently safe driver) I would say ye, book it - but in your current situation I think it's a waste. @TheTree0fDeath 's idea I think is perfect.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anygy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:22.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2e5a921653e85e6d91150c52e01446dc2a494a5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSFJYSGeCRgENBJKgpnuluWeqi2g9mw7IAvxRnNp7d4IpQV8fQ6tc8MKfoc0f8hy6VZaTKjDdfGRg--", "site_full": "forums.realgm.com", "site": "realgm.com", "site_section": "https://forums.realgm.com/boards/viewforum.php?f=19", "site_categories": ["pro_ice_hockey", "pro_basketball", "football", "sports", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Los Angeles Lakers - RealGM", "title": "Can someone clear-up our draft situation", "title_full": "Can someone clear-up our draft situation - RealGM", "published": "2017-12-06T02:44:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10264, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a82ab3c2443c1f7861646bf70653445c82d6256e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSFJYSGeCRgENBJKgpnuluWeqi2g9mw7IAvxRnNp7d4IpQV8fQ6tc8MKfoc0f8hy6VwXjitiYR98JGl7MEiv5EI", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "TylersLakers", "published": "2017-12-07T12:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Sedale Quote: : It's the freaking Celtics.
