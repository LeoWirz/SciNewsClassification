In 2014 major Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange MtGox collapsed after admitting that 850,000 coins -- worth around $480 million at the time -- had disappeared from its vaults.Agence France-Presse", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shane chanel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris weston", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "chicago mercantile exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asr wealth advisers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg news.the", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:10:10.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2063ed2accbcc3d2b1585d9f1a87e3629f3ff5f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21S6w.Bs1b1HaqL.cV6CmJbCKzs_vgefnjAulQ3E7HmWgiNnHxRGMbus9wfgEtdvv1R169Y2MNsKZ61ci9xdrG3S", "site_full": "arthurpewtysmaggotsandwich.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://arthurpewtysmaggotsandwich.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Arthur Pewty's maggot sandwich", "title": "Plastic.", "title_full": "Plastic.", "published": "2017-12-03T14:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "37d2b5f446cf62c7e267e991766222c8398d8773", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21S6w.Bs1b1HaqL.cV6CmJbCKzs_vgefnjAulQ3E7HmWgiNnHxRGMbus9wfgEtdvv1R169Y2MNsKZ4jEbC92Iw8OCk8ri1zure0-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T11:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "As a resident of Bexleyheath, who uses the Broadway as a pedestrian, car driver and user of public transport, I have to disagree with the view that the shared space (phase 1) has been a disaster.

(photo courtesy of Chabad of the Miracle Mile) \n\u201cIt was a great struggle for religious freedom,\u201d said Rabbi David Baron, of Beverly Hills Temple of the Arts. \u201cThey essentially outfought the Greeks and restored the worship of the Jewish people at the Temple.\u201d \nBaron said the lighting of the menorah is directly related to a miracle that occurred at the temple, in which the Maccabees only had enough oil to light their lamps for one day but the oil miraculously lasted for eight days \u2013 enough time to produce more oil. The special menorah used during Hanukkah has nine candles, with the extra candle used to light the others. \nBaron said Hanukkah has many other traditions, including eating fried foods because they are cooked in oil, like latkes and jelly doughnuts. \nChildren play Hanukkah games including spinning dreidels, which are four-sided tops. Hanukkah customs include gift giving, such as chocolate coins known as gelt. \n\u201cBut the greatest gift is the kindling of the menorah and understanding its meaning,\u201d Baron added. \nBeverly Hills Temple of the Arts is holding a community Hanukkah celebration on Friday, Dec. 15, at 8 p.m. at the Saban Theatre, which is owned by the temple. The free celebration includes a Shabbat service led by Baron and music by Klezmer Juice. Latkes and jelly doughnuts will be served. \nThe Chabad of the Miracle Mile is also inviting the community to a Hanukkah celebration on Sunday, Dec. 17, from 3 to 5 p.m. near the clock tower at the Original Farmers Market, corner of Third and Fairfax. The temple has hosted the event for the past 13 years. It includes the construction and lighting of a large LEGO menorah, traditional food and games, and a Hanukkah sing-along. \n\u201cIt\u2019s about community and unity,\u201d said Baily Fischer, co-director of Chabad of the Miracle Mile. \u201cIt\u2019s about bringing more light into the world.\u201d \nRepresentatives of the Original Farmers Market said they were pleased to host Hanukkah activities. \n\u201cWe love hosting this annual Hanukkah celebration for the community and appreciate our long-standing partnership with the Miracle Mile Chabad,\u201d said Ilysha Buss, director of marketing for the Original Farmers Market.

On account of the development of capnography equipment navigated by technology, most players operating in the market could be involved in conducting research-related tasks. This has been anticipated to help them manufacture novel offerings to attend to the swiftly-changing needs of end users. \nAccording to the market intelligence publication penned by TMR, the global capnography equipment market could attain a valuation of US$615.6 mn by the end of 2020. Sidestream capnographs, a sub-classification by product, have been predicted to register a noteworthy growth in the market for capnography equipment. On the regional front, North America could have an upper hand in the market, taking in view its sizable share achieved in the recent past. \nRead Report overview @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/capnography-market.html \nTechnological Transformation Promotes Reliability and Efficacy of Capnography Equipment \nThe authors of the report have identified some crucial factors of growth deemed significant for the world capnography equipment market. Over the course of a past few years, there is a weighty trend taking shape in the market that signifies the progressively sophisticated nature of capnography equipment. The transformation to improved functions has been expected to have set the tone for their increased reliability and efficacy. Capnographs have always been a vital component of essential health monitoring tools that are engaged during anesthesia or intensive care. A capnogram could be put in place to measure the level of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood and also the exhaled and inhaled concentration of the gas. \nMore factors have been envisaged to be responsible for a tangible growth in the world capnography equipment market in the near future. A wide scope of regulatory guidelines related to sedation procedures have already been introduced by government bodies and the medical sector. This could augur well for the marker to record a healthy growth rate. Furthermore, the demand for effective treatment options amid the growing prevalence of respiratory ailments has been projected to enhance the growth rate of the market. \nInexpensive Replacements Barricade Rise in Demand for Capnography Equipment \nDespite all the support received from favorable growth factors, the international capnography equipment market has been foreseen to be hindered by a slack in demand. This could be due to the accessibility to low-priced alternatives to capnographs such as pulse oximeters. The availability of substitutes at a cheaper amount has been forecasted to obstruct the market to reach a higher growth rate. \nHowever, such restraints of the international capnography equipment market could be held at bay by taking advantage of worthwhile business opportunities developing in the less developed nations of Asia Pacific and Latin America. The emerging economies of the world have been continually struggling with respiratory illnesses such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This could open up new prospects for capnography equipment manufacturers. Apart from the commanding product type market, i.e. sidestream capnographs, microstream capnographs could increase the demand for capnography equipment on the back of multiple advantages such as their use in neonatal and non-intubated patient care. \nRequest Sample Report@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag\u2026 \nThe information presented in this review is based on a TMR report, titled, \u201cCapnography Equipment Market (Product \u2013 Capnographs (Mainstream Capnographs, Sidestream Capnographs, and Microstream Capnographs) and Disposables; End User \u2013 Hospitals and Ambulatories) \u2013 Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2014 \u2013 2020.\u201d \nAbout TMR \nTransparency Market Research (TMR) is a global market intelligence company providing business information reports and services.

Being a mm or two too far out would make life very difficult on some systems . I used an ODK14 on which it was vital to have the OAG as far in as possible since, with the restricted FOV from a 2.4 metre focal length, finding guide stars could sometimes be marginal. The fact that we were using a full frame sensor also pushed the OAG further out of the light cone.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:10:10.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "63aacf34e43b44879f9ff22f26db7310a21a8136", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqa1FEjeW2baoziLEWcOYh347Plt1w7N9a6CiA1nk0RRCsnh2XI9gFESdBqIRJMGgsVGwoVz3Na8HYnfIN93NqzHVDHudsErSPDNUTrSOFd7Iuo8PbY9S3x5VIvMnwl2XxmgixxRH2aeA--", "site_full": "bizpr.us", "site": "bizpr.us", "site_section": "http://bizpr.co/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BizPR.us | US Free Press Release and Distribution center", "title": "Global Acetaminophen Market Analysis \u2013 Size, Trends, Opportunities and Forecast Report 2017", "title_full": "Global Acetaminophen Market Analysis \u2013 Size, Trends, Opportunities and Forecast Report 2017", "published": "2017-12-07T12:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://bizpr.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Market-Research-HUB-4.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "63aacf34e43b44879f9ff22f26db7310a21a8136", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqa1FEjeW2baoziLEWcOYh347Plt1w7N9a6CiA1nk0RRCsnh2XI9gFESdBqIRJMGgsVGwoVz3Na8HYnfIN93NqzHVDHudsErSPDNUTrSOFd7Iuo8PbY9S3x5VIvMnwl2XxmgixxRH2aeA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "vivek49491", "published": "2017-12-07T12:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "Global Acetaminophen Market Analysis \u2013 Size, Trends, Opportunities and Forecast Report 2017", "text": "2 Manufacturing Cost Structure Analysis of Acetaminophen 2.1 Raw Material and Suppliers 2.2 Manufacturing Cost Structure Analysis of Acetaminophen 2.3 Manufacturing Process Analysis of Acetaminophen 2.4 Industry Chain Structure of Acetaminophen \n3 Technical Data and Manufacturing Plants Analysis of Acetaminophen 3.1 Capacity and Commercial Production Date of Global Acetaminophen Major Manufacturers in 2016 3.2 Manufacturing Plants Distribution of Global Acetaminophen Major Manufacturers in 2016 3.3 R&D Status and Technology Source of Global Acetaminophen Major Manufacturers in 2016 3.4 Raw Materials Sources Analysis of Global Acetaminophen Major Manufacturers in 2016 \nContinue\u2026. \nEnquire About This Report: https://www.marketresearchhub.com/enquiry.php?type=enquiry&repid=1393642 \nAbout Market Research Hub: \nMarket Research Hub (MRH) is a next-generation reseller of research reports and analysis.

Chazama: Committees would also be dealing with border conflicts \nThe resolution was made Tuesday during the 11th session of Mozambique and Malawi Joint Permanent Commission on Defence and Security (JPCDS) held in Mangochi this week. \nMalawi\u2019s Minister of Home Affairs and Internal Security, Cecilia Chazama, told journalists that the committees would also be dealing with border conflicts which sometimes affect economic activities of the two countries along the border lines. \n\u201cWe would want to have committees in neighbouring districts both at local and higher levels just to ensure that conflicts or issues that arise from the two sides of the border line are resolved amicably with speed,\u201d the minister said. \nShe added the two governments also tackled issues of immigration, border reaffirmation and cross border crimes. \nMozambican National Defence Minister, Atanasio Salvador Mtumuke, said the meeting had consolidated the two countries\u2019 bilateral relations, adding that it also accorded the two countries opportunity to discuss issues surrounding the water bodies shared between the two countries. \n\u201cMost of the issues have been discussed but on the border reaffirmation, our two sub commissions, dealing with the matter will finalize everything by this December,\u201d said Mtumuke. \nThe resolutions made during the meeting are expected to be implemented soon. The two governments also condemned the ritual attacks on bald-headed people, persons with albinism, and those suspected to be bloodsuckers which the two countries witnessed recently.

Powerful Ways People Connected in 2017 By 0 SHARE \nFacebook has announced its 2017 Year in Review, highlighting the most powerful ways people came together on Facebook to support one another. \nFirst, people came together to react and talk about important moments and events that happened around the world. These top three moments that people discussed globally in 2017 were: \nInternational Women\u2019s Day : This was the No. 1 most talked about moment in 2017, doubling from last year, with people around the world talking, sharing and posting in celebration of women and related issues. \nSuper Bowl 51 : Fans around the world turned to News Feed to cheer for their favourite teams, celebrate with Lady Gaga and debate the top TV ads, with more than 262 million views of Super Bowl-related videos on the platform. \nLas Vegas Violence : This tragic incident drove conversation around the world, which in turn motivated more than 3,300 people to offer help to their community through our Crisis Response tools on Facebook. \nSecond, people came together to support one another in times of crisis. 2017 was a difficult year with natural disasters and violence around the world, but it was inspiring to see people help each other when they needed it most. The top three moments where people came to each other\u2019s aid on Facebook were: \nEarthquake in Mexico : The response to this crisis in late September drove the highest number of total interactions within Crisis Response on Facebook of the year, with millions of people marking themselves safe, offering help to their communities or donating to the cause. \nHurricane Harvey : In late August, the community rallied to help those in need by raising more than $20 million in the biggest fundraising effort for a single crisis in 2017 on Facebook. \nOne Love Manchester : The most viewed video and live broadcast on Facebook in 2017, this benefit concert generated over 80 million views and raised more than $450,000 for those affected by the Manchester terror attack. \nFinally, people used Facebook to get together in person. The top two ways people connected through these offline moments by creating Events on Facebook were: \nTotal Solar Eclipse : This celestial moment in August brought the world together through more than 20,000 Facebook Events in more than 80 countries. \nWomen\u2019s March on DC : On January 21, The Women\u2019s March on DC brought over 500,000 people together through the largest Facebook event for a single cause in 2017. \nYour Year In Review \nFacebook also wants to create a Year In Review for you. Starting Wednesday, you may see a personalized video in your News Feed. This video includes moments from this past year that you\u2019ve shared or been tagged in, and compiles them in a short video that can be edited and shared. You can access your video by visiting facebook.com/yearinreview . \nMethodology \nThe top moments of this year\u2019s Year In Review were determined by gathering a list of the top keywords by volume mentioned in a single day on Facebook between January 1st and November 1st, 2017. To identify which topics were unique to 2017, Facebook compared these keywords to the previous year\u2019s maximum single-day volume. \nThis means that keywords such as Mother\u2019s Day and Halloween, which typically represent the top moments every year, do not repeatedly appear at the top of the list Pls Share", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lady gaga", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "share  facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "review  facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook events", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "manchester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:10:12.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "55cf28980ef7fc98442d5f02b9c4a2a8bb77198e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Ud0aHJPardcu.rbLMc55IJhR1gIezxuWuhrkvbLlF_lbg--", "site_full": "diarioms.com.br", "site": "diarioms.com.br", "site_section": "http://diarioms.com.br/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Di\u00e1rio MS", "title": "Impresso \u2013 07/12", "title_full": "Impresso \u2013 07/12", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "BR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://diarioms.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/jornaOK-1-2.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "55cf28980ef7fc98442d5f02b9c4a2a8bb77198e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Ud0aHJPardcu.rbLMc55IJhR1gIezxuWuhrkvbLlF_lbg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rose Queiroz", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Impresso \u2013 07/12", "text": " 00 compartilhe: Your browser does not seem to support iframes. <a href=\"http://flowpaper.com/flipbook/?pdf=http://diarioms.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/jornaOK-2.pdf?wp-hosted=1\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to read this PDF</a>.

I decided to make the change after researching both the environmental and health benefits to a vegetarian diet. Although, after I became vegetarian it became quickly apparent to me that Christmas would be a particularly large hurdle to overcome, with everyone asking \u2018But\u2026 what about Christmas?\u2019 after telling them that I was going to be cutting meat out of my diet. Because of this, it seemed impossible at first to stick to the promise of a vegetarian Christmas, having spent every year enjoying my Mum\u2019s non-vegetarian recipes and helping her in the kitchen every year, I still think that she is holding out hope that maybe I\u2019ll change my mind when she bakes her well-renowned sage and sausage rolls\u2026 However, there is nothing to say that new recipes can\u2019t allow for new Christmas traditions to be made, with just as much flavour and ease.\nExperimenting with new flavours, recipes and foods is all a part of the fun, and after doing a little research online, here are some of the best vegetarian recipes I could find that are sure to be as filling and delicious as a plate of Christmas dinner, (that isn\u2019t a nut roast):\nDishes like mushroom risotto are pretty much fool proof, with the added opportunity for experimenting with herbs, flavours and fillings (or just adding as much cheese as you can manage). This classic recipe from Delia is as good as any. Creamy, rich and flavoursome, this is definitely one to try, and one that I think I might try this Christmas instead of the full turkey dinner.\nOr for something a little more Christmassy, there are plenty of savoury roulades splashed across food websites that might take your fancy. This sweet potato and leek roulade from Delicious with flavours of sage and nutmeg maintains the tastes of a traditional Christmas dinner, while being meat-free.\nAnother winter warmer from BBC Good Food is a Golden-glazed carrot, mushroom & hazelnut tart. Flavoursome and __ this is one that both vegetarians and meat eaters alike will not be able to get enough of. Savoury flavours coming together with sweet maple syrup, this recipe is also one that can be adapted and experimented with to suit everyone\u2019s tastes.\nAlthough it\u2019s not just the big meal to consider. Christmas is a time for constant grazing, or at least for me it is\u2026 With party food swimming around and evening nibbles in front of the fire. Whenever I have been at a party with finger food since becoming a vegetarian, it seems that almost all the treats available involve meat to some extent. A very first-world problem, I admit, but frustrating none-the-less. So, here are a few veggie ideas for nibbles that are as tempting as they are delicious\u2026\nChristmas is as good of a time as any to eat as much cheese as humanly possible. This recipe from Delish is a great idea for a cosy night in. Warm, baked brie with a selection of chutneys and jams, crusty bread and celery \u2013 too tempting not to try. Who wouldn\u2019t want to try this, vegetarian or not? Try mixing this recipe up with new flavours, herbs and dips to cater for everyone\u2019s palette. This really is the perfect midnight feast.\nAnd of course, you can\u2019t go far wrong with mini pizzas \u2013 get excited about flavours and toppings! These pizza tartlets from Utterly Scrummy provide an interesting take, and will go down a treat for family and friends alike!\nIf you\u2019re struggling for ideas, you can\u2019t go far wrong with stuffed roasted peppers, vegetable quiches, cheese and grapes, honey-roasted nuts, halloumi sliders with chilli jam\u2026. I\u2019m getting carried away now, but it just goes to show how inventive you can be with this stuff \u2013 and I really feel that by taking meat out of the equation, it forces you to push the boat out with food and flavour combinations that you would otherwise have never tried!\nVegetarian food can be as vibrant and varied as any other food at Christmas, and really is the best time to play with recipes and bring new ideas to the table. And honestly, since turning vegetarian earlier this year I have never been more enthusiastic and interested in cooking, flavours, and what I am putting into my body. I feel healthier, happier, and can\u2019t wait to start trying out new recipes and starting traditions that might even persuade my Mum.\nThe post How To Have The Best Vegetarian Christmas appeared first on Into the Fold .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "delia", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bbc good food", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:10:12.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d9f667ea46fdb6b8387acc49c89d35161d7b4985", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTDl9jpizdGlgiFc2GuY.wImfv4uQRfPAl2LjwZysKL8lxVukLPUJu9bmqvEFRJ.GTPCh.PijULJw--", "site_full": "lf420.deviantart.com", "site": "deviantart.com", "site_section": "http://backend.deviantart.com/rss.xml?q=+sort:time+meta:all&type=deviation", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "DeviantArt: Newest", "title": "Vikings Season Two", "title_full": "Vikings Season Two", "published": "2017-12-07T12:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://pre00.deviantart.net/09b6/th/pre/i/2017/341/8/8/vikings_season_two_by_lf420-dbvzts1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 264, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d9f667ea46fdb6b8387acc49c89d35161d7b4985", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTDl9jpizdGlgiFc2GuY.wImfv4uQRfPAl2LjwZysKL8lxVukLPUJu9bmqvEFRJ.GTPCh.PijULJw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "Vikings Season Two", "text": "Not currently featured in any groups.

Such decisions are also considered to show a bias against the historical and permanent rights of the Palestinian people in Jerusalem, which have been guaranteed by the relevant international resolutions and have received the recognition and support of the international community, the statement said.The ministry expressed its deep concern about the repercussions of this decision on the stability of the region, noting that it inflamed the feelings of Arab and Islamic peoples who have great esteem for Jerusalem.It also pointed to the negative impact of the decision on the future of the peace process between the Palestinian and Israeli sides, which was established on the basis that the city of Jerusalem is among the final status issues, with its fate to be determined through negotiations between the concerned parties.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation stressed the need to abide by all UN resolutions related to the city of Jerusalem, including Security Council resolutions and the principles of international law, which stipulate that diplomatic missions should not be established or transferred there, opposing any recognition of it as the capital of the occupying state and considering East Jerusalem as an integral part of the Palestinian territory occupied in 1967.The statement said that the UAE has warned that taking this step is a major violation of the principle of avoiding any impact or influence on the final status negotiations and that it contravenes international resolutions that affirmed the historic rights of the Palestinian people in Jerusalem, which cannot be interfered with, and that there should not be any attempt to impose a fait accompli.The step will represent a fundamental change and an unjustified bias in the neutral position of the United States at a time when everyone looks forward to seeing the United States of America working to achieve the desired ends in the peace process, the statement said.WAM", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abu dhabi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of foreign affairs and international cooperation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united arab emirates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states of america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:10:12.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "170f7c2357b43b895eecdd5813ea173d5a8b7278", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqa1FEjeW2baoziLEWcOYh347Plt1w7N9Z2yDJSNsvJXN_6C8U_RaMAZzc7vPxdBRfP79yZOlhkZYqZlSii0iy7lG5AqsWFjEatCP3Iu9Dq8UZgkAe_hAuofQ.spKgm20c-", "site_full": "bizpr.us", "site": "bizpr.us", "site_section": "http://bizpr.co/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BizPR.us | US Free Press Release and Distribution center", "title": "Global Phosphoric Acid Market is anticipated to maintain its trajectory in 2017-2022", "title_full": "Global Phosphoric Acid Market is anticipated to maintain its trajectory in 2017-2022", "published": "2017-12-07T12:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "170f7c2357b43b895eecdd5813ea173d5a8b7278", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqa1FEjeW2baoziLEWcOYh347Plt1w7N9Z2yDJSNsvJXN_6C8U_RaMAZzc7vPxdBRfP79yZOlhkZYqZlSii0iy7lG5AqsWFjEatCP3Iu9Dq8UZgkAe_hAuofQ.spKgm20c-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "markengine", "published": "2017-12-07T12:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "Global Phosphoric Acid Market is anticipated to maintain its trajectory in 2017-2022", "text": "A new report added to the repository of Market Research Reports Search Engine \u201c Phosphoric Acid Market \u2013 Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast 2017 \u2013 2022 \u201d is a comprehensive repository of information, providing market share, size, and forecast. \nRequest for Sample Report @ https://www.mrrse.com/sample/3801 \nPhosphoric acid is a colorless, odorless, and an inorganic acid used to acidify food products and beverages. Phosphoric acid is also utilized for preparing various types of phosphates for application in fertilizers. This acid also finds applications in non-fertilizers. Various types of end-uses of phosphoric acid include diammonium phosphate (DAP), monoammonium phosphate (MAP), trisodium phosphate (TSP), food additives and industrial uses. \nLiberalization of Fertilizer Production Industry and Shortage of Cultivable Lands to Drive Market Growth \nMajority of countries in the Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, cost of fertilizers are being strictly regulated by subsidies and import duties. For instance, agrarian economies such as Bangladesh and India are deficient in phosphate rocks and potash reserves. Liberalization of fertilizer production industry, along with the presence of numerous free markets is likely to fuel demand for phosphoric acid. Availability of cultivable land has witnessed a decline over the recent past, owing to rapid rate of urbanization. Arable lands are decreasing globally on the back of industrialization, high demand for energy and population expansion. However, efficient fertilizers have the potential to uplift cultivation capacity of the available arable lands. Phosphoric acid is used for producing effective fertilizers, which offer essential nutrients to crops. Currently, agricultural productivity is being improved worldwide by employing phosphate fertilizers such as TSP, DAP and MAP. \nNature of the global market for phosphoric acid is highly competitive, with the existence of several large & small vendors worldwide. Numerous integrated producers are located at large phosphate rick basins in China, North Africa and North America., with approximately 50% of global phosphate capacity accounted by these producers. Major players in the market realize significant benefits in terms of competitive pricing and low cost of production, owing to the easily available raw materials through integration. \nModerate Expansion Estimated for Global Phosphoric Acid Market through 2022 \nAccording to a new report by research, the global phosphoric acid market is anticipated to maintain its expansion trajectory over the forecast period (2017-2022), although at a moderate CAGR. Global sales of phosphoric acid is forecast to surpass US$ 30,000 Mn in revenues by 2022-end. \nAsia-Pacific excluding Japan (APEJ) will continue to hold its position of being the most lucrative market for phosphoric acid. The market in APEJ will reflect the fastest expansion through 2022. Middle East and North America are also expected to remain lucrative regions for expansion of the global phosphoric acid market.

Global Cloud Computing Services Market: Chief Trends The use of cloud computing services benefits enterprises and organizations in terms of costs. It also enables employees to access data and applications easily accessible from their particular devices. In several cases where the data centers of a company are unable to efficiently handle all the IT requirements, cloud computing services help in increasing the IT capacities without the need for high investments for new data centers. The idea of cloud computing services is that the number of users is inversely proportional to the price of the cloud computing services. Cloud computing services have been openly accepted across several industries as at present, almost all organizations rely on information technology resources to conduct their daily work. These cloud computing services require a considerable amount of initial investment and an incessant maintenance. Cloud computing services shift this obligation to vendors, thus, enabling enterprises to optimize and streamline their IT-based operations.

I\u2019m so happy to be here with you and your readers today. Since 2011, I\u2019ve been immersed in the written word\u2014penning romance novels, to be exact. The process of crafting and getting a work through the publishing machine\u2014especially the indie world\u2014can be a lonely and hard path but when my new imaginary friends walk out of my romances, they\u2019re worth all of grueling pain I submit my wrists and fingers to. Here are four reasons why I have been hooked by love stories. \n\n1. The characters The men! Handsome or scarred, funny or brooding, overbearing or supportive. Dark-haired, blond, paled skin, tanned and everything in between! Now put them together with blondes, brunettes or red-heads; thin or curved or toned; opinionated and bold or delicate and shy! Oh, my! To make it even better, throw in a couple of kids\u2014I love stories with smart kids! Of course, makes it even funnier if we have a few criminals in the story, too. There, I have a bunch of new friends\u2014and enemies\u2014for me to play with for a while. \n\n2. I get to create stories Imagine those said characters meeting over a business meeting, as in The Complete TRUST Series ; or fighting for a cure for a sick child, as in Forevermore , and the sparks flying over a heated argument or a nice gesture. And then imagine them doing it. Yeah! And some revengeful ex-partner or dark secret, which threatens their relationship. I decide who loves and hates; who lives and dies! I can totally transform a person I know in a good or a horrible character. I can even take my revenge on the ones I don\u2019t like much and create a whole new ending for a situation gone wrong. It\u2019s freeing! \n\n3. The research Learning is a passion of mine. In order to create believable characters, research is necessary. For example, Tavish Uilleam MacCraig, the lead male character of Love Painted in Red , who appeared on my first release Entwined Fates, TRUST Series #1 and was supposed to be a secondary character, grew so much as a character during TRUST Series that he demanded his story to be told. As it unfolded, and from it I have already Damaged Love , which features Tavish\u2019s best friend, Lord Richard Smith, and after comes the story of Richard\u2019s older brother, Lord Hugh Smith. All the three of them are veterans of war\u2014I am always in awe of those men and women who sacrifice themselves to make this world safer. We don\u2019t have a strong military here in Brazil and I wanted them to be believable veteran dealing with PTSD, living with disabilities, having invisible scars, for the readers to feel their pains. So I interviewed many veterans online. It was an enlightening and heartbreaking experience and it helped me make Tavish and Richard come out beautifully\u2014or so I like to think\u2014with their physical and psychological scars and yet full of life strength and vigor. \n\n4. The happily ever after With all the horrible things happening in the world, unnecessary killings, religious and racial strife, it\u2019s great to be able to escape to a world where my characters have survived bad things and are still able to find a fulfilling and healing relationship with a happy ending\u2014and don\u2019t forget the steamy sex I got to create. But sometimes, I get out of a story emotionally tired; so tired, I need a break. It was exactly the case of Forevermore , Olivia, Alek, and Ava\u2019s heart-wrenching and heart-warming story that I needed a break before I jump into the skin of Benedict, who is blind, and Natalya, from Evermore . Ah, what did I do during my break? I wrote a light, funny and suspenseful romance. So, pre-order already Royal Love , Last Royals Series #1 . \n\nLast, I want to share some good news.

He realises that being with her will not be easy, but she is a force of nature, a burst of sunlight in his otherwise ordinary world.  \nS ome people might look at  Alice and think she has everything, but Alice knows she is not like other women. Her life is complicated, unpredictable, difficult. Alice does not like pity. All she wants to do, has ever wanted to do, is sing. \nAlice has been told not to follow her dreams. But when fate has already dealt a tough hand, it\u2019s time to stop listening to everyone else and only follow their hearts.   \nReview \nA Song for Tomorrow  is truly a heart-warming and inspiring story, full of humour, love, friendship and honesty. \nIt is the fictionalised life story of real life singer, Alice Martineau, who tragically died from cystic fibrosis in 2003 at the age of 30. \nA Song for Tomorrow  tells of the remarkable determination of Alice and her truly inspiring story. This is an affirmative tale of living life and following dreams, not a sad tale of dying. It really is a story of courage, which Alice had in abundance. She must have been an incredibly inspiring person to have known. \nDespite living with a life-limiting lung condition, Alice dreamed of being a singer. Having already successfully completed university and enjoyed a short career as a model, Alice displayed a steely and unwavering determination to make her dreams come true. The book tells how her courage and positivity affected the lives of everyone around her, bringing her own unique brightness into their lives. \nWhat really struck me about the story was the humour with which Alice faced her daily challenges and how she remained so kind and hopeful throughout. The steadfast and reciprocated support between Alice and her family, friends and caregivers really shines through this book. \nThere are some difficult moments in the book, however it never becomes maudlin or downbeat.  As a reader, I felt that if anyone deserved happiness and success it was Alice, however fleeting it may prove to be. \nIt is difficult to separate the real Alice from the fictional account given by Alice Peterson. However, I am aware that she collaborated closely with the Martineau family and I have no doubt that the character is very close to the real version of Alice. \nThe book prompted me to search for Alice Martineau online and after listening to a couple of her songs, it is apparent what an incredibly talented lady she was. It is nice to think that by writing this book Alice Peterson has brought some increased awareness of Alice Martineau and her lovely music. \nThe book also gives a fascinating insight into cystic fibrosis and what it means to live with the condition. When growing up, I had a classmate with cystic fibrosis. Unfortunately he is no longer with us, however this book made me realise how little I really understood about the condition. \nI will be completely honest and admit that  A Song for Tomorrow  would not be my usual choice in books. I tend to avoid any books relating to death, illness, abuse etc\u2026 (except when told in the guise of a crime/thrillers).  However, this is one book that I am truly grateful that I made an exception for.   A Song for Tomorrow   is undoubtedly one of the best books I have read for a long time. Although, I do blame Alice Peterson for making me cry on public transportation \u2013 it may be best to read the last few chapters in the safety of your own home rather than on a train in rush hour!! Despite that indignity, Peterson is undoubtedly a very talented writer and I very much look forward to reading her earlier works. \nDespite some fairly hefty competition this year,  A Song for Tomorrow  is my book of the year for 2017, I really cannot recommend it enough. It is a beautiful tribute to a remarkable woman and an uplifting and inspiring tale for anyone facing adversity.   \nAbout the Author \nAlice Peterson writes contemporary fiction with humour and compassion. Her novels always have the feel good factor, but she also aims to take the reader to a darker place where characters have to overcome adversity.

Congratulations Naples!\" cried pizza maker Enzo Coccia, as crowds in the street outside the Sorbillo pizzeria erupted into cheers.It didn't matter that the cultural body's World Heritage Committee was still a few hours away from making it an \"intangible heritage\": there was no chance the world-famous dish could lose.The day before Thursday's much-awaited announcement, discs of floury dough flew through the air as jubilant pizzaioli feted the art of pizza making -- from the wooden ovens used, to the spectacular handling of the mix to \"oxygenate\" it.Passing families and youngsters whizzing by on scooters stopped to grab fresh slices dripping melted mozzarella as a man with a guitar burst into one of the songs dedicated to the Italian delicacy.Dozens more chefs were expected to hand out free pizza to locals and tourists in the southern city after the decision, which paid homage to pizza's key social as well as cultural role.\"Down the centuries, the Neapolitan art of pizza making has been based on a few key elements: water, flour, salt and yeast -- and the excellent produce from the Campania countryside,\" Coccia said.\"But it is also the hands, heart and soul of the pizzaiolo which allow us to make magic,\" he added, describing the stretching and turning of the dough as \"a love and passion that we transmit to others\".The pizza's humble ancestor, a plain affair usually tarted up with a bit of lard, was born less as an act of love than as a cheap, easy and fast way to feed the city's army of poor in the 18th century.\"In around 1750 the first pizza appeared in the taverns, after which people began to specialise as 'pizzaioli' (pizza chefs),\" said historian Antonio Mattozzi.\"By the end of the 18th century, the first pizzerias were born\".But despite being an immediate hit with the locals, pizza failed to take off outside the city at first, he told AFP.- 'Trade secrets' -It took Queen Margherita's love of the classic tomato, mozzarella and basil version to fire up the imagination and taste buds of diners far and wide -- at least that is how the story goes.Hoping to win the hearts of the commoners, the queen asked in 1889 to try their favourite dish. And while she was unconvinced by anchovy and Parmesan-topped versions, the basil delight won her over.Legend has it the winning combination was put together by pizza maker Raffaele Esposito, who baked it in the royal pizza oven in the grounds of the stunning hill-top Capodimonte Palace.The Margherita offered to the queen was recreated Tuesday in the 300-year old oven by pizzaioli who hold no truck with modern toppings like pineapple and are on a mission to defend the real thing.\"We are honoured to pass on secrets and tips,\" Gino Sorbillo told AFP.\"Each one of us might have a small detail that makes a difference, but we share them so that across the world those who want to make good Neapolitan pizza can do so\".He said there were \"youngsters from every culture who get in touch with us asking to learn, even sending us photographs of their pizza attempts online saying 'what did I do wrong?'\"But fellow pizza maker Antonio Starita was not convinced that tips were enough, insisting that \"to learn the art, you need to do long apprenticeships in pizzerias\".Culture Minister Dario Franceschini, digging into a hot slice straight off the royal peel, said that while \"pizza has become a universal patrimony, many around the world don't even know it is Italian\".\"This UNESCO decision will establish the truth once and for all: that pizza is a global food -- but it was born in Naples, and in this very oven\".Agence France-Presse", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "antonio starita", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dario franceschini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margherita", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raffaele esposito", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antonio mattozzi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coccia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gino sorbillo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enzo coccia", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "unesco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capodimonte palace.the margherita", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world heritage committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "naples", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naples", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "campania", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:10:16.106+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "77de19fc1e2d51174999796727971f5daab3bf76", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWrBdn5EfKX6VqbtdSUWx3lO_ff4WFycagFawHRu0sPFRRPQgpnrsFpNNQVjoGukYOpsJn_I2_9Q1hLZGaMeOIbI7lRyz9GhGaxFPDR5B_GkVdVyddCB1pXIq8F85BGaiWuZ1fnZEaiCw-", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-women-tote-bags/?spm=a2o4k.category-090103000000.0.0.SaY8qG", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Women's Tote Bags - Buy Women's Tote Bags at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "SoKaNo Trendz Sweet SA PU Premium PU Leather Bag- Dark Blue", "title_full": "SoKaNo Trendz Sweet SA PU Premium PU Leather Bag- Dark Blue | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2015-08-16T06:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 271, "participants_count": 180, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.084, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e73eb5de67be4de3c643180977962e81233cc034", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWrBdn5EfKX6VqbtdSUWx3lO_ff4WFycagFawHRu0sPFRRPQgpnrsFpNNQVjoGukYOpsJn_I2_9Q1hLZGaMeOIbI7lRyz9GhGaxFPDR5B_GkVdVyddCB1pXIq8F85BGaiWmImtOYbl4LE.kp9uAGyLkA--", "ord_in_thread": 258, "author": "Tharmendran S.", "published": "2017-11-18T06:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "Quality Product", "text": "The product is good as what advertise.
