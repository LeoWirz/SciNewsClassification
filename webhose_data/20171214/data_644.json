The Conservative leader and byelection candidate weren't shopping just to soothe a sugar craving. They were making a political point about small business taxes, an issue they're pushing to be front and centre in South Surrey-White Rock. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck \nSURREY, B.C. \u2013 Inside a colourful candy shop in a bustling Vancouver suburb, Andrew Scheer and Kerry-Lynne Findlay marvelled at delicate British chocolate bars, chewy Red Vines and an edible Monopoly board. \nThe Conservative leader and byelection candidate weren\u2019t shopping just to soothe a sugar craving. They were making a political point about small business taxes, an issue they\u2019re pushing to be front and centre in South Surrey-White Rock. \n\u201cPeople are saying, \u2018I\u2019m paying a lot higher taxes than I was before. I\u2019m being called a tax cheat because I\u2019m an entrepreneur with a small business,\u2019\u201d said Findlay, 62, a former national revenue minister. \nThe riding is one of four across Canada where a byelection will be held Monday, but it\u2019s anticipated to be the closest race. Conservative Dianne Watts won by just 1,400 votes over the Liberal candidate in 2015, while the NDP placed a distant third. \nThe vote arrives midway through Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s term and it\u2019s expected to test his popularity, as well as the potential of rookie leader Scheer, ahead of the 2019 election. Both men have visited the riding twice and both have suggested the outcome will indicate whether the Liberal surge of 2015 is continuing or waning. \n\u201cTwo years ago, in the election, Canadians didn\u2019t randomly or suddenly change who we are,\u201d Trudeau said at a recent rally to support Liberal candidate Gordie Hogg, 71. \n\u201cWe have always been progressive, forward-thinking, open, compassionate, ambitious people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just about getting a government that recognizes that.\u201d \nSouth Surrey-White Rock has older, wealthier and whiter demographics than other ridings in Surrey, which is the fastest-growing city in Metro Vancouver. It\u2019s home to a picturesque waterfront and an array of restaurants, shops and other small businesses. \nIn July, Trudeau\u2019s government announced plans to close loopholes that it said have allowed high-earning business owners to avoid higher taxes. The measures included changes to \u201cincome sprinkling,\u201d which allows owners to split income among family members. \nAfter a backlash, the government said it would cut the small business tax rate from 10.5 per cent to nine per cent by 2019. \nHogg said he and Trudeau are committed to cutting taxes for small businesses, while the Conservatives voted against a tax cut in 2015 for \u201cmiddle-class\u201d Canadians earning between about $45,000 and $90,000 a year. \n\u201cTo me, their record is more important than their rhetoric,\u201d said Hogg. \u201cThis byelection is about electing the strongest positive voice for our community, and only Justin Trudeau and I have a positive plan to strengthen our middle class and offer real help for families.\u201d \nThe seat became vacant after Watts resigned to run for leader of the B.C. Liberal Party, an informal coalition of federal Conservatives and Liberals. \nByelections will also be held in Battlefords-Lloydminster in Saskatchewan, previously held by the Conservatives; Bonavista-Burin-Trinity in Newfoundland, a Liberal seat; and Scarborough-Agincourt in Ontario, also won by the Liberals in the last election. \nIn South Surrey-White Rock, Hogg has name recognition and deep roots. He was White Rock mayor for 10 years before being elected to the B.C. legislature for two decades. Findlay, meantime, represented Delta-Richmond East in Parliament from 2011 to 2015. \nAsked about her connection to the riding, Findlay said her parents lived in the community and she has also lived there at various points, including after she was widowed at 34 and was raising her children alone. She said she moved to White Rock this summer. \nThe NDP candidate is Jonathan Silveira, 40, a real estate agent and founder of advocacy group Surrey Kids Matter. He said the byelection was an opportunity to train new volunteers and strengthen relationships, but added he was serious about winning. \n\u201cThere are two big sharks fighting here. I am not afraid of the fight as well,\u201d he said. \nNew Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh has not joined Silveira in the riding. \nTrudeau\u2019s recent rally with Hogg in Surrey drew hundreds. Some were not local voters, however, including a Syrian refugee who said she wanted to thank Trudeau, and a visitor from Singapore who wanted to see the famous Canadian politician in person. \nThe prime minister is pictured alongside Hogg on campaign signs, indicating confidence among Liberals in Trudeau\u2019s popularity. \nScheer and Findlay, however, said they\u2019ve heard from people who have \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d after voting Liberal in 2015. \nIt\u2019s hard to predict a general election based on byelections, Scheer added, because the latter generally have lower turnouts, and local issues become amplified over national ones. \n\u201cBut I think we would love to send a signal, mid-term, that what the Liberals have been doing for Canadians isn\u2019t working.\u201d

Babcock\u2019s body has not been found. \nIn its closing address on Wednesday the Crown said a \u201cmountain\u201d of circumstantial evidence points to Millard and Smich killing Babcock at Millard\u2019s home some time after 8 p.m. on July 3, 2012 and then disposing of her body at Millard\u2019s farm near Waterloo, Ont. \nThe prosecution alleges Babcock was killed after becoming the odd woman out in a love triangle with Millard and his girlfriend. \nSmich\u2019s lawyer told the jury on Wednesday that his client had no motive to kill Babcock because he was never part of a love triangle and all the Crown has is a rap song in which Smich says he killed a girl and burned her body. \nMillard, who represented himself, told the jury in his closing address Tuesday that several witnesses testified to having seen or heard from Babcock after July 4, 2012.

Tearoom \u201cMost of Dundee\u2019s ducktails were working guys who owned big motorbikes (known as \u2018boneys\u2019) and hot cars and hung out at the Central. They enjoyed roaring around and also scaring the Cosy members with madcap antics \u201c about 1 min ago \nThe rockin\u2019 60s and early \u201970s were brought back to life when a group of around 70 nostalgic former and current Dundonians reunited in Dundee to call back the \u2018good old days\u2019 of the legendary Cosy Tearoom, The reunion was based at Battlefields Country Lodge three weeks ago. Former Dundee resident and \u2018amateur Dundee historian\u2019, Rob Marshall (now living in Ermelo), recalls that the Cosy Tearoom was bought by Trevor Krause in the late 1950s. It soon became an institution with the town\u2019s youngsters.\u201cThe Cosy was on Victoria Street \u2013 between the old Standard Bank (now Canos Fashion Shop) and Boundary Road. The old Dundee Chemist was next door,\u201d Rob told the Courier.\u201cBack then there were two cafes in Dundee \u2013 the Cosy and the Central Caf\u00e9 about 150 metres down the road. Each caf\u00e9 attracted its own set of people \u2013 the Central was a hangout for \u2018Ducktails\u2019 with the jukebox blaring out Elvis Presley and other rock n roll music of the time. The younger set gravitated towards Cosy Tearoom where the jukebox played 60s music. \nTwo old pals from yesteryear \u2013 Robin Lowe and Leigh Soden catching up on lost time! \n\u201cGenerally the two groups got on well and tolerated each other\u2019s presence,\u201d Rob laughed.\u201cMost of Dundee\u2019s ducktails were working guys who owned big motorbikes (known as \u2018boneys\u2019) and hot cars and hung out at the Central. They enjoyed roaring around and also scaring the Cosy members with madcap antics such as riding their bikes flat out on the pavement and racing down past the movie house or Cosy regardless of the queues or groups of people on the pavement. \u2013 we just had to learn to jump! But that is just how we rolled in those days!\u201d Trevor Krause sold the Tearoom in around 1974 but two years later it burnt down along with three other nearby shops. The idea of a Tearoom reunion began when Lourens and Nan Roos of Battlefields Country Lodge attended the funeral of Roy Kirkness \u2013 an ex-Dundee High School teacher and renowned Dundee sportsman of the early 1960s, in Pietermaritzburg. Nan and Lourens Roos of Battlefields Country Lodge who hosted the memorable Cosy Tea Room reunion. 0312050214 0342124680 \nHow it all started During the service they met up with Lynette Cousins (n\u00e9e Levensohn) who is also an old Dundee girl and during their conversation, Lourens mentioned that \u201cbefore more people pass away I\u2019d like to arrange a reunion and call it the \u2018Cosy Tearoom Reunion\u2019 in honour of one of the popular hang-outs of our era.\u201d Lynette didn\u2019t need any more encouragement and set the ball rolling by immediately gathering the names of all the people of their era that she and her friends could think of and so began the reunion weekend! Friday evening saw the early birds gather around steaming stir-fry trays placed over hot coals and guests had the opportunity to choose their favourite stir-fry food from a magnificent selection of tasty bowls and fry their food according to taste. Recorded music was provided by our 1960s \u2018music man\u2019, Allan Dawson, who has a collection of over 20, 000 songs on a computer! Commented Rob: \u201cAllan\u2019s musical CV stretches back to the 1960s, when he was a member of the popular Dundee Band, The Apaches, he was definitely the right man for this job!\u201d \nTwo old pals from yesteryear \u2013 Robin Lowe and Leigh Soden catching up on lost time! \nSaturday dawned crisp and sunny \u2013 perfect for the various activities that Lourens and Nan planned for the day. A large number of guests opted for the Battlefield tour under the able direction of Bevin Shirley, an old Dundee boy from the 1960s. There was golf which Mike Norton, Peter Rogers, Trevor Lauf and Nan Roos all enjoyed. Some of the guests, like Leigh Soden, tried their luck at some fishing spots on the estate but it seems as if the fish were forewarned! In the evening, there was a tasty dinner with a band from Newcastle playing specific hits from the years the guests could identify with. \nDundee\u2019s music man of the 1960s (and still going strong) Allan and Shona Dawson. \n\u201cAllan Dawson added to the wonderful sound by showing videos on a large backing screen of the original bands playing the same songs. Before long, the dance floor was revving with all ages from septuagenarians to \u2018youngsters\u2019 in their 50s rocking and rolling to music that we readily understood,\u201d said Rob.\u201cIt was quite evident that even the oldest guests had never lost any of their dancing styles as they vigorously ripped up the floor, dancing to the music that we made popular for later generations to enjoy.\u201d In conclusion, Rob remembered one of the many anecdotes told on the night from \u2018dem days\u2019\u2026 \nThe popular Dundee group, The Apaches, with Allan Dawson, far left, performing at the then Royal Hotel in the 1960s. \n\u201cBevin Shirley and Stuart Clark kept horses at their homes and often rode their horses to town to do small shopping chores or just visit their friends which meant popping into the Cosy. One Saturday morning all was well \u2013 their horses were tethered outside the tearoom when the owner, Trevor Krause came tearing in and told them in no uncertain terms that a horse had dumped a huge \u2018visiting card\u2019 on the entrance to his tearoom and they better clean it up immediately or else! \n\u201cThat was our town with plenty ups and downs and a bucketful of good stories to tell many years later.\u201d SHARE", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mike norton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lourens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elvis presley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob marshall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allan dawson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trevor krause", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "levensohn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stuart clark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leigh soden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lynette", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nan roos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bevin shirley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robin lowe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trevor lauf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shona dawson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter rogers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lynette cousins", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dundee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lourens roos of battlefields country lodge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dundee band", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "standard bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dundee chemist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central caf\u00e9", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canos fashion shop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nan roos of battlefields country lodge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newcastle", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "royal hotel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "battlefields country lodge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dundee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boundary road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victoria street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pietermaritzburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ermelo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:22.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "83bbfea4e1dc68265fd31afe3cc65139df2b2f83", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqoPJd_.qDuqWKIzVhGH9m.NM_hTHIlWgzD9Fv9VEElrLA6w_CLKms5", "site_full": "bbs.mumayi.com", "site": "mumayi.com", "site_section": "http://bbs.mumayi.com/forum-49-9.html", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "\u6728\u8682\u8681\u624b\u673a\u4e50\u56ed\u9996\u9875-\u5b89\u5353\u6c49\u5316\u6e38\u620f\u8f6f\u4ef6-Android\u5b89\u5353\u6c49\u5316\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6e38\u620f\u6c49\u5316-\u6728\u8682\u8681\u6c49\u5316\u5c0f\u7ec4-\u6728\u8682\u8681\u624b\u673a\u4e50\u56ed\u9996\u9875 - Powered by Discuz!", "title": "Drivedroid 0.9.26 Free \u6c49\u5316\u7248-", "title_full": "Drivedroid 0.9.26 Free \u6c49\u5316\u7248-Android\u5b89\u5353\u6c49\u5316\u4e0b\u8f7d-\u6728\u8682\u8681\u5b89\u5353\u8bba\u575b Android\u5b89\u5353\u624b\u673a\u5e73\u677f\u6e38\u620f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u7528,\u5b89\u5353\u6e38\u620f\u7834\u89e3,\u539f\u521bROM,\u5b89\u5353\u6c49\u5316\u5206\u4eab\u8bba\u575b - Powered by Discuz!", "published": "2017-11-27T16:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "CN", "spam_score": 0.221, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20956, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "83bbfea4e1dc68265fd31afe3cc65139df2b2f83", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqoPJd_.qDuqWKIzVhGH9m.NM_hTHIlWgzD9Fv9VEElrLA6w_CLKms5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "\u25c7\u542c\u250a\u89c9\u250a\u25c6", "published": "2017-11-27T16:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "Drivedroid 0.9.26 Free \u6c49\u5316\u7248-", "text": "hhjjnvgjjvhhjk", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:22.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bdfe072b56d791584106f434ebc0a70b1ed83504", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApuzV2WawCWLsdYz0hVF.101aX6jRKUuoJDg6buzqrL8YE9WC..xyh3cLPgIUZlG9Sg4YnEXJKx6aDDS8J1.QshRqvcKlb0lHzIh9g5gxjV3xsqgN2LsNh.y", "site_full": "medicineasfakiakianakis.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://medicineasfakiakianakis.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Medicine by Sfakianakis G.

It\u2019s just not the type of thing one memorizes. But people are often able to figure it out with a little thought or research. Some ways include: * Finding the account creation verification e-mail which would have been sent to another account you owned. * Associating the creation of the account with some life event, like graduation, moving, a change in ISP, etc. * If it was created as part of a new mobile device setup, check the date on the sales receipt for the device. * If the account was created for starting mobile device service, check the start date of your mobile contract. * Asking contacts if they saved a change-of-email message sent from the new Gmail account. * Checking the creation date of any other accounts opened at the same time, like: PayPal, eBay, etc. * If you still have access to the account (perhaps on a mobile device) check the All Mail label for the oldest saved messages.

God will see that you do want society.(Henry David Thoreau) \"1) how terrible our life maybe, be brave to face it, love to live, never blame others, never give up your life. 2) learn to cultivate your mind and action our mind consists of plants; weeds or herbs (evil or kindness). nurture the herbs and pull out the weeds 3) to crave for new things, we invite pressure 4) we can't change the world, but we can change our-self for the better 5) we can sell any material for material, but never sell your kindness for evil. \" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "henry david thoreau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hikerakashi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "komu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:23.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "04970140bc255773982cb21ca8bd87b16758a649", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQOY2Vu62HdS2fx3k67ipt6upNUj_7ZtN6UPiuOuQbavNGwOf47CrwmUgd..EAHykExEuOq0cq7v9m9PhJ2CJvfwxG65oaarVMpmVphqMd6w2pGRMvzy318.l5kal3THdI-", "site_full": "article.wn.com", "site": "wn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.wn.com/English/keyword/environment", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WN.com -

government wants to lift the mystery surrounding the G7 summit as it prepares to host the gathering next year, in hopes that Canadians will feel more included and, perhaps, less inclined to protest on the periphery.\n\u201cThe idea is to get input from Canadians,\u201d Peter Boehm, the Canadian G7 summit sherpa, said in an interview with The Canadian Press.\n\u201cWhat are they thinking about some of the big themes in the world, whether it\u2019s economic inclusion, what the jobs of the future might look like, climate change, energy and, indeed, some of the big foreign policy and security questions that might be out there?\u201d said Boehm.\nThe efforts to open the process up to Canadians includes Boehm speaking at a public event Thursday night, organized by the Toronto branch of the Canadian International Council and the G7 Research Group at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto.\n\u201cA lot of this is listening and then feeding it through, but also a chance for us to demystify what the G7 is,\u201d said Boehm, who is preparing for Canada to assume the G7 presidency in January, six months before it hosts the summit at a resort in La Malbaie, Que.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a big gathering where you see a lot of people and even more security.\u201d\nHeavy \u2014 and armed \u2014 security presence is a common sight on the edges of G7 summits, where the need to protect the leaders of powerful countries takes on added urgency due to crowds gathered for demonstrations, which have sometimes turned into violent clashes with police.\nThe turbulent Toronto G20 summit in 2010, which included mass arrests and cases of police misconduct, reverberated for years.\nBoehm suggested involving Canadians along the road to the G7 summit is one way to get ahead of the issue.\n\u201cWe all have the right to express our views and we fully expect that there will be people who will be expressing their views,\u201d said Boehm. \u201cMy own view is that it is best to do that from an informed perspective, so that\u2019s part of the reason for the outreach.\u201d\nStill, Boehm said the summit organizers will nonetheless be prepared for protests.\n\u201cIn the past at large gatherings there has also been infiltration by less desirable elements who do not want to express views nor hear views, but they want to create mayhem,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, on the security side, we will certainly be ready for that.\u201d\n\u2014 Follow @smithjoanna on Twitter", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

in artificial intelligence are fuelling a new race between hackers and those toiling to protect cybersecurity networks.\nCybersecurity is always a race between offence and defence but new tools are giving companies that employ them a leg up on those trying to steal their data.\nWhereas past responses to cybercrimes often looked for known hacking methods long after they occurred, AI techniques using machine learning scan huge volumes of data to detect patterns of abnormal behaviour that are imperceptible to humans.\nExperts expect machines will become so sophisticated that they\u2019ll develop answers to questions that humans won\u2019t clearly understand.\nDavid Decary-Hetu, assistant professor of criminology at the University of Montreal, says defenders have an edge right now in using artificial intelligence.\n\u201cBut who knows what\u2019s going to happen in a few years from now,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\u201cThe main issue is that if you\u2019re defending a system you have to be good 100 per cent of the time, but when you\u2019re attacking the system you only have to be successful once to get in.\u201d\nDecary-Hetu said a growing list of corporate and government officials, including Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz, who say infiltrations are their top worry have a very good reason to fear.\nThe Bank of Canada warned in its semi-annual review released this month that the high degree of interconnectedness among Canadian financial institutions means any successful cyberattack could spread widely throughout the financial system.\nReports suggest cybercrime costs the Canadian economy between $3 billion and $5 billion a year, including ransom paid to foreign criminals.\nHacks of Sony Pictures, Uber, Ashley Madison, Yahoo and multinational retailers have sparked unsettling headlines about security of personal information.\nOne of the latest to face scrutiny is global credit-reporting firm Equifax. Hackers accessed the personal information, including names, social insurance and credit card numbers, as well as usernames, passwords and secret question/secret answer data of 19,000 Canadians and 145.5 million Americans.\nCurrent detection systems tend to only recognize improper activity based on past events, often long after the damage is done.\nAn example of this is Equifax, which discovered the breach in July, months after hackers first infiltrated the system. It only notified the public in early September.\nNiranjan Mayya, founder and CEO of Toronto-based Rank Software, said it takes on average 143 days for a breach to be detected.\nThe challenge is growing as the number of connected devices in the world continues to soar.\n\u201cClearly the old style techniques of looking at cybersecurity threats and having people go through each threat aren\u2019t working anymore, so automated means of detecting threats has become more and more important,\u201d he said.\nDavid Masson, Canadian manager for U.K.-based Darktrace, said artificial intelligence will help to keep up with threats by quickly identifying and stopping attacks by picking up on subtle markers that identify bad behaviour.\nHe said his company\u2019s systems map a customer\u2019s entire network, including every user and device, to discern even the slightest deviations as they emerge.\nMasson said AI is needed to keep up with threats by automating defence responses to growing machine-on-machine attacks launched by sophisticated hackers.\n\u201cYou\u2019re kind of looking at a cyber arms race,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\u201cIf you want to keep up with this threat and put the advantage back in the hands of the defenders you\u2019re gonna have to use AI.\u201d\nOntario-based utilities company Energy+ Inc. said installed Darktrace technology alerted it to a user going to a malware site in Russia and uploading undisclosed sensitive data to a third-party cloud provider that its existing security was unable to catch.\nSome observers temper the current exuberance about AI, saying it\u2019s not a silver bullet and these are nascent days for the technology.\nReceptiviti CEO Jonathan Kreindler says the hype around artificial intelligence has accelerated and has almost become a branding exercise for some companies that aren\u2019t even offering truly leading edge technology.\n\u201cThe term AI is now being applied to any sort of algorithmic reasoning unfortunately,\u201d said Kreindler.\nHis firm uses AI to scour writings for unconscious use of language to understand the psychological state of company insiders who are responsible for 80 per cent of cybersecurity issues.\nCanada\u2019s largest IT company, CGI Group, said artificial intelligence is a growing field of interest for customers, although the average client is in the fairly early stages of considering AI adoption in cybersecurity.\nCGI cybersecurity expert Andrew Rogoyski said that still puts them one step ahead of most hackers, who are typically interested in stealing data using the cheapest tools possible.\nRogoyski added that he expects a strengthening of defensive mechanisms might force hackers to also adopt innovative techniques such as AI.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a race, it\u2019s been going on for 20 years plus and the race just keeps evolving. We keep leapfrogging each other,\u201d he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david decary", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ross marowits", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "stephen poloz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan kreindler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashley madison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "masson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kreindler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chiasson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david masson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rogoyski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew rogoyski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "-hetu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david decary-hetu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "decary-hetu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niranjan mayya", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rank software", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.-based darktrace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yahoo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank of canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of montreal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "energy+ inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cgi group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sony pictures", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "equifax", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "montreal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darktrace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montreal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:24.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d611d6491a2da9551c982ac682da460cc65162d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJVdt3nInyIfqxK8QWsqTpaJvOH69uUK2Pl6VcKJQxN1fsZpE67PMgDVIBr2tVnyf3zyYXhKxOltPoudRTFi5KhJ4vzGYVq5N87kn6K4WlfEhfS8mAi3MUckpn9SU8aL5fZ1B_FGkHh7vVZhcZjenPNN", "site_full": "newsfenster.de", "site": "newsfenster.de", "site_section": "http://newsfenster.de/rssfeed.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Presse/News Portal - newsfenster.de - Newsfeed", "title": "DUALIS zeigt Neues aus der Welt der Fabrikplanung und 3D-Simulation auf der LogiMAT", "title_full": "DUALIS zeigt Neues aus der Welt der Fabrikplanung und 3D-Simulation auf der LogiMAT", "published": "2017-12-07T10:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://newsfenster.de/style/default/img/fb-logo-mini.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d611d6491a2da9551c982ac682da460cc65162d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJVdt3nInyIfqxK8QWsqTpaJvOH69uUK2Pl6VcKJQxN1fsZpE67PMgDVIBr2tVnyf3zyYXhKxOltPoudRTFi5KhJ4vzGYVq5N87kn6K4WlfEhfS8mAi3MUckpn9SU8aL5fZ1B_FGkHh7vVZhcZjenPNN", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "DUALIS zeigt Neues aus der Welt der Fabrikplanung und 3D-Simulation auf der LogiMAT", "text": "07.12.2017 | IT, NewMedia & Software | geschrieben von Heike Wilson\u00b9   DUALIS zeigt Neues aus der Welt der Fabrikplanung und 3D-Simulation auf der LogiMAT Dresden, 7. Dezember 2017 - Die DUALIS GmbH IT Solution (www.dualis-it.de) demonstriert vom 13. bis 15. M\u00e4rz 2018 auf der LogiMAT in Stuttgart, wie intelligente Fabriken geplant werden. Gemeinsam mit dem MES-Hersteller ISI Automation und dem ERP-Anbieter ASSECO Solutions pr\u00e4sentiert der APS-Hersteller DUALIS am Stand B10 in Halle 7 Komplettl\u00f6sungen zur Optimierung der zunehmend vernetzten Fertigungs- und Intralogistik-Prozesse. Dar\u00fcber hinaus hat DUALIS die 3D-Simulationsplattform Visual Components mit Neuerungen wie ein Hallenplanungs-Add-on im Messegep\u00e4ck. Die LogiMAT stellt unter dem Motto \"Digital - Vernetzt - Innovativ\" den digitalen Wandel in der Intralogistik-Branche in den Fokus. Diese Entwicklung unterst\u00fctzt auch DUALIS mit ihren Planungs- und Simulationsl\u00f6sungen. So dient das APS (Advanced Planning and Scheduling)-System GANTTPLAN zur Optimierung von Planungsabl\u00e4ufen in smarten Fabriken. Denn es wird zur fortgeschrittenen Planung sowie Terminierung von Produktions- und Logistikprozessen eingesetzt und erm\u00f6glicht die digitale Vernetzung der Produktions- und Managementebene. Das Feinplanungstool GANTTPLAN kann autark angewendet werden oder mit verschiedenen ERP- und MES-L\u00f6sungen ineinander greifen. So entwickelt der APS-Spezialist unter anderem mit dem MES-Hersteller ISI Automation und dem ERP-Anbieter ASSECO Solutions gemeinsame Industrie 4.0-L\u00f6sungen. Diese gehen \u00fcber die klassische Produktionsplanung und -steuerung hinaus, denn sie ber\u00fccksichtigen nicht nur die Ressourcen in der Produktion, sondern auch den Transport und die Lagerhaltung. Somit werden alle erforderlichen Prozesse im Rahmen des Supply Chain Managements optimiert. Mit Visual Components vernetzte Prozesse planen und optimieren Au\u00dferdem pr\u00e4sentiert DUALIS Neuerungen der 3D-Simulationsplattform Visual Components, die zur dreidimensionalen Robotersimulation, Materialfluss- und Anlagenplanung eingesetzt wird. Mit Visual Components Experience gibt es ab sofort einen neuen, kostenfreien Viewer f\u00fcr Animationen, die von einer Simulation aufgenommen werden k\u00f6nnen. Zudem unterst\u00fctzt diese Neuerung die Virtual Reality-Ausgabe mit HTC-Vive und ist auch als Version f\u00fcr mobile Endger\u00e4te erh\u00e4ltlich. Dar\u00fcber hinaus pr\u00e4sentiert DUALIS auf der Messe das eigens entwickelte Postprozessor Add-on. Es erm\u00f6glicht den Export des in Visual Components erstellten Roboterprogramms in die roboterspezifische Syntax (derzeit f\u00fcr KUKA und Yaskawa implementiert). Der Anwender kann die simulierten Roboterprogramme auf dem realen Roboter bzw. der Steuerung nachnutzen. Neu ist auch das Hallenplanung-Add-on, das speziell f\u00fcr einen Kunden aus dem Anlagenbau entwickelt wurde. Das Add-on dient zur Layoutplanung f\u00fcr die Belegung der Montagehalle(n) des Anlagenbauers. Der Anlagenbauer montiert vor der eigentlichen Endmontage beim Endkunden die Fertigungslinie in seinen eigenen Hallen. Daf\u00fcr muss der Hallenmeister f\u00fcr bestimmte Zeitfenster Platz in der Halle reservieren und f\u00fcr zuk\u00fcnftige Projekte eine entsprechende Planung vornehmen. Das Add-on kann kundenspezifisch angepasst werden und damit die Visual Components-Anwendung bei Maschinen- und Anlagenbauern in Richtung Hallenplanung erweitern. Es erm\u00f6glicht die Visualisierung aktueller Montageprojekte, den Import von zuk\u00fcnftigen Projekten, besitzt einen Zeitstrahl und Filteroptionen. \"Mit Visual Components k\u00f6nnen Fehler bereits im Entstehungsprozess einer Anlage, einer Halle oder eines Systems erkannt und ausger\u00e4umt werden\", erkl\u00e4rt Heike Wilson, Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrerin bei DUALIS. \"Sowohl bei GANTTPLAN als auch bei Visual Components geht es darum, Fabrik- sowie Intralogistikprozesse und damit Kosten zu optimieren. Wir unterst\u00fctzen Fertigungsbetriebe dabei, die digitale Welt - die f\u00fcr viele noch Neuland ist - planbar und kalkulierbar zu machen\", erg\u00e4nzt Heike Wilson.

Advertisement \n\"This is Australia: Fair, diverse, loving and filled for respect for everyone,\" said an effusive Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, as he introduced the bill for a final vote. \n\"This is a great day, it belongs to every Australian.\" \nThe move follows a two-month national postal survey that showed 61% of more than 12 million respondents were in favor of marriage equality. \nThe country is now the 24th in the world to allow same-sex couples to marry, according to Pew Research. \nAustralia's first same-sex weddings will not take place until at least January, however, due to a longstanding requirement for all Australian couples to provide a full month's notice of their intention to get married. \nHistoric moment \nMarriage equality campaigners have fought for years for Thursday's vote. Though the bill was expected to pass into law without significant opposition, the lengthy legislative process was excruciatingly slow for the hundreds of advocates watching from the public gallery. \nAmong them was Christine Forster, the gay sister of Tony Abbott, the former Australian Prime Minister who has long been seen as the face of the \"no\" campaign. \nForster was joined in the public gallery by her partner, Virginia Edwards. They plan to marry next year, and Abbott has said he'll attend despite his personal views. \nAbbott and other conservatives proposed amendments to the bill to include further religious protections, all of which were voted down. \n\"These amendments are important and I stress they are not against same-sex marriage, they are simply in favor of the rights of religious organizations to keep doing what their doing,\" Abbott said. \nOpponents of the changes argued they would legalize discrimination against the gay community. The 500 or so people in the gallery were vocal in their disapproval of the amendments. They were warned multiple times that parliamentary rules prohibit them making noise and even applauding. \nAn emotional week \nAfter the bill passed the Senate last week, House proceedings kicked off with fireworks Monday when Liberal MP Tim Wilson surprised his colleagues by proposing to his long-time partner Ryan Bolger. \nThe next day, Liberal MP Andrew Wallace, who is a devout Catholic, shared with his colleagues how his gay daughter helped change his position on same-sex marriage. \n\"She said: Dad, in the years to come, my generation will look back and judge your generation about how you deal with the issue of homosexuality in the same way that your generation considered your parents' generation in the way that they dealt with our Indigenous people,\" Wallace said. \nFighting back tears, Liberal MP Sarah Henderson told the story Wednesday night of a close gay friend of hers who died months ago and who, in one of their last conversations, asked her to continue to push for same-sex marriage. \nSurvey says yes \nThursday's vote comes three weeks after Australia voted overwhelmingly to legalize same-sex marriage as part of a national postal survey lasting two months. \nUnder political pressure to find a solution, the ruling Liberal National Coalition government announced the non-compulsory survey in August, saying if the result was \"yes\" they would allow a free vote in Parliament. \nIn the end, 61.6% of Australia voted in favor of allowing same-sex marriage, with 38.4% saying \"no.\" \nAbout 12.7 million people participated in the survey, which had a response rate of nearly 80% -- which is considered very high. \nAustralians have long been in favor of same-sex marriage, with polling from as long as 10 years ago showing a majority support for legalizing marriage equality.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine forster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia edwards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah henderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan bolger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pew research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal national coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:24.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cab59b63a222a2e30ce1fbb668336462025a7dd7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisaGDq2UlHqrZpCpXL61UWvvcjFgSjAr1CwUPsWBMngf5ZaHpFG0ieDs-", "site_full": "www.forexfactory.com", "site": "forexfactory.com", "site_section": "http://rss.forexfactory.net/forums/interactivetrading.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FF Forums: Interactive Trading", "title": "PayTheLimit replies to: EURUSD", "title_full": "PayTheLimit replies to: EURUSD", "published": "2017-12-07T11:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn-assets.forexfactory.net/images/misc/ff_fb_logo.gif?v=0.1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2596, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cab59b63a222a2e30ce1fbb668336462025a7dd7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisaGDq2UlHqrZpCpXL61UWvvcjFgSjAr1CwUPsWBMngf5ZaHpFG0ieDs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "PayTheLimit replies to: EURUSD", "text": "PayTheLimit Joined Aug 2009 | Status: Ride the Pig | 29,415 Posts | Invisible and yes, I can see the bulls make a case on the daily...but I'm hanging my hat on the 4hr...

Fialli is joined by his father, Robert Fialli (left), a 1987 graduate who also played for Crimson Tide coach John DiBiaso (right). comments Everett High football coach John DiBiaso walked into a room full of his players today and delivered one of the toughest speeches of his illustrious career \u2014 He is stepping down as the head coach.\nDiBiaso will remain as the school\u2019s head boys basketball coach and athletic director until the end of the school year.\n\u201cIt was very difficult,\u201d DiBiaso said. \u201cI\u2019ve spent 39 years of my life in this building and it is an emotional time.\u201d\nDiBiaso nearly stepped down last year after his team beat Xaverian, 21-7, to capture the Division 1 state title. He opted to return for one last year, a season which ended in the school\u2019s 12th Super Bowl title, a 35-10 rout over Xaverian.\n\u201cI really considered leaving when (Xaverian coach) Charlie Stevenson did last year,\u201d DiBiaso said. \u201cWhen you start thinking about leaving, then you know the time is coming soon.\u201d\nWhether this is the end for DiBiaso as a football coach remains to be seen. He was noncommittal in terms of his future, knowing full well there are rumors linking him to other jobs.\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know what I am going to do next. Maybe I\u2019ll step back and take some time off from football,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, my mind is on coaching basketball.\u201d\nDiBiaso will not be part of the hiring process for his successor, but the next coach will inherit a great situation. A trio of All-Scholastics \u2014 quarterback Jake Willcox and defensive backs Lewis Cine and Mike Sainristil \u2014 return, along with linemen Jalen Smith and Wilson Frederic.\n\u201cThat was very, very important to me,\u201d DiBiaso said. \u201cThe last thing I wanted was to leave the cupboard bare.\u201d\nDiBiaso spent his first 11 years coaching at St. Patrick\u2019s (1982-87) and Weston (1988-91), leading the Wildcats to a Super Bowl title in 1991. He took over at his alma mater in 1992 and amassed an incredible 252-33-0 record.\nFrank Nuzzo played at Everett from 2000-03 as a fullback and was part of three Super Bowl champions. He said DiBiaso was not just a great coach, but a quality human being as well.\n\u201cCoach Dib was the top guy in the community, he had a lot of credibility and was someone everybody looked up to,\u201d Nuzzo said. \u201cHe always treated everybody fairly. He would treat the regular players the same way he treated the star players, and that\u2019s why everyone respected him.\u201d\nThere are many untold stories in the community of things DiBiaso did to help past and present players. Central Catholic coach Chuck Adamopoulos was witness to this a few minutes before his team faced Everett in the Div. 1 North final last month.\n\u201cA parent of one of his former players walked up to John and couldn\u2019t stop thanking him for everything he did for his son,\u201d Adamopoulos said. \u201cTo me, that said a lot about John and that\u2019s why I always had the utmost respect for him as a coach and as a person.\u201d\nOne of the schools Everett developed a friendly rivalry with was Xaverian.

Chess legend Garry Kasparov was defeated by the IBM supercomputer, Deep Blue. Fast forward 20 years, Google\u2019s AlphaGo Artificial Intelligence has defeated the world\u2019s best Go player and Microsoft Artificial Intelligence achieves a perfect score in a game of Ms. Pac Man. The former is often termed as the world\u2019s most difficult strategy game, while the latter is a timeless classic in which no human has achieved the perfect score. For Artificial Intelligence (AI) to achieve the mentioned feats shows the path computing has traversed from logic to feats based on pattern recognition, inference and reasoning. Coined in the 1950\u2019s, Artificial Intelligence has come a long way as a discipline. Today the things AI can do has transcended human expectations. And we are just beginning. 90% of the data in the world was generated in the last two years, and now we are adding about 2.5 quintillion bytes to it every day. With such humungous data, it was all but inevitable that we develop intelligent systems which work on the data at extremely high speeds. Today, AI can develop systems which are capable of performing tasks which surpass human abilities. From Robotics and Manufacturing, AI has now permeated into fields like Legal and Banking and Financial Services Industry (BFSI), which have primarily been dependant on humans. BFSI has increasingly become more competitive, with majority of the business driving on margins, yet at the same time making their mark as an innovative institution. There are many processes in the BFSI sector which are now making use of Artificial Intelligence. With the increasing risk of fraudulent practices in the financial system, there has been a growing concern to outsmart the perpetrators. Banks and financial services are increasingly adopting Artificial Intelligence systems over softwares designed on rule basis. Artificial Intelligence systems have been proven to be more intelligent and robust when detecting anti-money laundering patterns. With increasingly available data to create patterns the Artificial Intelligence systems will go on to be more predictive and hence preventive. Artificial Intelligence will make anti-money laundering as prognosis measure from a diagnostic one. An automated response from a helpdesk without human interventions is a result of yet another application of Artificial Intelligence \u2013 the Chat Bots. The chat bots produce response based on the pattern the bots devised on the queries which are fed to them. The bots have gained enough intelligence to detect human emotions and the context of conversations, and reply accordingly. They are able to maintain the balance between \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018close to human\u2019 answers. These Chat Bots will keep on collecting massive amount of data over time to be even more accurate in replicating their human responses. The roots of Chat Bot can be found in the famous \u2018Turing Test\u2019 devised way back in 1950. There are many banks and financial institutions which are already gearing up to use such services for improving the experiences of their customers. Chat Bots have the advantage of analysing customers\u2019 previous experiences and improving upon them. Recommendation Engines - a contribution of Artificial Intelligence in the BFSI industry takes data analysis of the customers to recommend targeted products to a whole new level. The quick nature of AI systems in quick cross-selling of products can be used to change the recommendations in real time, based on the consumers\u2019 changing interests. They can also be used to perform real time competitive analysis to offer customers the best possible solutions. There is too much information and not enough manpower and talent to manage it. It\u2019s becoming more and more impossible to keep up with this ever-growing demand. How do we solve this? The answer is Cognitive Computing, a subfield under AI. Cognitive computing is a powerful beast; it refers to computing that is focused on logical reasoning and understanding at a higher level, helping make high-level decisions in complex situations. This is designed to solve a wide range of problems, enhance efficiency and increase productivity. AI is at the pinnacle of digital transformation and will have a profound impact on our society and will transform our personal and professional lives. There is no denying that AI systems are powerful and like with all powerful tools, great care must be taken in their deployment. AI is the future of every industry. Industry experts already understand that cognitive computing is going to be a major disrupter. Whether we choose to embrace it to our advantage or not is probably going to determine how various sectors of the industry performs and survives going forward. Artificial Intelligence is here to stay, grow and disrupt our way of life. We will be a Don Quixote to think otherwise.

At that time I was 16 days postop after a quadruple heart bypass. This was only 11 days after being released from Cardiac ICU at St Josephs in Stockton. I knew I had a responsibility to the citizens of Manteca and an obligation to Council Member Mike Morowit to make this important meeting. As to the first meeting Ben Cantu (who wrote a letter to the editor saying he missed two GPAC meetings due to medical conditions) attended on Aug. 2, it was simply to explain the structure of the process we would be following, there was no discussion about the General plan nor of the individual Elements. I agree there might often be medical conditions that would preclude a member attending a GPAC meeting; having said that, we must all understand that if we are going to correct past history regarding the General Plan, we have to be present to do that.The original plan before the Council called for 15 members on the GPAC committee, there was no provision for alternates. My recollection is that, after the 15 selections were made by Council members, Cantu insisted that alternates also be appointed. So far, as documented in the GPAC meeting minutes, of the total members attending the meetings, the alternates have averaged a 50 percent absentee rate.Ben, since you were not there, your \u201cobservations\u201d that \u201c\u2026each meeting and workshop currently occurring is exactly (almost word for word) like each general plan update process from previous years.\u201d can be nothing other than an assumption based on your past experience, or based on erroneous information. The positive thing is that the current meetings are nothing like you describe prior update processes to be. Further, your statements in the paper that you have been involved with and prepared the previous three General Plan documents, are contradictory and worrisome in my view, when applied to your comments at the December 4th meeting when you said that all the previous General Plans had been done wrong.I respect your years and experience with the City of Manteca, but we need to respect the past experience and backgrounds all the members bring to this process. I retired over 11 years ago from the County of Kern as the IT Manager and in that time much has changed. A city is much like a county but only a smaller version. County and city governments are constantly evolving, especially with internal automation and external influences like the housing blowout. Governing priorities have to react to those changes especially as the expectations of the citizens have evolved and changed as well. Eleven years ago I could explain in detail how a Planning Department operated, how the Auditor or Treasurer/Tax Collector functioned, how the Sheriff, D.A. and Courts interacted together, etc., but that has all changed. Over those eleven years I\u2019m sure that the major automated systems I brought into those departments have been outgrown and superseded with systems even more complex.

Land Regional Division discussed the 2018-19 school calendar at their Nov. 28 meeting. \nThe calendar, which strongly resembles the ones from former years, had the typical November break, two weeks at Christmas, one week in February and one week in April. \nAs with previous years it saw the school year starting before Labour Day. \nSuperintendent Cam McKeage asked the question that faced all boards: \u201cDo we want to have a November break?\u201d \n\u201cIs it beneficial?\u201d \n\u201cBy getting out of the November break would we be out of whack with our days?\u201d asked Vice-Chair Marsha Tkach. \n\u201cWe would have to do some jigging,\u201d McKeage answered. \n\u201cWe\u2019re over the amount of minutes (of instructional time) we need,\u201d he added. \nMcKeage said while currently the division has enough instructional time as recommended by Alberta Education, they are close to the cut-off. \n\u201cAnytime you have school closures because of weather or field trips it does cut into instructional time,\u201d he advised. \n\u201cYou have to be aware of that.\u201d \nTrustees asked if the exam time and the days leading up to it counted as instructional time. \n\u201cEven though exams start a few days later there is still one-on-one instruction, review and peer tutoring,\u201d McKeage answered regarding the days directly before exams. \nTkach also noted that the division had longer days. \n\u201cHow about we make them an extra 15 minutes a day and take Fridays away,\u201d suggested Trustee Tammy Burns. \n\u201cIt would save money,\u201d agreed Trustee Shauna Davies. \n\u201cYou would save on busing and custodian costs,\u2019 agreed Chair Holli Smith. \n\u201cI think the issue for some is childcare,\u201d noted Trustee Gwen Hampton. \n\u201cMoving forward Shauna is saying we have to consider all options,\u201d Smith replied. \n\u201cThat issue came up long ago,\u201d pointed out Deputy Superintendent Steve Nielsen. \nHe said having less days would make more efficient use of students time when being bussed in. \n\u201cI would send it out to schools for feedback,\u201d recommended McKeage. \nThe board agreed to revisit the draft calendar in January after teachers and parents had a chance to voice their opinions on it. \nJIrwin@postmedia.com ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Messi has admitted that next year\u2019s World Cup in Russia is likely to be his last chance to win a major international tournament for Argentina. The 30-year-old Barcelona forward is still seeking his first senior trophy with the Albiceleste, having come painfully close in the past three and a half years as a losing finalist in the 2014 World Cup, 2015 Copa America and 2016 Copa America, reports Xinhua news agency. \u201cPeople are waiting for this group to leave because it has not won for a long time and those who criticize get tired of always seeing the same faces,\u201d Messi told TyC Sports. \u201cI think it\u2019s the last opportunity for this group.

This scheme is primarily targeting two crore homes to be built across all urban locations over the next five years. The government has put up enormous efforts to make this agenda helpful for the general as developer and investors are getting drawn out into these realty sectors. Affordable housing is gearing up the denizens to invest in these properties, which are below the horizon of their budget with the ease of cheap finance. According to an India Ratings and Research report, affordable housing finance is set to be a Rs 6 trillion market by 2022. The research agency has also anticipated a whopping demand for 25 million homes in the medium-income group (MIG) and lower-income group (LIG) categories over the coming years. The government is reaching out to developers to make \u2018Housing for all by 2022\u2019 a reality. Most of these projects are being undertaken by PMAY and buyers can get the credit-linked subsidies. An additional incentive of 39 per cent higher allocations was announced for affordable housing development this financial year under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), announced by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The scheme envisages the vision of Housing for All by the year 2022. Another one is the newly projected Public-Private Partnership Model (PPP) of development. Elaborating PPP is a broad term that can be applied to anything from a simple, short-term management contract to a long-term contract that includes funding, planning, building, operation, maintenance, and divestiture. Ssumit Berry, Managing Director, BDI Group , says: \"This is a much-needed decision by HUPA. A PPP model will aid the PMAY, and provide a much-needed push to affordable housing. PPP will increase the private sector's role in the vision of the Union government in providing everyone with a house. It will also help in overcoming the challenges faced by the real estate sector in constructing affordable housing.\" Affordable housing is an emergence towards a better India. This effort has been bestowed into existence to bring home to the country of 1.3 billion people and is likely to bring a colossal $1.3 trillion wave of investment to the housing sector over the coming years. \u201cDevelopers across India seem to be moving toward affordable housing sector to befit middle-class pockets as this segment is expected to grow with 39 per cent higher allocations, under the PMAY. All these have resulted in the uptick in the home loans resulting into the engines of growth for this sector benefitting both developers and home buyers, says Berry.

What we do know and can discern from this is that there are things happening on levels that we are simply not aware of. There's a line from the original movie Men In Black; \"There is always an Arquillian battle cruiser, or a Corillian Death Ray, or an intergalactic plague that is about to wipe out all life on this miserable little planet, and the only way these people can get on with their happy lives is that they do not know about it!\" Have you ever thought about that? Every day there are conflicts happening on physical and spiritual levels while we may not be aware, they do effect our lives.

Lianhe Wanbao, McDonald\u2019s Singapore \nWhat\u2019s up with Singapore\u2019s food scene this year? \nFirst, bubble tea enthusiasts were gobsmacked when Gong Cha was replaced by local brand LiHo in May ( only to make an overwhelming comeback on Dec 1 ). \nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough shock for food-loving Singaporeans, we\u2019ve now been hit yet again by shocking news that popular froyo chain Llaollao has been replaced by a lesser-known brand of froyo desserts called Yole (pronounced \u201cyo-lay\u201d). \nThat\u2019s not all. On Wednesday (Dec 6), McDonald\u2019s fans in Singapore were also told that one of their all-time favourite menu items \u2013 the Quarter Pounder with Cheese \u2013 has left the scene permanently. \nIn it\u2019s place is an entirely new menu item called The Original Angus, which will be a permanent item sold at all McDonald\u2019s outlets. The Original Angus McDonald\u2019s Singapore \nThis new burger is part of the fast food chain\u2019s Signature Collection, which features Australia and New Zealand-sourced Angus beef patties. \nExcept for the upgraded buns and patty, a description and photo released by McDonald\u2019s suggests that the new burger is otherwise quite similar to the Quarter Pounder with Cheese. \nBut that didn\u2019t stop fans from reacting to the news with a mix of disappointment and outrage. \nSeveral people have left comments on McDonald\u2019s Singapore\u2019s Facebook page asking for the Quarter Pounder with Cheese to be brought back, while many others also lambasted the chain for unsatisfactory servings of cheese on the new limited-time Cheesy Loaded Fries. \nBut the award for shocker of the day still goes to the sudden discontinuation of Llaollao. \nA post on the brand\u2019s official Facebook page states that at least 10 of 29 Llaollao outlets have already been re-launched as Yole. \nIn case you forgot, Spanish brand Llaollao attracted huge crowds and long queues when it first launched in Singapore in 2014. As expected, many of the dessert chain\u2019s fans were shell-shocked to learn that their go-to froyo would no longer be available in Singapore. \nAccording to a report in Channel NewsAsia, Yole is an European frozen yogurt chain which sells froyo as well as coconut soft-serve ice-cream . But other than that, there has been little information released about the brand. \nA check online reveals little about the Yole brand, except that it currently has four stores in Taiwan . \nD+1 Holding, which operates the chain, was quoted as saying that the new brand has a wider menu compared to Llaollao, and will introduce new frozen yogurt flavours on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. \nHow Singapore\u2019s Llaollao fans will take to the new brand remains to be seen, but there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s certainly on everyone\u2019s minds \u2013 why so sudden? \nBusiness Insider has reached out to D+1 Holding for comment.

He said \u201cmy view is a dead terrorist can\u2019t cause any harm to Britain.\u201d At least 800 people have left the UK to join ISIS in Iraq or Syria. Other terror experts have said they should instead be reintegrated. \nBritain\u2019s new Defence Secretary has unequivocally threatened to kill Britons who leave the country to fight for ISIS. \n\u201cI do not believe that any terrorist, whether they come from this country or any other, should ever be allowed back into this country. [\u2026] \n\u201cQuite simply my view is a dead terrorist can\u2019t cause any harm to Britain.\u201d \nWilliamson added that British fighters who flee the UK for other countries would be hunted down and prevented from returning home or finding havens in other countries. \nHe said: \u201cMake sure there is no safe space for them, that they can\u2019t go to other countries preaching their hate, preaching their cult of death.\u201d \nThis could mean seizing their passports if they try to cross international borders, the Daily Mail said. \nWilliamson\u2019s threat was harsher than that of his predecessor, Michael Fallon, who resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations last month . \nIn October, Fallon said British nationals who have chosen to fight for ISIS in Iraq or Syria have made themselves \u201ca legitimate target\u201d and \u201crun the risk every hour of every day of being on the wrong end of an RAF or a United States missile,\u201d according to The Telegraph . \nWilliamson\u2019s Wednesday remarks echoed those of Rory Stewart, an international development minister, who said last month : \u201cThe only way of dealing with them [foreign fighters] will be, in almost every case, to kill them.\u201d \nMeanwhile, Max Hill QC, the UK\u2019s official anti-terror watchdog, has said that teenagers who joined ISIS \u201cout of a sense of naivety\u201d should be reintegrated into British society so as to avoid \u201closing a generation.\u201d \nAt least 800 Britons have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight for ISIS, according to the BBC . Sally Jones, a British woman who fled to join ISIS, was reportedly killed in a drone strike last month .

Die Auswirkungen des NS-Staates auf diese Menschen und ihre Umgebung untersucht Wolfgang Kellner anhand einer Kleinstadt genauer. Der Autor offenbart die Verstrickungen der lokalen Akteure bei der \"S\u00e4uberung des Volksk\u00f6rpers\" in der Region Leer (Ostfriesland), bei der Okkupation der Niederlande und Polens. Er schildert an diesem Beispiel die \u00dcberwachung und Denunziation auf lokaler Ebene und lenkt den Blick auf fast vergessene Opfer des NS-Staates, die oft niemand namentlich erw\u00e4hnt. Das detailreiche Buch \"Verfolgung und Verstrickung\" von Wolfgang Kellner setzt sich mit dem NS-Terror und informellen Netzwerke in einer Kleinstadt auseinander. Die Leser erfahren darin, wie der Weg in den NS-Staat bereits im Kaiserreich begann. Menschen, die sich f\u00fcr unsere j\u00fcngere Geschichte interessieren und mehr \u00fcber die Hintergr\u00fcnde der Maschinerie des NS-Staates erfahren m\u00f6chten, finden in Kellners Buch eine gr\u00fcndliche Analyse, die zeigt wie Hitlers Pl\u00e4ne durch viele Helfer erst in die Tat umgesetzt werden konnten. \"Verfolgung und Verstrickung\" von Wolfgang Kellner ist ab sofort im tredition Verlag oder alternativ unter der ISBN 978-3-7439-6806-6 zu bestellen.
