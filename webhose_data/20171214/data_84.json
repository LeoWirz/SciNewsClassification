The victim, who was released by the police in Abuja on Wednesday, after uproar on the social media, said he saw hell in the hands of police personnel, who dehumanised and treated him like a criminal. \nSpeaking to journalists on his experience, Motoni explained that he was not informed about his crime, adding that the policemen simply said he was arrested for \u201cinciting the populace and trying to impeach the Emir of Bida.\u201d \nMotoni\u2019s troubles began when he visited Niger State last Saturday to sensitise residents of the Niger South Senatorial District to the zonal intervention projects awarded to their constituency in the 2017 budget. \nThe projects were the installation of transformers and electrification of Nowanya-Tawadzuru, Tiffin-Emitswachi-Tawadzuru and Tako communities in the Gbako Local Government Area, Niger South Senatorial District, Niger State as stated in the 2017 Appropriation Act. Moroni was arrested on Tuesday after he was tricked into visiting the DHL office at Markafi Market, Kaduna, to pick a parcel. He was reportedly forced into vehicle and brought to Abuja by policemen who disguised as DHL personnel. \nThe BudgIT worker explained that he simply enlightened the people about the constituency projects and how to track the budget, noting that he was surprised by the allegations that he wanted to incite the public and impeach the traditional ruler in the area. \nHe said, \u201cI was arrested in Kaduna and our journey from there to Abuja was hell for me because I was handcuffed on both legs and my elbows were handcuffed to a chair, which dislocated my joints. \n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sitting; I squatted from Kaduna to Abuja, which was a journey of about two and a half hours. It was when I got to Abuja that I was told about the reason for my arrest.\u201d \nMotoni denied that his engagement with the Bida community would lead to a breach of the peace, noting that the idea of budget tracking was to encourage the community members to engage their representatives at the National Assembly and ensure that the projects were implemented. \n\u201cThey (policemen) said they got a complaint that I was trying to incite the public, create a breach of trust and impeach the Emir. But this is not true; I went to the community to educate the people on how they can engage their representatives on the implementation of the projects,\u201d he stated. \nThe civic worker said he was not cowed by his detention, noting that he would still visit Niger State to continue his advocacy. The team lead, BudgIT, Oluseun Onigbinde, explained that the budget tracking project was meant to simplify the budget and create citizens awareness about the fiscal document so they could demand accountability from their representatives. \nHe condemned Motoni\u2019s arrest, which he alleged was instigated by the NASS representatives from the area. He explained that shortly after the town hall meeting, a senator had made a phone call to Motoni, inviting him to a meeting in his house, which he declined \u201cbecause BudgIT tracking personnel were not allowed to meet with public officials privately.\u201d \nOnigbinde said, \u201cAfter this, we believe the senator reached out to the Nigeria Police Force and accused Motoni of plotting to topple the Emir of Bida following which he was arrested, handcuffed and taken to SARS\u2019 office in Abuja.\u201d \n\u201cWe condemn this abuse of power by the police and we plan to take up the issue with President Muhammadu Buhari and the Senate President; we will also reach out to the United Nations and the United States on this issue,\u201d he added. \nThe police could not be reached for comment as the mobile phone of the Force spokesman, Jimoh Moshood, rang out. He had also yet to reply to a text message sent to his phone as of the time of filing this report. \nstay tune for more info.

Chain Reaction is basically a report card, showing how well major fast-food (and -casual) restaurants are doing at limiting their reliance on meat products raised on antibiotics. Here\u2019s a look at 2017\u2019s scorecard : \nAs you can see, far more restaurants earn an \u201cF\u201d than an \u201cA.\u201d Many of them probably don\u2019t want you to see this scorecard. \nThe NRDC\u2019s report looks at where restaurants are getting meat and poultry, their policies, the total amount of antibiotics in their meat products, and how transparent restaurants are about their sourcing practices. Chipotle and Panera are doing a great job because they\u2019ve stopped getting poultry, beef and pork from sources that raise them on antibiotics. \nWhile Subway \u2019s poultry no longer contains antibiotics , the same can\u2019t be said for its beef and pork. According to the NRDC, Subway is on a \u201clong timeline\u201d towards serving you beef or pork sandwiches without antibiotics. The same can be said for the other brands with a passing grade that don\u2019t earn an \u201cA.\u201d They\u2019ve made steps towards eliminating or limiting poultry raised on antibiotics. But when it comes to antibiotic-free pork and beef, they\u2019re still working on implementing policies. If you go to any of these restaurants, it\u2019s best to order the chicken. \nSo, what\u2019s the problem with antibiotics in meat and poultry? One word: resistance. \nAntibiotic-resistant superbugs are increasingly threatening people\u2019s health, in part because we\u2019re consuming meat that\u2019s been pumped full of drugs: 70 percent of the antibiotics we take are also used to grow livestock 88 percent of swine receive antibiotics to promote growth and prevent disease (even before disease is detected) Almost all dairy cows receive prophylactic antibiotics \nAdditionally, antibiotics add more pollution to the environment. Nearly 90 percent of these drugs are excreted in an animal\u2019s urine, and 75 percent are excreted in feces. Then, they can enter water tables and get picked up by insects. \nScientists have been noting an increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria and wondering what, exactly, is the cause. Tuberculosis, a bacterial disease, is on the list of public health concerns . It\u2019s re-emerging with an antibiotic-resistant nature after many thought it was under control. \nWhen we\u2019re overexposed to antibiotics in food sources, on top of exposure from prescriptions, it helps bacteria develop a resistance to antibiotics. The CDC estimates that antibiotic-resistant infections cause a minimum of 2 million illnesses per year and at least 23,000 deaths. According to the CDC : \nScientists around the world have provided strong evidence that antibiotic use in food animals can lead to resistant infections in humans. Studies have shown that: Antibiotic use in food animals allows antibiotic-resistant bacteria to grow and crowd out the bacteria that do respond to antibiotics; Resistant bacteria can contaminate food from the animals; and Resistant bacteria in food can cause infections in humans \nFurthermore, antibiotic-resistant infections aren\u2019t the only problem with using drugs to grow food animals. \nAccording to the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition ( NSAC ): \u201cLarge-scale concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs)\u201d that use antibiotics also pose a \u201csignificant\u201d threat to the environment. CAFOs are \u201cknown emitters of air pollutants \u2013 such as hydrogen sulfide and volatile organic compounds \u2013 and are also a significant source of water pollutants, including nitrogen, phosphorus, pathogens, antibiotics, pesticides and heavy metals.\u201d \nEssentially, the unsanitary, tightly packed conditions that make animals need antibiotics in the first place are also harmful to the environment. \nFast food brands could help by only buying meat and poultry from farms that practice sustainable agriculture \u2014 agriculture that doesn\u2019t depend on antibiotics to grow animals. According to Sustainable Table : \u201cToday, many animal farmers do not use antibiotics at all, in large part because they don\u2019t have to compensate for unhealthy conditions associated with CAFO production systems. On these types of farms, animals are raised in clean environments with adequate space to reduce animal stress and the likelihood of infections.\u201d \nThe NRDC reports that fast-food restaurants sell a quarter of all chicken products in the US, and McDonald\u2019s is the largest beef buyer. If fast-food chains throughout the country can follow Panera\u2019s and Chipotle\u2019s example and commit to only buying meat from farms that don\u2019t use antibiotics, they may help stop the spread of antibiotic-resistant superbugs and benefit the environment by helping promote sustainable agriculture practices. \nDaniel Matthews earned his Bachelor's in Creative Writing from Boise State University.

Deo Akiiki, deputy spokesman for the Ugandan military, said Thursday that 281 troops will leave Somalia by Dec. 31. \nAkiiki said that under an agreement between the African Union and the U.N. Security Council the number of all African peacekeepers in Somalia will be reduced by 1,000 before the end of 2017. \nUganda has over 6,000 troops deployed in Somalia as part of the multi-national African Union force. Other African countries such as Burundi and Kenya also contribute to the regional force. \nThe Western-backed deployments have helped to push Islamic extremists out of Somalia's capital and other centers, even though the rebels still make frequent bombing attacks targeting public places.

More >> More >> \nJERUSALEM (AP) - The Latest on the fallout from President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital (all times local): \n10:30 a.m. \nSaudi Arabia's royal court, led by King Salman and his powerful son, are condemning the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nIt's a rare public rebuke by the royal court of U.S. ally and President Donald Trump. \nSaudi Arabia, a regional powerhouse that could help the White House push through a Middle East settlement, said on Thursday the kingdom had already warned against this step and \"continues to express its deep regret at the U.S. administration's decision,\" describing it \"unjustified and irresponsible.\" \nTrump's move puts the Sunni nation in a bind. The kingdom, particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. \nU.S. Embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa have warned American citizens of possible protests as a result of Trump's decision. \n___ \n9:40 a.m. \nSchools and shops are closed in the West Bank, as Palestinians are protesting President Donald Trump's recognition of contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nPolitical groups have called for protest marches in West Bank town centers at noon on Thursday. \nTrump's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. \nThe Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. In recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Trump was seen as siding with Israel which claims the entire city. \n___ \n9:30 a.m. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is accusing his American counterpart of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" by declaring the divided holy city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nErdogan also compared President Donald Trump to a \"blender\" that is stirring up trouble in the region. \nThe Turkish leader said, addressing Trump: \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it.\" \nErdogan added that \"political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace.\" \nHe also said: \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right,' he is mistaken.\" \nErdogan spoke to a group of workers on Thursday who had gathered at Ankara's airport, before he departed for an official visit to Greece. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nPalestinians, Israelis and the wider Middle East are bracing for the fallout after President Donald Trump's seismic shift in recognizing the bitterly contested Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was to travel to Jordan on Thursday to meet with King Abdullah II. The monarch is seen as Abbas' closest Arab ally, and the two leaders might try to coordinate a response to Trump's policy change. \nIn Wednesday's move, Trump defied worldwide warnings and insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, describing his decision as merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. \nTrump also said the United States would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable for that.

The model and university student denies any intent to insult. \nTurkish media reported that the tweet, which has since been erased, said: \"I got my period on the morning of the July 15 martyrs' day. I'm marking the day by bleeding as a representation of the martyrs' blood.\" \nThe posting caused uproar on social media. \nA court must accept the indictment before a trial date is set. \nRunner-up Asli Sumen was given the title and represented Turkey at the Miss World competition in China.

Some clips: There are three main critiques of big tech. The first is that it is destroying the young. Social media promises an end to loneliness but actually produces an increase in solitude and an intense awareness of social exclusion. Texting and other technologies give you more control over your social interactions but also lead to thinner interactions and less real engagement with the world. The second critique of the tech industry is that it is causing this addiction on purpose, to make money. Tech companies understand what causes dopamine surges in the brain and they lace their products with \u201chijacking techniques\u201d that lure us in and create \u201ccompulsion loops.\u201d The third critique is that Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook are near monopolies that use their market power to invade the private lives of their users and impose unfair conditions on content creators and smaller competitors. The political assault on this front is gaining steam. The big breakthrough will come when tech executives clearly acknowledge the central truth: Their technologies are extremely useful for the tasks and pleasures that require shallower forms of consciousness, but they often crowd out and destroy the deeper forms of consciousness people need to thrive...Online is a place for human contact but not intimacy. Online is a place for information but not reflection. Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel wrote that we take a break from the distractions of the world not as a rest to give us more strength to dive back in, but as the climax of living. \u201cThe seventh day is a palace in time which we build. It is made of soul, joy and reticence,\u201d he said. By cutting off work and technology we enter a different state of consciousness, a different dimension of time and a different atmosphere, a \u201cmine where the spirit\u2019s precious metal can be found.\u201d Imagine if instead of claiming to offer us the best things in life, tech merely saw itself as providing efficiency devices. Its innovations can save us time on lower-level tasks so we can get offline and there experience the best things in life. Imagine if tech pitched itself that way. That would be an amazing show of realism and, especially, humility, which these days is the ultimate and most disruptive technology.
