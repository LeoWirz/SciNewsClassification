As such, this global pinnacle must go far beyond what the world expects from a luxury vehicle. \u201d Toshio Asahi, Chief Engineer \nThe original Lexus LS was the result of six years\u2019 work by 1,400 engineers to build a luxury car that would rival the best in the world. This Project F1 delivered the first LS in 1989, launching the Lexus brand. \nAlmost 30 years later, the all-new, fifth-generation LS flagship saloon extends the boundaries of automotive luxury, drawing on the proud history of its predecessors while breaking new ground in design, technology and performance. \nThis is the first in a series of six articles that will cover many key aspects of the new model, from exterior and interior design to exhilarating performance, imaginative technology, Takumi craftsmanship and Omotenashi. 2018 Lexus LS: exterior design \u201cWith my team, we wanted to produce something completely new, with unique proportions. Our goal was a car that was longer, lower and wider with a more powerful presence.\u201d Koichi Saga, Chief Designer \nAs the flagship of the range, the LS has always played a pivotal role in defining Lexus, embodying the brand\u2019s image and what it stands for. With the new LS saloon, there was an opportunity to tear up the rulebook and create something with its own unique identity. \nThe low-slung, coupe-like silhouette eschews the established saloon car form, without compromising the interior spaciousness and comfort that are fundamental to a flagship luxury vehicle. \nThe designers were helped in their mission by the new Global Architecture-Luxury platform, which allows for a longer wheelbase, spacious interior and a lower, ground-hugging appearance. \nThere is incredible attention to detail in evidence throughout the car\u2019s exterior, not least in the powerful interpretation of the spindle grille. This intricate design has 5,000 individual surfaces which took a highly-skilled CAD modeller six months to develop. \nThe grille is central to the new LS\u2019s beautifully sculpted design, acting as the starting point for the lines that flow through the body and converge at the rear. \nThe front of the car is given even more presence by the slimline, triple bi-LED headlights, which are set in an L configuration that wraps around the front of the car. \nA strong shoulder line running from front to rear emphasises the LS\u2019s ground-hugging appearance and low centre of gravity, while the lines of the front and rear wings are slanted forward, hinting at the car\u2019s dynamic qualities. \nThe shoulder line then flows through to the rear, linking to the LED headlights, which are instantly recognisable as belonging to a Lexus thanks to their strong \u2018L\u2019 motif. The shoulder line then folds down and back on itself, echoing the lines of the spindle grille at the front. \nThe Lexus LS is available with new alloy wheel designs and a choice of 12 different paint finishes.

Two people were burned in one new hot spot, known as the Lilac Fire, which was about 45 miles north of San Diego. Officials didn't release the nature of the injuries to the burn victims nor give their conditions. The 4,100-acre fire is moving at an \"extremely rapid rate,\" and burning west toward the Vista and Oceanside communities, officials said. A total of 20 structures were destroyed, according to Cal Fire. Many of those were mobile homes in a community next to where the fire started, said Ron Lane, the deputy chief administrative officer for San Diego County. Read More To the north in Ventura County, the numbers were much more ominous. The four-day old Thomas Fire had burned 115,000 acres and destroyed 439 buildings, damaging 85 others. Another new fire, just to the north of the Lilac Fire, had consumed 300 acres. That blaze, called the Liberty Fire, is 10% contained. The wildfires are testing the stamina of firefighters and military personnel, who have been laboring almost nonstop. On top of exhaustion from the long hours, they're also trying to stave off the effects of smoke inhalation and the airborne embers irritating their eyes. At least 190,000 residents have been evacuated as 5,700 firefighters work to contain the blazes, Cal Fire officials said. \"Honestly, the firefighters are taking a beating, but we have to acknowledge the residents because they're taking a beating, too, but they're cooperating with our orders,\" Thomas Kruschke, spokesman for the Ventura County Fire Department, said earlier. See photos of the fierce wildfires in Southern California The state National Guard's 146th Airlift Wing out of Oxnard has also joined the fight, even though roughly 50 of the National Guardsmen involved had to be evacuated themselves, said spokeswoman Maj. Kimberly Holman. Three lost their homes in the blazes, she said. The fires have pushed 110,000 Californians from their homes. Compounding problems Thursday were dry weather and merciless winds, with gusts predicted to reach the strength of a Category 1 hurricane in mountainous areas. Almost half of the total number of firefighters are assigned to the massive Thomas Fire alone, officials said. Officials have shut down hundreds of schools spanning at least 16 districts. It could go down as one of the most destructive fires in state history , and at one point, spread over 31,000 acres in the span of about nine hours -- roughly an acre a second. At that rate, it would have consumed New York's Central Park in about 15 minutes. The plume from the fire stretches 1,000 miles into the Pacific Ocean. The fire is the most destructive ever in December (due to the number of buildings destroyed), according to Cal Fire records posted online. 7 images that show why the Southern California wildfires are so dangerous Latest developments \u2022 New measures: Fire officials said Thursday brought a historic fire danger score and prompted them to upgrade their color-coding system to include purple for the first time.

Police drove through the neighborhood announcing a mandatory evacuation around 4:30 a.m., he said. The family's car was already packed with hospital bags, changes of clothes, laptops, photos, passports, dog food and important financial documents. Why the California wildfires are spreading so quickly \"Last trip back inside I grabbed my ketubah off the wall and headed out,\" he said, using the Hebrew word for a wedding contract. On Thursday, Rosenberg and his wife were staying with his in-laws in Carpinteria, about 25 minutes from Ventura, and \"We can see the billowing smoke clouds in the distance,\" he said. Purple is the new red The battle to contain the blaze is especially difficult on the Santa Barbara-Ventura County line, where the terrain is steep and rugged, said Kruschke, the Ventura County fire official. Fire officials hope to get as many as a dozen helicopters in the air Thursday, but the winds have been playing havoc on the choppers and fixed-wing aircraft, he said. Thursday afternoon, in the eerie, sepia-colored haze, firefighters could be seen setting a back fire on the northwest flank of the Thomas Fire. Well before sundown, the back fires added more smoke but seemed to help hold a fire line built in a canyon on the county line.

An AL&S has to do that; their other watches have spoiled me. Marius \nLange has always been one of my favourite brands. Having lived in Dresden for a few years, I had the opportunity to experience this brand firsthand before it achieved the level of fame of today. Nevertheless, over the last few years, Lange seems to be on a rather unconvincing and lackluster path. \nFirstly, it appears that the Richemont Group has adopted a very Panerai-esque strategy for Lange. Over the last years, Lange has released quite a few timepieces as \u201cHomage to Walter Mitty\u201d, \u201cHomage to the Lange boutique in Dresden\u201d, \u201cHomage to the new duty-free shop in Bangkok\u201d etcetera. In my view, Lange should leave the limited editions for awesome brands such as H\u00fcblotter, Paneristi, or Undone. \nSecondly, I have always admired Lange because although they manufactured high-end, highly-finished watches, they always focused on creating very legible as well as practical timepieces. To me, Lange is the Rolex of the upper echalon because it focuses on a very practical approach, and its watches can very easily be worn on a daily basis. Yet, this new reference is gimmicky just for the sake of being gimmicky. I don\u2019t see the purpose of having two seconds indicators, and I don\u2019t understand why you would install a jumping seconds indicator that can be activated only for \u201cbrief periods.\u201d \nLastly, Lange is starting to push its prices to stratospheric levels. Sure, I agree that the quality level displayed by Lange is slightly superior to The Holy Trinity (Patek, Vacheron, Audemars), but even so, I find their watches quite overpriced. For instance, this watch costs almost $50,000, and to me, it doesn\u2019t even look like a $20,000 watch. Even if you take into account the jumping seconds complication (which works only for \u201cbrief periods\u201d), I still don\u2019t see how it can cost $50,000. Personally, I would use the $50,000 to get a JLC Duometre \u00e0 Chronographe ($42,000) AND a Reverso Tribute 1931, and engrave on the caseback \u201cPush harder, me\u201d referring to my Thai ladyboy. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6412d67566dbc97ab8fc383d4a864cde911912230d2b1076c19a4220a9ca005a.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e8c3de229a5bd8cbb8ab111fb813be87a8d92f10422be72635ce05f982b08b0d.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e8f2e503c139d0fdf8a7d3669bfe473f5f89f41fae74017d39946c5ba212acac.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f4fa116a9f9fffe155ca039e567286973cdff6c1bec1481f91728fcf3df64539.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/37023f8ac77efe8f3a9bb3ba7c1363ed890071868092bbbf381177dc252e74eb.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0824909d2b4135532ebbaefec82ecb37b5dffd326774921ad6b78bd9d17d4074.jpg BNABOD \n\u201cPush harder, me\u201d got to say you are quite creative Marius. Some will even go as far as calling it a sign of intelligence so chapeau \nAfter a successful day a week ago, are you flush enough to buy the JLC? Rupert Muller \nI completely agree with everything you say, Marius. And I also like your price comparisons that you draw for many of the watches presented on ABTW. \nHowever, I think the price comparison is only an argument for the poor, which, as you surely know, do not live in Monaco. Someone that is in the market for one of these \u201cHomage to Walter Lange\u201d watches with this absolutely silly complication couldn\u2019t care less about a comparison to the Duometre and Reverso. Because he already OWNS a Duometre and three Reversos. \nThe same is true for your recent comparison between the Spike Lee Daytona and the Lange 1 / regular Daytona. Someone interested in the flashy Brooklyn Daytona for sure already owns a Lange 1 and Paul Newman Daytona (and maybe even three Ladyboys). Lincolnshire Poacher \nI\u2019m going to echo that sentiment Marius. You do post some lovely/interesting pictures of alternative watches in you\u2019re posts. I must be ill, I\u2019m giving out free praise. Just ignore me. Terance Hill \nI openly admit I don\u2019t know a lot about watches but I\u2019m learning. . But I think this guy just schooled you in a rich classy kinda way. egznyc \nThose are each beautiful watches. One with its beautiful complications and the other for its simplicity- and both so well balanced. I\u2019ll only dream of spending my hard-earned money on the likes of these. BNABOD \nAll these watches are starting to look exactly the same to me w variations of the same topic. Tribute to Winnie the Pooh, spike Lee edition for a man that still feel oppressed while leaving large, Jesus and his Undone and today the Adolph tribute for 50Gs w a useless complication. Now ok ALS blah blah nice brand great finish good reputation but can we please attempt to get back to reality price wise. Bored to death already w these Ranchracer \nYawn. TheChuphta \nA friend of mine in college had a Pontiac that had a digital \u201cheads up\u201d display that would project the car\u2019s speed onto the bottom of the windshield to save the driver the effort of looking all the way down at the dashboard. I thought it was the dumbest thing ever. This has blown it out of the water at only about 8x the price. \nThey\u2019ve made a watch with the most generic, uninspired design paired with a perplexingly redundant and fundamentally useless complication.

You don\u0092t get high from these products,\u0094 he said. \u0093It makes you feel better.\u0094\nEachus said he wants the products to be available in the area.\nLarry Danko, owner of Danko\u0092s, said he plans to attend the forum on Thursday and try the products and he may sell them at his fitness facility in the future.\nState law gives people under a doctor\u0092s care access to medical marijuana if they suffer from an illness on a list of 17 qualifying conditions.\nFor someone who has something like back pain, however, they can\u0092t get medical marijuana and Eachus said, \u0093The next best thing is this.\u0094\n\u0093We want to inform people that there are products to help people now,\u0094 Eachus said. \u0093This is an all-natural thing that can help people who are on opioids. When people get prescribed an opioid at a doctor, 25 percent of those people abuse it.\u0094\nSolt, 55, a Coughlin High School graduate who played for the Indianapolis Colts and the Philadelphia Eagles, spoke in favor of using the products for pain relief from injuries.\nHe said he has been operated on at least 13 times on everything from his wrists to his shoulders and knees.\nAfter talking to Eachus\u0092 father, former State Rep. Todd Eachus, Solt learned about CBD products derived from hemp extract.\nHe said he takes two capsules every day and feels better.\nHe also finds the products to be a better alternative than Vicodin and Oxycontin.\n\u0093You want to get high? Try taking some of that stuff doctors give you after surgery.

SEE ALSO: SGX proposes to fix weak spots in disclosure rules \nThe SGX has recommended that interested person transactions (IPT) that are under S$100,000 to no longer be exempted from announcements or shareholder vote, in addition to greater notice on the nature of the relationship with the interested person. \nThe bourse operator is also suggesting that the relevant director, chief executive or controlling shareholder of the issuer who will be covered by the IPT mandate, be identified. \nIn terms of significant transactions and loans, the SGX is proposing additional disclosures for loans that are not part of the issuer's ordinary course of business. \nIt wants companies to explain why no valuation was done for an acquisition or disposal of assets that is a major transaction. The exception will be if the transaction involved shares. \nThe SGX is also suggesting the appointment of a competent and independent valuer for significant asset disposals. \nTan Boon Gin, CEO of Singapore Exchange Regulation said: \"We are proposing to recalibrate the disclosure regime using a risk-based approach following extensive engagements with investors, companies, and other stakeholders. The additional disclosures we are proposing address key areas of concern of the market and the exchange.\" \nThe public can submit feedback on the proposed listing rule changes till Jan 12, 2018. \nIf adopted, the SGX said that it expects to implement the changes in 2018.

League exit \nTwice finalists in the last four seasons, Atletico Madrid\u2019s Champions League campaign came to an abrupt end this time round as they failed to reach the last 16 for the first time in five seasons.\nDiego Simeone admitted his side were \u201ccondemned\u201d by their inability to beat Azerbaijani Champions League debutants Qarabag over two games as despite taking four points from a possible six off group winners Roma, they finished third also behind Chelsea in Group C.\nHaving just moved into a new 310 million euro ($367 million) stadium at the Wanda Metropolitano, which will host next season\u2019s Champions League final, and broken the club\u2019s transfer record to bring Diego Costa back to the Spanish capital in January, an early Champions League exit is also an untimely financial blow.\nHere, AFP Sports looks at the repercussions for Atletico.\n\u2013 Financial fallout \u2013 \nIn six years in charge, Simeone has transformed Atletico from perennial underachievers on the field which has, in turn, dragged the economic power of the club into Europe\u2019s elite.\nAccording to Deloitte\u2019s Football Money League, Atletico had the 13th highest income in world football in the 2015/16 season and revenue is expected to increase in the long run thanks to the greater capacity of the Wanda Metropolitano.\nHowever, Atletico made 69.6 million euros in prize money and TV revenue from the Champions League alone in 2015/16.\nEven with an extended run in the Europa League, Madrid sports daily AS reported on Wednesday Atletico are likely to pick up just 30 million euros from a failed European campaign.\n\u2013 Player exodus? \u2013 \nAtletico will be able to register new players for the first time in 18 months from January 1 after a FIFA imposed transfer ban with nearly 100 million euros already committed to the signings of Costa and Spanish international Vitolo.\nThe club also made a huge financial effort to put key players Antoine Griezmann, Koke and Saul Niguez on improved contracts during the transfer ban.\nSpanish media reported on Wednesday that at least two and possibly three players will need to be sold in January to help Atletico balance the books.\nFringe players such as Kevin Gameiro, Nicolas Gaitan and Sime Vrsaljko are more likely to leave immediately.\nHowever, Atletico\u2019s fear remains that Griezmann, the club\u2019s top scorer for the past three seasons, will be lured away come the summer with his 100 million euro buyout clause easily attainable for interested giants like Manchester United, Barcelona or Real Madrid.\n\u201cCompletely the opposite,\u201d Simeone responded when asked if he was concerned about an exodus after Tuesday\u2019s 1-1 draw at Chelsea. \u201cWe turn the negatives into the positives.\u201d\nAtletico will at least be able to count on their charismatic coach, who extended his own deal to 2020 in September.\n\u2013 Europa League consolation \u2013 \nThe last time Atletico failed to make it out of the group stages of the Champions League was back in 2009/10, when they went to win the first of two Europa League titles in three seasons.\n\u201cThere is no point crying over spilt milk, look forward to the Europa League,\u201d Madrid sports daily AS\u2019s editorial said on Wednesday.\n\u201cThe final won in Hamburg (in 2010) built the foundations for a glorious period for Atletico.\u201d\nTwo years later in Bucharest, it was Simeone\u2019s first trophy as Atletico boss.

Raspberry leaf tea is a herbal remedy, not to be confused with raspberry fruit tea.\nMany herbalists consider raspberry leaf tea or capsules to be a good way of preparing for labour and birth. They believe that it helps the cervix to soften up, easing labour, and possibly making it quicker. A few small studies seem to back up these claims, although more research is needed to say for sure that it works.\nAlways talk to your midwife or a medical herbalist with experience of pregnancy before drinking the tea or taking capsules. Raspberry leaf contains chemicals which act in exactly the same way as drugs, and it's important to make sure you're taking a dose that's safe for you and your growing baby.\nThere are some circumstances where raspberry leaf tea can be particularly risky for you and your baby. You shouldn't take it at all if:\n* You're expecting twins or more.\n* Your baby is in a breech position.\n* You've had a premature labour before.\n* You've had vaginal bleeding in the second half of pregnancy.\n* A previous labour lasted only three hours or less, from start to finish.\n* You're scheduled to have a planned caesarean, or have had a caesarean before.\n* You've had any complications or health problems in your pregnancy, including high blood pressure.\n* You have a family or personal history of breast or ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or fibroids.\n* If you do decide to drink raspberry tea, always talk to your midwife first. It's best to start when you're about 32 weeks pregnant, starting with one cup a day, and gradually increasing to three cups. If you don't like the taste of the tea, you can buy raspberry leaf capsules in health food stores \u2013 just be sure to follow the directions on the pack.\n*\n* The biologically active compounds found in raspberry leaf tea take time to build up in your body, so you should ideally start drinking it a good few weeks before you\u2019d expect to go into labour.\n*\n* If you go overdue, it's fine to carry on drinking the tea or taking the capsules if you've already been taking raspberry leaf for a few weeks. But don't suddenly start taking a lot of it once you're past your due date. This may cause contractions that are so intense that they cause distress to your baby.\n*\n* If you have strong Braxton Hicks contractions after drinking the tea, cut down on the amount you drink, or stop taking it.\n*\n* During early labour, while you are at home, you can either sip hot tea or suck ice cubes made from the tea. You could also take a flask of the tea with you into hospital or birth centre. However, don't take the tea if your labour is being induced, or if you are having treatment with a hormone drip to speed up labour. \u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:14:22.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8bf383f7fbb553ddf56426958750370edc348b5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLtsGSwLqD9K1qikmfvDibDJKS3O0hzP8JAnx0QhyX8JSGG0EDgz5YXMA0ZoMj5Q35.90wpiljVEoswjv3h5VuZqSOO7O2csq05g--", "site_full": "floridastate.forums.rivals.com", "site": "rivals.com", "site_section": "https://floridastate.forums.rivals.com/forums/seminole-hoops-talk.42/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Seminole Hoops Talk | Warchant.com", "title": "We have to be ranked higher than UF next poll...

It\u2019s not really been a conscious choice, but I\u2019ve had some of the best Christmas parties, drinks, and experiences doing them! If you\u2019re in London and looking for something different to do (or if you\u2019re sick of the traditional Christmas already) why not give these a go? Fireside Drinks \nThe Kitty Hawk, 11, 13 & 14 South Place, EC2M 7EB | Moorgate or Liverpool Street Stations \nForget roasting chestnuts by the fire \u2013 it\u2019s time to drink, chat and be merry round the fire instead! I really enjoyed visiting The Kitty Hawk a few weeks ago to try their Christmas menu and drinks too \u2013 they do delicious mocktails alongside their cocktails, great vegetarian options, and more. But the real highlight is their high table with live fire\u2026 So cosy! \nNot-So Christmassy Cuisine \nAcross London \nI walked past a sign outside a restaurant in Soho last weekend, and it said \u201c\u2018Tis the season for a Thai Curry\u201d. It made my laugh, and then realise that all I\u2019ve done since December started was eat Asian cuisine! It makes quite a nice change though \u2013 with so many meet-ups and gatherings around the holiday season, alternative eateries make a welcome change to the usual roast dinner. My favourites so far have been Ping Pong\u2019s dim sum and Dishoom\u2019s Bombay-meets-Gatsby curries! Santa\u2019s Workshops \nAcross London \nLast year I really enjoyed getting crafty, making my own wreath and even trying a little macram\u00e9! This year, I\u2019m planning on doing something similar using Airbnb\u2019s Festive Experiences . They\u2019ve curated a series of workshops in and around London including ceramic painting, woodcut printing, and gingerbread house making! \nFinnish Christmas \nSouth Bank Centre, Belvedere Road, SE1 8XX | Waterloo or Embankment Stations \nI love South Bank Centre\u2019s take on Christmas. In fact, I love South Bank Centre\u2019s take on most things \u2013 down to the lobster and lips decorations on their Christmas trees! However, it\u2019s their Finnish Rooftop Sauna that has caught my eye. I love a good spa session, so to do so outside in chilly London air has me intrigued! Definitely on my wishlist this year. \nChristmas Carnival \nCarnaby Street, Soho, W1F | Piccadilly Circus or Oxford Circus Stations \nIf the huge fir trees, mistletoe and lights at Covent Garden seem a bit too clich\u00e9, try heading to Carnaby Street\u2019s carnival-themed lights! Carnaby Street has probably been called alternative far too many times, but their giant parrots, party poppers and palm trees are the antithesis to all that fake snow. One of my favourite displays this year! \nWinter Rollercoasters \nWinter Wonderland, Hyde Park | Marble Arch or Hyde Park Corner Stations \nThe final one on my list is the terribly cheesy but delightful Winter Wonderland. I went a few weeks ago with friends and was surprised at just how large the place is! When I think of Christmas I don\u2019t usually think of rollercoasters but I almost died of laughter on the Wild Mouse rollercoaster \u2013 it\u2019s worth going just for the fun of it!

Why The Globalists Need A War... And Soon Dec 7, 2017 5:00 AM 0 \nAuthored by Brandon Smith via Alt-Market.com, \nIt is difficult to gauge and understand geopolitical and economic events without first comprehending the fact that much of what happens in the world is engineered to happen and with a specific encompassing goal in mind. If you subscribe to the theory that all is random \"chaos\" and outcomes are circumstantial or coincidental, then you will be lost in the dark on most things. If you think a globalist \"conspiracy\" would require \"too much control\" or foresight, I would point out that organized conspiracy by people in power is a matter of history, not of theory. If such cabals were prevalent in the past, it is rather foolish to dismiss the reality that they are prevalent today. \nIn my articles \" The Economic End Game Explained\" and \"The Economic End Game Continues,\" I outline considerable evidence supporting the following conclusion: International financiers and political puppets in Western AND Eastern countries share a deep rooted ideology called \"globalism\" or the \"new world order.\" T his ideology demands total centralization of economy and government resulting in a single global fiscal authority, a single global monetary system and a one world ruling structure. Obviously, such a pursuit would take extensive time and planning. It is a long term project, with moments of accelerated change. \nThe globalists refer to the process of their intended change as the \"global economic reset.\" A reset of the world's economic processes is not so far fetched as skeptics like to argue. When an organized group of ideologues maintains control over the currency production and interest rates of most nations on the planet, it would hardly be difficult to manipulate politicians, manipulate legislation or even scientifically conjure financial bubbles and collapses. By extension, it would also be simple to trigger international conflicts if needed. \nBut why would war be a necessary ingredient to globalization? \nWar is the ultimate distraction, the ultimate divider and, perhaps ironically, the ultimate consolidator. In the past century, war always seems to follow or coincide with economic crisis events that are later exposed as products of the banking elites and their aggressive monetary policies. And, in the aftermath of these wars, supranational institutions are often founded (like the League of Nations, the United Nations, the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund) as \"solutions\" to preventing mass tragedies from ever happening again. War is a social steroid promoting mutation, usually in an unhealthy way. \nIn recent years the concept of \"world war\" has given way to a more insidious trend of constant and sporadic regional wars. In most cases these regional wars have helped to contribute to the steady downfall of the U.S. through accumulating national debts as well as international distrust or hatred. In fact, one might conclude that if we were to look at the macro-picture of the vast array of regional wars being perpetrated by the globalists we would see that all of them combined are amounting to a kind of world war in a different form. \nThat said, the globalists will need a new and far larger catalyst for their reset, and soon. Why? Because a sizable distraction is essential to the next phase of the ongoing collapse. A pervasive scapegoat is needed; one that can be blamed for almost any negative scenario. This draws public attention away from the globalists themselves as the culprits behind fiscal crisis, maybe so much so that it will take decades before the mainstream ever questions what actually happened, if they ever question anything at all. \nThe fear generated through an uncertain war also acts as a form of psychological alchemy, transmuting the collective public mindset to accept centralization they never would have accepted otherwise. \nHere is the issue at hand \u2014 central banks are seeking a monetary reset more than anything else. A monetary reset demands massive debt, followed by massive stimulus, followed by fiscal tightening, then massive inflation, followed by currency implosion that opens the door to a replacement structure (most likely in the form of blockchain technology and cyrptocurrency). The credit crisis of 2008 conveniently provided at least two of these elements so far, vast debt and stimulus measures. Today, we are beginning to witness the fiscal tightening phase of this process. \nAs I have been warning since before the Fed taper of QE, the central bank trend will lead to a removal of stimulus support , facilitating a crushing blow to bonds and equities markets. Now, interestingly enough, the Bank for International Settlements is warning of the same thing as 2017 comes to a close. It should be noted that this is not the first time the BIS warned of an impending crash ; they also predicted with keen timing the derivatives and credit crash back in 2007. This was, of course, too little too late for the masses to react in any positive way, though. \nTheir latest warning arrives on the heels of the December Federal Reserve meeting at which it is widely expected that the central bank will raise interest rates yet again while taking the next step towards reducing their balance sheet. Many mainstream and alternative economists doubted the taper of QE and doubted the hiking of interest rates. They were wrong. Just as the doubts over the Fed balance sheet reductions are wrong. The pullback in these measures will invariably strike bonds and equities in a negative way. Time is running out. \nBut, the banking elites have taken steps. For example, they have in place a perfect distraction in the form of the Trump Administration. With Trump loudly and proudly taking credit for the stock market bull run over the course of the past year, who do you think the public will blame when those same markets go south as the central bank pulls the rug out? Probably not the Fed or the establishment banks. \nTrump has also in an odd way created the perfect rationale for the Fed as they increase interest rates and end the cheap money that has been feeding stocks for so long. With the passage of Trump's tax \"reform\" plan, the fed can now argue that interest rates MUST be raised in order to create incentives for treasury investment and to pay for Trump's intended public works programs and military expansion goals. Meaning, the fed can claim it is not culpable for any negative effects from removing cheap capital from the table because Trump's actions demanded it. \nI would also point out that in most cases in history the Fed has lowered interest rates immediately following tax cuts and reforms. They did this after Reagan's tax reforms in 1981 and in 1986, as well as after George W. Bush's tax reforms in 2001. Juxtapose that with 2018, as the Fed intends to continue RAISING interest rates in the wake of Trump's tax reforms. Meaning, they are taking the opposite action from what they have often done in the past. Something to think about... \nTrump's tax plan itself is primarily a distraction from the real problem. \nFirst, when comparing tax brackets from this past year to the intended tax brackets for next year under the Trump reforms, there is almost no change whatsoever for the average American. The only major reductions in taxes are, no surprise, in the form of corporate tax cuts ; reducing the corporate tax ceiling from 35 percent to 20 percent. This is trickle-down economics at best, and not a solution to a single problem facing the public and the country in terms of the flailing economy. \nSecond, why are we talking about income tax \"reform\" when we should be talking about abolishing the income tax and the Federal Reserve altogether? Whatever happened to that dialogue? It has disappeared down the memory hole. \nTrump's tax plan will do nothing to slow or undo the current economic crisis because the crisis stems directly from central banking monetary policies and interest rate manipulations. Tax reform is far too little far too late, and stands as nothing more than meager bone thrown to conservatives to keep them quiet for a while. This is what Trump's tax reform does do very well, though \u2014 it rallies conservatives around Trump, regardless of whether it actually helps them or not. Much like Obama's universal health care bill, which has proven to be a continued disaster in practice, but was rather successful at the time of its passage in rallying the liberal base. Trump is certainly going to need a base of public support if he is going to initiate a major war campaign. \nNorth Korea continues to be the most likely powder keg for the next distraction event. Two months of quiet led people with short attention spans to dismiss the notion, and perhaps some of them will double down and continue their denials, but it is growing more difficult to ignore by the day. I would argue that North Korea is the most viable option simply because almost no one expects a war with the isolated nation to happen. The level of complacency despite all the signals to the contrary is palpable. \nThe U.S. has staged three aircraft carrier groups in the region for the first time in a decade. Major combat exercises are underway, designated Vigilant Ace 18, specifically designed to simulate an invasion of North Korea with over 230 aircraft and 12,000 American troops participating . North Korea has warned of \"nuclear war\" as a consequence. \nNorth Korea may have the ability to follow through, at least on a limited scale, as they have recently test launched what appears to be a huge leap in missile technology \u2014 an ICBM capable of carrying multiple warheads and striking the Eastern seaboard of the U.S. How the North Koreans came to possess this technology so quickly is a question everyone should be asking. \nIn response, the war rhetoric has been amplified. White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster has stated that North Korea is the greatest immediate threat to the U.S., saying that the potential for war \"is increasing every day.\" Warmonger and enemy of the Constitution, Lindsay Graham, has stated that the families of U.S. military personnel should be moved out of South Korea for their own safety, and that \" We're getting close to military conflict. \" \nSo how close is close? I maintain that war with North Korea is likely by the second quarter of 2018. I also maintain the globalists will continue the strategy of multiple regional conflicts and global economic warfare rather than a one-off global nuclear mess that would wipe out trillions of dollars and decades of effort put into infrastructure and surveillance grids. \nThis would be advantageous to the globalists if they plan to continue interest rate hikes and stimulus removal by central banks around the world. It would help hide the effects of balance sheet reductions on stocks and it could expedite the fall of the dollar as the world reserve as Eastern and European nations apply alternatives like the IMF's SDR basket system in response to the massive debt brought on by a military quagmire for the U.S. In other words, catastrophic fiscal developments that were already going to happen anyway due to central bank sabotage will be entirely blamed on geopolitical crisis rather than the true culprits. \nFinally, will the East step in militarily to prevent a conflict in North Korea? No. China has already stated that if North Korea attacks first, then they will not obstruct regime change by the U.S. \nThis flies in the face of those that believe in the false east/west paradigm. China has left the door wide open to potential conflict. If the globalists want a war in North Korea, they will create a war in North Korea, and the Chinese have publicly admitted they will step out of the way to let it happen. A false flag is probable. More provocations leading to a violent response by North Korea would also be rather easy to produce. So far, North Korea remains the best existing shock and awe event to hide a globally disintegrating economic situation. Would the globalists pass up an opportunity like this? There is no reason for them to do so. \nSpecial Note: Moriarty's speech on the \"inevitability of war\" is a rather accurate portrayal in my opinion of the globalist mindset - rationalizing the artificial engineering of conflicts because \"human nature\" dictates that such events will \"happen anyway\", so why shouldn't they benefit? Of course, if human nature was a reliable ally of the power brokers, then they would not need to engineer these crises in the first place. Such is the insane circular logic of organized psychopaths. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tim knight", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vince lanci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moriarty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george w. bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lindsay graham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "h.r. mcmaster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reagan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brandon smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "december federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "imf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international monetary fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank for international settlements", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "league of nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alt-market", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:14:22.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4980f07358e1e6a840915f2a56c9587b6b54c5aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTtnb.k3dQQDAN9yr7G1N4eP5xyIugzx6WQrFhtvGahgigSUUdKfeJXqmXIqY.mum7dZQfmumtXNldOf7AQJU4", "site_full": "add2base.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://add2base.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Safinteam \u2013 Leap Of Faith \u2013 add2dnb's blog", "title": "Safinteam \u2013 Leap Of Faith", "title_full": "Safinteam \u2013 Leap Of Faith", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4980f07358e1e6a840915f2a56c9587b6b54c5aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTtnb.k3dQQDAN9yr7G1N4eP5xyIugzx6WQrFhtvGahgigSUUdKfeJXqmXIqY.mum7dZQfmumtXNldOf7AQJU4", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "add2dnb", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Safinteam \u2013 Leap Of Faith", "text": "", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:14:23.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c94e93b9fa06e84da704c08e382fc8fec5d15c9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRDmvNF99Cd6OdIMpPJGUX_tayIpmpvR_yVBOBEyzR116Z3hOGv2fcu0DyVRqVlofEV4pL9O7YzXTLFyW_q3QRM0TYONyqyQup.qslWFULRRvCD_LRKLaeUMTEc1775Nnc7KYhauJHBiesmRLEvfn2V", "site_full": "germanjamison.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://germanjamison.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Why Mergers and Acquisitions Will Define the Distributed Energy Boom \u2013 German Jamison", "title": "Why Mergers and Acquisitions Will Define the Distributed Energy Boom", "title_full": "Why Mergers and Acquisitions Will Define the Distributed Energy Boom", "published": "2017-12-07T12:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c94e93b9fa06e84da704c08e382fc8fec5d15c9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRDmvNF99Cd6OdIMpPJGUX_tayIpmpvR_yVBOBEyzR116Z3hOGv2fcu0DyVRqVlofEV4pL9O7YzXTLFyW_q3QRM0TYONyqyQup.qslWFULRRvCD_LRKLaeUMTEc1775Nnc7KYhauJHBiesmRLEvfn2V", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "germanjamison", "published": "2017-12-07T12:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "Why Mergers and Acquisitions Will Define the Distributed Energy Boom", "text": "We\u2019re in the middle of a boom in utility mergers and acquisitions. The biggest power companies in the world are scrambling to buy up new startups in order to stay at the forefront of the distributed energy transition \u2014 and they\u2019re spending billions of dollars in the process.\nTotal annual investments in distributed energy companies by European and North American utilities more than tripled between 2010 and 2016, according to data compiled by GTM Research.\nIn total, utilities invested $2.9 billion in 130 individual distributed energy companies since 2009 \u2014 $1 billion of which was invested in 2016 alone. The trend has continued this year, with nearly half of global industry deals involving renewable energy during the second quarter, according to a report from Ernst & Young.\nThose numbers are only a preview of what\u2019s to come. \n\u201cI think the appetite for acquiring startups will really increase over the next few years,\u201d predicted Matthias Dill, the managing director of Germany-based Statkraft Ventures , a venture capital fund backed by Norwegian energy firm Statkraft. \u201cWe see three fundamental trends driving M&A activity in the energy sector: Incumbents embracing distributed energy, startups becoming relevant players in the energy sector, and players from other sectors entering the energy sector. The exciting part is that all of this is happening at the same time.\u201d\nIncumbent utilities are now grappling with the reality of distributed energy. Consequently, operations are already changing in significant ways \u2013 and utilities are doing everything they can to future-proof themselves.\nThe shakeup is evident in Europe, where E.ON and RWE both split up their fossil fuel and renewable assets last year. RWE created Innogy to focus on renewable energy, electric vehicles and retail markets. And E.ON established Uniper, in order to separate its upstream fossil fuel operations. Both are seeking out partnerships and acquisition targets to grow their renewables businesses. \nAnd there is much more money waiting to be spent. According to the International Energy Agency\u2019s latest forecast, renewable energy investments will amount to $7 trillion by 2040. Trillions more will be invested in energy efficiency and demand-side management.\nThe trend holds true for midsized European power companies as well. U.K.-based Drax Group acquired the electricity provider Opus Energy last year for \u00a3340 million ($453 million). The Netherlands-based Eneco invested in two German companies \u2014 virtual power plant developer Next Kraftwerke and renewable energy provider LichtBlick \u2014 and acquired the Dutch smart thermostat company Quby.  \nDill said startups like Quby are especially appealing to incumbent power utilities because they bring in new business possibilities and, once acquired, no longer present an acute threat. \nStatkraft Ventures invested in one such startup in 2015. Munich-based Tado was developing intelligent climate control platforms, and Dill\u2019s team saw an opportunity to market the product through utilities.\n\u201cWhen they started out, they weren\u2019t really an energy firm. They were already successful, but mainly an e-commerce and consumer electronics firm,\u201d said Dill. \u201cWe invested two years ago, and today their major customers are the utility sector. Now they enable incumbent utilities to offer new products to their customers and have a better customer relationship.\u201d\nA diverse and growing pool of cleantech startups like Tado is entering the scene and presenting new possibilities for mergers and acquisitions. More companies than ever are working in the energy space, and many got their start outside of the energy sector .\nTechnology maturation and customer preferences are drivers of the trend. Wind and solar costs rival conventional fossil fuels; customers want renewables and greater control of their energy use; and the business models are becoming more sophisticated.\n\u201cToday, the heavy lifting in developing technologies like solar, wind and storage is done, but this generates a new set of questions,\u201d explained Dill. \u201cStartups are in a perfect position to address these new issues, which are often centered around data-management and customer experience, and they can be addressed in a very capital-efficient way.\u201d\nTado has become so attractive to utilities that it receives a steady stream of offers to acquire the company.\n\u201cWe get inbound inquires every two months,\u201d said Tado founder and managing director Christian Deilmann, \u201cbut Tado is not up for sale. We are just getting started.\u201d  \nSince Statkraft invested in Tado, the company has grown \u201ctenfold\u201d in customers and revenue, added Deilmann.\nOther nontraditional players are eyeing cleantech startups too. Last year, the California-based cloud-computing giant Oracle bought Opower, a utility software company, for $532 million.
