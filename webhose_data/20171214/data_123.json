v City: Noisy neighbours, \u00b4Why Always Me?\u00b4 and other Old Trafford memories 7 December 2017 09:00 \nAfter last season's false start, Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho now look set to reprise their previous battle for supremacy at Barcelona and Real Madrid with Manchester City and Manchester United. \nUnited lie eight points behind City heading into this weekend's crosstown showdown, which seems certain to provide a pivotal moment in this season's race for the Premier League. \nBut this famous old rivalry has not always needed superstar managers lifted from a hallowed football battleground to provide unforgettable excitement, dizzying highs and punishing lows. \nHere, we take a look through some of the most memorable Old Trafford encounters in the Manchester derby's rich history. \nMarch 1968 - Manchester United 1 Manchester City 3 \nUnited were on their way to becoming England's first European champions but they would also let domestic dominance slip into the hands of local rivals City over the closing weeks of the 1967-68 season. The great George Best opened the scoring in the first minute but it was the man long recognised as the greatest player in City's history, Colin Bell, who inspired a typically stylish victory from Joe Mercer and Malcom Allison's swashbuckling side. England midfielder Bell equalised before half-time and, after centre-back George Heslop headed the visitors in front, he won a penalty for Francis Lee to seal the points. In events that would be echoed 44 years later, City pipped United to the title on the final day of the season. Happy 71st birthday to The King! \u2014 Manchester City (@ManCity) February 26, 2017 \nApril 1974 \u2013 Manchester United 0 Manchester City 1 \nA day when City symbolically, if not actually, relegated United and one of lingering regret for Denis Law. 'The King of Old Trafford', Law left United after 11 years and 236 goals in 1973 for a second stint at City. Matt Busby's old empire was in a state of crumbling disrepair and United headed into their penultimate game of the following season needing to beat City and hope other results went their way. In the 82nd minute of an otherwise forgettable contest, Bell strode forward and fed Lee, who cut the ball across the box and saw Law instinctively backheel through the legs of Alex Stepney. The visibly crestfallen goalscorer was substituted and retired at the start of the following season. Birmingham City's win over Norwich City meant United were condemned to Division Two in any case, but years later Law said: \"I have seldom felt so depressed in my life as I did that weekend.\" On this day in 1974, Denis Law's audacious back heel claims the derby spoils for #mcfc at Old Trafford. pic.twitter.com/jxt4GT5fan \u2014 Manchester City (@ManCity) April 27, 2015 \nNovember 1994 \u2013 Manchester United 5 Manchester City 0 \nUnited fans had been treated to the waspish wit of their colleagues and jokes about three-pin plugs after their latest European escapade under Alex Ferguson ended in a 4-0 defeat to a Romario and Hristo Stoichkov-inspired Barcelona. The days of Champions League glory under Ferguson were still a little way down the road but, eight days on from their Camp Nou ordeal, United emphatically proved they were masters of their own manor with a brutal demolition of City. Andrei Kanchelskis plundered a hat-trick with a livewire performance from the right wing, while Eric Cantona \u2013 the scourge of the blue half of Manchester during this period with eight goals in as many derbies \u2013 got in on the act along with Mark Hughes to chalk up United's record win in the fixture. Andrei Kanchelskis hit a hat-trick as we beat Man City 5-0 on this day in 1994. https://t.co/Qa4dLFYdSv \u2014 Manchester United (@ManUtd) November 10, 2015 \nSeptember 2009 \u2013 Manchester United 4 Manchester City 3 \nThe 'noisy neighbours' derby. Ferguson had been irritated by the newly emboldened Manchester City over the first year of their Abu Dhabi ownership and he delighted in taking the spoils from this undulating thriller. Carlos Tevez, back at United for the first time since joining their rivals, hustled a mistake out of goalkeeper Ben Foster and laid on Gareth Barry to cancel out Wayne Rooney's early opener. Try as they might, United just could not shake City \u2013 Darren Fletcher twice headed them back in front, only for Craig Bellamy to answer with a pair of brilliant solo efforts. But then came injury time, that often fruitful terrain of the Ferguson era, and Michael Owen's ice-cool finish in front of the Stretford End sparked delirium.

He enters the National Football Museum Hall of Fame today. https://t.co/zRsklPX1d2 \u2014 Manchester United (@ManUtd) October 16, 2014 \nFebruary 2011 \u2013 Manchester United 2 Manchester City 1 \nAn important win as Ferguson and United wrestled the Premier League title back from Chelsea produced arguably the standout moment of Rooney's record-breaking United career. The hosts got their noses in front shortly before half-time when Nani stole in front of Pablo Zabaleta to finish tidily. A tense, tactical affair was all square after 65 minutes. David Silva equalising by virtue of a wayward Edin Dzeko shot clattering off his backside was not becoming of player of his sublime talents, before Rooney placed his own brilliance at centre stage. Nani's right-wing cross looped up off Zabaleta and the former England captain pivoted to launch himself skywards, sending an unstoppable overhead kick beyond Joe Hart. Two great goals, but you chose Rooney's derby strike as your favourite ahead of Owen's. https://t.co/Qmp7Uzcxok \u2014 Manchester United (@ManUtd) October 23, 2015 \nOctober 2011 \u2013 Manchester United 1 Manchester City 6 \nEight months on from Rooney's stunning intervention, Roberto Mancini's City served notice of their title intentions by spectacularly turning the tables on United. Mario Balotelli's 'Why Always Me' celebration supplied the game's defining image but the slick build-up for that opening goal, with Silva and James Milner to the fore, highlighted the manner of City's dominance from the first whistle. Jonny Evans' red card for pulling back Balotelli early in the second half left United with a mountain to climb and the enigmatic Italian soon doubled his tally. Sergio Aguero slid in a third on the end of a brilliant one-touch move before Fletcher's fine consolation had the unfortunate effect of emboldening a depleted United. City streamed forward repeatedly as Dzeko, twice, and Silva laid the punishment on thick. The severity of United's collapse took on added significance in the final reckoning, as Mancini's men won the league on goal difference. \u2014 Manchester City (@ManCity) October 23, 2017 Sponsored

Socialism, as its name suggests, is based on a belief in the notion of action through the community, in the idea that individuals do not stand alone, and that it is not merely morally right that we should think of ourselves in this way but that it is the most rational way to organise our lives. The world we face today makes a socialist approach all the more relevant: from new technology to the arms race, co-operation surely makes more sense than competition. \u201d\n\u201c Post-war Britain has seen two big changes. First, and partly as a result of reforming Labour governments, there are many more healthy, wealthy and well-educated people than before. In addition, employment has switched from traditional manufacturing industries to a more white-collar, service-based economy. The inevitable result has been that class identity has fragmented. Only about a third of the population now regard themselves as \u2018working-class\u2019. Of course it is possible still to analyse Britain in terms of a strict Marxist definition of class: but it is not very helpful to our understanding of how the country thinks and votes. In fact, of that third, many are likely not to be \u2018working\u2019 at all: these are the unemployed, pensioners, single parents \u2013 in other words, the poor.\nA party that restricts its appeal to the traditional working class will not win an election. That doesn\u2019t entail a rejection of socialism\u2019s traditional values: but it does mean that its appeal, and hence its policies, must address a much wider range of interests. \u201d\n\u201c The trick for Labour is not to follow them and abandon the notion of government and collective provision: but to re-fashion it so that real power is exercised by people and not by institutions or bureaucracies. The fundamental error of Dr Owen (and, oddly, of David Steel since the election, though not before it) has been to surrender to Mrs Thatcher\u2019s philosophy and say that power can only be devolved through the market. The 1990s will not see the continuing triumph of the market, but its failure. \u201d\n\nRoy Hattersley: http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/24/labour2001to2005.news\n\u201c Tony Blair discovered a big idea. His destiny is to create a meritocracy. Unfortunately meritocracy is not the form of society which social democrats want to see. ... A Labour government should not be talking about escape routes from poverty and deprivation. By their nature they are only available to a highly-motivated minority. The Labour Party was created to change society in such a way that there is no poverty and deprivation from which to escape . ... The certain knowledge that the Conservative Party would be a worse government than Labour is not enough to sustain what used to be a party of principles. ... At this moment Labour stands for very little that can be identified with social democracy \u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities":

The Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. \nSaudi Arabia's royal court, led by King Salman and his powerful son, condemned the Trump administration's decision in a rare public rebuke by the U.S. ally. \nSaudi Arabia, a regional powerhouse that could help the White House push through a Middle East settlement, said Thursday the kingdom had already warned against this step and \"continues to express its deep regret at the U.S. administration's decision,\" describing it \"unjustified and irresponsible.\" \nTrump's move puts the Sunni nation in a bind. The kingdom, particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who leads Trump's efforts to restart Mideast peace talks. \nU.S. Embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa warned American citizens of possible protests following Trump's move. \nIn recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Trump was seen as siding with Israel's hard-line government which says it will not give up any part of the city. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has suggested that the United States disqualified itself as mediator between Israelis and Palestinians, a role it has played exclusively in more than two decades of stop-and-go negotiations on setting up a Palestinian state alongside Israel. \nThe talks, stalled in recent years, have failed to bring the Palestinians closer to the state the seek in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. In parallel, Israel has steadily expanded Jewish settlements on war-won lands, even as it said it wants to negotiate a deal. \nTrump's claim Wednesday that he still wants to pursue what he has called the \"ultimate\" Mideast deal was met by mounting skepticism. \n\"With its decision, the U.S. has isolated itself and Israel, and has pushed the area into a dangerous situation and stopped the peace process,\" said Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a senior Abbas aid. \"Without a doubt, this decision will not help at all in solving the problems in the area, but rather strengthen the extremists.\" \nAbbas has not said what steps he would take, if any. Later Thursday, he is to meet with his closest Arab ally, Jordan's King Abdullah II, to coordinate positions. \nJordan plays a central role in the mounting controversy and, alongside other U.S. allies in the region, has slammed Trump's decision on Jerusalem. \nThe king is seen as one of Washington's most dependable partners in the battle against Islamic extremism in the region. \nAt the same time, the legitimacy of his Hashemite dynasty is closely linked to its special role in Jerusalem, as religious guardian of a key Muslim shrine in east Jerusalem. Jordan, which has a large population with Palestinian roots, cannot afford to be seen as soft on Muslim claims to the holy city. \nThe consultations between the monarch and Abbas will kick off a series of meetings in the Arab and Muslim world on how to respond to Trump. \nThe Arab League, a group representing most states in the Middle East and North Africa, will meet Saturday. Next week, Turkey will host a gathering of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which has 57 Arab and Muslim member states. \nThe region has been bracing for fallout from Trump's seismic policy shift. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday accused Trump of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" and said his motives were difficult to fathom. \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it, Erdogan said, referring to Trump in a speech to a group of workers at Ankara's airport. \n\"Political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace,\" Erdogan said. \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right,' he is mistaken.\" \nWith his announcement Wednesday, Trump shattered decades of unwavering U.S. neutrality on Jerusalem. \nDefying dire, worldwide warnings, Trump insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, starting with what he said was his decision merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. He also said the U.S. would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable. \n\"We cannot solve our problems by making the same failed assumptions and repeating the same failed strategies of the past,\" Trump said, brushing aside the appeals for caution from around the world. \n___ \nLaub reported from Amman, Jordan.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nCoventry City Council have agreed to fund a \u00a31.5m loan to cover the cost of a new indoor pitch at the Alan Higgs Centre. \nThe proposal for the loan was discussed during a full council meeting this week as it was approved by councillors. \nIt means the new indoor pitch could be available to use as early as September 2018. \nA council report shows the money will be supplied to the leisure centre owners, The Coventry and Warwickshire Award Trust (CAWAT), in the form of a 40-year loan. Read More Wasps pull out of Higgs site: YOUR reaction to training centre plans being scrapped \nThe report states there would be no net cost to the council and that it should generate a profit for the taxpayer over the term of the loan. That\u2019s because the cost of borrowing for our funds are lower than the commercial rate at which the council would lend. \nPlans for a new indoor pitch are necessary because of proposals to build a 50m swimming pool on the site of the existing indoor facility used by the community and Coventry City FC\u2019s Academy. Alan Higgs Centre on Allard Way, Coventry. \nIt is expected the new swimming pool could be open to the public in summer 2019. Coventry\u2019s existing 50m swimming pool at Fairfax Street is set to close after a council vote in 2014. \nThe provision of a new indoor facility will boost hopes that the Academy can remain at the Allard Way venue, despite the ongoing redevelopment. \nPlans for Premiership rugby side Wasps to develop a training base at the site were dropped last month, removing more potential obstacles to the CCFC Academy remaining at the site - including the provision of an adequate number of outdoor football pitches. Read More Coventry City remain tight-lipped on Wasps decision to scrap training complex on Academy site \nThe rugby club was given planning permission last year for a \u00a37million base at the site, despite protests from the football club which was facing having no home for its successful Academy. \nThe football club gained an extension to its tenancy at the centre operators Coventry Sports Foundation (CSF) until summer 2018 before Wasps put their plans on hold. \nThe anticipated approval date for planning permission for the new indoor pitch and swimming pool plan is January 2018.

Socialism, as its name suggests, is based on a belief in the notion of action through the community, in the idea that individuals do not stand alone, and that it is not merely morally right that we should think of ourselves in this way but that it is the most rational way to organise our lives. The world we face today makes a socialist approach all the more relevant: from new technology to the arms race, co-operation surely makes more sense than competition. \u201d\n\u201c Post-war Britain has seen two big changes. First, and partly as a result of reforming Labour governments, there are many more healthy, wealthy and well-educated people than before. In addition, employment has switched from traditional manufacturing industries to a more white-collar, service-based economy. The inevitable result has been that class identity has fragmented. Only about a third of the population now regard themselves as \u2018working-class\u2019. Of course it is possible still to analyse Britain in terms of a strict Marxist definition of class: but it is not very helpful to our understanding of how the country thinks and votes. In fact, of that third, many are likely not to be \u2018working\u2019 at all: these are the unemployed, pensioners, single parents \u2013 in other words, the poor.\nA party that restricts its appeal to the traditional working class will not win an election. That doesn\u2019t entail a rejection of socialism\u2019s traditional values: but it does mean that its appeal, and hence its policies, must address a much wider range of interests. \u201d\n\u201c The trick for Labour is not to follow them and abandon the notion of government and collective provision: but to re-fashion it so that real power is exercised by people and not by institutions or bureaucracies. The fundamental error of Dr Owen (and, oddly, of David Steel since the election, though not before it) has been to surrender to Mrs Thatcher\u2019s philosophy and say that power can only be devolved through the market. The 1990s will not see the continuing triumph of the market, but its failure. \u201d\n\nRoy Hattersley: http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/24/labour2001to2005.news\n\u201c Tony Blair discovered a big idea. His destiny is to create a meritocracy. Unfortunately meritocracy is not the form of society which social democrats want to see. ... A Labour government should not be talking about escape routes from poverty and deprivation. By their nature they are only available to a highly-motivated minority. The Labour Party was created to change society in such a way that there is no poverty and deprivation from which to escape . ... The certain knowledge that the Conservative Party would be a worse government than Labour is not enough to sustain what used to be a party of principles. ... At this moment Labour stands for very little that can be identified with social democracy \u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:07.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3cc53e2aed1ab82068402207975f00a959bd3108", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kWjpIwclEOqxH53qL2bedtyTxoYUln24.kD2mj6_WECXK59j9Xwx4", "site_full": "www.grandprix.com", "site": "grandprix.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/grandprix/FFaI", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Grandprix.com Current News", "title": "Teams must handle Budkowski-style work bans says Todt", "title_full": "Teams must handle Budkowski-style work bans says Todt", "published": "2017-12-06T14:10:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3cc53e2aed1ab82068402207975f00a959bd3108", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kWjpIwclEOqxH53qL2bedtyTxoYUln24.kD2mj6_WECXK59j9Xwx4", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T14:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "Teams must handle Budkowski-style work bans says Todt", "text": "DECEMBER 6, 2017 Teams must handle Budkowski-style work bans says Todt Jean Todt says it is up to F1 teams to regulate how new staff are employed after they move from the FIA. \nMarcin Budkowski's impending move from the FIA to Renault caused uproar among the teams. \nUnder Swiss law, Budkowski only had to serve three months of 'gardening leave' before making the move, but Renault has instead decided that he should not start until April 1. \nTeams have called on the FIA to intervene, but FIA president Todt said it is not the Federation's responsibility. \n\"Like all our employees, Budkowski was employed under Swiss law,\" he told Auto Motor und Sport. \n\"There is a work ban of three months by law, but we negotiated with Renault to extend it to half a year.

The shutdown reprieve came as all sides issued optimistic takes on an afternoon White House meeting between top congressional leaders and President Donald Trump. \nThe measure passed the House 235-193, mostly along party lines, and breezed through the Senate on a sweeping 81-14 tally barely an hour later. It would keep the government running through Dec. 22, when another, and more difficult, shutdown problem awaits. \nThe bill now heads to Trump for his signature. \nTopics at the White House session included relief from a budget freeze on the Pentagon and domestic agencies, extending a key children's health program and aid to hurricane-slammed Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida. The trickiest topic, and a top priority for Democrats, involves protections for immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. \nThese \"Dreamer\" immigrants are viewed sympathetically by the public and most lawmakers but face deportation in a few months because Trump reversed administrative protections provided to them by former President Barack Obama. \nIn back-to-back statements, both Democratic and GOP leaders declared the meeting \"productive.\" The White House called it \"constructive.\" \n\"We had a productive conversation on a wide variety of issues. Nothing specific has been agreed to, but discussions continue,\" said Capitol Hill's top Democrats, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, ticking off a roster of Democratic priorities, including domestic spending increases, funding for veterans and money to battle opioid abuse, immigration and health care. \nGOP leaders said they agreed with the need to address immigration, including the almost 1 million immigrants given protections by Obama, many of whom have only known America as their home. \nSpokesmen for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said GOP leaders \"stressed the need to address border security, interior enforcement and other parts of our broken immigration system,\" adding that the tricky immigration issue \"should be a separate process and not used to hold hostage funding for our men and women in uniform.\" \nNegotiations are sure to be challenging. Pelosi staked out a hard line Thursday and insisted that any year-end deal solve the immigration issue. \nPelosi told reporters before the meeting that \"we will not leave here\" without helping the \"Dreamers.\" Her stance was noteworthy because GOP leaders are likely to require Democratic votes for the pre-Christmas spending bill. \nThe White House said \"negotiations on immigration should be held separately on a different track\" and not slow down funding increases for the Pentagon. \nPelosi returned from the White House to oppose Thursday's stopgap bill. Fourteen Democrats supported the measure, however, while 18 Republicans opposed it. \nAmong Republicans, the conservative House Freedom Caucus had resisted the pending stopgap measure earlier in the week, fearing it would lead to a bad deal for conservatives down the road. But on Thursday, the group's chairman, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said the group will likely give leaders whatever support they need to pass the legislation. \nMeadows said they'd help it pass to avoid distractions from the GOP drive to push their treasured $1.5 trillion tax bill through Congress this month. That measure, which mostly benefits businesses and upper-income people, is Trump's and the GOP's top remaining priority and would be their first major legislative triumph of the year. \nBut hours before Trump was to bargain with congressional leaders at the White House over longer-term spending decisions, Meadows said the conservatives would oppose any agreement they feel allows excessive federal spending. \n\"I want to avoid a headline that says President Trump's administration just passes the highest spending levels in U.S. history,\" Meadows told reporters. \"There will be zero support on numbers that are too high, regardless of anybody's position on that.\" \nHe also said Ryan promised he'd fight in coming weeks to pass a full-year budget for the military and leave fights with Democrats over domestic spending for later. It is unclear how that strategy would work, since Republicans control the Senate 52-48 and will need at least eight Democratic votes to pass any spending legislation. \nThe prospects for successful White House talks were buffeted Wednesday when the impulsive Trump blurted to reporters that a shutdown \"could happen.\" He blamed Democrats, saying they want \"illegal immigrants pouring into our country, bringing with them crime, tremendous amounts of crime.\" \nLast week, an unexpected attack by Trump on Schumer and Pelosi prompted the two to skip a bargaining session. \nThe two-week spending bill also makes money available to several states that are running out of funds for the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP. That widely popular program provides medical care to more than 8 million children. \nThe CHIP issue is among the year-end items where negotiations have gone positively, and aides say a long-term agreement is nearly in hand.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "congr", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "chuck schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark meadows", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "freedom caucus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house freedom caucus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "children's health insurance program", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-n.y.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-calif.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:07.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "36f1864597ae3a92f081f0fd2b22fcad0c7a90e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg._QsXKpwKCS9lrjlVbMO35avdZc3VUZHDXLEAE1O6vSzIP2y39uMowYbdMWRryn53u3bDdYlTICa_nmtgD5O3hK4qR_tKbFozRNC0ED1kNFo.Ngh7fh12q74KYA8twMJFikAvcg_8PQzudXuJxe6QX", "site_full": "www.moneycontrol.com", "site": "moneycontrol.com", "site_section": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/rss/buzzingstocks.xml", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Moneycontrol Buzzing Stocks", "title": "UFO Moviez jumps 3%; Citi initiates buy, raises target to Rs 610", "title_full": "UFO Moviez jumps 3%; Citi initiates buy, raises target to Rs 610", "published": "2017-12-07T09:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://static-news.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2017/10/PVR-DC-Audi-770x433.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 630, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 74}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "36f1864597ae3a92f081f0fd2b22fcad0c7a90e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg._QsXKpwKCS9lrjlVbMO35avdZc3VUZHDXLEAE1O6vSzIP2y39uMowYbdMWRryn53u3bDdYlTICa_nmtgD5O3hK4qR_tKbFozRNC0ED1kNFo.Ngh7fh12q74KYA8twMJFikAvcg_8PQzudXuJxe6QX", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "UFO Moviez jumps 3%; Citi initiates buy, raises target to Rs 610", "text": "you are here: Home News Business Dec 07, 2017 12:32 PM IST | Source: Moneycontrol.com UFO Moviez jumps 3%; Citi initiates buy, raises target to Rs 610 The house is of the view that merger with Qube is likely to increase geographical strength and client base and feels that GST and demonetization impact with subdued content are temporary issues and provide buying opportunity in the stock.

You hear the swoosh of the screen door, and the click of the door behind it. Footsteps. Then a slight shadow in the doorway. All of the lights are off. Then you feel the weight of the bed shift and another body joins yours. The sheet that covers you shifts and you feel the first touch on your naked skin. His hand is insistent, firm, on you. He touches your leg, urging it to separate from the other. Fingers brush up your leg, over thigh, to breast. he runs his hands over you, before you reach down, feeling his hair, the back of his head. His beard is the first thing to tickle your sex, inhaling you and your arousal. You feel warm breath, and it almost coincides with the warm tongue that lashes out, tracing you. Digits enter you and you arch your back to him. He beckons more of your arousal to him with his fingers, finally settling. You feel his body as it moves up yours, his head and warm breath at your neck. You part for him, feeling him enter, slowly, stretching into you. His cock is hard, velvety, and fills you beautifully. You push back to meet him, thrust after thrust. You claw at his back, scratching him, prolonging his release. You climax shortly before him, and it is only as you feel him drip down your thigh that you see the headlights light up your window, then go dark. This is a fun fantasy of mine. If it were to happen, that would be even more fun. I'm very dd free, and have some free time in the late evenings. Drop a line if this piques your interest, even if just to share mutual fantasies.

In March I moved overseas and closed my checking and savings accounts. I still have a Wells Fargo credit card but haven't used it since then.\nI personally haven't had any bad experiences with WF but before I open another checking account, I thought I'd see what my options are. (I'm moving back to the U.S. next week)\nI'm a lot less financially secure than I was before I moved. To be straightforward, I have $88 to my name and an $800 balance on my other credit card - an Amazon Chase card I got for the awesome 5% cashback feature. Before the last few months, I'd never ONCE paid interest on a credit card. I never dipped below $1000 in savings.\nUnemployment sucks, needless to say.\nI'm lucky in that I should have somewhere to crash at least for a little while when I get home, plus I've got three potential jobs I'm waiting to hear back on, although they are all likely part-time hours.\nI'm also lucky to have gotten enough scholarship money and a pell grant to cover this upcoming semester's tuition, so that's covered. I just need to cover the basics - food and gas, mostly. And I want to get this credit card balance paid off ASAP of course.\nI haven't checked my credit score in several months. It was in the 750s but I have a bad feeling that is no longer.\nI've been careful about money up until this point and I don't want to be \"that\" college kid who abused credit cards and got into debt.\nAll advice welcome.

In addition to the potential halting of daily firm activity, there\u2019s crisis management, forensic investigations and much more to pay for as a result of an avoidable breach. \nThe report also acknowledges that legal technology and security protocols may seem overwhelming for firms, but the damage incurred after a breach is much greater. \nThe Indiana Business Report identifies four ways that legal technology can both help secure data and create trust with clients: Knowing and understanding client data is protected with approved certified methods Educating staff on risks and preventative measures Assuring clients that their data is protected Controlling who has access to information \nThere are many legal technology choices available in the market for firms. When narrowing down potential candidates, counsel should confirm that the third-party provider meets specific standards, such as storing information in centers that are ISO 27001 and SSAE Type II certified, plus ones that comply with U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks and its replacement framework, the EU-US Privacy Shield. \nBy implementing legal technology, training and education of staff on vulnerable practices to avoid can occur, such as storing client data in email. \nInstilling confidence in clients by ensuring them that the firm\u2019s data security measures in place meet the highest industry standards and certifications is priceless. \nFinally, a firm can increase data security by setting specific roles and permissions. This also instills confidence in clients. \nSecuring and protecting client data should be a top priority in a firm. The cost of not doing so is far too high to a firm\u2019s finances and reputation. \nFor a deeper dive into cybersecurity in the legal industry, download our latest white paper, \u201c Best Practices for Counsel Serious About Cybersecurity .\u201d Tags:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "indiana", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:09.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "96739cf3b1f0d3656729afcb5a081f8f69ea458b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jcLig0FggkWx6jQzjvE7cUMHj4.OyFq1go5ZisBnwuQE3WUtLKQmIANBqYLcQg0UanPFLBFl_aVziaPwxyzxRUNK5_p9akValJV_ZoXdlfP4A--", "site_full": "cheapessays-to-buy.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://cheapessays-to-buy.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "cheap essays to buy", "title": "'Inner Health and Chiropractic'", "title_full": "'Inner Health and Chiropractic'", "published": "2017-12-07T11:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "96739cf3b1f0d3656729afcb5a081f8f69ea458b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jcLig0FggkWx6jQzjvE7cUMHj4.OyFq1go5ZisBnwuQE3WUtLKQmIANBqYLcQg0UanPFLBFl_aVziaPwxyzxRUNK5_p9akValJV_ZoXdlfP4A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Megan Roberts (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "'Inner Health and Chiropractic'", "text": "'Dr. Steve Edelson of second Tampa, (813) 831-8321, chances t individu comp permitelyyes his patients approxi two-dimensionalely slipway to bring out total wellness. continuing affection affects so m some(prenominal) a(prenominal) wad in America.
