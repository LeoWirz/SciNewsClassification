And, property owners are less than thrilled about this fee. \nAccording to the ordinance for the fire service fee, charges shall be billed on the customer's annual city property tax bill, beginning in September 2018. \nThere is a $12.9 million deficit that city leaders want to fill, and the fire fee helps offset a portion of that. \nThursday\u2019s city council meeting will begin at 2 p.m. at City Hall. \nCopyright 2017 WTOC .

Which is good because it aligns with govt policy on tackling emissions. In fact it aligns with cross-party policies: Labour supports Moorside as much as the Tories do.\nWhereas your figures also show that there is a hard core minority of renewables supporters who are anti-nuclear. They are the ones who are directly opposing cross-party policy on tackling emissions.\nAnd there are 40% who are neutral on nuclear. You seem to be advocating to persuade these people that they too should oppose cross-party policy on tackling emissions.\nGiven that all the major parties at Westminster support nuclear power, and it is a key component of UK emission reduction, why would you want to agitate against it?

To vote for an argument, use these icons: You have the power to cast exactly one vote (either up or down) for each argument. Once you vote, the icon will become grayed out and the argument's score will change. Yes, you can change your vote. Debate scores, side scores and tag scores are automatically calculated by an algorithm that primarily takes argument scores into account. All scores are updated in real-time. To learn more about the CreateDebate scoring system, check out the FAQ . When you are ready to voice your opinion, use the Add Argument button to create an argument. If you would like to address an existing argument, use the Support and Dispute link within that argument to create a new reply.

Col. Deo Akiiki, deputy spokesman for the Ugandan military. \nUganda was the first country to deploy troops to Somalia in 2007 to back a weak federal government in Mogadishu against an insurgency by the extremist group al-Shabab, which is responsible for many deadly attacks in Somalia and elsewhere in the region. \nUnder an agreement between the African Union and the U.N. Security Council the number of all African peacekeepers in Somalia will be reduced by 1,000 before the end of 2017, Akiiki said. The African Union plans to withdraw all its 22,000 forces from Somalia by the end of 2020, prompting questions about the ability of Somalia's army to fight al-Shabab on its own.

Other African countries such as Burundi and Kenya also contribute to the regional force. \nThe Western-backed deployments have helped to push Islamic extremists out of Mogadishu and other areas, even though the rebels still make frequent bombing attacks targeting public places. The armed group is now mostly active in the southern rural areas of Somalia. \nAl-Shabab, which is allied to al-Qaida, opposes the presence of foreign troops in Somalia. The group has mounted deadly attacks in Kenya and Uganda, saying the killings were in retaliation over those countries' military involvement in Somalia.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rodney muhumuza", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "deo akiiki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akiiki", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.n. security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "african union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al-shabab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al-shabab", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "somalia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burundi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "african union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uganda  uganda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uganda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kampala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mogadishu", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:03.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "129b076fafa6d45c3497a8fe3521d1de6dd4b528", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS3jCYg5wgV2RTcGzw_Tz21gb7OKAz4cH6f2V1uP6WNuzfxr0Tol98YOb67UiDvu4s-", "site_full": "hantulab.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://hantulab.wordpress.com/feed/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "let's learn now!", "title": "at / batch", "title_full": "at / batch", "published": "2017-12-06T08:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "129b076fafa6d45c3497a8fe3521d1de6dd4b528", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS3jCYg5wgV2RTcGzw_Tz21gb7OKAz4cH6f2V1uP6WNuzfxr0Tol98YOb67UiDvu4s-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "hantulab", "published": "2017-12-06T08:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "at / batch", "text": "Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Email (Address never made public) Name You are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

Evan Frost | MPR News 4min 29sec \nRising numbers of Minnesotans are living their lives in multiple languages. \nThe number of Minnesota residents who speak a language besides English at home is increasing. At the same time, 60 percent of those people also report speaking English \"very well,\" a figure that has been consistent over the past decade. \nData out this week from the U.S. Census Bureau pinpoint the hot spots of language diversity around the state. Nobles County, in southwestern Minnesota, and Ramsey County have the largest shares of residents who don't speak English at home. \nForty-two percent of those Nobles County residents also speak very good English. In Ramsey County, 54 percent are multilingual. \nIn Hennepin County, just 17 percent of residents don't speak English at home, although 57 percent are multilingual. \nMastering multiple languages can be a tough task. But it's an essential one for many Minnesotans who must navigate life in English while still communicating with friends and family members who speak another language first. \u2022 Path to mastering English? Schools say students' home language is key \nFinding the right words is a balancing act, said Chalee Yang of Brooklyn Center, whose family came to the U.S. in 2004 from Thailand. Like 11.6 percent of Minnesotans, they don't speak English at home. They speak Hmong. \n\"I'm trying to live in my world, the Hmong world, while also maintaining a different world, the English world,\" Yang said. \nAmong Minnesotans who speak a language other than English, Spanish is by far the most common language followed by Somali and Hmong. Chalee Yang swims the backstroke at practice for the Park Center High School swim team in Brooklyn Park on Wednesday. Evan Frost | MPR News \nAnd while some of those speakers are less than proficient in English, most are like Yang. \n\"I don't prefer one [language] over [the other]. I see both as important. Each one will have their own opportunities to come,\" said Yang, noting that he's learning Spanish, Thai and Lao, too. \nBee Yang, Chalee's father, said he speaks some English, along with Hmong, Thai and Lao and thinks the more languages his son knows, the better. Being multilingual, Chalee \"can pull people from a different race, or different region of the world into the company where I'm working,\" Bee Yang said in Hmong as Chalee translated. \nUniversity of Minnesota professor Frances Vavrus helps weigh hiring and admissions for one of the university's graduate programs. Non-English first languages can be useful for students' research, she said. Students at the university must also show English proficiency. \n\"I can think of a student right now that I have from Kenya. He has excellent English skills but he conducted much of his research in Kenya using the national language, Kiswahili,\" Vavrus said. \nShe said department faculty also have diverse language backgrounds. \"We're all seeing the phenomenon that we're interested in slightly differently and that generates new knowledge that wouldn't be possible if it were only a monolingual, monocultural research group,\" Vavrus said. \nWhile Spanish, Somali and Hmong are the most common non-English languages spoken in Minnesota, they are not nearly the only ones. English proficiency is especially high among speakers of Native American languages, German and several languages associated with India. \u2022 Learning: Mankato's English language education focuses on the whole family \nThe impact of this multilingualism in the workplace overall is hard to measure because state data doesn't track employer demand for languages. \nA 2016 survey of employers by the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development offers a proxy. The survey asked employers how they define \"diversity.\" \"Language spoken\" was cited less than half the time. \nThe trait was much more likely to be cited by large employers, said DEED agency and performance manager Rachel Vilsack. \n\"Having business locations across the globe or across the United States could be [a reason],\" Vilsack said. She said large companies also likely have a bigger human resources office that can support increasing workforce diversity. \nBee Yang worries that his children's multilingualism might not survive as they grow up in a largely English-speaking society. Yang said he hears many young people speaking less and less Hmong. \n\"If they don't hold on tight to it they might forget who they are,\" Yang said with Chalee translating. For now, at least, Chalee still has a foot in both worlds. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chalee yang", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "evan frost", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vilsack", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bee yang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vavrus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chalee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frances vavrus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rachel vilsack", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "minnesota department of employment and economic development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn center high school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "park center high school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. census bureau", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brooklyn center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minn.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nobles county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramsey county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hennepin county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thailand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mankato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:04.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e79f53157ab7f357caea8e9b1a76fca236ccac1e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg999YYspK0ijd888gwN6tfunLtTbtwaW6OFZ17Y9y0QU8X.jFq7tKI6AEvSIEu2FNTs_KgjKvF0RxF2nyz9rTr9jqnNIY1OpXv0Un8zeKcaO49gE.p_Yr5K", "site_full": "www.poandpo.com", "site": "poandpo.com", "site_section": "http://poandpo.com/rss-articles/", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "POST Online Media", "title": "Limoneira appoints Mark Palamountain as CFO", "title_full": "Limoneira appoints Mark Palamountain as CFO", "published": "2017-12-07T06:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "HR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e79f53157ab7f357caea8e9b1a76fca236ccac1e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg999YYspK0ijd888gwN6tfunLtTbtwaW6OFZ17Y9y0QU8X.jFq7tKI6AEvSIEu2FNTs_KgjKvF0RxF2nyz9rTr9jqnNIY1OpXv0Un8zeKcaO49gE.p_Yr5K", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T06:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "Limoneira appoints Mark Palamountain as CFO", "text": "Limoneira appoints Mark Palamountain as CFO Staff Writer | Santa Paula, Ca., USA | Thursday December 7, 2017 | 42 minutes ago Limoneira Company, an agricultural business, announced that it will name Mark Palamountain as its new chief financial officer, treasurer and corporate secretary, effective January 8, 2018.

One of the diseases that falls under the category of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is emphysema. Emphysema is also referred as obstructive disorder because inhalation and exhalation is slow down or even stop some time due to over inflammation of alveoli. According to the National Emphysema Foundation emphysema is characterized by injuries to the wall of lungs between air sacs. Emphysema can cause damage to air sac which results the change of shape of air sac or often destruction. This results the low gas exchanged in the lungs leading difficulty in breathing. The damage happen to thin membrane lining of air sacs is beyond repair which reduces flow of oxygen in the blood stream. This happens because air is trapped inside alveoli due to its damage results insufficient space for air to enter in the sacs. Emphysema have higher death due to respiratory failure, lung infection or heart attack. The emphysema patient can be treated by improving shortness in breath and reducing the number of hospitalization. Before treatment a pulmonary function test is performed to find how much air patient can blow. \nView Report Preview @ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/emphysema-treatment-market.asp \nThe major driving factor for emphysema treatment in global market is smoking habit of enormous population worldwide. As per survey smokers have six time more chances to suffer from emphysema compared to non-smokers. Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is also another driving factor for emphysema but this has low cause compared to smokers. AAT deficiency is a form genetic disorder which results the damage of white blood cell on normal tissue in lungs. Approximately 2% to 3% of people suffering emphysema due to AAT deficiency. Treatment given to emphysema by inhale steroid method have some side effects such as weaken of bone and high risk of heart diseases. Treatment by oral steroid for emphysema may cause high blood pressure problem which my lead to heart diseases again. \nIt is to be expected that the global market of emphysema treatment will show tremendous growth.

Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio, left, and Keith Gregg, the county's Chief Information Technology Officer, right, speak at a press conference Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, at the Government Center about t... \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

I have the tools \u2013 I just have no willpower or desire to obey the tools I\u2019ve been given. I want to want to\u2026 but I haven\u2019t done anything about my want to. I\u2019ve started and stopped and started and stopped multiple times this summer, thinking this time will work. I\u2019ve had health scares reminding me if I don\u2019t take charge of my health I\u2019ll be heading down a path I really don\u2019t want to walk\u2026 heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, etc. and even that hasn\u2019t changed my behavior. God\u2019s lavished His grace and love on me\u2026 putting people and reminders and even speaking to me directly Himself about what He desires and finally I started listening, really listening.\nI truly desire to love and obey God with my whole heart. I know that when I choose to live a life of disobedience I block God\u2019s blessings from my life. You would think I would want His blessings more than I would want a cookie or ice cream or (fill in the blank). However, the food keeps calling, I keep answering and then feeling guilty for being too weak to resist things I don\u2019t even truly want.\n\nYesterday I realized an important truth. Unless I make a personal covenant with God, I don\u2019t stick with my choices. Something always comes up, I somehow justify my actions and what I want to do never happens. I end up circling around the same issues continuously. So, I sat down and thought about why I was successful last summer versus struggling so hard this summer. Last summer I knew that God wanted me to fast and learn a new lifestyle. I felt better living in that lifestyle and after a while, it wasn\u2019t difficult anymore, it just was.\nI know the guidelines God has asked me to live under. They aren\u2019t difficult and while they require giving up some food, possibly forever, there is still a lot of food left to choose from. I sat down this morning and dedicated my life to living a lifestyle of fasting. Fasting from the things God wants me to stay away from permanently, permission to eat certain things on certain occasions but not regularly and freedom to eat other things always. I wrote it all down in black and white so there would be no arguing when cravings hit and no way to justify giving in to temptation. This time it\u2019s not a time period of fasting\u2026 it\u2019s a lifestyle of fasting.\nI truly want to live under God\u2019s blessings. I truly want to obey Him in all areas. In order for me to actively succeed with those goals, I have to live a lifestyle of fasting. Not a temporary fast, not a \u201cdiet\u201d or meal plan. A fast from certain foods and a complete surrender to His way.\nI am serious this time. So much so that the snack cupboard that is permanently off limits to me has been relocated from beneath the microwave (where it stared me in the face and called my name multiple times a day) to a cupboard I will now never have reason to open for myself. A lifestyle of fasting. Feel free to ask me how I\u2019m doing. I choose to be authentic and accountable to those who want to ask.\n\u00a9 Cheri Swalwell 2017\n \n \n \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cheri swalwell", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "niv", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:05.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "50e61a3cc349e8101132593ad5e4c7b95d27096d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSm1T92cToJGYEMWPaYhcX5wXo036qFFhRi9rUVe42r28LWebNy8kOUQQS1J4.rTRvmnUxFEUaljPLvrN9rfocZGz1r_GT5cRIDHYpHsKM188aA1OfeYq9zkkLn2Uk1oIlRU2IAyM23FFyH5uz1CmyQwrnc4pnwEWy9ervgrGd09SSUXBw1buG4epxa4xmae9R44x1MWAeTxSQ8OqJpAtRA", "site_full": "www.chennaiclassic.com", "site": "chennaiclassic.com", "site_section": "http://www.chennaiclassic.com/feed/1/posts", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "Chennai  - ChennaiClassic.com", "title": "Hiring for Prodapt Hiring Architect / Senior Architect - RPA in Chennai, for Exp. 8 - 13 yrs at Prod (Chennai Job)", "title_full": "Hiring for Prodapt Hiring Architect / Senior Architect - RPA in Chennai, for Exp. 8 - 13 yrs at Prod (Chennai Job)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 64302, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "50e61a3cc349e8101132593ad5e4c7b95d27096d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSm1T92cToJGYEMWPaYhcX5wXo036qFFhRi9rUVe42r28LWebNy8kOUQQS1J4.rTRvmnUxFEUaljPLvrN9rfocZGz1r_GT5cRIDHYpHsKM188aA1OfeYq9zkkLn2Uk1oIlRU2IAyM23FFyH5uz1CmyQwrnc4pnwEWy9ervgrGd09SSUXBw1buG4epxa4xmae9R44x1MWAeTxSQ8OqJpAtRA", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "Hiring for Prodapt Hiring Architect / Senior Architect - RPA in Chennai, for Exp. 8 - 13 yrs at Prod (Chennai Job)", "text": "Hiring for Prodapt Hiring Architect / Senior Architect - RPA in Chennai, for Exp. 8 - 13 yrs at Prod (Chennai Job) Reply to: (Not Shown) (Please mention ChennaiClassic.com when contacting) Job Description: Dear Candidate, Prodapt is hiring Architect / Senior Architect - RPA for Chennai location.

BriefingWire.com , 12/07/2017 - With a large number of players, the global market for preservative blends demonstrates a fragmented and a competitive landscape, finds a research report by Transparency Market Research (TMR).\nThe leading companies, such as The Dow Chemical Co., Lonza, and Lanxess, are primarily concentrating on improving the product definition, design, commercialization, and manufacturing phases, owing to the increasing demand for beauty care, home care, and personal care products. Over the coming years, these players are likely to invest heavily in R&D activities in order to introduce innovative and advanced products, which may lead to intensified competition within the market. \nAs per the report, the worried market for preservative blends presented an opportunity of US$133.5 mn in 2015. Rising at a healthy CAGR of 5.60% during the period from 2016 to 2024, the market is likely to attain a value of US$215.9 mn by the end of the period of the forecast. The demand for these preservatives from the personal care application segment is higher than others. Thanks to the increasing awareness among consumers pertaining to personal health and hygiene and the rise in their purchasing power, the segment is likely to remain exhibiting a high demand for these preservatives in the years to come.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "global industry analysis & opportunity assessment", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lonza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dow chemical co.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "transparency market research", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lanxess", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:05.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "073274ba1a1d96e6d47914246fee5ecbe078b01b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_7sZBOjv13UnoYqRkC1lSRBOJA3Se5agvTJ5Tm8CNJIpIW3isCyN44oA5T063igpo-", "site_full": "www.camaro6.com", "site": "camaro6.com", "site_section": "http://www.camaro6.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=4", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Members Area - CAMARO6", "title": "Hard Bound Books ?", "title_full": "Hard Bound Books ? - CAMARO6", "published": "2017-07-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "498ac28974cd34047583741a87d3cc04b84fcda8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_7sZBOjv13UnoYqRkC1lSRBOJA3Se5agvTJ5Tm8CNJIpIW3isCyN44zrlobkIHukeficMoaRWIYw--", "ord_in_thread": 10, "author": "hammdo", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I\u2019m all in too...\n-Don", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:06.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "391c85bb0b2923d6a606195baa6c6b9507a447ef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmgPp6PRsSqxX2.9UAyURoUR0si.0Usb9b_fBaA52W3VOXeD94TxaT0EBN3aOVFW6Pt1EJhmqk1WFmhYhWRu8hcqtBf9IOtvmIcWys2S9J8hA--", "site_full": "resume-formats.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://resume-formats.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "More Than 10000 CV Formats For Free Download", "title": "Better example of cv free download", "title_full": "Better example of cv free download", "published": "2017-12-07T12:17:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "391c85bb0b2923d6a606195baa6c6b9507a447ef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmgPp6PRsSqxX2.9UAyURoUR0si.0Usb9b_fBaA52W3VOXeD94TxaT0EBN3aOVFW6Pt1EJhmqk1WFmhYhWRu8hcqtBf9IOtvmIcWys2S9J8hA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nikki Singh (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:17:00.000+02:00", "title": "Better example of cv free download", "text": "Excellent Curriculum Vitae / Resume with Career Objective, Job Profile & Work Experience for B.E. in Electronics & Communication Engineer CV Freshers & Experienced in Word / Doc / Pdf Free Download \n\nV.AMRESH \n\n63, Avani Complex, Block - B, Flat No-307, Richi Road, Tirupur \u2013 641629             Email Id:    amresh@gmail.com Phone No: 919362673391 \nOBJECTIVE \nTo pursue an exciting career in an organization which is challenging, creative and would like to be a part of an excellent team that makes contribution in achieving the company\u2019s objective.    \n\nEDUCATION QUALIFICATION \nBACHELOR OF ENGINEERING College Name: Sasurie College of Engineering, Vijayamanglam, Perunduari.

Great choice Simon! \nLet\u2019s see if I felt that this movie would be worthy of being in the company of my others favorite movies in the genre of Road Trip Movies. \u2026 \n\u201cI have a photogenic memory. \u201d\u2013 Ethan \n  2 (1 Feb 2011 and 5   A man trying to get back to LA before his wife gives birth, meets an aspiring actor who makes his trip a living Hell. \nMy Take on it \u2013 I decided that in order to make my guest choices of the Genre for the Genre Grandeur series more personal (and expand my own personal horizons of these genres), I will take a recommendation from my guest for a film to watch for this Genre Guesstimation series. \nThis film was Simon\u2019s choice for me to watch. \nWhoever decided to pair up Zack Galifianakis and Robert Downey Jr. was pure genius. \nThe two of them have amazing chemistry together that is filled with so much energy the whole time. \nThey are able to play off one another so well and they make it all seem so real that we want to keep watching the interactions between the two of them for as long as we can. \nThe film feels like a modern updated version of Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987) and despite neither of the actors or characters matching up to the roles played by Steve Martin and John Candy, they do a wonderful job here. \nThe jokes keep coming scene after scene and it\u2019s so difficult to not laugh so hard at the antics of these two characters. \nThere road trip is quite interesting to wtac unfold and I would love to find a way to watch these characters continue to interact. \nBottom Line \u2013 Galifianakis and Downey Jr. have amazing energy and chemistry that help make this film so much fun to watch. The two of them play off each other so well and they make you want to keep watching these two characters interact. The film itself feels like an updated version of Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987) and does it so well. The jokes keep coming every few minutes and it\u2019s so hard to not laugh at everything that happens to these men during their trip.   On Access Hollywood (1996) to promote the film, Robert Downey, Jr. said that working on this film was his \u201cmost glorious experience\u201d in all his career. (From IMDB ) \nGenre Grandeur Worthy? \u2013 Comes really close. This film is hilarious, but something slight is missing from raising it up one more notch on the scale. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zack galifianakis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert downey jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "downey jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john candy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "galifianakis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert downey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "imdb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moustache movie news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:06.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "58717eff4b00430985b113cd3ceff05a675e4f76", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4LzpGR7363LhCOOcphhMhYTjs9xftYBzKk4xKubi36_GkHlbpxjnlnea6oPERDbXvY98lVsSOLPLlSvS5bJYiwr.j", "site_full": "www.booking.com", "site": "booking.com", "site_section": "https://www.booking.com/hotel/za/bread-amp-barrel-slaley-stellenbosch.en-gb.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Guest house Bread &amp; Barrel Slaley Stellenbosch, South Africa - Booking.com ", "title": "109 Verified Reviews of Bread & Barrel Slaley Stellenbosch | Booking.com", "title_full": "109 Verified Reviews of Bread & Barrel Slaley Stellenbosch | Booking.com", "published": "2017-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 33, "participants_count": 29, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://t-ec.bstatic.com/static/img/facebook-image-else/566c7081f1deeaca39957e96365c3908f83b95af.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 105, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c2a3d471368d803fc3f8238fca51a65360c2b050", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4LzpGR7363LhCOOcphhMhYTjs9xftYBzKk4xKubi36_GkHlbpxjnlnea6oPERDbXvY98lVsSOLPLlSuDftL_EDKBebBotylphne.cB4SI49kwNCX6Si1Ei2YceD75GH.6Lrc-", "ord_in_thread": 33, "author": "Anne", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "\"Lovely\"", "text": "\ub207 For this price you will get a lot.

I've tried hard to see this from an anti-EU Leaver point of view, but I struggle.\nLeo Varadkar clearly doesn't want a border, any more than May & co and the DUP. No-one wants a border. Including the rest of the EU, as they have made clear from the start. That much is unarguable.\nBut if, post-Brexit, there is divergence of regulations between the EU and the UK - which Mogg says is 'whence come the benefits' of leaving - then goods and services from the UK may not and in some cases will not comply with EU law governing the single market.\nWhat you are suggesting - especially with the 'petty bureaucrat' jibe - is that it is somehow unreasonable for the EU not to allow illegal trade across their border.\nIf the regulations in the UK are tightened in some areas, is it unreasonable for the UK to restrict entry of goods and services that don't comply? Would that be the fault of petty bureaucrats in Westminster? Or should we just allow a free-for-all?\nVaradkar's government must comply with EU law, which is why Brexit & divergence force a hard border unless a different solution can be found.

But lets try and put this simply. In 1921 the Island of Ireland had a civil war as the republic rose up against there British rulers. In 1922 the Ireland of Ireland was split and the Irish Free State created in the South. Northern Ireland chose to stay British and remained within the UK. To this day the Northern Irish remains British because they are happy being part of the United Kingdom. It is the Republic of Ireland or should I say LV who is pushing to reunited Ireland. Northern Irish citizens have made it clear in previous Irish Border polls that they have no desire to reunite Ireland like LV wants. Only the Northern Irish can call a border poll not the Republic as it was the Northern Irish that decided to stay under the rule of the British (United Kingdom). The DUP have no desire to call a border poll and there is no desire for anymore elections in the near future. Westminster has to give permission for a border poll to take place as well because payment of such a poll comes out of British Tax Payers pockets.\nIn the Belfast Telegraph on the 25th october 2017 it was said that if a border poll did take place today the Northern Irish would vote 62.86% to remain in the UK and 37.14% against remaining in the UK which is far different from LV's claim that 50% plus 1 would vote to reunite Ireland.\nSo if a border poll happened Northern Ireland would remain in the UK.\nThe border in Ireland was originally created to keep the peace between the North and South and to split Ireland as the Irish Free State (The Republic) wanted to be Independent.\nLets roll forward to recent history. The Republic of Ireland decided to join the EEC that later became the EU because its closest trading partner the UK joined. Back then the EEC was a trading agreement between European countries and nothing else.\nRecent history in Northern Ireland. The Northern Irish voted in the Democratic Unionist Party in June 2017 in there recent election. Sinn Fein came second. Both parties must form a power sharing assembly but have failed. This leaves the DUP as the ruling party but no assembly in power.

I have to say it doesn't seem unreasonable to me; an open border is all he wants out of this so he has to do what he must to get it.\nHopefully, as you say, the wording can be changed to make everyone happy.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://m.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/brexit/varadkar-keeps-open-mind-over-mays-redraft-of-border-deal-36386249.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:07.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "94c7d5b85043c06b48c15d151094494dace66c97", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWwCSqS.zsR3zaE4Bj3RNSrsIxDLNK0LqNjxB1OMWNtQ9EY_XT.T4BvuZ5tvbdeaiheSWcqaFQI9PJrqvIsn.YgT5m_swx5wguEurgZZT0d7Y3n7GdOEG7TEmQB1Tm84OKxjgk9A.PKmmISy67UuYC8LThIQYguEOxG1HZHsEieoeEn50UkRq6Mg--", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-women-lingerie-nightwear/?spm=a2o4k.category-090108000000.0.0.F4lrN4", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Women's Lingerie &amp; Nightwear for the Best Prices in Malaysia", "title": "LadyFinery Soft Nursing Maternity Bra Comfort Sleep Wireless Underwear For Women(Blue)", "title_full": "LadyFinery Soft Nursing Maternity Bra Comfort Sleep Wireless Underwear For Women(Blue) | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2016-12-09T05:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 52, "participants_count": 26, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.726, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ba65595f4c488e3d552a3995b7c229f69b09eafd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWwCSqS.zsR3zaE4Bj3RNSrsIxDLNK0LqNjxB1OMWNtQ9EY_XT.T4BvuZ5tvbdeaiheSWcqaFQI9PJrqvIsn.YgT5m_swx5wguEurgZZT0d7Y3n7GdOEG7TEmQB1Tm84OKxjgk9A.PKmmISy67UuYC8LThIQYguEOxG1HZHsEieod6xsZ3OdC7VfDVjImfu4iH", "ord_in_thread": 52, "author": "MOHD F.", "published": "2017-11-18T00:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "Good", "text": "Bought for my wife.

I swallowed an ogre whole. You could be next! \u201d Hogsqueal \n  1 (4   Three children who move to a country estate with their mother discover a fantasy world filled with goblins and other creatures that wish to find a way of destroying our world. \nMy Take on it \u2013 This is a film that I have been avoiding for quite some time because I assumed that it would be too childish. \nOne of my sons, read the books that this is based on last year and even watched the movie when he finished reading them, but even that didn\u2019t make me want to watch this. \nFor some reason, I decided this week to check it out and thoroughly enjoyed it so much more than I had expected. \nI really enjoyed getting to know the characters and learning so much about everything that happens as they also found out the mysteries of the Spiderwick house. \nThe fact that this story layers the fantasy world on the real world is such an intriguing idea and helps keep things fascinating the whole way through. \nLoved the way that the story is part adventure and part about how family dynamics work because it helps make the story feel more genuine and realistic that way. \nThe choice to use Martin Short and Seth Rogen as the voices of two prominent creatures of the fantasy world is great because they both are able to be humorous and authoritative at the same time. \nThe special effects are great and they use them in an extremely clever way in order to help make us believe that we are watching a story that has potential to seem to be real. \nBottom Line -Very interesting idea that works really well. Enjoyed getting to know the characters and finding out so many intriguing facts about the fantasy world that moves in conjunction with our own. The story is part adventure and part about family dynamics that help make things seem quite realistic and even plausible. Short and Rogen are both hilarious and charming in their voice work. The special effects are done in quite a clever way and help us believe the possibilities of stories like this one.   The facial features of the brownie, \u201cThimbletack\u201d, bear an uncanny resemblance to those of Sir Laurence Olivier. This is most apparent in the scene where Aunt Lucinda (Joan Plowright, Olivier\u2019s widow) calls him \u201cmy little guardian angel\u201d.
