In addition, integrated action planning and business intelligence reporting from Tableau empower lenders to more effectively track, report and trend loan defects and proactively mitigate future risk.\n\n\"Digital innovation must extend to mortgage QC if lenders hope to maintain and improve loan quality while accelerating the origination process through the pursuit of the eMortgage,\" said Teri Sundh, CEO of TRK Connection. \"Insight RDM is the engine lenders need to drive loan quality throughout their organization.\"\n\nAbout Waterstone Mortgage Corporation:\nHeadquartered in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, Waterstone Mortgage is a wholly owned subsidiary of WaterStone Bank SSB (NASDAQ:WSBF) with assets of more than $1.8 billion.

My Mother purchased this recently for my Father who is 84 years old, however he wouldn't try it, so she's getting him a standard wheelchair. It has only been driven a little indoors to move it/test it, but it has never been ridden outside or even at a store. It's total weight is 72.5lbs, However it breaks down for transport and the heaviest piece is 27.5 lbs. I have a larger SUV and only had to remove the basket in order to put it in the back of my truck, but my mother broke it down further and was able to fit it in her car, an older Buick. This may avoid having to attach a carrying device to the back of your vehicle as it is designed to be broken down and more easily portable. This retailed for $999. My mother got it on sale but this price is still less than she paid for it. So I would appreciate the listed price being considered as it is a good deal, but I will consider a reasonable offer.

BriefingWire.com , 12/07/2017 - A new report added to the repository of Market Research Reports Search Engine \u201cPhosphoric Acid Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast 2017 - 2022\u201d is a comprehensive repository of information, providing market share, size, and forecast.\nRequest for Sample Report @ www.mrrse.com/sample/3801 \nPhosphoric acid is a colorless, odorless, and an inorganic acid used to acidify food products and beverages. Phosphoric acid is also utilized for preparing various types of phosphates for application in fertilizers. This acid also finds applications in non-fertilizers. Various types of end-uses of phosphoric acid include diammonium phosphate (DAP), monoammonium phosphate (MAP), trisodium phosphate (TSP), food additives and industrial uses. \nLiberalization of Fertilizer Production Industry and Shortage of Cultivable Lands to Drive Market Growth \nMajority of countries in the Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, cost of fertilizers are being strictly regulated by subsidies and import duties. For instance, agrarian economies such as Bangladesh and India are deficient in phosphate rocks and potash reserves. Liberalization of fertilizer production industry, along with the presence of numerous free markets is likely to fuel demand for phosphoric acid. Availability of cultivable land has witnessed a decline over the recent past, owing to rapid rate of urbanization. Arable lands are decreasing globally on the back of industrialization, high demand for energy and population expansion. However, efficient fertilizers have the potential to uplift cultivation capacity of the available arable lands. Phosphoric acid is used for producing effective fertilizers, which offer essential nutrients to crops. Currently, agricultural productivity is being improved worldwide by employing phosphate fertilizers such as TSP, DAP and MAP. \nNature of the global market for phosphoric acid is highly competitive, with the existence of several large & small vendors worldwide. Numerous integrated producers are located at large phosphate rick basins in China, North Africa and North America., with approximately 50% of global phosphate capacity accounted by these producers. Major players in the market realize significant benefits in terms of competitive pricing and low cost of production, owing to the easily available raw materials through integration. \nModerate Expansion Estimated for Global Phosphoric Acid Market through 2022 \nAccording to a new report by research, the global phosphoric acid market is anticipated to maintain its expansion trajectory over the forecast period (2017-2022), although at a moderate CAGR. Global sales of phosphoric acid is forecast to surpass US$ 30,000 Mn in revenues by 2022-end. \nAsia-Pacific excluding Japan (APEJ) will continue to hold its position of being the most lucrative market for phosphoric acid. The market in APEJ will reflect the fastest expansion through 2022. Middle East and North America are also expected to remain lucrative regions for expansion of the global phosphoric acid market. The phosphoric acid market in North America and Latin America will register similar CAGRs through 2022.

It is a syndrome that occurs in patients with liver dysfunction and is defined as a spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities, after exclusion of brain disease. Hepatic encephalopathy is categorized by intellectual impairment, a depressed level of consciousness, and personality changes. The symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy includes changes in sleeping patterns, disorientation, slurred speech and agitation, drowsiness or confusion, and excitement. The influencing factors for hepatic encephalopathy includes constipation (due to increased nitrogen load), increased protein intake with azotemia, drugs, and hypoxia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and renal dysfunction. Report Overview and TOC @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/hepatic-encephalopathy-market.html \nThe hepatic encephalopathy market can be segmented by types, treatment, and geography. Based on types, the market can be categorized into Type A, Type B, and Type C. Type A hepatic encephalopathy is related to acute liver failure that leads to rapid deterioration of the liver in patients suffering from pre-existing liver disorders. Acute liver failure that causes complications such as elevated pressure and excessive bleeding in the brain is known as fulminant hepatic failure that requires emergency hospitalization. Type B hepatic encephalopathy is related to portal-systemic bypass deprived of liver disorder. Type B hepatic encephalopathy arises when blood streams around the liver and hence the liver cannot remove or control elements in the blood. Type B generally arises as a result of hereditary abnormalities and as a result of invasive procedures or trauma. Type C hepatic encephalopathy is related to cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is the last phase of chronic liver disease when damaging fibrosis matures. As a result, problems of cirrhosis is reflected in bruising and bleeding easily, jaundice (a yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes), painful swelling of the legs (edema), fluid build-up in the abdomen (ascites), and portal hypertension (a rise in the blood pressure within a system of veins called the portal venous system). \nFurthermore, on the basis of treatments, the hepatic encephalopathy market is categorized into lactulose, antibiotics, probiotics, branched-chain amino acids, and liver transplantation. Lactulose is a synthetic form of sugar that is not absorbed into the body. Lactulose creates an aggressive environment for the bad microbes in the intestine, thus reducing ammonia production in the intestine. Antibiotics such as Rifaximin and Metronidazole may be used to slow down the development of bacteria in the intestine, including bacteria which produce ammonia. Rifaximin is slowly absorbed into the body that helps it to deliberate in the intestines, where it can decrease the growth of unfavorable bacteria. Probiotics or favorable microbes can change the balance of microbes in the intestines, increasing the proportion of favorable bacteria. This can result in reduced levels of ammonia production and other toxic substances. Branched-chain amino acids Valine, Leucine, and Isoleucine can help uphold muscle mass and increase ammonia clearance. Liver transplantation is the final treatment for hepatic encephalopathy wherein the damaged liver is replaced with a healthy donor\u2019s liver. Patients who receive a liver transplant recover their brain function. However, it is important to control and stop incidents of over hepatic encephalopathy, because several incidents of over hepatic encephalopathy can possibly lead to enduring and therefore irreversible brain damage. Request for Broucher @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=31535 \nOn the basis of geography, the global hepatic encephalopathy market is segmented into five key regions, North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East & Africa. North America is the dominant market followed by Europe. Rising patient awareness about different treatment options and increasing demand for treatment is expected to influence the market in North America. The hepatic encephalopathy market is growing due to increasing population, better treatment options, and rising demand for rapid diagnosis globally. Presently, the U.S. is the main country contributing to the global hepatic encephalopathy market, where the financial burden of hepatic encephalopathy is significant. Followed by ascites, hepatic encephalopathy is the second most common cause for hospitalization of cirrhotic patients in the U.S. In addition, the market for global hepatic encephalopathy is expected to expand at a healthy rate in the next few years due to lack of treatment options. For Specific and Customized Requirements @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=CR&rep_id=31535 \nThe major players operating in the global hepatic encephalopathy market are Alfa Wassermann S.p.A, Cosmo Pharmaceuticals S.p.A, KannaLife Sciences, Inc., Ocera Therapeutics, Inc., Rebiotix Inc., Spherium Biomed S.L., and Umecrine Cognition AB among others. Increasing competition among key players to develop new therapies for hepatic encephalopathy will drive the market globally. \nThe report offers a comprehensive evaluation of the market.

In this week\u2019s edition: Some millennials would prefer robot politicians; Reader/publisher relationship influences ad effectiveness; and Brits unhappy at hijacking their computers for Bitcoin mining. Some millennials would prefer robot politicians \nMore than four in every ten (43%) consumers prefer to deal with a machine than a real person, according to the Mindshare Trends Report. \nThe report shows that consumers of all ages are embracing technological advancements: \n\u2013 46% are willing to use facial recognition \n\u2013 57% agree that machines will be able to do tasks more effectively than humans \n\u2013 A third of millennials would prefer an artificially intelligent politician \n\u2013 52% of 18-34 year olds think it is sometimes easier to deal with a machine than a real person \nAnother prediction the report makes for 2018 is a higher level of scrutiny from consumers on how their personal data is being used. Eight out of ten (80%) would like more control over what brands do with their data, though 58% agree to terms and conditions without reading them. There is a stronger trust in Amazon when it comes to this data \u2013 38% of people would choose to give Amazon access to their data over Facebook, Google, and Apple (rising to 48% of 65+). Reader/publisher relationship influences ad effectiveness \nThe relationship a reader has with a publisher has far more impact on the effectiveness of online ads than the surrounding editorial content, finds a study by Inskin Media , Research Now , and Conquest Research . \nThis suggests that concerns around brand safety may be misunderstood. The study reveals that ads on the publisher-branded sites increased consideration for the advertiser by 60%, compared to the ads on the site without publisher branding. \nAmong readers with a close relationship to the publisher, consideration for the advertiser is 152% higher than among those who see the ads on the site without publisher branding. Alongside this, advertiser brand warmth is 33% higher, brand empathy 20% higher, and brand proximity (how close people feel to a brand) 19% higher. \nIn contrast, the report finds no systematic pattern to suggest that editorial content impacts the ad \u2013 be the article positive or negative, or whether it has a similar theme to the ad. For example, a supermarket food advert next to an article about obesity does not overtly affect any brand metrics at all. Brits unhappy at hijacking their computers for Bitcoin mining \nTwo-thirds (65%) of Brits don\u2019t like the idea of their computers being hacked by those mining Bitcoin, according to a study by Reboot . \nInstead, the overwhelming majority of respondents (84%) say they would like to be asked for permission before the computer is used for Bitcoin mining. A similar proportion (83%) would be worried about the security of their computer being compromised as a result of Bitcoin mining. \nIt is not just individuals the British public doesn\u2019t want mining Bitcoin. Almost seven-in-ten (68%) would be unhappy with companies using their computers processing power to analyse or mine Bitcoins. Meanwhile, 62% fear that Bitcoin mining could damage their computer in some way. \nOne of the main concerns of Bitcoin mining is the financial reward. Seven-in-ten (70%) of Brits say they would be concerned about who gets the money raised from Bitcoin mining on their computer. Because of this, nearly half (48%) of respondents would not be open to Bitcoin mining on the computers, even if it meant reduced exposure to online adverts.

According to a new CareerBuilder survey, companies lost an average of $14,900 on every bad hire in the last year, and it's a common mistake \u2014 nearly three in four employers (74 percent) say they've hired the wrong person for a position. \n\nThe survey was conducted online by Harris Poll from August 16 to September 15, 2017 and included a representative sample of 2,257 full-time hiring managers and human resource professionals and 3,697 full-time workers across industries and company sizes in the U.S. private sector.\n\"It's important to note that there's a ripple affect with bad hires. Disengagement is contagious \u2014 poor performers lower the bar for other workers on their teams, and their bad habits spread throughout the organization,\" said Rosemary Haefner , chief human resources officer at CareerBuilder. \"The best thing hiring managers can do is put in the time and effort on the front end to make sure they have the best available pool of applicants for every job opening. And, just as importantly, have good procedures in place for evaluating candidates.\" \nWhen asked how a bad hire affected their business in the last year, employers cited less productivity (37 percent), lost time to recruit and train another worker (32 percent) and compromised quality of work (31 percent).\nWhat Makes a Bad Hire\nHow do you know if you've hired the wrong person? When asked what made them think they had made the wrong decision, employers who have made a bad hire said: \nWhile the candidate didn't have all the needed skills, thought they could learn quickly: 35 percent Candidate lied about his/her qualifications: 33 percent Took a chance on a nice person: 32 percent Pressured to fill the role quickly: 30 percent Had a hard time finding qualified candidates: 29 percent Focused on skills and not attitude: 29 percent Ignored some of the warning signs: 25 percent Lacked adequate tools to find the right person: 10 percent Didn't do a complete background check: 10 percent Didn't work close enough with HR: 7 percent Overall, this is how employers categorize someone as a bad hire: \nThe worker didn't produce the proper quality of work: 54 percent The worker had a negative attitude: 53 percent The worker didn't work well with other workers: 50 percent The worker had immediate attendance problems: 46 percent The worker's skills did not match what they claimed to be able to do when hired: 45 percent Workers Have Regrets, Too\nEmployers aren't the only ones making regretful decisions. Two in three workers (66 percent) say they have accepted a job and later realized it was a bad fit, and while half of these workers (50 percent) have quit within six months, more than a third (37 percent) have stuck it out. Workers who said they had taken a job only to realize it's a bad fit said they noticed their mistake based on toxic work culture (46 percent), boss' management style (40 percent), job didn't match what was described in the job listing and interviews (37 percent), and a lack of clear expectations around the role (33 percent). \nDon't Let the Good Ones Go \nWhile the cost of hiring the wrong person can be high, the cost of letting a good worker go is even higher. According to employers, the average cost of losing a good hire was $29,600 this year. And while 75 percent of workers say they're loyal to their current employer, much less (54 percent) say they feel their company is loyal to them, and nearly a third (31 percent) say they are likely to change jobs in the next year. \nSurvey Methodology\nThis survey was conducted online within the U.S. by Harris Poll on behalf of CareerBuilder among 2,257 hiring and human resource managers ages 18 and over (employed full-time, not self-employed, non-government) and 3,697 workers ages 18 and over (employed full-time, not self-employed, non-government) between August 16 and September 15, 2017 (percentages for some questions are based on a subset, based on their responses to certain questions). With a pure probability sample of 2,257 and 3,697, one could say with a 95 percent probability that the overall results have a sampling error of +/- 2.06 and +/- 1.61 percentage points, respectively. Sampling error for data from sub-samples is higher and varies.\nAbout CareerBuilder\u00ae\nCareerBuilder is a global, end-to-end human capital solutions company focused on helping employers find, hire and manage great talent.

As I sat down for Shabbat dinner in Birmingham, I knew that Jewish students in more than 30 other cities were doing the same, and I was reminded of the phrase that Alan Senitt (z\u201dl) coined in his two years as UJS President: \u201cmore Jewish students doing more Jewish things.\u201d That young Jewish people leave their homes, want to create Jewish lives for themselves and others, and work so hard to do so, is a testament to the strength of our Jewish identity as a community. UJS is a vibrant and vital organisation, and its meaning for me goes so much deeper than just a political ideology or the few policies that a Presidential candidate puts forward; it is the essence and the future of Jewish life in the UK.\nI grew up in BBYO, and it is where I developed the bulk of my Jewish identity. Its core ideologies; pluralism, activism, Zionism, Judaism and peer-leadership are inextricably linked to my understanding of my Judaism. When students question why we should stand up for people from minority identities, I have learnt that it\u2019s not about politics, it\u2019s our collective responsibility as Jewish people.\nWhen we think about cross-communalism, we should unequivocally say that community is enhanced by different expressions of Judaism, not burdened by it. There is a reason why my campaign focuses on tangible and achievable policies; we are nothing without transformative activism. We are strongest when we are together.\nREAD MORE:\nMeet the candidates vying to be the next UJS president OPINION \u2013 Lawrence Rosenberg: Jewish students aren\u2019t snowflakes OPINION \u2013 Annie Cohen : My non Zionism makes me the best candidate to lead this union Our union is powerful. That\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learnt in my four years within UJS. Be that from campaigning on my campus with my J-Soc against divisive boycott motions, or standing with Jewish students across the country at NUS conferences against leadership who consistently spouted antisemitic rhetoric.\nI was lucky to be able to get involved in UJS before I\u2019d even stepped foot on my campus. I know what we can achieve when we are united, when we have leadership willing and able to reach out to all Jewish students.\nThat\u2019s the sort of UJS President I want to be. One that knows and embodies all four core values of UJS, on campus, in our community, and in the wider student movement.\nSo when I say this campaign isn\u2019t about me or my politics, I really mean it. I\u2019m not here because it seems like a good job, or because it may be a good stepping stone for whatever I may do next. I\u2019m here because facilitating and empowering Jewish life on campus is at the core of my identity as a young Jewish person.\nAnd in order to continue growing in strength, and deliver, as Alan Senitt said, more Jewish things, we need to embody Jo Cox\u2019s immortal words, and embed it into the heart of everything we do.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/timesofisrael", "https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=timesofisrael"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hannah rose every j-soc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jo cox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan senitt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "judaism", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "presidential candidate", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "birmingham", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:31.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e1222b25f381c4fb5c2bfe231d1bda53dc5870d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvv2_osI4TYx.njVMBY78mxYXg27kbEraw3omG5rLx.Ixy29Z.wDJhipAiDN.KOJpvUFLdrBrHqkrJ0_uuQT7Om2hkmH900M_OsEm_rtWsRsWWTx_QcTEWKXq78T_E4BUeVBWH3SwYHwd0L.6mmfdz0QHVf0EHve5l99wwYsVji5enTU7b_ZiIPZCNtaEvHHp1XiHmjX5acP_M-", "site_full": "www.4-traders.com", "site": "4-traders.com", "site_section": "http://www.4-traders.com/rss/FeedNews.php", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Stock market news - Company News  - 4-Traders.com", "title": "Global Copper Mining Category - Procurement Report 2017 - Construction Industry Consumes Around 25% - Research and Markets", "title_full": "Global Copper Mining Category - Procurement Report 2017 - Construction Industry Consumes Around 25% - Research and Markets", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27554, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e42c33a893f2a8a79e2a093ed5a089231d594c20", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvv2_osI4TYx.njVMBY78mxYXg27kbEraw3omG5rLx.Ixy29Z.wDJhipAiDN.KOJpvUFLdrBrHqkrJ0_uuQT7Om2hkmH900M_OsEm_rtWsRsWWTx_QcTEWKXq78T_E4BUeVBWH3SwYHwd31BrA6MeDBqg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "www.4-traders.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Global Copper Mining Category - Procurement Report 2017 - Construction Industry Consumes Around 25% - Research and Markets", "text": "The \"Global Copper Mining Category - Procurement Market Intelligence Report\" report has been added to Research and Markets' offering. \nThe construction industry consumes around 25% of the total copper produced annually for applications such as heat exchangers in buildings, sprinkler systems, seawater feed lines, cement pumps, and fuel gas distribution pipes.

The system has a robust design suitable for demanding environments and is the only one in its category to be configurable to all electrical system schemes with the benefits of power modularity. Protect Flex features a wide range of configurable options and a high level of scalability and flexibility.\n\nThe Protect Flex is designed to meet an increasing demand from industries to secure power supply with an equipment which has a compact footprint yet still offering a high level of reliability and resist to unprotected environment (humidity, corrosion, dust\u2026).\n\nAEG Power Solutions answers with a new concept of UPS systems that combines a modular architecture based on 10 and 15 kVA/kW, hot swappable power modules, transformer-less and IGBT based, with a customizable set of options and provides N+1 inbuilt power redundancy to maximize reliability.\n\nProtect Flex is a simplified, flexible and highly cost-effective UPS which can cope effectively with harsh environmental conditions, with an IP43 rating protection. The system is designed to maximize savings in terms of footprint and power installed (kVA). Its electrical and mechanical design, cabling and protection devices, are engineered to maximize security and simplify maintenance operations. High quality UPS, benefiting of the long engineering experience of AEG PS for rugged systems, Protect Flex achieves high reliability with optimum availability. Up time availability is maximised by a high-quality equipment and design with the Mean Time To repair (MTTR) minimized, thanks to its modular and hot-swappable architecture.\n\nThe scalable architecture of the UPS reduces CAPEX and optimizes OPEX costs. The power modules are based on the latest IGBT double conversion technology, with a low input THDi and input power factor close to one, even when a low percentage of load is applied. \n\n'Operations continuity is not an option in many industries or service businesses today, comments Alessandro Nalbone, product manager AEG Power Solutions. Whenever highly reliable power is needed, Protect Flex provides a compact, flexible and robust solution, minimizing costs and maximizing availability. It's the ideal combination for many applications such as operations in chemical and petrochemical industry, mining, or any other demanding environment, but also for transport critical applications like control and signaling'.

A clinical performance with the ball has ensured that Stirling and Dockrell's fine knocks have not gone in vain. Ireland have levelled the series 1-1 with a 51-run victory. \nMcCarthy bags five: \nJamal's struggle comes to an end as he strikes a McCarthy delivery to Porterfield at short cover to depart for 25 off 47. Shafiqullah follows the very next delivery, bowled. On a hat-trick, Dawlat negotiates the hat-trick delivery but McCarthy manages to trap him in front soon after to bag his maiden five-wicket haul. \nNaib departs: \nAnother wicket goes down as Chase bags his second. Naib departs after failing to keep down a pull, leaving Afghanistan in more trouble. They are 190 for 6 after 40, needing to score at 8.2 an over to reach the target. \nNabi departs after half-century stand: \nMohammad Nabi and Nasair Jamal bring up a half-century stand to keep Afghanistan in the hunt. While Nabi has batted positively, Jamal has not been brisk, scoring a strike rate of just over 50. However, Afghanistan are in a spot of bother as Nabi departs, chopping on a Chase delivery. They are 182 for 5 in the 38th over. \nA wicket for Dockrell and one for Murtagh: \nAnother set batsman departs. This time is Rahmat, who's out stumped off Dockrell for 32 off 43. Stanikzai falls a short while later, finding Wilson at deep square leg. Afghanistan are 130 for 4 in the 29th over. \nAhmadi falls short of fifty: \nThe short ball does the trick for McCarthy as Ahmadi pulls it straight to Dockrell at deep backward square leg to depart for 48. Afghanistan are 97/2 in the 22nd over. \nFifty-run stand: \nAhmadi and Rahmat bring up the half-century stand in the 21st over. Nothing too flash from the second wicket pair as Afghanistan move to 96 for 1. \nSteady partnership: \nAhmadi has entered the 40s and has received support from Rahmat Shah as they extend their partnership past 30. Afghanistan are 77 for 1 after 17 overs. \nMcCarthy ends opening stand: \nEnd of the opening stand, worth 46 runs. Looking to drive on the up, Ihsanullah is bowled as the ball sneaks through the gap between bat and pad. \nWatchful approach: \nAt the end of the first 10 overs, Ihsanullah and Javed Ahmadi have managed five fours and a six between them and have been mostly watchful. Afghanistan are 40 for 0. \nAfghanistan get a move on after slow start: \nHaving managed 13 off the first four overs, openers Ihsanullah and Javed Ahmadi manage a six and a four respectively to help Afghanistan to 25 for 0 after 6 overs. \nDockrell lifts Ireland to 271: \nWith a four in the final over off Nabi, Dockrell went past 50 and also managed a mighty six over long-on to help Ireland finish positively. They end up with 271 for 9, all thanks to Dockrell fine unbeaten 62 off 48. Can Afghanistan match up to their opposition's efforts with the bat? \nIreland cross 250: \nRegular boundaries from Dockrell has helped Ireland past the 250 mark in the 48th over. \nEnd of the rearguard action: \nThe seventh-wicket pair's rearguard action comes to an end in the 43rd over as Nabi strikes to send back Poynter. Ireland are 217 for 7. \nIreland cross 200: \nA boundary for George Dockrell off Rashid in the 40th over helps Ireland past the 200 mark. Can they cross 250? \nOne more wicket: \nKevin O'Brien becomes the sixth to depart, out leg-before to Dawlat Zadran as Ireland slip to 188 for 6 in the 37th over. \nAnd another: \nNiall O'Brien departs too, and it's spin at work again. This time it's Mujeeb who had the left-handed O'Brien out stumped to pick up his second wicket, with Ireland losing their fifth for only 45 runs. They slip to 160 for 5. \nRashid ends Stirling's outing: \nA wicket for Rashid Khan, finally. In his fifth over the legspinner bowls a googly which Stirling fails to read and is out leg-before for 82. Gary Wilson follows soon after, bowled after failing to pick another googly. Ireland slip to 160 for 4. \nRebuilding phase: \nNiall O'Brien and Stirling have done a good job to stem the rot. A steady partnership has helped Ireland past 150. \nAnother wicket: \nMujeeb strikes in the 23rd over to cut short Andy Balbirnie's stay, trapping him in front for 4. Ireland are 120 for 2. \nEnd of opening stand: \nWilliam Porterfield misses a half-century. Attempting to pull Naib, he top-edged the ball to Stanikzai at mid-on to depart for 47, ending the opening stand worth 115. Paul Stirling half-century helped Ireland make good progress after opting to bat \u00a9 Getty \nFifty for Stirling: \nStirling brings up a 51-ball fifty with a single off Nabi in the 16th over. Ireland reach 100 two overs later to continue the good work. The opening pair has managed to keep Rashid at bay in his opening over. Can they continue in the same vein? \nHalf-century stand: \nThe fifty partnership is up in the 11th over - Porterfield greets Dawlat with a boundary to bring up the milestone. He celebrates it with another boundary, his fourth so far. Ireland are scoring at a good rate. Will Rashid Khan be introduced soon to pull things back? \nStirling keeps Ireland going strong: \nTen overs gone and not a wicket lost so far. Stirling has played the aggressor's role, having managed four fours while the Ireland captain has decided to anchor. Ireland are 48 for 0. \nIreland off to good start: \nPaul Stirling scores a couple of boundaries off Mujeeb in the opening over to set the tone against the spinner. Porterfield managed one four off Dawlat Zadran in the second. Ireland are 13 for 2. \nToss and Teams: \nIreland captain William Porterfield won the toss and decided to bat. \nIreland (Playing XI): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, Andrew Balbirnie, Niall O'Brien(w), Barry McCarthy, Gary Wilson, Kevin O'Brien, Stuart Poynter, George Dockrell, Tim Murtagh, Peter Chase \nAfghanistan (Playing XI): Javed Ahmadi, Ihsanullah Janat, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Shafiqullah Shafiq(w), Gulbadin Naib, Asghar Stanikzai(c), Dawlat Zadran, Rahmat Shah, Nasir Jamal, Mujeeb Zadran \nBuild-up: Ireland hope to keep series alive \nHello and welcome to the Live Blog of the second ODI between Afghanistan and Ireland in Sharjah. Having clinched the ODI series against Ireland in Noida earlier this year, Afghanistan have extended their dominance over Ireland with a big win on Tuesday, and they will be eager to continue in the same vein and secure their second successive ODI series win against the European nation. \nIreland's weakness against spin, especially Rashid Khan , was evident during the series in Noida, where the legspinner bagged 16 wickets in five games at an average of 13.37. Two days back, before even Rashid was introduced into the attack, the experienced Ireland batting line-up had no answers to the guiles of Mujeeb Zadran , the 16-year-old offspinner, who bagged a four-wicket haul on debut. Rashid then continued his love affair with Ireland, picking up three wickets to fast-track their collapse. \nCan Ireland come up with an improved showing in the second ODI and keep the series alive? While you ponder over that, here's a look at the preview . \u00a9 Cricbuzz", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rashid khan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rashid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "william porterfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mujeeb zadran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u00a9 cricbuzz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharjah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noida", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:31.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6a35a763d64e18671f52d8e512faa8f8f015c9dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg999YYspK0ijSseSh6BN._34KxiWcXcSmVpJ04W3g.jSRr3Hywrx9VTUMVMy8dTx89NnAs8Q49rlbw9vqqhIhIIqiRtddgWrw70h9P4Dsrlh0DhJgs1bROM", "site_full": "www.poandpo.com", "site": "poandpo.com", "site_section": "http://poandpo.com/rss-articles/", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "POST Online Media", "title": "Global growth holds steady at two-and-a-half year high", "title_full": "Global growth holds steady at two-and-a-half year high", "published": "2017-12-07T05:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "HR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6a35a763d64e18671f52d8e512faa8f8f015c9dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg999YYspK0ijSseSh6BN._34KxiWcXcSmVpJ04W3g.jSRr3Hywrx9VTUMVMy8dTx89NnAs8Q49rlbw9vqqhIhIIqiRtddgWrw70h9P4Dsrlh0DhJgs1bROM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T05:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "Global growth holds steady at two-and-a-half year high", "text": "World J.P.Morgan Global Manufacturing & Services PMI Global growth holds steady at two-and-a-half year high Staff Writer | Thursday December 7, 2017 3:36AM ET November saw the rate of expansion in global economic output remain at its joint-highest over the past two-and-ahalf years.   READ MORE China's GDP expands 6.9 percent in first 3 quarters The outlook also remained positive, with new business intakes rising at the strongest pace since September 2014 and backlogs of work increasing to the greatest extent in four years. The J.P.Morgan Global All-Industry Output Index1,2 \u2013 which is produced by J.P.Morgan and IHS Markit in association with ISM and IFPSM \u2013 posted 54.0 in November, to remain above the neutral 50.0 mark for the sixty-second successive month. The rate of expansion was solid and slightly above its long-run average. November saw an upswing in the rate of increase in manufacturing production, which rose to the greatest extent since February 2011. Service sector business activity also rose at a solid clip, albeit the weakest in four months. Growth at service providers was again led by the financial and business categories, while increases in manufacturing output were strongest in the intermediate and investment goods sectors. The consumer category was the weakest performer in both the services and manufacturing industries. National PMI data indicated that the euro area remained a prime growth engine for the global economy in November. Output across the eurozone expanded at the quickest pace in over six-and-a-half years, with accelerations seen across each of the currency union\u2019s \u2018big-four\u2019 economies (Germany, France, Italy and Spain). Rates of expansion also improved in China, Russia and Australia, but slowed in the US, Japan, the UK and India. Brazil was the only major nation to signal a contraction in economic activity, as ongoing weakness in services more than offset a strong growth acceleration at manufacturers. Inflows of new business rose at the fastest pace in over three years in the world economy. The solid trend in new orders tested capacity and contributed to further accumulation of backlogs of work. This encouraged job creation, with the rate of expansion equalling October\u2019s near six-and-a-half-year high. \u25a0 What to read next", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "world j.p.morgan global manufacturing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ihs markit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:31.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "08b25a282290184f0ed6f7d02bc3b9184b78d608", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/FYJ2xGwtw8Gb5j5iASnHthQFDbW2EsdmMolF3Z0gDunv_Pw8j9dKPBTC_E_t7tRemrwQNSUNIJrbxdDp7HRexgA7dCXSxME40XJqqZtrJXI-", "site_full": "youtubeinvi.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://youtubeinvi.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Youtube invi", "title": "Waching daily Dec 7 2017", "title_full": "Waching daily Dec 7 2017", "published": "2017-12-07T12:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "08b25a282290184f0ed6f7d02bc3b9184b78d608", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/FYJ2xGwtw8Gb5j5iASnHthQFDbW2EsdmMolF3Z0gDunv_Pw8j9dKPBTC_E_t7tRemrwQNSUNIJrbxdDp7HRexgA7dCXSxME40XJqqZtrJXI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Duong Anh (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "Waching daily Dec 7 2017", "text": "Today Bangla Breaking News Update, Bangla News update,\nbangla news, Bangla tv News, Bangla News today, Today Bangla News\nFor more infomation >> \u09af\u09ae\u09c1\u09a8\u09be \u09b8\u0982\u09ac\u09be\u09a6 Jamuna News 7 December 2017 Bangla News Toady Latest Bangla News - Shadhin 24 - Duration: 29:36. \nLatest News: Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez not talking marriages - Duration: 2:33.

Each Member State in which an application has been submitted in accordance with paragraph 1 shall adopt a decision in conformity with the approved assessment report, the summary of product characteristics and the labelling and package leaflet as approved, within 30 days after acknowledgement of the agreement.\u2019 7 Article 29(1) of Directive 2001/83 states as follows: \u2018If, within the period laid down in Article 28(4), a Member State cannot approve the assessment report, the summary of product characteristics, the labelling and the package leaflet on the grounds of serious potential risk to public health, it shall give a detailed exposition of the reasons for its position to the reference Member State, to the other Member States concerned and to the applicant. The points of disagreement shall be forthwith referred to the coordination group.\u2019 The SPC Regulation Recitals 4, 5, 8 and 10 of the SPC regulation read as follows: \u2018(4) At the moment, the period that elapses between the filing of an application for a patent for a new medicinal product and authorisation to place the medicinal product on the market makes the period of effective protection under the patent insufficient to cover the investment put into the research. (5) This situation leads to a lack of protection which penalises pharmaceutical research. \u2026 (8) Therefore, the provision of a supplementary protection certificate granted, under the same conditions, by each of the Member States at the request of the holder of a national or European patent relating to a medicinal product for which marketing authorisation has been granted is necessary. A regulation is therefore the most appropriate legal instrument. \u2026 (10) All the interests at stake, including those of public health, in a sector as complex and sensitive as the pharmaceutical sector should nevertheless be taken into account. For this purpose, the certificate cannot be granted for a period exceeding five years. The protection granted should furthermore be strictly confined to the product which obtained authorisation to be placed on the market as a medicinal product.\u2019 9 Article 1 of the SPC Regulation, headed \u2018Definitions\u2019, provides as follows: \u2018For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply: (a) \u201cmedicinal product\u201d means any substance or combination of substances presented for treating or preventing disease in human beings \u2026; (b) \u201cproduct\u201d means the active ingredient or combination of active ingredients of a medicinal product; (c) \u201cbasic patent\u201d means a patent which protects a product as such, a process to obtain a product or an application of a product, and which is designated by its holder for the purpose of the procedure for grant of a certificate; (d) \u201ccertificate\u201d means the supplementary protection certificate; \u2026\u2019 10 Article 3 of the SPC Regulation, entitled \u2018Conditions for obtaining a certificate\u2019, is worded as follows: \u2018A certificate shall be granted if, in the Member State in which the application referred to in Article 7 is submitted and at the date of that application: (a) the product is protected by a basic patent in force; (b) a valid authorisation to place the product on the market as a medicinal product has been granted in accordance with [Directive 2001/83] \u2026; (c) the product has not already been the subject of a certificate; (d) the authorisation referred to in (b) is the first authorisation to place the product on the market as a medicinal product.\u2019 11 Article 7 of the SPC Regulation, headed \u2018Application for a certificate\u2019, states as follows: \u20181. The application for a certificate shall be lodged within six months of the date on which the authorisation referred to in Article 3(b) to place the product on the market as a medicinal product was granted. \u2026 3. The application for an extension of the duration may be made when lodging the application for a certificate or when the application for the certificate is pending and the appropriate requirements of Article 8(1)(d) or Article 8(2), respectively, are fulfilled. 4. The application for an extension of the duration of a certificate already granted shall be lodged not later than two years before the expiry of the certificate. 5 . Notwithstanding paragraph 4, for five years following the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 [of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on medicinal products for paediatric use and amending Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92, Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, ( OJ 2006 L 378, p. 1 )] the application for an extension of the duration of a certificate already granted shall be lodged not later than six months before the expiry of the certificate.\u2019 12 Article 8 of the SPC Regulation provides as follows: \u20181. The application for a certificate shall contain: (a) a request for the grant of a certificate, stating in particular: \u2026 (iv) the number and date of the first authorisation to place the product on the market, as referred to in Article 3(b) and, if this authorisation is not the first authorisation for placing the product on the market in the Community, the number and date of that authorisation; (b) a copy of the authorisation to place the product on the market, as referred to in Article 3(b), in which the product is identified, containing in particular the number and date of the authorisation and the summary of the product characteristics listed in Article 11 of Directive [2001/83] \u2026; (c) if the authorisation referred to in (b) is not the first authorisation for placing the product on the market as a medicinal product in the Community, information regarding the identity of the product thus authorised and the legal provision under which the authorisation procedure took place, together with a copy of the notice publishing the authorisation in the appropriate official publication; \u2026\u2019 13 According to Article 9(1) of the SPC Regulation: \u2018The application for a certificate shall be lodged with the competent industrial property office of the Member State which granted the basic patent or on whose behalf it was granted and in which the authorisation referred to in Article 3(b) to place the product on the market was obtained, unless the Member State designates another authority for the purpose. The application for an extension of the duration of a certificate shall be lodged with the competent authority of the Member State concerned.\u2019 14 Article 10 of that regulation provides as follows: \u2018\u2026 2. The authority referred to in Article 9(1) shall, subject to paragraph 3, reject the application for a certificate if the application or the product to which it relates does not meet the conditions laid down in this Regulation. 3. Where the application for a certificate does not meet the conditions laid down in Article 8, the authority referred to in Article 9(1) shall ask the applicant to rectify the irregularity, or to settle the fee, within a stated time. 4. If the irregularity is not rectified or the fee is not settled under paragraph 3 within the stated time, the authority shall reject the application. \u2026\u2019 15 Article 13 of the SPC Regulation, headed \u2018Duration of the certificate\u2019, is worded in paragraph 1 thereof as follows: \u2018The certificate shall take effect at the end of the lawful term of the basic patent for a period equal to the period which elapsed between the date on which the application for a basic patent was lodged and the date of the first authorisation to place the product on the market in the Community, reduced by a period of five years.\u2019 United Kingdom law 16 In the United Kingdom, the Human Medicines Regulation 2012, which transposed Directive 2001/83, governs the grant of marketing authorisations by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. The dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling 17 MSD, a company incorporated in New Jersey (United States), is part of a group of pharmaceutical companies whose ultimate parent company is Merck & Co. Incorporated. 18 Merck & Co. Incorporated was the holder of European Patent (UK) No EP 0 720599, for which an application was filed on 14 September 1994, with an earliest priority date of 21 September 1993, and which was granted on 19 May 1999. The patent covered the active ingredient ezetimibe and combinations of ezetimibe with other active ingredients. 19 In September 2006 MSD, began development of a fixed dose combination of two active ingredients in tablet form. As it encountered problems in establishing a satisfactory formulation, this work continued until 2013. 20 In September 2013, MSD submitted applications based on an identical dossier in a number of Member States, under the decentralised procedure laid down in Article 28 of Directive 2001/83, with a view to being granted a marketing authorisation in each of those Member States and requested the Federal Republic of Germany to act as the reference Member State for the medicinal product Atozet, a medicinal product for adults intended to reduce the overall level of cholesterol. 21 As is apparent from the file submitted to the Court, the validity of those applications was acknowledged only on 13 February 2014. 22 On 10 September 2014, that is 209 days after the valid marketing authorisation applications had been submitted and, therefore, within the period laid down in Article 17 of Directive 2001/83, the Bundesinstitut f\u00fcr Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte (the German Medicinal Products Agency) issued an end of procedure notice, in accordance with Article 28(4) of the directive. 23 On 12 September 2014, the first marketing authorisation for Atozet in the European Union was granted by the competent French national authority. 24 On the same day, MSD filed an application for a supplementary protection certificate (\u2018SPC\u2019) with the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office (\u2018the UKIPO\u2019), on the basis of the patent referred to in paragraph 18 above. 25 That application related to the two active ingredients of which Atozet is composed, namely ezetimibe and atorvastatin, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. 26 With the SPC application in the United Kingdom, MSD provided a copy of the end of procedure notice issued on 10 September 2014 by the German Medicinal Products Agency. In the letter accompanying that application, MSD contended that the effect of the notice was that all Member States concerned, including the United Kingdom, had agreed to grant marketing authorisations for Atozet and requested that it be permitted to supplement the SPC application when the UK marketing authorisation was granted. 27 On 13 September 2014, MSD\u2019s patent referred to in paragraph 18 above expired. 28 On 17 September 2014, the UKIPO\u2019s examiner wrote to MSD raising an objection to the SPC application in the United Kingdom, on the ground, inter alia, that the application did not comply with the requirements laid down in Article 3(b) of the SPC Regulation since MSD did not hold a valid UK marketing authorisation. 29 On 10 October 2014, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency granted a marketing authorisation for Atozet in the United Kingdom to MSD\u2019s UK subsidiary, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd. 30 On 17 November 2014, MSD sent a letter to the UKIPO, enclosing a copy of the UK marketing authorisation, together with the authorisation granted in France on 12 September 2014. In that letter, MSD requested that those documents be taken into account to rectify any irregularities which might invalidate the SCP application in the United Kingdom. 31 The UKIPO\u2019s examiner declined to comply with that request on the ground that, where no marketing authorisation has been granted, that does not constitute an irregularity that may be rectified for the purposes of Article 10(3) of the SPC Regulation. Following a hearing on 3 September 2015, the examiner\u2019s position was confirmed on behalf of the Comptroller by the UKIPO\u2019s hearing officer. 32 MSD brought an action against the Comptroller\u2019s decision before the referring court, the High Court of Justice (England and Wales), Chancery Division, Patents Court. 33 According to that court, the Comptroller\u2019s decision is correct. It considers that the granting of a marketing authorisation following the issue of an end of procedure notice is not a mere administrative formality. Thus, that notice is not equivalent to a marketing authorisation within the meaning of Article 3(b) of the SPC Regulation. 34 Moreover, the referring court is of the view that the irregularity invalidating MSD\u2019s SPC application in the United Kingdom cannot be rectified under Article 10(3) of the SPC Regulation. 35 The referring court observes, nonetheless, that the SPC applications submitted by MSD in Portugal and Sweden were rejected on the same ground as that on which the SPC application filed in the United Kingdom was refused. On the other hand, such applications were granted in Denmark, Greece, Italy and Luxembourg. In the Netherlands, the only ground for refusal was non-compliance with Article 3(c) of the SPC Regulation, which requires that, at the date of the SPC application, the product has not already been the subject of a certificate in the Member State in which the application is submitted. 36 In those circumstances, the High Court of Justice (England and Wales), Chancery Division, Patents Court, decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling: \u2018(1) Is an end of procedure notice issued by the reference Member State under Article 28(4) of Directive [2001/83] before expiry of the basic patent to be treated as equivalent to a granted marketing authorisation for the purpose of Article 3(b) of [the SPC Regulation], such that an applicant for [an SPC] in the Member State in question is entitled to apply for and be granted [an SPC] on the basis of the end of procedure notice? (2) If the answer to question 1 is no: in the circumstances in question, is the absence of a granted marketing authorisation in the Member State in question at the date of the application for [an SPC] in that Member State an irregularity that can be cured under Article 10(3) of [the SPC Regulation] once the marketing authorisation has been granted? Consideration of the questions referred The first question 37 By its first question, the referring court seeks to ascertain, in essence, whether Article 3(b) of the SPC Regulation is to be interpreted as meaning that an end of procedure notice issued by the reference Member State in accordance with Article 28(4) of Directive 2001/83 before the expiry of the basic patent, as defined in Article 1(c) of the SPC Regulation, may be treated as equivalent to a marketing authorisation within the meaning of Article 3(b) of that regulation, with the result that an SPC may be obtained on the basis of such a notice. 38 It should be observed at the outset that Article 3(b) of the SPC Regulation requires, in order for an SPC to be granted for a product as a medicinal product, a valid marketing authorisation to have been obtained in accordance with Directive 2001/83. 39 It should be noted in that regard that, on any natural reading, the word \u2018granted\u2019 in Article 3(b) of the SPC Regulation can only refer to an action that has already been completed. 40 Moreover, with regard to the context of that provision, it is clear that the legislature established a connection between the SPC Regulation and Directive 2001/83 by linking the grant of an SPC to the grant of a marketing authorisation under the directive. 41 It follows that, for the purposes of Article 3(b) of the SPC Regulation, a \u2018valid authorisation to place [a] product on the market\u2019 must be in the form of a document which meets the requirements laid down by Directive 2001/83 under the decentralised procedure, which is based on the principle of mutual recognition and is applicable where the medicinal product in question has not yet been the subject of a marketing authorisation in a Member State, as was the case in the main proceedings. 42 The decentralised procedure provided for in Article 28 of Directive 2001/83 entails a number of stages, commencing with the submission by the applicant of an application for marketing authorisation in all the Member States concerned and of an application to one Member State to act as the reference Member State. Article 28(4) of the directive provides that the reference Member State is to record the agreement of all parties, close the procedure and inform the applicant accordingly. Under Article 28(5) of the directive, each Member State is to adopt a decision authorising the marketing of the product concerned, in conformity with the approved assessment report and the related documents, within 30 days of acknowledgement of the agreement of all the parties. 43 It follows that the adoption of the end of procedure notice under Article 28(4) of Directive 2001/83 represents an intermediate stage in the decentralised procedure and that the notice does not have the same legal effects as a \u2018valid\u2019 marketing authorisation, since such a notice does not authorise the applicant to place the medicinal product on a particular market. 44 In that regard, while, at the hearing before the Court, MSD pleaded in aid the fact that some of the functions of a marketing authorisation \u2014 in particular, the functions of providing a guarantee that the product is safe, identifying the product to which the SPC relates and calculating the duration of the SPC \u2014 may be fulfilled by the end of procedure notice, it nonetheless acknowledged that such a notice does not allow what is in fact the essential feature of a marketing authorisation, namely the placing on the market of the medicinal product at issue in the main proceedings. 45 It is also apparent from the Court\u2019s case-law that, unless it has been granted a marketing authorisation as a medicinal product, a patented product may not give rise to the grant of an SPC (judgment of 15 January 2015, Forsgren, C\u2011631/13 , EU:C:2015:13 , paragraph 34 ). 46 In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question is that Article 3(b) of the SPC Regulation is to be interpreted as meaning that an end of procedure notice issued by the reference Member State in accordance with Article 28(4) of Directive 2001/83 before the expiry of the basic patent, as defined in Article 1(c) of the SPC Regulation, may not be treated as equivalent to a marketing authorisation within the meaning of Article 3(b) of that regulation, with the result that an SPC may not be obtained on the basis of such a notice. The second question 47 By its second question, the referring court asks whether Article 10(3) of the SPC Regulation is to be interpreted as meaning that the fact that no marketing authorisation has been granted by the Member State concerned at the time the SPC application is lodged in that Member State constitutes an irregularity that can be cured under that provision. 48 Article 3(b) of the SPC Regulation, which sets out the \u2018conditions for obtaining\u2019 an SPC, provides that an SPC certificate is to be granted if, in the Member State in which the application referred to in Article 7 of the regulation is submitted and at the date of that application, a valid authorisation to place the product on the market as a medicinal product has been granted in accordance with Directive 2001/83. 49 It is clear from the wording of that provision, in particular the phrase \u2018if \u2026 a valid authorisation to place the product on the market as a medicinal product has been granted\u2019, that one of the conditions which the product must satisfy is that a marketing authorisation has been granted in the Member State concerned. 50 It follows that, under Article 10(2) of the SPC Regulation, the authority referred to in Article 9(1) of the regulation must reject the SPC application if the application or the product to which it relates does not meet the conditions laid down by the regulation. 51 Article 10(3) of the SPC Regulation states that, where the SPC application does not meet the conditions laid down in Article 8 thereof, the authority referred to in Article 9(1) of the regulation is to ask the applicant to rectify the irregularity. 52 Thus, it is clear from the wording itself of Article 10(3) of the SPC Regulation, in particular the phrase \u2018if the [SPC] application does not meet the conditions\u2019, that only an irregularity affecting the SPC application can be rectified under that provision. 53 It follows that the absence of a marketing authorisation does not constitute an irregularity which the applicant can rectify ex post under Article 10(3) of the SPC Regulation, since it constitutes an irregularity in connection with the product, as a medicinal product, not an irregularity in connection with the SPC application. Moreover, with regard to the marketing authorisation, the conditions laid down by Article 8 of the SPC Regulation, which are referred to in Article 10(3) thereof, relate not to the actual existence of the marketing authorisation \u2014 which is a requirement under Article 3(b) of the regulation \u2014 but simply to various items of information and documents to be produced in order to prove that the marketing authorisation exists and to identify that authorisation when the SPC application is lodged. 54 In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the second question is that Article 10(3) of the SPC Regulation is to be interpreted as meaning that the fact no marketing authorisation has been granted by the Member State concerned at the time the SPC application is lodged in that Member State does not constitute an irregularity that can be cured under that provision. Costs 55 Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Seventh Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 3(b) of Regulation (EC) No 469/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 concerning the supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products is to be interpreted as meaning that an end of procedure notice issued by the reference Member State in accordance with Article 28(4) of Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use, as amended, as regards pharmacovigilance, by Directive 2010/84/EU of the European Parliament and the Council of 15 December 2010, before the expiry of the basic patent, as defined in Article 1(c) of Regulation No 469/2009, may not be treated as equivalent to a marketing authorisation within the meaning of Article 3(b) of that regulation, with the result that a supplementary protection certificate may not be obtained on the basis of such a notice. 2. Article 10(3) of Regulation No 469/2009 is to be interpreted as meaning that the fact that no marketing authorisation has been granted by the Member State concerned at the time the supplementary protection certificate application is lodged in that Member State does not constitute an irregularity that can be cured under that provision.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "m. ferreira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "t. hinchliffe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "a. sipos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. vl\u00e1\u010dil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "c. toader", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s. bennett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toader", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forsgren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "a. prechal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "e. jara\u0161i\u016bnas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "h. saugmandsgaard \u00f8e", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "m. smolek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l. whiting", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. samnadda", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "merck sharp & dohme corporation", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "scp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicinal products agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthcare products regulatory agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tfeu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "k. bacon qc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recitals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merck sharp & dohme ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patents court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merck & co", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "court of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "msd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom intellectual property office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukipo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "high court of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "member state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chancery division", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "german medicinal products agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merck sharp & dohme corporation comptroller general of patents", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "federal republic of germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukipo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portugal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new jersey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "member states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luxembourg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denmark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:32.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4a040979e82f64410b9e83d35d5911f8ec214fde", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8xMR_zqDhVU24R8Gr303y2eFJY60f.Y2pzTKaD85UY9ceUmWsX0Ytt1gnIYEYHPi5saXbLfWVYrN0OZml.bwpz4cjA1hW0j5dHGOn3b7V6b.liehiDemx2Nbk_FYLpSFV9Kcn8WoZoT5hRi_yi4a7Gtm6hYdklNwQ-", "site_full": "www.juxtapost.com", "site": "juxtapost.com", "site_section": "http://www.juxtapost.com/feed/id/global", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Juxtapost -

In the presence of the President of the French Republic, Mr. Emmanuel Macron, and his Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the Qatar Armed Forces and Dassault Aviation signed an agreement on future cooperation and the exercise of an option for 12 Rafale. \nThis new order follows on from the contract signed on 4 May 2015 between the State of Qatar and Dassault Aviation for the acquisition of 24 Rafale, thus raising the number of Rafale aircraft operated by the Qatar Emiri Air Force to 36. \nDassault Aviation and its partners thank the Qatari Authorities for having given them the opportunity to enhance their collaboration by restating their confidence in the qualities of the Rafale and expressing their satisfaction with the performance of the main contract. \n'This new agreement is built around the special relationship that exists between the two countries and the shared determination, by the Defense Ministry of Qatar and Dassault Aviation, to move forwards together', declared Eric Trappier, Chairman and CEO of Dassault Aviation. \nWith over 10,000 military and civil aircraft delivered in more than 90 countries over the last century, Dassault Aviation has built up expertise recognized worldwide in the design, development, sale and support of all types of aircraft, ranging from the Rafale fighter, to the high-end Falcon family of business jets and military drones. In 2016, Dassault Aviation reported revenues of \u20ac3.6 billion. The company has 12,000 employees. \nwww.dassault-aviation.com \nTwitter: @Dassault_OnAir \nDassault Aviation SA published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 10:01:09 UTC . \nOriginal document https://www.dassault-aviation.com/en/group/press/press-kits/qatar-acquires-additional-12-rafale \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/422B0CB21A9B65C4DDBA62C6B694D05F17B8F466", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "emmanuel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eric trappier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tamim bin hamad al thani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macron", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dassault aviation", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "qatar emiri air force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dassault aviation sa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qatar armed forces", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defense ministry of qatar", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "french republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qatar", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:33.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ba30c5733d546e15cc815a4afcf51446d362760c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Xs9dwluKAcmvrqW3hxvQiPsi0iUV8uKdKbuVBMlXRyeej9z0QQqTvEtkQhJFcg4rlkn0gzotM3Q--", "site_full": "www.greekchat.com", "site": "greekchat.com", "site_section": "http://www.greekchat.com/gcforums/forumdisplay.php?f=221", "site_categories": ["tennis", "sports"], "section_title": "Introductions -

Our opportunity is either to sit on the sidelines and watch how it happens, and not influence the outcome or put ourselves at the negotiating table.\"\nBarickman says that way he can try and shape how a legal, recreational marijuana program will work. And he can shape how the hundreds of millions of dollars that Illinois could see in new taxes is spent.\n\"I would like to see these revenues pay down our backlog of bills, our debt, our pension liabilities,\" Barickman said. \"I'd like to see us move our income tax rates.\"\nIndustry experts say legal, recreational marijuana in Illinois could be worth as much as $700 million a year.\nBarickman said he's ready to vote yes for legal marijuana, but not to co-sponsor the plan. He expects other Republicans to also endorse marijuana, and he hopes Gov. Bruce Rauner changes his mind.\nBarickman said marijuana supporters are modifying the existing legalization legislation. He hopes to see a new plan in February of 2018.\nLawmakers could vote next year, but many speculate that a vote won't occur until after the November 2018 gubernatorial election.\n Downstate Republican senator: Illinois should legalize marijuana | State Politics | ilnews.org\nAuthor: Benjamin Yount\nContact: About ILNews.org | Site | ilnews.org\nPhoto Credit: Shutterstock\nWebsite: ilnews.org | Illinois News Network", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ilnews.org/site/about.html", "https://www.ilnews.org/", "https://www.ilnews.org/news/state_politics/downstate-republican-senator-illinois-should-legalize-marijuana/article_9f4b5fc6-d9ea-11e7-bfed-0b3b007cea6e.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:34.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "247a918cb7c10ca4914dbd4548022750de96c66d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvv3tJIf3FToi5QBqInveQKyrV2Bhkz0utndDLCA263x5zg_inXoU0.h585K5b7eoJkGIr7Y6_PglFSoJ74rdM8mxkbEySQSGESKwuPR3nPECAPvT9zdXtfVqgJwiRR4iZtD68IXLb_OfAyucOHvIW9ux6ojxPYXgOpPDR78GBcqcfFSiIR1r2X2OyERA1yJq1QoeruUhT7KqwRfDHADL9.WwKALjnrSvSnR5A5pGFQrdRi1qzTQrrCEA--", "site_full": "www.4-traders.com", "site": "4-traders.com", "site_section": "http://www.4-traders.com/rss/FeedNews.php", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Stock market news - Company News  - 4-Traders.com", "title": "All for One Steeb : Figures for Financial Year 2016/17 Confirmed.

Digital transformation has reached the DNA of the German economy and with it All for One Steeb AG's customers. The transformation is sweeping across all business lines, units and departments. With its integrated business model, the All for One Steeb Group is unifying all aspects of the digital agenda - strategic, technological, procedural and cultural - under its corporate umbrella and posted strong gains in all types of revenue. The recurring revenues from outsourcing and cloud services (including software maintenance) improved 11% to EUR 130.5 million (2015/16: EUR 117.7 million) and account for a 43% share (2015/16: 44%) of total sales. Ahead of what is expected to be many years of generational change from the SAP Business Suite to SAP S/4HANA as the digital core, revenues from the sale of SAP licenses increased 18% to EUR 38.8 million (2015/16: EUR 32.8 million) and set another new record. Consulting revenues gained 13% to EUR 124.8 million (2015/16: EUR 110.9 million).\n\n\u00bbSolutions and services from the cloud are becoming increasingly important as businesses embark on their transformation journey. We welcomed more than 50 new customers to our managed cloud services alone in the financial year 2016/17 and want to move up and become the leading provider of cloud services for the many specialised departments and activities in the midmarket segment, such as human resources and sales and marketing. Therefore, and in addition to concentrating on the SAP S/4HANA business, we are also investing in the enlargement of our lines of business portfolio\u00ab, said All for One Steeb AG CFO Stefan Land.\n\nDespite the major investments in expanding key growth segments, All for One Steeb improved its 2016/17 EBIT by 6% to EUR 20.1 million (2015/16: EUR 18.8 million), thus resulting in an EBIT margin of 6.7% (2015/16: 7.1%). The EBT increased to EUR 19.4 million, for a gain of 11% over the prior year (2015/16: EUR 17.4 million). Group earnings rose 6% to EUR 13.1 million (2015/16: EUR 12.3 million). The equity ratio improved to 41% (30 Sep 2016: 39%) while the number of employees rose by 13% to 1,476 (30 Sep 2016: 1,302).\n\nAll for One Steeb AG wants to continue to progress as planned in the future and generate revenues within a range of EUR 315 million to 325 million and an EBIT of between EUR 20.5 million and 22.0 million in the financial year 2017/18.\n\nBecause of these good results, the management board and the supervisory board have decided to further increase the distribution to shareholders and recommend to the annual general meeting scheduled for 15 March 2018 that a dividend be paid in the amount of EUR 1.20 (2015/16: EUR 1.10) per share entitled to dividends.\n\nAll for One Steeb AG will be publishing its full annual report as scheduled during its financial results press conference on 13 December 2017. \nZur\u00fcck \nAll for One Steeb.
