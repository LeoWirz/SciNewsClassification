The Karnataka captain rocked Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy quarter-final in Nagpur on Thursday. His hat-trick spanned over two overs. It began off the final ball of the first over and finished in the third over. The three players dismissed were Prithvi Shaw, Jay Bista and Akash Parkar. \nFirst over, sixth delivery: Shaw was on strike for the final ball of the first over. The shot one which no opening batsman would be proud of. It is delivery that just moved away from Shaw, who is rooted to his crease. After pitching at around short-of-good-length area, it moves towards the off-side a little and Shaw, without any movement of his feet, tries to punch it through the cover region, only to get a thick edge and find Karun Nair at first slip. \nThird over, first delivery: In a replay of the Shaw dismissal, Bista is also dismissed by getting an outside edge. A similar delivery which pitch at the same area and Bista made the same mistake as Shaw. He tries to reach to the ball with his feet not moving and when his bat made contact with the ball, his feet are in air. A thin edge which flies between the wicketkeeper and first slip. When keeper CM Gautam does not go for the catch, Nair stuck his left hand out and ball sticks to it. \nThird over, second delivery: Akash Parkar, the fast bowler, isn\u2019t a regular number four batsman. He has been sent ahead of the batsman and he will be facing the hat-trick delivery. Vinay steams in and this not a short pitched delivery. He comes in and bowls a full delivery which is shaping away from the right-hander. Akash moves forward to play the outswinger but the ball moves back into him after pitching. Seam movement for Vinay. Akash is struck on the pads and it looks plumb.

WHO THE \u2018HACK\u2019 IS Riaak de Baai?\nOh no, if so, then only God can really save South Sudan! \n***\nBy: Riaak de Baai\nIn an effort to cling into power in South Sudan, President Kiir is using his intelligent Chief, Akol Koor Kuch to manufacture and mastermind conflict among communities in the country.\n This is in the form of arming communities against themselves using state resources. For example, the leadership has long been using Murle to destabilise neighbouring states and across international boundary in Ethiopia, in an event it wants to shift attention from local politics to regional issues. On more than one occasion recently, arms intended for Murle youth were confiscated in Juba following a deal by David Yau Yau, Akol Koor, Akot Lual and Tor Deng Mawein, Presidential Adviser on Decentralization (of crisis). \nOther similar projects of locking communities against each other include; Luo vs Dinka (Western Bahr-el-Ghazal state), Chollo Community vs Dinka Ngok (Upper Nile State), Aguok vs Apuk (Warrap state), Athoi vs Nyang (Lakes State), Madi vs Acholi (Eastern Equatoria state), Bari vs Mundari (Central Equatoria state), Mundari vs Dinka Bor (Jonglei state) and Dinka Aliab (Lakes state) among others.\nSecondly, he recruits illiterate personnel into National Security service to intimidate, harass, detain, torture or even kill members of the public on unfounded accusations. He marginalizes the educated/professional members of the National Security service. For example, in order to get rid of Gen. Riny Tueny Mabior in the National Security system, they blindfolded him by appointing him as the Eastern Lakes state governor only to be relieved few months later. This is to advance dictatorial principles on the public using the unprofessional ones.\nThe reasons for locking communities against each other (themselves) are the following;\n1. President Kiir has no strategy/strategies in place to fix the economy. As a result, he is using violence as a scapegoat for failing to fix the economy.\n2. President Kiir has increasingly become unpopular. So without violence, peace would reign and elections would be organized. And because he is unpopular, he would lose elections if he intimidates the SPLM hierarchy to contest as the flag bearer. Therefore, he is engaging communities against themselves violently so that there is no peace and violence reigns \u2013 a good excuse for not conducting elections.\n3. The accusations that Former Chief of General Staff, Paul Malong was against Agreement on the Resolution of Conflict in South Sudan (ARCISS) are not true. In fact, President Kiir Security Chief, Akol Koor is against the agreement itself. He recently plotted for the assassination of the First Vice President, Taban Deng Gai using National Security men to ambush his convoy while on a peace mission to Jonglei State. More than twenty of his guards were killed and the attackers were disguised as Mundari armed youth. The intention was to kill the vice President so that what happened in J1 in July 2016 between President Kiir guards and Riek Machar guards could repeat itself so that public attention is shifted towards new crisis instead of deteriorating economy.  \n4. The recent relief of the former Chief of Staff, Gen. Paul Malong is to manufacture violence in peaceful areas of greater Bahr-el-Ghazal. The appointed Chief of staff, James Ajongo Mawut hails from the same Northern Bar-el-Ghazal state as Malong. So he would counter Malong using divide and rule policy and bring instability to the peaceful state. Secondly, in case Malong loyalists, Mathiang Anyoor resist the change, Ajongo would use state resources to demolish them and kill Malong influence in Northern Barh-el-Ghazal and the country as a whole because Kiir sees him as a threat to his throne. Thirdly, the reinstatement of the former SPLA-IO General, Dau Aturjong who rebelled because of Malong, into active SPLA list is to reinforce Kiir influence alongside unpopular Ajongo in Northern Barh-el-Ghazal. Dau Aturjong is expected to replace Gen. Santino Deng Wuol of Division 1 located in Northern Bahr-el-Ghazal who is Malong loyalist.\n5. The on-going peace initiative by a committee headed by vice president, Taban Deng Gai, between Dinka Bor and Murle is a waste of time. The reality is that, Taban is honest himself in bringing about lasting peace among these communities. The plan of Akol Koor is however different from the current peace processes. He influenced president Kiir to Dismiss Malong and Appoint Ajongo so that they would arm Murle youth and Mundari youth to destabilise Jonglei state. Akol Koor doesn\u2019t want Taban Deng to be credited for bringing peace to this troubled region. They are only using Taban to pause the ongoing skirmishing between Bor youth and Murle youth so that it gives time to mobilize, organize and arm both Murle and Mundari youth by the New Chief of Staff, Ajongo Mawut. Alternatively, David Yau Yau would even be asked to rebel in order to command the youth and destabilize the region in the name of a New rebellion to engage the SPLA once again. For the meantime, phase 1 of the project is targeting Dinka Bor using two fronts of Mundari and Murle, Phase 2 is Dinka Aliab (using Mundari) and phase 3 is Lou Nuer (using Murle). It\u2019s designed in a way that phase 1 would take about a year and phase 2 and 3 would commence simultaneously after a year.\n6. The closure of all highways leading into and out of the state capital, Juba is not SPLA-IO tactic. In fact, it\u2019s a tactical plan by Akol Koor using National Security agents to create insecurity on the highways. Following the weakening of the rebels in major fronts in greater Equatoria and greater Upper Nile, President Kiir has no any other excuse for instability in most parts of the country which his forces control, so Akol Koor manufacture these highway butchering, including the recent one along Bor-Juba road in which more than 40 innocent civilians were killed as a cover for all the mischiefs. It\u2019s also a deterrent to those refugees/asylum seekers who would want to come back home.  \n7. In the midst of these crises, there are joint illegal projects booming between president Kiir and Akol Koor. There is illegal gold mining in Kapoeta, Eastern Equatoria state in which Governor Luis Lobong is the managing director of the project in the State. He recently recruited a militia to serve two purposes; (a) destabilize Eastern Equatoria and (b) reinforce Kiir and Akol in Juba to live-long the project in case their other projects don\u2019t succeed. The same deal of illegal gold mining is taking place in Boma State, This is why there is a close relationship between David Yau Yau, Akol Koor, Akot Lual and Tor Deng Mawein. All the two rebellions of David Yau Yau were orchestrated in Juba to undermine the leadership of former Governor and Current Defense Minister, Kuol Manyang Juuk so that they could mine gold illegally in Boma. The short reign of the former Boma state Governor, Baba Medan was sabotaged by Akol Koor, David Yau Yau, Ismail Konyi because he was on a front foot in bringing about long lasting peace in the region. This was against the interest of this click. So they frustrated him by arming Murle youth to attack neighbours. They would later replace him with Konyi, an active member of the same project.\n8. Currently, President Kiir has no loyalty of the Army. He uses his close relatives, like Akol Koor and advisors Tor Deng Mawein to protect him and engage the army in useless wars \u2013 some of them his own projects. That is, using the army to fight his own project war. For example, he recently ordered for the confrontation of Bor youth by the state army, when in fact, child abduction is president Kiir\u2019s sponsored project.\nIn Conclusion, South Sudan is being held hostage by two men, President Kiir and his relative who serves as a security chief, Akol Koor Kuch. They manufacture violence to maintain power, acquire wealth by diverting State resources into their own coffers and sabotage any local or regional initiatives for peace and stability in the country.\n***\n\nHandwriting is not mine, so catch feelings at your own peril!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "riaak de baai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dau aturjong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akol koor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baba medan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kiir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dinka ngok", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akot lual", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aguok", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taban deng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santino deng wuol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ismail konyi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mathiang anyoor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taban deng gai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ajongo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luis lobong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "riny tueny mabior", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ajongo mawut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tor deng mawein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul malong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taban", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "konyi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuol manyang juuk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david yau yau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dinka bor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james ajongo mawut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akol koor kuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mundari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dinka aliab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "riek machar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lou nuer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "upper nile state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akol koor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "splm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chollo community", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sudan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south sudan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athoi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eastern lakes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonglei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boma state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kapoeta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central equatoria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "upper nile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eastern equatoria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bor-juba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mundari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "equatoria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonglei state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethiopia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern bar-el-ghazal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boma", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:38.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "30246f3f05c29ef743f44f17b2b3fb9e47ffe73f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qPw70_8Ln37rg3V0gkZkToFJ1Ufehp9hYE1z9jvEOKIr4ejXxocH0UkcfXvcKfz1b8xV3Dxyg9v1q0ZGwKTOfsRF38EnPJONFZhCZUWYSpScw9ONn7Me_WpDzhTp_BdMZ0-", "site_full": "indianexpress.com", "site": "indianexpress.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "IMF approves $44.5 million credit for Madagascar | The Indian Express", "title_full": "IMF approves $44.5 million credit for Madagascar | The Indian Express", "published": "2017-12-07T14:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.308, "main_image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/10/imf-759.jpg?w=759", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 598, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "30246f3f05c29ef743f44f17b2b3fb9e47ffe73f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qPw70_8Ln37rg3V0gkZkToFJ1Ufehp9hYE1z9jvEOKIr4ejXxocH0UkcfXvcKfz1b8xV3Dxyg9v1q0ZGwKTOfsRF38EnPJONFZhCZUWYSpScw9ONn7Me_WpDzhTp_BdMZ0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T14:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "IMF approves $44.5 million credit for Madagascar | The Indian Express", "text": "Rajasthan labourer hacked: Accused claimed murder in name of rescuing woman, she denies link \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it has approved a further $44.5 million credit for Madagascar, as part of a drive to support the country\u2019s economic recovery.

Meanwhile many of them are underestimating how much of a deposit they will need for their first property, aiming to save \u00a334,693 when in fact they will need on average \u00a349,639. This means they are left with a deposit deficit of around \u00a315,388 or 31 per cent. Aldemore\u2019s researchers found that this shortfall is a particular issue in London. \nFirst-time buyers are also underestimating how long it will take them to save for their deposit, with 58 per cent believing it will take them five years to reach their goal when in fact most take over eight years to save. \nThey are also ignorant as to the additional costs associated with buying a property, such as solicitors fees and stamp duty. Almost one in three prospective buyers admitted to Aldemore that they don\u2019t know how much this will cost and 40 per cent of those who had bought a home had spent, on average, \u00a32,334 more than they\u2019d anticipated on extra costs. \nFor first-time buyers, a good understanding of the process is crucial, particularly as there are so many pitfalls along the way. Indeed Aldemore\u2019s research found that 47 per cent of first-time buyers who purchased a property this year experienced the collapse of a purchase at a cost of \u00a31,305 to them. \nCharles McDowell, commercial director, Mortgages, said: \u201cIt is clear there is a divergence between perception and reality when it comes to the house buying process. This often means those looking to buy are under-estimating the associated costs as well as the time it could take to complete, especially with first-time buyers expecting it to take four years on average to save for a deposit.\" \nHe went on to outline the impact this lack of understanding could have on first-time buyers. \n\u201cThis lack of understanding clearly has financial implications but it can also take its toll emotionally. Our First Time Buyer Index carried out in the second quarter of 2017 revealed nearly one in five (17%) recent first time buyers took three or more attempts to buy their home and the process of buying a first property caused so much stress that over one in three (35%) were made ill.\u201d \nOne solution to the challenges faced by first-time buyers would be for the Government to cut stamp duty, a move that Mr McDowell would welcome. \n\u201cSome have suggested that the Government plans to announce cutting stamp duty for first-time buyers in the Autumn Budget, a step we would welcome,\" he said. \"As it stands, first-time buyers are systematically let down by an overly complex, opaque and costly system.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "charles mcdowell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aldemore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcdowell", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:39.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fd186c626155271ba313c4a1a3bc6b5952c19747", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSm1T92cToJGYEMWPaYhcX5wXo036qFFhRi9rUVe42r28LWebNy8kOUQQS1J4.rTRswarp19ug5Y9LlVocOcJcPtYagaCJxjeTuR7wKYQPcJqYV9BSR.6GpvMLyhcUsI05lBo2l_ROLLPRQFThBE_pTvMn1RUFLmlUiNu6tRgiAKeY0SajuHWbXa45kmZJFX3zxBUhvZJGW2nszqATRzFNo", "site_full": "www.chennaiclassic.com", "site": "chennaiclassic.com", "site_section": "http://www.chennaiclassic.com/feed/1/posts", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "Chennai  - ChennaiClassic.com", "title": "Hiring for Network Operations Associate in Chennai, for Exp. 1 - 3 yrs at US Technology Internationa (Chennai Job)", "title_full": "Hiring for Network Operations Associate in Chennai, for Exp. 1 - 3 yrs at US Technology Internationa (Chennai Job)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 64302, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fd186c626155271ba313c4a1a3bc6b5952c19747", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSm1T92cToJGYEMWPaYhcX5wXo036qFFhRi9rUVe42r28LWebNy8kOUQQS1J4.rTRswarp19ug5Y9LlVocOcJcPtYagaCJxjeTuR7wKYQPcJqYV9BSR.6GpvMLyhcUsI05lBo2l_ROLLPRQFThBE_pTvMn1RUFLmlUiNu6tRgiAKeY0SajuHWbXa45kmZJFX3zxBUhvZJGW2nszqATRzFNo", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "Hiring for Network Operations Associate in Chennai, for Exp. 1 - 3 yrs at US Technology Internationa (Chennai Job)", "text": "Hiring for Network Operations Associate in Chennai, for Exp. 1 - 3 yrs at US Technology Internationa (Chennai Job) Reply to: (Not Shown) (Please mention ChennaiClassic.com when contacting) Job Description: Skill : CORE Alarm Monitoring 1.

The two-phase election is the first for members in the seven provincial assemblies established under the constitution that was adopted in 2015 after initially being rejected by ethnic groups in southern Nepal. The assembly members will name the seven states formed under the constitution and will draft provincial laws. \nThursday\u2019s voting involves about 12 million people in the southern half of the Himalayan nation, nearly 80 percent of the population. The northern, mountainous region voted on November 26. Counting of all the votes is expected to start Friday and take several days as some of the ballot boxes must be transported from remote villages to counting centers. \nPeople holding their voting cards in their hands lined up before polling stations opened at 7 a.m. in the capital, Kathmandu. \u201cI am here to vote today because it is the first election for provinces with the hope these provincial governments would be able to deliver development to a focused and concentrated areas,\u201d said Kedar Sharan Raya, 74-year-old retired advocate. \u201cI am voting after many years because there is new hope in the country with the establishment of provinces,\u201d said Iswor Prasad Shrestha, 70, businessman. \nPolice spokesman Manoj Nupane said voting on Thursday was mostly peaceful and security was stepped up in the region. Police, army soldiers and temporary police officers are guarding polling stations. Vehicles were banned from the streets and voters walked to the polling stations in their neighborhoods. Both foreign and local observers were monitoring the polling. \nEuropean Union observer Zeljana Zovko said they have not noted any major issues in the places they have visited. \u201cThe process has started without any major incidents, this is something which is very important,\u201d she said. \nNepal\u2019s slow path to democracy began in 2006, when protesters forced the king to give up his rule. Two years later, Nepal officially abolished the centuries-old monarchy and decided a federal system would best serve all corners of the one of the poorest nations in the world. But bickering among political parties delayed until 2015 the implementation of the new constitution, which declared Nepal a republic. \nSecurity was stepped up for the elections, with thousands of police and army soldiers deployed. According to the Home Ministry, more than 400 people were detained in days leading up to the vote. Soon after the constitution was implemented in 2015, protests by ethnic groups in southern Nepal turned violent and left some 50 people dead. \nThe ethnic Madhesi group protested for months, saying they did not get enough territory in the province assigned to them. They said they deserved more land because they represented a bigger population. Their protest blocked the border with India for months, cutting off fuel and other supplies in Nepal.

The 33-year-old actor, who debuted in Bollywood with 2012 film Bittoo Boss and grabbed Fukrey the very next year, feels while the sequel is a refreshing change for him, he isn\u2019t really doing comedy in the film. \n\u201cI\u2019ve grown as an actor I would say. Comic actor, serious actor are simply terms. Even in Fukrey or any other film, it not only has comedy. Some scenes have emotions, some have soul, some have action, some have comedy. In this film, majorily it is comedy. But we aren\u2019t doing that comedy. It is happening around us. Situations are comic. And they are not actually comic like Charlie Chaplin.

The 1975. I don't know if you guys know them. Yeah, they're awesome.\" \nCamila also admitted that in the immediate aftermath of leaving Fifth Harmony, she felt under pressure to deliver a hit record. \nBut now, the brunette beauty has a more philosophical approach to her music. \nShe explained: \"I remember feeling super nervous, but there was a time where I was like, 'It doesn't matter that much. It's music! It's not that deep.\" \nMeanwhile, Camilla previously admitted she felt like she's had to \"prove\" to her collaborators that she's a real artist. \nThe singer - who has worked with the likes of Diplo and Shawn Mendes - said: \"I just really wanted to prove to people that I had something to say and that I wasn't just a singer, that I was an artist, that I had a point of view and knew exactly the song that I wanted to write or the lyrics. \n\"The first few weeks were me really wanting to prove that to people and prove to myself to. People I was writing with were like, that's actually a really great lyric, or that's a really good idea, or oh yeah we should do that! \n\"That made me less and less insecure to the point where by the end of it, I feel like the last studio session I went to, I would come in and know exactly what I want and not be afraid to say it.\" This article originally ran on celebretainment.com .

Such was the incredible strength of Ambedkar that his philosophy and contribution in nation-building could not be erased despite the efforts of some people, the PM said. \n\u201cSuch was his incredible strength, that when years after his demise efforts were made by such people to crush his philosophy, when efforts were made to erase his contribution towards nation-building, his ideals could not be wiped outfrom people\u2019s memory,\u201d he said. He said he would not be wrong in saying that \u201cmore people are still influenced by his ideas than the family for which such efforts (to erase his contribution) were made\u201d. \nThe PM said the idea to construct the centre was conceived in 1992. \u201cThen nothing happened for 23 years\u2026when our government came, we not only laid its foundation (in April 2015), but are also dedicating it to the nation today,\u201d Modi said. \nIn a broadside against the Congress and Rahul Gandhi, who is poised to become party president, he said political parties who sought votes in the name of Ambedkar were perhaps not even aware that the project was pending. \u201cIt is a different matter that they are thinking more of Baba Bhole than Babasaheb\u2026 even that is okay,\u201d he said. \nThe Congress vice-president had recently evoked Lord Shiva in reply to the BJP\u2019s criticism that his temple visits in Gujarat were an election gimmick. \u201cI am a devotee of Shiv. The BJP may say anything, but I will remain honest,\u201d he had said in Ahmedabad. \nThe PM said in his address that there are forces trying to divide the country on caste lines. Caste divisions, he added, put brakes on the pace of development. Modi also lamented that Ambedkar\u2019s dream of social democracy \u2013 where all have a say \u2013 is still unaccomplished. \u201cBut I see hope in today\u2019s generation\u2026 things are changing\u2026 the ills of society are being removed,\u201d he said. \nHe said the centre will be an inspiration for the promotion of the Dalit icon\u2019s thoughts and teachings and an important place for research on social and economic issues. Modi added that the government had developed five places related to Babasaheb Ambedkar into pilgrimage spots. The five pilgrimage spots \u2013 in Delhi, Mumbai, Nagpur, Mhow and London \u2013 were like a homage from the present generation. \u201cI think that this centre is for the youth\u2026where they can see and understand the vision of Babasaheb Ambedkar,\u201d the PM said. The centre, he said, was a fusion of Buddhist and modern architecture.

With three episodes each during the first two seasons, the show put its best foot forward. When the first episode of the series, The National Anthem ended, it introduced us to a future that felt pretty believable. Episodes like White Bear maintained the mystery for the entire duration only to reveal the horrifying climax that left us questioning our moral code. And an episode like White Christmas showed cinematic brilliance with a strong plot line that kept us glued. \nCharlie Brooker\u2019s vision is simply unparalleled and it\u2019s difficult to name another personality in the world of entertainment who has a better understanding of the world than him. But even with Charlie Brooker\u2019s genius attached to the show, this season feels underwhelming. \nIt would be wise to say in the times when binge watching has become the most popular way of consuming content, Black Mirror still remains a show that just can\u2019t be binge watched and the sole reason for that is the superior quality it always delivered. Many episodes in the past have left us gobsmacked and spiraled us down a wormhole where we were left imagining the destruction that technology could cause to human life. \nBut sadly, the new season of Black Mirror doesn\u2019t hold up to its predecessors. \nThe six independent episodes of the fourth season aim to recreate the same impact but most of them, unfortunately fail. Black Mirror has left us googling the real-life inventions that have already happened and how they could have an effect on our lives. More often than not, these episodes paint the picture of a bleak future and there would be no exit from that. This season has a significant change in tone as the stories aren\u2019t as dark as we expect them to be. \nBlack Mirror\u2019s new season tries too hard to recreate the legacy that it created for itself but can\u2019t match it. \n1. Arkangel \nThis story of a mother-daughter duo is set in the near future. Their relationship is nurturing but quite interfering for the daughter and the consequences, as expected, aren\u2019t pleasant for anyone involved. The storyline focuses on the over-protective nature of parents and the measures they take to save their child from the monstrous world. The decisions, even taken from a good place, turn toxic for an impressionable mind. While the concept is futuristic, the impact from the climax of the story does not leave you scarred or scared. The story is engaging but somehow does not match the expectations that one has from a Black Mirror episode, considering its legacy so far. Arkangel | Screenshot from YouTube/Netflix \n2. Black Museum \nOne of the best episodes this season, Black Museum serves three stories that are entwined in one episode in the best way possible. This one has a lot of easter eggs from the previous episodes of the series and is quite engaging for the viewer. The creepy factor that has been associated with Black Mirror for all these years remains consistent in this episode. With the duration that lasts over an hour, this episode has the kind of impact that we have associated with Black Mirror. Black Museum | Screenshot from YouTube/Netflix \n3. USS Callister \nThis episode is Black Mirror\u2019s ode to the likes of Star Trek. This feature length episode is about an organisation and the intellectual politics that dictates an individual\u2019s decision making. The introvert who is pushed around at work but lives an alternate life that allows him to be whosoever he wants to be, an extrovert who swoops in at the right time and takes away the cake, this episode explores these personality archetypes. The introduction scene of this episode is enough to raise the interest bar and even the tension remains consistent but it\u2019s only the payback that leaves you questioning if it was worth it. USS Callister | Screenshot from YouTube/Netflix \n4. Crocodile \nThis episode is entirely filmed in Iceland and is set in the near future where raw impressions of live events can be extracted out of one\u2019s mind. The protagonist has a dark secret and in her struggle to keep that secret buried, she ends up making more devastating mistakes. The story is predictable, and even when the big shock drops in the end, you know you could see it coming. Crocodile was certainly the least impressive episode this season with events that don\u2019t really hold your attention for long. The picturesque beauty of Iceland is wonderfully captured but at the end of the day, we expect more from Black Mirror than a few shots that look stunning. Crocodile | Screenshot from YouTube/Netflix \n5. Hang the DJ \nAs told by Charlie Brooker himself, Hang the DJ is a follow up of San Junipero. San Junipero was a rare episode from the Black Mirror universe that did not leave us disheartened. Hang the DJ has the same tone of hopefulness attached to it, at least for most part of the episode. This is set in a world where dating apps match you with prospects and study your relationship patterns revealing who would be the right fit. Two characters remain the focal point of this story and we see them struggling through this course where they are matched with people they might or might not have an interest in. Unlike other episodes, this one does not constantly border on the dangers of technology directly but toys with the idea very cleverly. Hang the DJ | Screenshot from YouTube/Netflix \n6. Metalhead \nThe first episode of Black Mirror that has entirely been shot in black and white. It is a tale of survival that has been shot quite aesthetically. Metalhead isn\u2019t meant for everyone and does require one to be invested in the plot. It\u2019s shot beautifully and stands out in the bouquet of the episodes that came out this year.

Keep the winter wildlife ones coming in. \nFinally, John Gorman captures soft pastel sky colours in this shot of a winter sunset at Winnats Pass in the Peak District. \nIt\u2019s a gentle and lovely scene worth setting the alarm for. Telegraph-In Focus-Winter - Chatsworth \nThis weekend there are plenty of Christmas events happening around Sheffield - as well as the possibility of snow showers - so there will belots of opportunities to take more winter shots. \nAction shots of sledging would be a fantastic way to raise a cheer, and some of us may even be able to build a snowman. \nHere\u2019s hoping.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe number of suspects arrested in terrorism investigations has reached a record high, official figures reveal. \nA total of 400 people were held for terror-related offences in Britain in the year to the end of September. \nThis was the highest tally since data collection started in 2001 and a jump of 54% compared with the previous year. \nThe Home Office said the increase was partly due to a large number of arrests made following terrorist attacks in London and Manchester. \nThe 400 total includes 64 arrests made in connection with the Westminster (12), Manchester (23), London Bridge (21), Finsbury Park (one) and Parsons Green (seven) attacks. Armed police stand guard at Downing Street's gates after revelations of a terror plot to assassinate Theresa May was revealed (Image: AFP) \nA Home Office statistical bulletin said: \"As a result, the number of arrests in the year to 30 September 2017 was the highest since the data collection began.\" \nThe figures show that of the arrests made over the year: 115 (29%) resulted in a charge, of which 97 (84%) were charged with terrorism-related offences; 213 (53%) were released without charge; 60 (15%) were released on bail pending further investigation; 11 (3%) faced \"alternative action\"; and one case was pending. \nIt was also revealed that 58 of those held were female - the highest number on record. \nThere were year-on-year increases in the number of arrests for terrorism-related offences across all age groups and ethnic groups, including a 77% rise in the number of white suspects held, from 81 to 143. \nThe new figures show an annual jump of more than a third in arrests linked to international terrorism, from 212 to 292. \nThis category refers to activity linked to or motivated by any terrorist group that is based outside the UK which operates in and from third countries, such as Islamic State. \nThere was also a leap in arrests for \"domestic\" terrorism, up from 20 in the year to September 2016 to 73 in the latest period. \nDomestic terrorism refers to activity where there are no links to either Northern Ireland-related or international terrorism. The remaining arrests were Northern Ireland-related (five) and unclassified (30). Security minister Ben Wallace (Image: REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett) \nSecurity Minister Ben Wallace said police and security services \"have been clear that we are facing a shift rather than a short-term spike in the terrorist threat\". \nHe added: \"The statistics we are publishing today demonstrate the breadth of work that they undertake, alongside the rest of the criminal justice system, day in and day out to keep us safe. \n\"But this is not the totality of our work. The whole of society must come together to challenge the terrorist threat. \n\"The public must remain alert but not alarmed and report any suspicions they have about unusual activity or behaviour to the appropriate authorities. \n\"Furthermore, the Government is reviewing its counter-terrorism strategy in light of recent attacks to ensure we meet the threat from terrorism now and in the future.\" \nCounter-terror agencies believe the scale of the threat facing the country is unprecedented. \nBritain was hit by five attacks between March and September, while authorities are mounting more operations to disrupt suspected terrorist planning. Amber Rudd revealed in Parliament the increasing number of terror plots thwarted (Image: PA) \nHome Secretary Amber Rudd disclosed earlier this week that MI5 and police have now thwarted 22 Islamist plots since the murder of Lee Rigby in May 2013. \nThis includes nine which have been foiled since the Westminster atrocity in March. \nThe number of \"live\" operations being run by MI5 and police has surged by a third since the beginning of this year to well over 500. \nThese probes involve around 3,000 \"subjects of interest\", while there is a further pool of more than 20,000 individuals who have previously been investigated. \nEarlier this week an official assessment revealed the ringleader of the London Bridge rampage was being \"actively\" investigated at the time of the atrocity. \nIt also found that the Manchester bombing in May could have been stopped \"had the cards fallen differently\".

The session started with the reasons for their popularity and discussed the goals, potential, and techniques they offered for marketing.\nFurther Challapallin said, \u201c Experts believed that the right way to market a brand is to show how it could solve a problem, show its experience, and make the consumer\u2019s story the focus of the show.\u201d \nWith all the advantages there is a flip side too which she explained quoting studies on clutter content and that many people did not really give brands much importance. She also accentuate on using Indian languages other than Hindi and English.\nDiscussing the future possibility of content marketing Challapalli said, \u201cIn the future, there could possibly be more technology to grapple with, such as virtual and augmented reality.

Request More Information DBCT has recently been experiencing vessel queues at the highest levels since 2010, with around 45 ships waiting. From 2011 to June 2017, the monthly daily average queue only exceeded 30 ships twice, according to DBCT Management data.One of DBCT's users Stanmore Coal, said Thursday that the port congestion has caused it to defer two planned December semi-soft coking coal shipments into January.\"The vessel queue is primarily due to a slower-than-expected clearing of the backlog caused by the impact of Tropical Cyclone Debbie earlier this year when the Goonyella rail line was disrupted for over five weeks,\" it said.Tropical Cyclone Debbie made landfall in late March.\"Vessel queues are expected to return to lower levels in early calendar 2018 and as a result, production guidance of 1.2 million mt/year for the FY 18 remains unchanged and Stanmore's FY 18 results are not expected to be materially impacted,\" Stanmore said.Other Australian coal export ports are currently not experiencing similar shipping delays, it added.The neighbouring BHP Mitsubishi Alliance-owned Hay Point Coal Terminal saw exports in November bounce back from very weak levels in October, NQBP data showed.HPCT shipped 3.90 million mt in November, which is down 10% year on year from 4.32 million mt, but 32% higher than the 2.95 million mt shipped in October, it shows.Apart from April this year -- when exports from the terminal were heavily impacted by Tropical Cyclone Debbie and slumped to just 759,000 mt -- HPCT's October exports were the smallest monthly volume since at least September 2013, according to the data.Further north, shipment volumes from the Abbott Point Coal Terminal were relatively stable in November at 2.23 million mt, which is up 6% from 2.11 million mt a year earlier and down 3% from 2.30 million mt in October, it said.For January-November, the three terminals have exported a combined 121.79 million mt, which compares to the combined nameplate capacity of 190 million mt/year.The breakdown of coal exported from the three terminals by metallurgical coal and thermal coal is not readily available, but metallurgical coal makes up the bulk of it.--Nathan Richardson,", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons":

promote artifacts with ease\n\nPak is a tool to generate build artifacts with custom metadata, that you can later promote.\n\n# Usage\n\nYou define your artifacts using a `Pakfile.json` that looks like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"artifact_name\": \"ALPHA-ARTIFACT\",\n  \"path\": \"./bin\",\n  \"metadata\": {\n      \"mantainer\": \"bronzdoc@mail.com\",\n      \"BUILD_DATE\": \"${BUILD_DATE}\"\n    }\n\n  \"promote\":{\n    \"rc\":{\n      \"name\": \"RELEASE-ARTIFACT\",\n      \"metadata\": {\n      \"REL_DATE\": \"${BUILD_DATE}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> pak can read environment variables so you can use them inside your Pakfile.json as `${VAR_NAME}`\n\n### Build\n\n```shell\n$ export BUILD_DATE=$(date)\n$ pak build\n```\n\nthis will generate a .tar file named `ALPHA-ARTIFACT.tar`\n\n### Inspect\n\nAfter you build an artifact using 'pak' you can inspect it's metadata with the inspect subcommand\n\n```shell\n$ pak inspect ALPHA-ARTIFACT.tar\n\n{\n  \"build\": {\n    \"metadata\": {\n      \"BUILD_DATE\": \"lun dic  4 16:57:23 CST 2017\",\n      \"mantainer\": \"bronzdoc@mail.com\"\n    },\n    \"name\": \"ALPHA-ARTIFACT\"\n  },\n  \"rc\": {\n    \"metadata\": {\n      \"REL_DATE\": \"${REL_DATE}\"\n    },\n    \"name\": \"RELEASE-ARTIFACT\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can pass the \"--key-value\" flag to the inspect subcommand to display the data in a key=value manner, i.e:\n\n```shell\n$ pak inspect --key-value ALPHA-ARTIFACT.tar\n\n#build\n  BUILD_DATE=\"lun dic  4 16:57:23 CST 2017\"\n  mantainer=\"bronzdoc@mail.com\"\n

The Commission received 45,000 suggestions on its questionnaire and recently commented that in case UCC does not come out, it will recommend \u201cpiecemeal\u201d amendments to various religion based family laws. \nCodifying all religion into one has been one of the oldest debates in independent India. And public opinion on the issue has been sharply divided. With the Narendra Modi -led BJP government at the Centre, UCC has once again come to the fore. \nUCC was discussed in the Constituent Assembly as well. Giving context to the term \u201cpiecemeal\u201d legislation, it was first used on November 23, 1948 by KM Munshi during a debate on the UCC. Article 35, the then UCC provision, was under discussion in the Constituent Assembly. KM Munshi was in favour of UCC and it was he who defined what a \u201cpiecemeal\u201d legislation is. \nThe idea of codified law met with several arguments in the Constituent Assembly like infringement of fundamental rights and \u201ctyrannous\u201d to minority. \n\u201cIs it tyrannical? Nowhere in advanced Muslim countries the personal law of each minority has been recognised as so sacrosanct as to prevent the enactment of a Civil Code,\u201d Munshi had said. \nMunshi illustrated Europe which, follows a civic code and every person or minority residing in the country falls under the umbrella. Retaliating against religious practices in daily life, Munshi elucidated that \u201cthese matters are not religion, they are purely matters for secular legislation.\u201d \nDuring the debate Munshi laid down his view and said, \u201cWe want to divorce religion from personal law, from what may be called social relations or from the rights of parties as regards inheritance or succession. What have these things got to do with religion I really fail to understand.\u201d \nMunshi illustrated with an example of various schools present in Hindu law like Mithakshara, Dayabagha in Bengal and Mayukha applying in other parts of the country. He explained that Hindus have separate laws based on different schools and during that time, provinces and States had begun formulating their separate laws. This \u201cpiecemeal\u201d legislation was what Munshi feared would affect the personal laws of the country. \n\u201cIt is therefore not merely a question for minorities but it also affects the majority,\u201d Munshi had remarked. \n\u201cReligion must be restricted to spheres which legitimately appertain to religion, and the rest of life must be regulated, unified and modified in such a manner that we may evolve, as early as possible a strong and consolidated nation. Our first problem and the most important problem is to produce national unity in this country. We think we have got national unity,\u201d Munshi concluded.

Ryan's character I felt was very childish especially with the wanting to get married so quickly and expecting Kara to fall back into his arms straight away. Also for a person who is meant to be a genius he never really thought through his actions and its consequences. Kara's character was just annoying because she had no back bone and just went running back to the man who broke her heart as well as she was going into a marriage where she knew something was very wrong and just for the sake that she did not want to be alone. I also did not like Matt's or Kara's mothers character because they just believed the worst of Ryan even though they knew him for so long. The only good thing about this book was the steaming hot chemistry between Ryan and Kara and this was the sole reason I completed the book. Overall this was a predictable second chance which lacked a good story and characters. \nRating:2/5 \nPlot Kara has always been in love with her brothers gorgeous best friend, but when he disappears just after proposing to her she is left completely heartbroken. It has taken Kara 5 years to get over Ryan and move on with her life.When she finally feels like she is going to be happy again, Ryan shows up again but now he is richer and more handsome and he wants Kara back in his life again. \nRyan had left the only women he had ever loved due to one horrible incident during a stormy night. No matter how successful he became he knows that Kara is the only one for him. He is now back in their home town to make her his again, but the catch is that she cannot find out what happen the night he left her.

So when he got the opportunity on Wednesday night, he relished it. Durant had 35 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists, and Golden State beat the Charlotte Hornets 101-87 without Curry and Draymond Green. \nIt was Durant\u2019s first triple-double of the season and his second since joining the Warriors. \n\u201cIt\u2019s fun when you get to create and just be creative out there, whether it\u2019s passing to JaVale (McGee) for a lob or shooting a pull-up jump shot,\u201d Durant said. \u201cTonight it felt like I could go in my bag of tools, my bag of tricks, to pull some stuff out. I don\u2019t expect it to be like that every single game, but tonight I thought it called for it.\u201d \nCoach Steve Kerr called it a luxury to turn from one MVP to another in a time of need. He said Durant simply took over. \n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much a vocal leadership role, but more of an `I got this\u2019 type of thing,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cIt was the way he carried himself. He was clearly the best player on the floor and the dominant player on the floor. Without Steph, he almost had a different bounce to his step, like `This one is mine, I got it.\u201d \nKlay Thompson scored seven of his 22 points in the fourth quarter for the Warriors, who have won five straight overall and seven in a row against the Hornets. Curry will be sidelined for about two weeks with a sprained ankle, while Green is nursing a sore shoulder. \nIt hardly mattered. Durant set the tone, scoring 16 points on 6-of-9 shooting in the first quarter to help the Warriors build a 26-18 lead. The edge increased to 26 in the second quarter following back-to-back 3-pointers by Nick Young, who had 10 points. \n\u201cEven without those other guys, they\u2019re still pretty good,\u201d said Hornets associate head coach Stephen Silas, who is leading the team while Steve Clifford is dealing with a health issue. \u201cObviously with Kevin Durant and Klay it was hard to stop those guys tonight.\u201d \nKemba Walker led the Hornets with 24 points, while Nic Batum added 15 and Dwight Howard 14. Charlotte cut the lead to 11 at the end of the third quarter behind 10 points from Batum but didn\u2019t make a serious run at the lead thanks to a strong fourth quarter from Thompson. \nTIP INS Warriors: Golden State (20-6) had 24 fast-break points against a team that had been allowing the second-fewest fast-break points in the league at 7.5 per game. \u2026 Patrick McCaw did not play because of a bruised nose. \nHornets: Charlotte attempted one free throw in the first half after attempting 40 on Monday night against the Orlando Magic. \nWHAT\u2019S COOKING: Quinn Cook started at point guard for the Warriors and had eight points, three assists and three rebounds. Kerr said his play was fantastic. \n\u201cI knew Quinn would play well,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHe\u2019s played a lot of minutes for New Orleans last year and we have watched him in practice in the G league. \u2026 We have a lot of synergy between the franchises and we run the same stuff, so Quinn knows all of the plays.\u201d \nINJURED HORNETS: Just when the Hornets finally got everyone back healthy, they lost two big men off the bench. Frank Kaminsky left the game in the first quarter with an ankle injury and Cody Zeller left in the fourth with a strained left knee. Neither returned to the game. \nKaminsky left the arena in a walking boot. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Silas said of their status moving forward. \u201cHopefully those guys will be OK because we got some home games coming up and we\u2019ll need them.\u201d \nUP NEXT Warriors: Visit Pistons on Friday night. \nHornets: Host Bulls on Friday night.

Friel believes the Hoops have what it takes to continue their recent dominance of the Four Lanterns Ulster Senior League. \nFriel this week was named as the Watson Menswear Player of the Month for the first time. \n\u201cIt was a good month for us and we were banging in the goals,\u201d the Cockhill hitman said. \n\u201cBut we\u2019ve been like that all season \u2013 there are plenty of goals all around our squad now. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very fresh this season so far. At the end of last year, we struggled a bit, the squad was light and we had a lot of men out. \n\u201cThis year, we have Mark Coyle and Mark Moran back in and we\u2019ve added Laurence Toland to it. \n\u201cWe know if we\u2019re not playing well or not scoring, there\u2019s someone biting at your ankles to get in. We know with the strength in depth we have that we\u2019re capable of doing well again this season.\u201d \nCockhill head to Fanad this Sunday, with Friel expecting a tough battle. \nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s always tricky in Fanad. We never get it easy down there. At this time of year, with the wind and the rain, it makes it even harder. You\u2019d imagine there mightn\u2019t be a whole lot of football played, but it\u2019s a game we need to go and win.\u201d \nCockhill were held to a 1-1 draw by Derry City Reserves on Sunday when Mark Moran\u2019s opening goal was cancelled out by Caolan McLaughlin. \nWith Letterkenny Rovers beating Bonagee 3-0 at Dry Arch Park, Cockhill\u2019s lead at the summit, even though they remain unbeaten, is down to a point. \nFriel said: \u201cBefore the game, you\u2019d be thinking a draw at home would be two points dropped, but the way the game went we\u2019d take it for sure. \n\u201cOisin McColgan came in with a couple of last ditch tackles and Lee McCarron made a couple of top saves. \n\u201cWe\u2019re unbeaten, but we have Letterkenny and Derry absolutely breathing down our necks. It\u2019s important we keep on winning because you\u2019ve no margin for losses in this League. You don\u2019t want to be going level on points or even starting to chase other teams. \n\u201cYou just can\u2019t afford to slip up.\u201d \nWhile Cockhill have dominated domestically over the last handful of years, Gavin Cullen\u2019s side have not managed to make significant inroads into the Intermediate Cup. \nHowever, wins over Swilly Rovers and Swords Celtic have Cockhill into the fourth round, but they face a tricky away tie at Home Farm in January as they bid to reach the latter stages. \nFriel said: \u201cThere\u2019s no easy drawn in the Intermediate Cup. Obviously, you\u2019d like to be at home all the time, but you have to just take whatever the draw throws at you really. \n\u201cNo-one will be relishing meeting us anyway. We know that. We just have to take every game as it comes. \n\u201cBut with the squad we have, there\u2019s no doubt we should be looking at the Intermediate Cup and aiming to give it a rattle.\u201d USL \u2013 Friel says \u2018fresh\u2019 Cockhill still have what it takes to win silverware   6th,   Tags:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "friel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oisin mccolgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cockhill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gavin cullen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee mccarron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark coyle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laurence toland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bonagee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark moran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caolan mclaughlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garbhan friel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "home farm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "celtic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cockhill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swilly rovers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "watson menswear", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derry city reserves", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "letterkenny rovers", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "dry arch park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "letterkenny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fanad", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:43.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9b54e445ac0602cbfaeb7cba2c6c51b0f7bfffb4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9pZjbkz0yttu0HCHKIvYEzRAItHutl1kIdQ3ia7NPweNIbtjRMgibxVaQ2ZxJVOm4SB_bOyprOWF66b6MBGWZgII8YLtRc0QG4MbTKy184SmOb5HskhVClWMBo6Im3YzaVqDlYrzOqA--", "site_full": "mybroadband.co.za", "site": "mybroadband.co.za", "site_section": "http://mybroadband.co.za/news/cellular/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Cellular \u2013 MyBroadband \u2013 Trusted in Tech", "title": "We launched out-of-bundle data blocking by mistake \u2013 MTN", "title_full": "We launched out-of-bundle data blocking by mistake \u2013 MTN", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 75, "participants_count": 57, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MTN-logo-yellow.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5974, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6dc242f2b1c6047ca4ef3a96f276f9313d248f06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9pZjbkz0yttu0HCHKIvYEzRAItHutl1kIdQ3ia7NPweNIbtjRMgibxVaQ2ZxJVOm4SB_bOyprOWF66b6MBGWZgII8YLtRc0QG4MbTKy184SmOb5HskhVClWMBo6Im3YxKpwKHSZYyyig4qukFcMgg", "ord_in_thread": 73, "author": "v_3", "published": "2017-12-07T09:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Not sure what gave you that impression.\nYou have to test a feature before you release it.

He ruled 2017 with his Toilet Ek Prem Katha where he portrayed the story of a man whose marriage comes under strain after his wife learns that his house does not have a toilet. Now, he is attracting eyeballs with his film PadMan. After releasing two posters and several looks from the film, the actor shared a motion poster in which we can hear Sonam Kapoor teaching Akshay how to pronounce PadMan. The way Akshay responds to the pronunciation speaks a lot about the kind of innocence he will be portraying on screen, and we surely cannot wait to see him take over the screen space as Lakshmikant Chauhan. \nAkshay Kumar\u2019s character Lakshmikant is inspired by the life of Coimbatore-based Arunachalam Muruganantham, who found a way to make cheap, affordable sanitary napkins for women in his village. PadMan features an ensemble of actors like Akshay Kumar, Sonam Kapoor and Radhika Apte . Arunachalam\u2019s story even inspired Twinkle Khanna so much that she mentioned him in one of the chapters of her book \u2018The Legend Of Lakshmi Prasad\u2019. Later, she decided to turn producer making it into a film. \nDirector R Balki feels Arunachalam\u2019s life is nothing less and entertaining as the iconic film Sholay. \u201cHis (Muruganantham\u2019s) life itself is equal to \u2018Sholay\u2019. It is as entertaining as the biggest masala entertainers\u2026 And when you have a life that is so entertaining, why do I need to add entertainment,\u201d asked Balki. P-A-D + M-A-N = PAD MAN \n\u2014 Akshay Kumar (@akshaykumar) December 7, 2017 \nPadMan, directed by R. Balki and produced by Twinkle Khanna, will head to theaters on January 26, 2018.

His support for cab sharing, which, at present, is being provided by app-based cab aggregators has come amid the Delhi government firming up the City Taxi Scheme 2017. \n\u201cI agree that ride sharing is a good idea. This is being discussed within the govt. Our concern is women safety. Sharing a ride wid strangers may not be safe for women,\u201d Kejriwal tweeted. \nHe also invited suggestions on how to allow ride sharing and simultaneously ensure women safety. \nHowever, the opinion on whether to allow cab sharing or ban it is divided in the absence of any enabling law supporting either. According to sources, Delhi Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot is against banning cab ride sharing and a final decision over it is expected to be taken today. \n\u201cThe file related to the proposed City Taxi Scheme is pending with the minister\u2019s office for his approval. Once the minister takes a decision, the draft will be sent to the Lt Governor and thereafter, it will be made public for general suggestion,\u201d an official said on the condition of anonymity. \nCab aggregators operate with contract carriage permits that allow point-to-point transportation with no stop-overs between the origin and the final destination of a ride. \nIn contrast, the stage carriage permit, given for public service transport, allows pick and drop at different stops on a route. The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, does not allow shared rides by cabs that operate under contract carriage permits. It can be done only after an amending the Act.
