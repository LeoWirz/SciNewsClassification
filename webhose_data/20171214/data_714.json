It is an inflammatory disorder which affects nasal and conjunctival mucosa and is induced as a result of hypersensitive immune response. Rhinoconjunctivitis causes symptoms of allergic rhinitis such as sneezing, watery mucus, itchy nose, and nasal congestion, as well as conjunctivitis which include burning sensation, tears and redness of eyes. These symptoms may also be accompanied by systemic symptoms such as poor sleep, irritability and fatigue. Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis is often mistaken with common cold and a person may realize this only after carrying out considerable allergy diagnostics.Report Overview and TOC: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/rhinoconjunctivitis-ma... Various allergens are known to cause rhinoconjunctivitis including pollen grains, dust and dust mites, animal skin or dander, perfumes, smoke, hair and several others. Allergic rhinitis is one of the most common allergic reactions in U.S. According to National Institute for Health Research, more than 10 million individuals in the U.K. suffer from allergic rhinitis. The institute also explains that the over 90% of the individuals with allergic rhinitis frequently suffer from ocular symptoms. An article published in Journal of Allergy and Therapy mentions that allergic rhinitis is one of the most common reasons for hospital visits due to allergies. Other publications also report that majority of the patients with asthma also suffer from rhinitis, and over 20% of patients with rhinoconjunctivitis also have concomitant asthma.Request brochure: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag... A broad spectrum of treatment is available for treatment of rhinoconjunctivitis. The treatment for allergic conjunctivitis includes both topical as well as systemic interventions such decongestants, mast-cell stabilizers, antihistamines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and intranasal corticosteroids. In case of occasional symptoms, Claritin (loratadine), Reactine (cetirizine), Aerius (desloratadine), Allegra (fexofenadine) are prescribed. While if the symptoms are more frequent, intra-nasal corticosteroids are prescribed which include Avamys, Flonase, Nasacort, Nasonex, Omnaris, Rhinocort.For Specific and Customized requirements@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag... Article published in World Allergy Organizations Journal in 2013 suggests that no accurate data is available for studying the prevalence and its changing trends. This has hampered the research and development activities. The study also found that the prevalence of non food allergies is also increasing rapidly in Asia. Allergic asthma is also a rising concern for many countries. More than 5 million people in the U.K. suffer from asthma.A report published by European Environment and Health Information System, considerable increase in prevalence was observed for rhinoconjunctivitis in Poland, Romania and the Russia Federation for rhinoconjunctivitis. This increasing prevalence is a major factor driving the global rhinoconjunctivitis market. Consistent research and development, and growing awareness about allergies would also support the growth, especially in developing countries. Prevalence of allergic rhinitis has increased considerably in adults as well as children. Consumption of food that has been preserved extensively in refrigerators, industrialization and air pollution are also responsible for the increased prevalence according to a study published in Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Research Journal. Similar conditions prevail in India, Korea, Singapore and other Asian countries.Pre Book full report@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/checkout.php?rep_id=30... Various pharmaceutical companies and research institutes are conducting research for the discovery for better treatment of the allergy. Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. is currently conducting phase III clinical trials for SCH 697243 a biological drug, and another candidate MK-8237 is under phase I trials. BioTech Tools S.A. is also developing gpASIT+TM as a potential treatment for rhinoconjunctivitis. The study is currently under phase II clinical trials. Such consistent research activities will add more products in the market and expand its scope. Some of the key players in the market include Johnson & Johnson Inc., Merck & Co., Inc.

Kevin R. Wexler/NorthJersey.com Tucked into a corner at the Richard Stockton Service Place south of Exit 7A, a monument commemorates the attack that drew the U.S. into World War II. John Niedzielski of Suffolk County, N.Y., said the Pearl Harbor memorial at the Richard Stockton Service Plaza off the New Jersey Turnpike should be moved someplace where more people would see it. Perhaps Trenton, he said. (Photo: Kevin R. Wexler/NorthJersey.com) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE On a recent morning, Ray Malone, a long-haul trucker from Maryland, steered his 18-wheeler northward on the New Jersey Turnpike to deliver a load of outdoor carpeting for a Pearl Harbor memorial ceremony on Long Island. The next day, Malone drove south on the turnpike and stumbled onto another connection to the devastating Japanese attack on U.S. Navy ships at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on Dec. 7, 1941, which led to America\u2019s entry into World War II. Malone pulled into the Richard Stockton Service Plaza, which sits on a stretch of New Jersey flatlands a few miles south of Exit 7A in Hamilton. As he got out of his truck, a wind blew across the parking lot and the smell of manure wafted off a nearby farm. Malone walked past a series of empty handicapped parking spaces, a sign telling him to \u201cplease discard papers and trash in containers,\u201d and a shuttered frozen yogurt stand. As he headed for the boxy rest stop building that is home to a Starbucks, a Pizza Hut, a Quiznos, a Burger King and a photo affirming that Chris Christie is still New Jersey's governor, Malone stopped by a stand of trees and a worn brick patio dotted with pigeon droppings, a few cigarette butts, dead leaves and the summer\u2019s wilted flowers. \nAfter the highway extension linking the New Jersey and Pennsylvania turnpikes was dedicated in 1997 to the 2,403 people who were killed at Pearl Harbor, the state elected to place the memorial plaque at the Richard Stockton Service Plaza \"for safety reasons.\" (Photo: Kevin R. Wexler/NorthJersey.com) Then he noticed a plaque \u2014 for a memorial to Pearl Harbor . On the turnpike. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of ridiculous,\u201d said Malone, 41, as he stared at the plaque and wondered aloud why a memorial to one of the nation\u2019s most historic events would be located at a turnpike rest stop. New Jersey is home to plenty of oddities. In Margate, for instance, a 65-foot-tall wood-and-tin elephant named Lucy overlooks the beach. In Asbury Park, a storefront museum honors the state's ghosts. In Edgewater, a luxury condominium complex overlooking the Hudson River wraps around a century-old cemetery. In Camden, an aquarium was built blocks from one of the nation\u2019s poorest and most drug-infested neighborhoods. \nThe destroyer USS Shaw explodes after being hit by bombs during the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. on Dec. 7, 1941. (Photo: U.S. Navy file photo via AP) But placing a memorial to the Pearl Harbor attack at a turnpike rest stop may be one of the oddest of combinations. If nothing else, it is a bizarre linkage of what is arguably New Jersey\u2019s most iconic and reviled landmark with a devastating and pivotal historic event that is usually commemorated with solemn tributes on Dec 7. As he pointed out the strange placement of what should be an otherwise important memorial, Malone asked: \u201cWho\u2019s really going to see it?\u201d \nRay Malone, a truck driver from Maryland, stopped at the Richard Stockton rest stop this week on his way to deliver carpet for a Pearl Harbor ceremony on Long Island. \"It's kind of ridiculous,\" he said, referring to the memorial's location after happening upon it by accident, adding: \u201cWho\u2019s really going to see it?\u201d (Photo: Kevin R. Wexler/NorthJersey.com) A quick answer to Malone\u2019s question \u2014 based on several hours of observation earlier this week \u2014 is that almost no one stops at this memorial to Pearl Harbor to reflect on its meaning or its location on a highway. One exception was Louis Fallot, a union representative and a retired NBC network camera operator. Fallot, 69, who lives in Monroe, N.Y., regularly takes a break at the Stockton rest stop when driving to his job in Washington, D.C., with the Communications Workers of America. He happened to see the Pearl Harbor plaque one day \u2014 by accident. \u201cOn the way to throw out trash, I stopped and looked,\u201d he said, pointing to a green garbage can near the memorial. \u201cHey, I didn\u2019t know that,\u201d Fallot said, recalling his reaction to seeing a Pearl Harbor memorial at a turnpike rest stop. \u201cIt\u2019s strange. You would think it would be in a little more public place.\u201d No ceremony planned For several years, Pearl Harbor veterans gathered at the Stockton rest stop on Dec. 7 for a brief service. But this year \u2014 for the 76th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack \u2014 no formal memorial service has been scheduled, in part because most veterans of the attack either have died or are too frail to make the trip. Kelly: Post-9/11 unity proved fleeting. What happened? Like Malone, most travelers pull into the rest stop for a quick restroom visit and maybe a stop at a fast-food counter before heading back to the turnpike. \nA small boat rescues a USS West Virginia crew member from the water after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on Dec. 7, 1941. (Photo: AP) Most don\u2019t bother to study the 2-by-3-foot brass plaque that tells visitors a highway \u201cextension\u201d 8 miles away linking the New Jersey and Pennsylvania turnpikes was renamed in the memory of those who perished at Pearl Harbor. The plaque also explains that \u201cthis memorial is dedicated to the memory of our 2,403 comrades in arms\u201d who perished in the Pearl Harbor attack and encourages travelers \u201cwho come here to rest\u201d to \u201cremember their sacrifices and strive to keep America alert and free.\u201d The other day, Malone read the plaque and frowned. He explained that he tries to honor veterans as much as possible. He has an uncle who served in Vietnam, and his stepmother deployed to Saudi Arabia in the Persian Gulf War of 1991. His brother, a Marine, currently serves in Afghanistan. Since 2007, Malone estimates, he has driven up and down the turnpike at least 10 times a month, regularly taking a break at the Stockton rest stop as he carried deliveries of carpeting for special events. But he never saw the Pearl Harbor plaque. \u201cI\u2019ve probably walked by this thing 10,000 times and never noticed it,\u201d he said. This seems to be the sad fate of the turnpike memorial to Pearl Harbor \u2014 a potentially important historical marker that has been rendered unimportant because of its location. Location chosen for 'safety reasons' How the memorial ended up at this obscure and unlikely location was really a matter of convenience. After the extension linking the turnpike with its sister highway in Pennsylvania was renamed in memory of Pearl Harbor veterans in 1997, state officials said they wanted to erect some sort of memorial. But they couldn\u2019t place one on an exit ramp. Nor were they willing to build a special memorial along the extension. \nLouis Fallot of Monroe, N.Y., stumbled upon the memorial as he was throwing out some trash. \u201cIt\u2019s strange,\" he said. \"You would think it would be in a little more public place.\u201d (Photo: Kevin R. Wexler/NorthJersey.com) A turnpike spokesman explained that for \u201csafety reasons,\u201d the memorial was built at the Stockton Service Plaza. At the same time, a sign was erected just off Exit 6 \u2014 8.7 miles from the memorial \u2014 advising motorists that the roadway is now called the \u201cPearl Harbor Memorial Turnpike Extension.\u201d Eric Marko, 43, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Afghanistan in 2004, now works for a construction firm in Hillsborough. Until he pulled into the Stockton rest stop the other day to take a break between jobs, he had never heard about the Pearl Harbor memorial. When told about it as he walked back to his truck, Marko stopped and stared in silence for a few moments, shaking his head in disbelief. \u201cIt\u2019s a bookmark in history,\u201d Marko said of Pearl Harbor. \u201cIt\u2019s where we can all time-stamp where our parents were. It\u2019s a changing point in United States history, without a doubt.\u201d Marko turned away, still shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s hidden away on the turnpike,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cIt\u2019s a sin.\u201d 'No one ever asks about it' Jackie Agee, the manager of the Stockton Service Plaza, said she noticed the Pearl Harbor memorial on her first day on the job earlier this year. \u201cI\u2019m aware of my surroundings,\u201d she said. Agee also said she has a special reverence for those who died on that Sunday morning in 1941 when Japanese planes attacked the U.S. Navy base at Pearl Harbor. On a recent vacation to Hawaii, Agee said, she not only visited the Pearl Harbor base but also made a point of stopping at the museum and memorial. But at the Stockton rest stop, Agee said, travelers don\u2019t pay attention to the Pearl Harbor memorial. \u201cNo one ever asks about it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re the first.\u201d \nMike Kelly (Photo: NorthJersey.com) As they walked their 12-year-old Shih Tzu, named Jeter after the Yankees star, while taking a break at the Stockton rest stop the other day, John and Billie Niedzielski noticed the Pearl Harbor memorial for the first time. The Niedzielskis said they travel the turnpike regularly while driving between homes in Port Jefferson, New York, and Gainesville, Virginia. But they had never seen the memorial before. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing,\u201d Billie said, when told of the memorial. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve been by there. I never saw it. I was always fixated on going inside or going to the car.\u201d John agreed, suggesting that the memorial be moved to a more prominent spot. Trenton, perhaps. \u201cThis country has forgotten about our veterans,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d So far, New Jersey has no plans to move the memorial.

The Senate seemed ready to follow. Without legislation, many agencies would run out of money after midnight Friday and grind to a close. \nThe two-week spending measure is aimed at giving both parties' bargainers more time to reach longer-term budget decisions. To jumpstart that negotiating, Trump and congressional leaders were meeting Thursday to try reaching agreements. \nThe prospects for successful White House talks were buffeted Wednesday when the impulsive Trump blurted to reporters that a shutdown \"could happen.\" He blamed Democrats, saying they want \"illegal immigrants pouring into our country, bringing with them crime, tremendous amounts of crime.\" \nLast week, an unexpected attack by Trump on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., prompted the two Democrats to skip a bargaining session that was planned then. \nThis time, the White House smoothed the waters by following up with a more peaceable, written statement. It praised Pelosi and Schumer for choosing to \"put their responsibility to the American people above partisanship\" and said Trump was anticipating productive talks between \"leaders who put their differences aside.\" \nLater, the White House issued another statement indicating Trump would sign the two-week spending extension. It also laid out administration budget goals, saying money for the military including missile defense and security along the border with Mexico \"must be prioritized in a long-term funding agreement.\" \nFor Republicans, a shutdown would put a humiliating bookend on a year in which they've controlled the White House and Congress with little to show for it. They want the public to focus instead on the GOP's prized $1.5 trillion tax bill, which party leaders hope to send Trump by Christmas. \nThe two-week spending bill also makes money available to several states that are running out of funds for the Children's Health Insurance Program. That widely popular program provides medical care to more than 8 million children. \nEven the head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, whose members have been threatening to oppose the temporary spending measure, predicted passage. \n\"No one wants a shutdown, including Freedom Caucus members,\" Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told reporters. \nThe roughly 30-member caucus has been trying to win promises from leaders of spending curbs and quick passage of a full-year defense budget in exchange for backing the short-term bill. Without support from many of them, Republicans would need votes from Democrats to push the temporary spending measure through the House. \nWhile many Democrats seemed likely to oppose the short-term bill, enough were expected to support it in the Senate to allow its passage there. They know they'd still have leverage on subsequent bills needed to keep the government running. \nRepublicans control the Senate 52-48 and will need at least eight Democratic votes for passage. \nDemocrats have been using their leverage to insist on spending boosts for health care, infrastructure and other domestic programs that would match increases Republicans want for defense. \nDemocrats are also seeking an agreement to extend protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children. Trump ended safeguards against deportation three months ago but has expressed an openness to restoring them. \n___ \nAP reporters Andrew Taylor and Ken Thomas contributed.

The high health risks of non-communicable diseases and relevant comorbidities in Africa, particularly in contaminated areas like e-waste and crude oil and gas exploration areas and for high consumers of food commodity groupings which are most critical for PAH exposure, are exacerbated by dietary exposure due to unsafe practices in commonly consumed foods, like those street vended.\nIn February 2016, 20 commonly consumed street foods were purchased directly from vendors at major bus stops in Benin City and Umunede in Nigeria. The concentration of 16 priority PAHs was determined. The dietary intake of B[a]P, \u2211PAH, PAH4, PAH8, and \u2211B(a)P eq was estimated for children, peripubertal children/adolescent, and adult using the total diet study (TDS) method. Among the analyzed PAHs, there was a predominance of chrysene (17.42 \u03bcg/kg). Roasted yam (14.15 \u03bcg/kg) and fried fish (1.40 \u03bcg/kg) had the highest levels of \u2211PAH and B[a]P, respectively. The mean concentration of B[a]P, \u2211PAH, PAH4, PAH8, and \u2211B(a)P eq ranged from 0.65\u20131.40 \u03bcg/kg, 0.20\u201314.15 \u03bcg/kg, 0.43\u20135.22 \u03bcg/kg, 0.13\u20137.88 \u03bcg/kg, and 0.002\u20132.123 \u03bcg/kg, respectively. The mean concentration of B[a]P and PAH4 reported in this study was below the maximum allowable levels of 5 and 12 \u03bcg/kg for adults and above the maximum levels for young children set at 1.0 \u03bcg/kg for both B[a]P and PAH4 in food. The estimated dietary intake of B[a]P, \u2211PAH, PAH4, PAH8, and \u2211B(a)P eq for adult, adolescent, and children was 0.56, 0.37, and 0.31 \u03bcg/day; 17.6, 10.7, and 8.81 \u03bcg/day; 5.78, 4.01, and 3.26 \u03bcg/day; 9.22, 6.19, and 5.09 \u03bcg/day; and 1.72, 0.97, and 0.82 \u03bcg/day, respectively.\nStreet foods represent one important source of PAHs. The exposure occurring through street food compounds with that from home-made foods, environmental pollution, and lifestyle (tobacco smoke) is making up an aggregate daily exposure in the general population.\nThe incremental lifetime cancer risk for adults and children from the consumption of street food was 7.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910 \u22128 and 2.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910 \u22128 , respectively.

Itis the second most commonly diagnosed and has the highest mortality rate of all cancers in both men and women. American Lung Association has estimated that around 224,210new cases were diagnosed with lung cancer in the American region that accounts for approximately 13% of all the cancer cases diagnosed. Thus, with the rise in incidence rate of lung cancer, the demand for therapeutics is also expected to grow during the study period. Based on the cancer cell types, lung cancer is broadly segmented as small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC segment accounts for approximately 80 to 90% of all lung cancers. Based on the cell shape and size, NSCLC is further divided to three subtypes, they are adenocarcinoma,large-cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. These NSCLC\u2019s are primarily treated with the surgeries, at the same time chemotherapy is increasingly used for both pre-operative and post-operative treatment of the patients. The treatment options available for the NSCLC includesurgery, radiation therapy andchemotherapy. As per the American Cancer Society, it was estimated that in the United States approximately 195,000 peopleare suffering from NSCLC every year and the number of deaths from NSCLC areapproximately 135,000. The top five global brands that are commercially available in the market are Avastin, Tarceva, Alimta, Gemzar and Taxotere. Thus, all the above mentioned factors collectively drive the growth of the global lung cancer therapeutics market. Read Report Overview: www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/lung-cancer-therapeu... Increasing incidences of lung cancer due to rising smoking population is one of the major factors driving the growth of lung cancer therapeutics market. The risk of lung cancer is tenfold higher in smokers as compared to non-smokers. In addition, launch of premium priced drugs, new innovative radiation therapies coupled with rising incidences of NSCLC are the major driving factors for the growth of lung cancer therapeutics market. However, genericization of the major drugs might restrict the growth of this market. Geographically, North America and Europe dominates the global lung cancer therapeutics market. According to Lung Disease Research Funding, approximately 75,000 people in the U.S. die because of lung injury every year. The United States is the largest market for NSCLC owing to the high incidence rate, rise in aging population. In addition, with advent of new treatment therapies such as targeted drug therapy, stereotacticsare aiding patient population. Europe accounts to be the largest market after North America.While, Asia-Pacific countries such as India and China, South East Asia are the emerging regions for the global lung cancer therapeutics market due to high prevalence of this diseasecoupled with increasing healthcare awareness.

It is shown that four water surroundings all could leach hazardous materials from the Ni-Cd batteries. The water with NaCl concentration of 66.7 mg L \u22121 had the highest leaching ability, the hazardous materials were leached after only approximately 50 days (average time, with a standard deviation of 4.1), while less than 100 days were needed in the others. An electrochemical corrosion is considered to be the main leaching mechanism leading to battery breakage, while the dissolution-deposition process and the powder route result in the leakage and transference of nickel and cadmium materials from the electrodes. The anions, i.e., SO 4 2\u2212 and Cl \u2212 , and dissolved oxygen in water were demonstrated to be the vital factors that influence the leaching processes. Thus, it is proposed that spent Ni-Cd batteries must be treated properly to avoid potential danger to the environment.\n\n\nfrom #MedicinebyAlexandrosSfakianakis via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2AB29Mo\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:22.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a65cd9abb5bcfa8f2b4b33dab490e416e97b9b76", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3m4omySYwvKzXaDBo_0Ah9NbSUkJhLNfKarGpVX3JvlbQs_dGqCn.sAi5ZZ4pjj8C.YkDu3dMOwgj00R0ht7PeCRzXOHIjbdRhZQuFQMavDaiQU6kip.x9V7MaLOMSOT4p8ECNE4JB4.ym79XQDXM", "site_full": "www.motorsport.com", "site": "motorsport.com", "site_section": "http://motorsport.com//rss/all/videos", "site_categories": ["auto_racing", "sports"], "section_title": "Motorsport.com - All - Videos", "title": "Autosport Awards review & Hamilton's Instagram gaffe", "title_full": "Autosport Awards review & Hamilton's Instagram gaffe", "published": "2017-12-06T18:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn-5.motorsport.com/static/img/vmt/100000/100000/101000/101900/101955/s1_2.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6573, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a65cd9abb5bcfa8f2b4b33dab490e416e97b9b76", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3m4omySYwvKzXaDBo_0Ah9NbSUkJhLNfKarGpVX3JvlbQs_dGqCn.sAi5ZZ4pjj8C.YkDu3dMOwgj00R0ht7PeCRzXOHIjbdRhZQuFQMavDaiQU6kip.x9V7MaLOMSOT4p8ECNE4JB4.ym79XQDXM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T18:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "Autosport Awards review & Hamilton's Instagram gaffe", "text": "Autosport Awards review & Hamilton's Instagram gaffe Description Motorsport Network's Julia Piquet was on the red carpet for London's Autosport Awards this past weekend, and also takes a look at Lewis Hamilton's Instagram post that sent Formula E wild!

In a heated argument that was later migrated to Facebook, Paredes seemed to be shifting the blame of the vaccines gone rogue to the Duterte administration. \nHowever, as with other detractors, he is met with the throngs of those who are willing to defend President Rodrigo Duterte. One of them is Dr. Gary Sy, he clarified that the Dengvaxia drug was approved in 2016, and that the 2016 budget was still crafted by the previous administration, so there is no way that it should be pinned on Duterte. \n\nSome people called Paredes for being desperate and that he was being paid by the Liberal Party to do what he is doing. A lot of netizens agreed to Sy, and aired out their statements too, however, one netizen took it to Facebook to lash back at Paredes. A netizen named Carlo de Leon addressed Paredes in his post and said that it is unbelievable how Paredes thinks that the previous administration was perfect. \n\nJim Paredes, are you saying that the Duterte admin should be held accountable? Wow naman! Parang the yellows can never make a mistake noh. Always perfect, claiming a monopoly on righteousness and good governance. \n\nHe then repeated the question that is repeated being asked by the people. Why did the Aquino administration purchase the drug in the first place? Ang tanong ng bayan? Bakit binili at ginamit ng Aquino government ang Dengvaxia anti-Dengue vaccine knowing that Dengvaxia may be ineffective or may worsen Dengue symptoms for those who have not had dengue prior to vaccination. (Based on a report by WHO in April 2016, when Noynoy Aquino was still president). \n\n\nSource: Facebook , Twitter ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "duterte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim paredes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paredes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noynoy aquino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carlo de leon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gary sy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rodrigo duterte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aquino", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "liberal party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apo hiking society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "who", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "parang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dengvaxia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:22.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "55738ce8ca6aa65fb170625dd75df8b7ffbd62b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nZOCJivZzescL.JpS5yLU1ZQBoeYJpx.YWDCd3IBibkv_G_U5Fa82iyGZvZeHZPrGYb7374ala13R3TTAmMC9LZxkDZRya382HuCUBpvualpNToAXrdMWssr_wHWgjafL", "site_full": "www.theguardian.com", "site": "theguardian.com", "site_section": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/commentisfree", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Opinion | The Guardian", "title": "True stories of human suffering can change MPs\u2019 hearts.

Barnett, Mellissa Prunty, Sara Rosenblum\nBackgroundDemands for the production of legible handwriting produced in a timely manner increase as children progress through school. Despite the considerable number of children faced with handwriting difficulties, there is no quick and practical tool to assess legibility in this population.AimThe aim of this study was to develop the Handwriting Legibility Scale (HLS) and to establish the scale's reliability and validity.MethodsThe HLS is a non-language dependent scale which assesses global legibility, based on five criteria applied to samples of 'free writing'. Content validity, inter-rater reliability and internal consistency were initially examined using scripts from 20 children aged 8\u201314 years. Construct validity was established by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of data from 150 school children aged 9\u201314 years, with an additional examination of gender effects. Discriminant validity of the HLS score was examined in 29 children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) and 29 typically developing (TD) children.ResultsThe results indicated high internal consistency (\u03b1=0.92). The inter-rater reliability was acceptable but indicates the need to refine the scoring instructions. PCA of the five components revealed a one factor solution explaining 61% of the variance. In the discriminant analysis, 86.2% of the children with DCD and 89.7% of the TD children were correctly classified to their groups based on the total HLS score.ConclusionsThe overall findings suggest that the HLS may be a useful tool to identify poor handwriting legibility, with application across different languages and writing scripts.\n\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2k1PQ1U", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anna l. barnett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mellissa prunty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sara rosenblum backgrounddemands", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dcd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "principal component analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pca", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:22.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c77abf84d467a227cf3ee7e9d7da781d42696e1a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm268MFYg0_624Vcpeq2QNiN", "site_full": "www.ooyuz.com", "site": "ooyuz.com", "site_section": "http://www.ooyuz.com/newsanalysis?term=ben mcadoo", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "ben%20mcadoo News Results and Analysis |OOYUZ", "title": "Faksa's first career hat trick leads Stars to 3-0 win | National Sports | postbulletin.com", "title_full": "Faksa's first career hat trick leads Stars to 3-0 win | National Sports | postbulletin.com : Related Articles | OOYUZ", "published": "2017-11-29T06:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53324, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c77abf84d467a227cf3ee7e9d7da781d42696e1a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm268MFYg0_624Vcpeq2QNiN", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Post Bulletin", "published": "2017-11-29T06:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "Faksa's first career hat trick leads Stars to 3-0 win | National Sports | postbulletin.com", "text": "LAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 The Vegas Golden Knights were looking to make more history Tuesday night.

Huge study putting 3-D scans to the test 2017-12-07T09:00:46Z 2017-12-07T09:49:56Z (Montefiore Health System via AP). In this Nov. 21, 2017, photo provided by the Montefiore Health System, Dr. Tova Koenigsberg at The Montefiore Einstein Center for Cancer Care in New York shows an example of a traditional mammogram scan. \nBy LAURAN NEERGAARDAP Medical Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens. \n___ \nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

She has no right to use the word \u201cWe Rajputs\u201d because she is a converted Christian. Here is her tweet. She hasn\u2019t mentioned what was offered to her to change the religion and whether she is still enjoying a married life or her husband has just used her and left away. There are so many lies that it is difficult to counter them all. After all you can\u2019t Summarize Rajput Article in 2 A4 size paper. The headline itself is a big joke where she abuses the Rajput community as Non-intelligent Losers? Here is my attempt as a writer. We Rajputs do not have \u201ctales\u201d but \u201cHistory\u201d written in blood and not only by our historians but the historians of all times and genre. It is obvious that she has not taken any pain to study the Rajput Kings like Pruthviraj Chauhan, Bappa Rawal, Rana Kumbha, Sawai Jaisinh, Maharana Pratap, VanRaj Chavda, Solanki, Raa Navghan, Hamirji Gohil, Jam saaheb, Bhavsinhji, and amarsingh Rathore, Veer Durgadas Rathore to name just a few. Pruthviraj Chauhan defeated Ghori many a times and Ghori choose to bag mercy over the life punishment. Isn\u2019t Pruthviraj Chauhan\u2019s killing mohammad Chori the most brilliant and supreme Military Tecnics of Rajputs. He knew \u201cShabd-Bhedi Baan\u201d There is a famous Raga Named After Rana Kumbha because he was also a great Scholar of Samved. His kumbhal Garh fort wall is next to only great wall of China. Jaipur\u2019s Architectural Marvels are still studied by Astronomy students. Most of the forms of arts were developed, sustained and encouraged during Rajput Raj. Poet \u201cKalapi\u201d was a king of Lathi who has written a set of extra ordinary poems. The great Rajput Sati Meera Bai was born to Rajputani. Jauhar was an ultimate Military Tactic employed by Rajput Warriors. Even today Rajput \u201cPALIYA\u201d ( A stone statue in remembrance of Rajputs who laid his life while protecting the villegers, cows, and Brahmins.) are worshipped. Most of the beautiful Architectural buildings including Temples were built during Rajput Raj. Law & Order, Justice and disciplined life were the core principles for Rajput Rulers. Muslims were Successful where ever they attacked except India. There are countless victories witnessed by the historians where Rajputs took the fight to the highest level.

Barnett, Mellissa Prunty, Sara Rosenblum\nBackgroundDemands for the production of legible handwriting produced in a timely manner increase as children progress through school. Despite the considerable number of children faced with handwriting difficulties, there is no quick and practical tool to assess legibility in this population.AimThe aim of this study was to develop the Handwriting Legibility Scale (HLS) and to establish the scale's reliability and validity.MethodsThe HLS is a non-language dependent scale which assesses global legibility, based on five criteria applied to samples of 'free writing'. Content validity, inter-rater reliability and internal consistency were initially examined using scripts from 20 children aged 8\u201314 years. Construct validity was established by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of data from 150 school children aged 9\u201314 years, with an additional examination of gender effects. Discriminant validity of the HLS score was examined in 29 children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) and 29 typically developing (TD) children.ResultsThe results indicated high internal consistency (\u03b1=0.92). The inter-rater reliability was acceptable but indicates the need to refine the scoring instructions. PCA of the five components revealed a one factor solution explaining 61% of the variance. In the discriminant analysis, 86.2% of the children with DCD and 89.7% of the TD children were correctly classified to their groups based on the total HLS score.ConclusionsThe overall findings suggest that the HLS may be a useful tool to identify poor handwriting legibility, with application across different languages and writing scripts.\n\n\n\nfrom #MedicinebyAlexandrosSfakianakis via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2k1PQ1U\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anna l. barnett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mellissa prunty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sara rosenblum backgrounddemands", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dcd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "principal component analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pca", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:24.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f06711131a0bdff828caa30caae481fd0b05f8bd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2.VkTtT.s2awMV251KjBgw_ayZDyKCMbRqdmVXMpXU7G8rHb4hQyhDc6jAxBCmydTc_3HjMlWbNRdwuMpDtdJFuQ9J8KETeo-", "site_full": "flint.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://flint.craigslist.org/search/ppp?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist flint | personals search", "title": "Looking for a med *grower* - w4m", "title_full": "Looking for a med *grower* - w4m", "published": "2017-12-07T11:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f06711131a0bdff828caa30caae481fd0b05f8bd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2.VkTtT.s2awMV251KjBgw_ayZDyKCMbRqdmVXMpXU7G8rHb4hQyhDc6jAxBCmydTc_3HjMlWbNRdwuMpDtdJFuQ9J8KETeo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "Looking for a med *grower* - w4m", "text": "favorite this post Looking for a med *grower* - w4m hide this posting unhide age: 24   Eight10 what's up guys everyone calls me *Diva* and I'm 772 home all alone 1202 and want to have sum company. it's ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests post id: 6411642335", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:24.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f0dae30c3971c79036836794ffe63a942e700767", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMvsBItMpRlLelv24U4mPCZxhJS8ghqaCRmtzwKXqj.smomv7gh571w00moMtLj0qOSZAarkRzbsIA--", "site_full": "vidya-gaweshana.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://vidya-gaweshana.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0daf\u0dca\u0dba\u0dcf \u0d9c\u0dc0\u0dda\u0dc2\u0dab Exploring Science", "title": "HISTORY : \u0daf\u0dd9\u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dd2 \u0dbd\u0ddd\u0d9a \u0dba\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dca\u0db0\u0dba\u0dda \u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dab \u0da1\u0dcf\u0dba\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dd6\u0db4", "title_full": "HISTORY : \u0daf\u0dd9\u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dd2 \u0dbd\u0ddd\u0d9a \u0dba\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dca\u0db0\u0dba\u0dda \u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dab \u0da1\u0dcf\u0dba\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dd6\u0db4", "published": "2017-12-07T12:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f0dae30c3971c79036836794ffe63a942e700767", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMvsBItMpRlLelv24U4mPCZxhJS8ghqaCRmtzwKXqj.smomv7gh571w00moMtLj0qOSZAarkRzbsIA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Terence Arachchi (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "HISTORY : \u0daf\u0dd9\u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dd2 \u0dbd\u0ddd\u0d9a \u0dba\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dca\u0db0\u0dba\u0dda \u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dab \u0da1\u0dcf\u0dba\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dd6\u0db4", "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIDYA GAWESHANA - \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0daf\u0dca\u0dba\u0dcf \u0d9c\u0dc0\u0dda\u0dc2\u0dab by Terence Kahapola Arachchi is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License .

By Sunday, Houthi fighters had taken control of most of the capital, Sanaa, with intense battles going on in the city. Saudi airstrikes didn\u2019t prvent the Houthi fighters from reaching former President Saleh\u2019s own home on Monday. Shortly after this, the reports began to circulate that he had been murdered, with some versions of the story claiming he had been taken out of the vehicle he had attempted to flee in and summarily executed by Houthi fighers acting no better than Al-Qaeda fighters or jihadists. The unsettling footage circulating on the Internet and some news channels appeared to show Saleh\u2019s body \u2013 with a bullet-wound to the head \u2013 being paraded around in the open back of a truck (I preferred not to show it here, but it\u2019s here if anyone wants to see it). His murder, as has been noted elsewhere, is eerily reminiscent of the brutal murder of Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. The Gaddafi comparison arguably goes even further than just the grim manner of death. Ali Abdullah Saleh, like Gaddafi, had been leader in his country for decades. And, like Gaddafi, he was a victim of the so-called \u2018Arab Spring\u2019, which was what forced him from power a few years ago. Also like Gaddafi in Libya, Saleh was considered by all to be a master at maintaining relationships with all the various tribes in Yemen. As in Libya and a number of other Arab countries, the tribal make-up in Yemen is a delicate thing, and not just anyone can effectively deal with that system or know how to keep everything together. Saleh has been regarded as a very effective deal-maker in his relationships with Yemen\u2019s tribal interests, which is one of the reasons he was able to stay in power for so long. For many years, he was able to hold the impoverished country together, preventing tribal conflicts from erupting or spilling out of control. That Saleh was guilty of corruption isn\u2019t argued: but he was by no means the most corrupt leader in a region ruled almost exclusively by dictators or by corrupt regimes (some of them being Western-backed regimes, others not). Nevertheless, despite his decades in power, the Arab Spring protests were the beginning of his downfall. But a number of Arab commentators have argued that the fact Saleh still remained in the picture as a key player even after the Arab Spring and his dismissal is proof of how important a figure he was in Yemen: a figure with decades\u2019 worth of relationship-building and influence all across the country. That is a person it is very difficult to replace or replicate, as has been found in post-Gaddafi Libya . \nThe irony of his death is that his murderers \u2013 the Houthis (a Shia militia allegedly backed by Iran) \u2013 were the same people he had been in alliance with against the Saudis and their preferred Yemeni leader. \nUp until just a few days ago, were he to have been killed it would\u2019ve been at the hands of the Saudi-led coalition. But Saleh\u2019s apparent decision to try to enter a diplomatic solution with the Saudis and their coalition was \u2013 according to most reports \u2013 what caused the Houthis to kill him and then boast about it. While many question Saleh\u2019s decision to enter an alliance with the Houthis in the first place, it was arguably in his long-standing nature as a deal-maker who repeatedly sought alliances with different tribes or factions. He also must\u2019ve seen the Houthis as a valuable alliance in terms of fighting Al-Qaeda . According to Foreign Policy , Saleh \u2013 like Gaddafi in Libya \u2013 had been so successful at combating Al-Qaeda that \u2018Washington\u2019s priority in Yemen shifted from counter-terrorism to promoting democracy.\u2019 Washington may have therefore been complicit in Saleh\u2019s downfall during the Arab Spring, despite Saleh being an effective ally in the Bush regime\u2019s so-called War on Terror. His decision to abandon the Houthis and seek a diplomatic rapproachment with the Saudis might\u2019ve been borne out of some kind of self-interest: but it also may have simply been a case of Saleh seeing no other solution to the crisis in Yemen . With the Saudi bombing of Yemen \u2013 along with the enormous humanitarian crisis \u2013 having gone on now for over two years, Saleh, arguably, simply saw that it was time to end the devastation; and seeing the Houthis as both a lost cause and a total no-go for the Saudis, he may have seen no other choice but seeking an arrangement with the Saudis to bring about an end to all the bombing. \n\u2013 \n\u2013 Many commentators now say the Houthis\u2019 decision to murder him has effectively destroyed any possibility they had of any kind of long-term victory; as he was their only possibility for any kind of legitimacy in Yemen.

December 7, 2017 \nSOUTHERN Africa fall armyworm stakeholders have called for an increase in investment and stronger coordination and partnerships in responding to the pest. \nBY MUNESU NYAKUDYA \nThe call was made after a stakeholders\u2019 meeting held in Johannesburg last week, organised by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in collaboration with Southern African Development Community (Sadc). \nThe meeting was convened to discuss the regional fall armyworm response actions, lessons learnt, challenges and preparedness plans for the 2017/18 production season. \n\u201cGiven its adaptability and tenacious nature, many experts believe that the pest will continue building its momentum and impact on food security in the region in the coming seasons and years to come,\u201d said FAO sub-regional co-ordinator for Southern Africa, David Phiri. \u201cWe have, however, an opportunity to prevent this threat from reaching disastrous proportions by building the resilience of farmers and institutions to this pest.\u201d \nPhiri said despite efforts made so far to manage the fall armyworm infestation in the region, there were still many issues that needed to be addressed to reach the desired scale in terms of protecting the food security and livelihoods of populations at risk from the pest. \nThe meeting identified funding gaps with respect to farmer education and awareness, monitoring and surveillance, impact assessment, research, as well as rolling out of pest management options. \n\u201cThere is, therefore, an urgent need to support governments in the region with financial resources to ensure effective management of the fall armyworm in Southern Africa,\u201d said Phiri. \nRepresentatives of Sadc member States, Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, donors, development partners, farmers\u2019 organisations, academia and research organisations observed that since the fall armyworm had established itself on the continent and in the region, there was no other option than to manage it effectively and sustainably. \nMember States and stakeholders were challenged to make strong commitments by allocating more funding, developing programmes and putting in place infrastructure for the management of the fall armyworm and other emerging and re-emerging crop pests and diseases with potential to cause food insecurity in the region.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david phiri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phiri", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "southern africa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "common market for eastern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sadc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "food and agriculture organisation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:24.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "329724b342f4d6530366c38aca88bdd9eeac757b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xac92U3w.AXY3YVsX.a9_VCgcYanKrdBzIG9a2p5TKxzinLrLV0VbkFoA--", "site_full": "www.nairaland.com", "site": "nairaland.com", "site_section": "http://www.nairaland.com/phones", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Phones -
