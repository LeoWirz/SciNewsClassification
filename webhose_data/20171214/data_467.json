The interchangeable (bird) heads were a constant source of interest to other trekkers and, in one Yorkshire village pub I stayed in, the cockatoo thrust through the door to the bar as I headed to my room to get rid of my wet clothing, was a sign to the bar staff to start pouring a Theakston\u0092s Yorkshire Old Peculiar.\n131ACB2E-EACD-47AC-BAE1-BBDEC9970C33.jpg\nThe kookaburra however meant \u0093please get the bowl of pickled onions AND a Theakston ready\u0094 !\nUnfortunately, I wasn\u0092t using it on the day I fell and dislocated 2 fingers and I often wonder if it would have saved me?\nAnyway, after my 2 month trip ( flettrek | just like Startrek but with Fletts ) it was apparent that the hiking pole even without a carved bird head, could be seen as an offensive weapon to airport and airline staff and so I had to cut it in halves to fit it diagonally in my travel bag. I hadn\u0092t confessed this to Cobalt until yesterday and only told him then after I had rectified this sacrilege.\nAlso, in a couple of situations like standing in a freezing river to photograph a waterfall, I realised that the hiking pole would make a wonderful camera monopod that may dampen my shivering before it transferred to the camera, so I also took the opportunity to design and commission a camera attachment.\nA brass coupling took care of the sacrilegious pole cutting...\n0F0F2CF9-8603-40C1-996C-3770941F423C.jpeg 9085E489-B3B4-446A-9C30-7B650716E103.jpeg 90277182-3DE0-4E11-890B-D9D089533C07.jpeg\n.... and a turned delrin extension plus a bought tripod ball joint and tripod quick-release plate, provided the interchangeable monopod head...\n2B255D4E-19E1-4967-9488-A92939644DD5.jpeg ABE4A60E-D935-4A66-A95D-25C88B65D02E.jpeg 32C5E918-BD58-4AAA-A90D-B60F24F549B2.jpeg\nNow, I don\u0092t want to get a reputation for being gadget-driven but, I have gone one step further and used a mobile phone holder for bicycle handlebars to mount my mobile phone beyond halfway down the pole.

Therefore, other kinds of coercive control like psychological, emotional, religious or financial abuse are underestimated by the victims themselves. This is why the Abuse, That\u2019s Not Only\u2026 (Przemoc To Nie Tylko\u2026) initiative was launched as part of the 16 days of Action campaign. \nThere are a few cultural barriers to reporting domestic abuse in the Polish community. They may be linked to attachment to the traditional family model as well as lack of awareness and confidence in support services in the UK. \nThe traditional perception of the role of a man as a provider and head of the family, entitles him to keep the hand on the family budget. Thus, financial control is the most common form of coercive behaviour affecting Polish families. Not being able to afford a bus fare or a mobile phone can lead to the complete isolation of a woman strengthened by the loneliness of the emigration itself. The poor knowledge of English, due to the isolation and lack of opportunity to practice, influences the already low self-esteem and hinders chances to reach out for help. Magdalena Grzymkowska \nThe reason for under reporting of the domestic abuse may also lay in Polish culture where violence against women is not addressed as a mainstream policy issue. The domestic abuse is seen as the family problem and should be solved privately, which can be an additional source of shame and guilt for the victim, who failed as a wife and a mother. This effects in the poor understanding of the consequences of the domestic abuse on children and how this would affect their adult life. As Professor Karatzias from Edinburgh Napier University highlighted at the launch of 16 Days of Activism in Edinburgh on 25 November, untreated childhood trauma has a great impact on adults\u2019 mental health and influences the way they enter the relationships and undertake other destructive behaviours. \nThe results of the FRA \u2013 European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights study (March, 2014) - indicate the positive relationship between violence and abuse of alcohol by a perpetrator. Alcohol misuse is a great problem in Poland. According to the Polish Alcohol Problems Agency there are 600,000 alcoholics and 350,000 new addicts who appear in the treatment system every year. On the other hand, over three million people drink alcohol excessively. Alcohol is closely linked to development of the dysfunctional families and causing attachment issues in adult life, broadly explained as adult children of alcoholics syndrome. This problem should be highlighted and treated as a factor contributing to the use of violence against Polish women in Polish families. The adults can feel the effects of alcoholism, likewise people in violent relationships, often experienced this in childhood. In addition while many Polish victims of domestic violence admit to suffer from the syndrome of Adult Children of Alcoholics, this problem is not much recognised in the UK and there are not many therapies or support groups available. \nAnother cultural barrier is the lack of faith in the resourcefulness of the police and lack of awareness of procedures or the rights of the victim. As a result, many myths grow around this topic, for example, requesting help is tantamount to taking away children by social services or, another one, that Poles are not entitled to an interpreter. \nThe tragedy of the victims is magnified by the welfare reform and ever changing conditions around how social support is awarded. Often, women have no or little work history, and sometimes have never acquired a National Insurance Number as the result of isolation they have experience. This - unexpectedly for the EEA nationals - results in the \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d status, which significantly hinders the level of support the services are able to provide. \nRegarding all above factors, Polish workers and volunteers supporting victims of domestic abuse identify a crucial need to raise awareness about various forms of domestic abuse within the community. The effects of the education and information campaign can already be seen. Currently our Polish helpline in the UK which operates only eight hours a week, is reporting twice as many applications now compared to previous weeks. \nMagdalena Grzymkowska, is a media relations support officer for Feniks, and prepared this article with help from Magda Czarnecka", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "magdale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "feniks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karatzias", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nie tylko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "magdalena grzymkowska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "magda czarnecka", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "polish alcohol problems agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national insurance number", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tfn guest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adult children of alcoholics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edinburgh napier university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union agency", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grzymkowska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:52.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e13e6990418d1533d0f886c29222c59faa2ca20b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXJy8QueI_F_3v4zue17vIAHKkyH9DfUbT5rM4_C0_VTX836rKMwlujhJwhUJ_l5pGA9j5uZDTbtKGEjQkUzoyz7XgIdyybnVga0LBf_LtuA--", "site_full": "www.mediaupdate.co.za", "site": "mediaupdate.co.za", "site_section": "https://www.mediaupdate.co.za/feed", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "social"], "section_title": "Media Update", "title": "Youtube releases its annual Rewind list", "title_full": "Youtube releases its annual Rewind list", "published": "2017-12-07T13:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://dash.mediaupdate.co.za/story/image/143142/143142.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e13e6990418d1533d0f886c29222c59faa2ca20b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXJy8QueI_F_3v4zue17vIAHKkyH9DfUbT5rM4_C0_VTX836rKMwlujhJwhUJ_l5pGA9j5uZDTbtKGEjQkUzoyz7XgIdyybnVga0LBf_LtuA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T13:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Youtube releases its annual Rewind list", "text": "Youtube releases its annual Rewind list 7 Dec 2017 11:30 Media YouTube has released its annual Rewind, which reveals the most-watched videos for the year in South Africa and globally.

Dezember 2017 - Kaum ein anderes Getr\u00e4nk kann so viele Bed\u00fcrfnisse und Verzehrsanl\u00e4sse bedienen wie Fruchtsaft. Und so bieten sich S\u00e4fte auch beim Trendthema \"Food Pairing\" als ideale Partner an. Beim Food Pairing werden Aromen kombiniert, die zun\u00e4chst nicht vermuten lassen, dass sie gemeinsam ein harmonisches Ganzes ergeben. Fruchtsaft & Co. in Kombination mit Tonic Water oder schwarzem Tee, mit Kr\u00e4utern, Gew\u00fcrzen oder \u00d6len bieten ganz neue Geschmacksalternativen. Diese Kombinationen eigenen sich hervorragend als alkoholfreie Speisebegleiter, auch als Alternative zum klassischen Wein im Rahmen des Weihnachtsmen\u00fcs. Dabei muss man nur wissen, was wozu passt und welche Aromen miteinander harmonieren. Grunds\u00e4tzlich sind der Fantasie aber keine Grenzen gesetzt und schlu\u00dfendlich entscheidet immer der eigene Geschmack. \nFruchtsaft f\u00fcr neue Geschmackserlebnisse Fruchts\u00e4fte und -nektare k\u00f6nnen dank ihrer Sorten- und Geschmacksvielfalt ganz unterschiedliche Geschm\u00e4cker bedienen. Ob herb-s\u00e4uerlich, klar und spritzig oder samtig-s\u00fc\u00df, es gibt immer das passende Produkt. Das moderne Food Pairing geht heute \u00fcber die Berechnung von passenden Schl\u00fcsselaromen hinaus. Um die Kombinationen perfekt zu machen, kommt es auch auf Texturen, Konsistenzen und Aggregatzust\u00e4nde an. Fruchts\u00e4fte und -nektare verf\u00fcgen hier von Haus aus \u00fcber verschiedene Varianten, sei es ein klarer Kirschnektar, ein Orangensaft mit Fruchtfleisch oder ein samtiger Aprikosennektar. Ein Saft oder Nektar bietet sich auch ideal als Granita an oder sorgt \u00fcber das Fermentieren f\u00fcr ein ganz neues Geschmackserlebnis. Fermentation beruht auf dem Prinzip, dass der Pilz in einer N\u00e4hrl\u00f6sung wie Tee oder einem Aufguss liegt und von dem zugegeben Zucker lebt. Verwendet man Fruchs\u00e4fte, reduziert dies nicht nur die Menge des beizugebenden Zuckers, sondern sorgt durch die Fermentation f\u00fcr v\u00f6llig neue Geschmackserlebnisse. Es muss auch nicht immer das Getr\u00e4nk sein. Fruchts\u00e4fte begleiten das Men\u00fc auch in Dressings, Saucen oder Dips. So passen Sauerkirsche und Johannisbeere gut zu Fleisch- und Wildgerichten, w\u00e4hrend die Ananas Currys eine besondere Note verleiht und ein Orangensaft dem Salat den Frischekick gibt. \nUnsere Food Pairing-Ideen f\u00fcr Weihnachten \nRhabarber-Loorbeer-Drink 330 ml Apfelsaft naturtr\u00fcb, 330 ml Rhabarbernektar, 350 ml kochendes Wasser, 5 getrocknete Lorbeerbl\u00e4tter \nZubereitung: Lorbeerbl\u00e4tter grob brechen, mit dem kochenden Wasser aufgie\u00dfen und 15 Minuten ziehen lassen. Abseihen und den Lorbeertee abk\u00fchlen lassen. Apfelsaft, Rhabarbernektar und Lorbeertee mischen. \nPasst zu: Ein s\u00fcffiger Allrounder-Drink, der mit seiner fruchtig-herben Note zu vielen Gerichten passt! Er schmeckt zu Gem\u00fcsegerichten wie geschmortem K\u00fcrbis oder Guacamole. Er passt zu Ofenkartoffeln, Couscoussalat und Flammkuchen, harmoniert mit milden Frischk\u00e4sen, wei\u00dfem Fischfilet oder Omeletts. Er l\u00e4sst sich aber auch zu m\u00fcrbem Apfelkuchen, Waffeln oder gebackenen Apfelspalten trinken.

Business leaders warn further delays will hurt companies as they plan for the future. \nIreland\u2019s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said late Wednesday that he hopes May will submit a new offer \u201ctonight or tomorrow.\u201d Disagreements over rules governing the border between the Republic of Ireland, which is a member of the EU, and the U.K. province of Northern Ireland derailed an earlier proposal. \nExisting rules allow people and goods to pass freely between the Republic and Northern Ireland with no border checks. Ireland wants to preserve the current arrangement, which has eased tensions along the border. May is struggling to balance those demands against the concerns of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to support her government in Parliament. \nVaradkar said Wednesday that avoiding a hard border remains his \u201cabsolute red line.\u201d \n\u201cWe will not loosen our position,\u201d he told Ireland\u2019s Parliament, the Dail. \u201cWe will stay very firm.\u201d \nThe British and Irish prime ministers discussed the Brexit impasse in a phone call Wednesday, but there was no sign of an imminent breakthrough. \nMay\u2019s office said she and Varadkar are \u201cworking hard to find a specific solution to the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland,\u201d which have triggered a crisis in Britain\u2019s divorce negotiations. \nIn Brussels, the EU\u2019s executive Commission is talking with the British government to organize a visit by May by Sunday. \n\u201cWe here in the commission are still in discussions with London and the whole EU 27, notably with Dublin. So far, no white smoke,\u201d said EU Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas. \nHe rejected British media speculation that May could be given until next week to demonstrate \u201csufficient progress\u201d on the three key issues of the Brexit divorce. \n\u201cWe stand ready to receive Prime Minister May at any moment in time when they are ready,\u201d Schinas said, but warned: \u201cThis will have to have to happen this week.\u201d \n\u201cEvery day lost makes this more difficult,\u201d he said.

(NYSE: KEYS) and Ixia (Nasdaq: XXIA) today announced a definitive agreement for Keysight to acquire Ixia in an all-cash transaction totaling approximately $1.6 billion in consideration, net of cash. The Board of Directors of both companies have unanimously approved the transaction, which is anticipated to close no later than the end of October 2017 and is subject to customary closing conditions and approvals. Under the terms of the agreement, Ixia shareholders will receive $19.65 per share in cash. This represents a premium of approximately 45% to Ixia\u2019s unaffected closing stock price on December 1, 2016, the last trading day prior to media reports that Ixia was considering strategic alternatives, and a premium of approximately 38% to the Ixia\u2019s unaffected 52-week high closing stock price for the period ended December 1, 2016. \u201cThe proposed acquisition of Ixia is in direct alignment with our strategy to transform Keysight for growth and is 100% complementary to our business,\u201d said Ron Nersesian, Keysight president and CEO. \u201cThe combination creates a powerful innovation engine to fuel growth, expands our software-centric solutions and builds new opportunities through sales and technology leverage. Ixia also brings a world-class level of talent, and together, we will provide leading-edge solutions that address the fastest-growing communications and networking trends including 5G, IoT, visibility, security and application performance.\u201d The combination of Keysight and Ixia brings together two highly complementary companies to create an innovative force in leading-edge technologies that spans electronic design, device and network validation, and application and security performance. Ixia has a broad IP portfolio that encompasses network communications, visibility, application and security technologies with solutions deeply rooted in software. Additionally, Ixia\u2019s IP includes extensive networking and wireless protocols that will extend Keysight\u2019s position in wireless communications and create a unique combination of Layer 1 through 7 end-to-end solutions that address fast-growing segments of the 5G communications design and test ecosystem. \u201cWe are confident that Keysight is the ideal partner to accelerate our growth initiatives and will continue to build upon our successful 20-year history,\u201d said Bethany Mayer, Ixia president and CEO. \u201cIxia and Keysight share many of the same values including our dedication to innovation of leading-edge technologies, and commitment to operational excellence and financial discipline, which combine to create value for shareholders. We also have industry leading IP portfolios that are complementary, deep technical prowess and amazing teams. We believe that together, Ixia and Keysight have a tremendous opportunity to further strengthen our market leading positions and create unprecedented value for our customers, partners, employees and shareholders. The transaction also provides Ixia shareholders significant cash value at a substantial premium to market.\u201d Benefits of the Combination * Accelerates Keysight\u2019s Growth by Creating a Powerful Innovation Engine: Enables a unique combination of Layer 1 through 7 end-to-end solutions for assessing performance from the mobile device to the data center and the cloud. Also expands Keysight\u2019s software capabilities by adding engineering talent and software-centric solutions with a high gross-margin profile. * Enhances Scale, Expands SAM and Deepens Market Penetration: Increases Keysight\u2019s SAM by approximately $2.5 billion and establishes a strong position in fast-growing segments. The combined company will serve over 100 countries around the world, and Keysight\u2019s worldwide go-to-market strength and sales channel enables Ixia access to previously untapped non-US NEMs, particularly in Asia. * Combines Global Talent and Advances Innovation Culture: The combination brings together two world-class organizations with innovative culture and common values that will help drive strong collaboration and innovation. * Compelling Financial Profile: The combined company will have an attractive financial profile with enhanced cash flow driven by synergies, scale and improved revenue growth. * Immediately Accretive: Keysight expects the transaction to be immediately accretive to adjusted earnings with annual cost synergies of $60 million, of which $50 million is expected to be achieved within 24 months. Revenue synergies are expected to be in excess of $50 million by year three and $100 million by year five.

Instead of having to struggle with the situation, choose the Cellular Signal Booster Austin option to improve your status. The following are guidelines on factors that you should look at when choosing an entity for this work.\n\nIt is usually wiser for you to choose a company that is locally found in your state. The easier way to go about this is by asking for recommendations from you colleagues who may have had this tools installed in their homes or working areas. After finding some few names, take down their contact lists and make a call to them to schedule a meeting. Select companies that have physical addresses which you can locate.\n\nIn order for you to get the best services, select an organization that is fully licensed with a permit to provide this services to your home or working areas. The fact that you will be allowing other people to access your house should make you want to know if they are recognized contractors or not. If they lack licensed or insurance then do not consider for hiring.\n\nThe institution of your choice ought to have employees who have gone through the relevant education system, studied about installation of similar tools and know how to carry out the work. The number of years that they have been in this business will let you know if they are as good as they say. This is because companies that are known to have years of experience are well skilled.\n\nYou should choose an institution who have knowledgeable individuals working for them. The use of latest model tools should be in their fingertips. They ought to know what to do and where to get the best equipment for the installation of this tool. Companies that still rely on old technology may not be so efficient.\n\nThe next factor to look at is if the institution upholds the standard procedure for the installation of these tools. They ought to be fully aware of what is required from them. You can look into the process yourself then during the meeting, involve the representative in questions of how they will approach the process. Note whether they skip any step.\n\nYou can make your own observation on how they treat their clients when it comes to service delivery. See how their customer care works, if they are willing to answer all your question or if they easily get irritated when you ask. This is important because you need to work with an institution that has a commendable reputation hence putting your worries aside.\n\nLike all other institutions, they should have a standard estimate for their services. This includes how much they want to be paid, their most referred mode of payment and the amount of time they are willing to carry out the job. Take this opportunity to agree to terms together and even put it into a signed contract. Do not agree to take services from a company that asks for less and promises to finish the work in an unreasonable period.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nGet a summary of important things to consider when choosing a cellular signal booster Austin supplier and more information about a reliable supplier at http://www.centextelecom.com/cellular-boosters now. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cellular signal booster austin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:53.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "734c475337c37e174152c41a03fc397cd9652eb5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTALzpwbEN37AMAAxT9j72lY.Nv3UMHh.F8PxL8TNRvcd4yVsa1Y0j9aVymE7MXtko-", "site_full": "davidkitz.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://davidkitz.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "A Great Victory \u2013 I love the Psalms", "title": "A Great Victory", "title_full": "A Great Victory", "published": "2017-12-07T11:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "734c475337c37e174152c41a03fc397cd9652eb5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTALzpwbEN37AMAAxT9j72lY.Nv3UMHh.F8PxL8TNRvcd4yVsa1Y0j9aVymE7MXtko-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "davidkitz", "published": "2017-12-07T11:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "A Great Victory", "text": "Reading: Psalm 68 \nFor the director of music.

A song.\n(Verses 1-6)\nMay God arise, may his enemies be scattered;\nmay his foes flee before him.\nMay you blow them away like smoke\u2014\nas wax melts before the fire,\nmay the wicked perish before God.\nBut may the righteous be glad\nand rejoice before God;\nmay they be happy and joyful.\n|Sing to God, sing in praise of his name,\nextol him who rides on the clouds;\nrejoice before him\u2014his name is the L ORD .\nA father to the fatherless, a defender of widows,\nis God in his holy dwelling.\nGod sets the lonely in families,\nhe leads out the prisoners with singing;\nbut the rebellious live in a sun-scorched land (NIV).\nReflection\nAnyone who has read through the Book of Psalms will readily admit there is a great deal of variety from psalm to psalm. Some psalms are filled with joyous praise, while others are personal or even national laments. Some are filled with humble contrition, while others call for retribution against one\u2019s foes. Each psalm is reflective of the state the psalmist finds himself in. In this respect the psalms act as a Spirit-inspired mirror of the human condition. The highs and lows of life are reflected there.\nBlue skies of victory \u2014 photo by David Kitz Psalm 68 is a hymn of triumph\u2014national triumph. Think of it as a triumphant processional song. The enemies have been vanquished and God\u2019s army has returned victorious. May God arise, may his enemies be scattered; may his foes flee before him. \nBecause God has won the victory, His people can rejoice before Him. Sing to God, sing in praise of his name, extol him who rides on the clouds; rejoice before him\u2014his name is the L ORD . \nIn his lifetime David experienced many victories over his foes, but he did not take credit for his successes. He knew that his triumphs came from the LORD. God was his personal defender\u2014but God was and is also the defender of the fatherless and the widow.\nWe too have experienced a great victory. It was won for us on Mount Calvary. Satan and the power of sin and death were defeated there. Jesus triumphed over hell and the grave through his resurrection. Now that victory is ours by faith. Rejoice before him\u2014his name is the L ORD ! \nResponse : LORD God, I thank you for the victory Jesus won on my behalf at the cross. I praise you for your unconditional love. Help me walk triumphantly in life today because of you, Lord Jesus. Amen.\nYour Turn: Are you experiencing victory today?

In fairness, though, I think the oral sex came before the spanking this evening.\nI am beyond exhausted right now, having been awake for 24 hours straight with no nap. No. Nap. Oh, and did I mention that I may have been responsible for my flight arriving into Las Vegas with not a single bottle of champagne left for the next flight? #sorrynotsorry The gay, all-male flight attendants kept making me drink #mimosas, no doubt to keep me healthy with delicious vitamin C. I\u2019d later get vitamin C(ock) from another source as well. I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. At some point, the mimosas evolved and one of the gays had added Amaretto. Yums! The FAs and I also all learned that we are all size queens. Oh, and there was a potential PG2 on this flight\u2026super hot hillbilly from Virginia, but I was too toasted to think to hit on him. The flight only had 71 souls on board, including crew, so the coach section was practically empty\u2026an in-air tryst could have definitely been managed. And the FAs? Please\u2026they\u2019d have cleared out a few rows for their new #faghag. Were it not for all that damned champagne clouding my brain, maybe there would have been two blog updates today! Dare to dream, eh?\nPart of the reason for this #Vegas trip is that I wanted to meet one of my online friends (Hi, corky!) in person. I did. She\u2019s awesome, even if (or maybe because ) she walked on a bride\u2019s train during a photo shoot in the middle of a very public walkway. It was hilarious. The bride gave her the stink eye, but the groom didn\u2019t react. We also ran into one of the Spice Girls on the elevator. She was a bit bitchy when I complimented her jewel-encrusted fingernails (before I realized who she was), so I won\u2019t mention her name. It was scary , though, how rude she was. Right.\nI had been advised that Aria Sky Suites were not to be missed, so I took the opportunity to try one out on this trip. It started with my driver holding a sign with my name on it at the bottom of the escalator. He grabbed my bag and we walked to the limo. I don\u2019t really remember much about the ride because I was still inebriated from the steady stream of mimosas previously mentioned. Also, I was Snapchatting my experience for posterity because I was pretty sure the whole thing would be a blur. It was.\nI\u2019ll spare you the non-sexual details of my day, but it was spent having lunch and great conversation with my friend. Blah, blah, blah. Let\u2019s get to the reason you\u2019re reading my blog: you wanna hear about me getting things shoved inside of my holes. #slutholes #putitinme\nY\u2019all know that I am keen on Man Bun and that I booked a 4-hour date with him for Wednesday evening. In case I haven\u2019t mentioned it before? He. Fine. He wore the almost-sweater again. Sweet, merciful Christ. He. So. Fucking. Fine. I informed his agent that he should show up at the Sky Suites lobby. I received the text that he had arrived, but I didn\u2019t see him in the lobby. I got up and walked around to find my Man Bun (mine for the next 4 hours, that is) sitting on a bench near the elevators. Actually, he saw me before I saw him. I heard him say, \u201cHey!\u201d I turned around and was again stunned at his hotness. He gave me a hug and a kiss. I had made dinner reservations for 7:15, but first we walked over to the Sky Suites Lounge for a juice for him and a water for me.\nThen we walked over to the restaurant. The food was yummy and the conversation was not strained. You don\u2019t really care about dinner, either, do you? Fuck you. It\u2019s my blog. I had Singapore noodles and he had curry with duck and jasmine rice. We ate and talked and I stared at my hot date like a starving hyena looking at a wounded zebra. I will have you. It was just a light dinner, so as not to interfere with our shenanigans later in the evening. Our food was then wrapped up and we ventured up to the 54th floor to my lovely suite.\nWhat did we find? Housekeeping was doing the second room cleaning of the day and night service. He used the guest powder room, I checked my phone, and the housekeeper, uh, housekept. I told him at dinner about the veritable bonanza of #champagne that had been delivered to my room, courtesy of two different concierges. One was a bottle of Veuve Clicquot Brut and the larger bottle was Michelle Extra Dry. He popped the cork of the Veuve and we sat on the couch and had our after-dinner drink as the housekeeper was finishing the room. Yes, y\u2019all, I talked with him again. I happen to like talking to him and we have amusing conversations. Anyhoozles\u2026\nThe housekeeper finally left and I invited him to have a look at the bedroom and big bathroom. We went back out to the living room and finished the Veuve. As we were chatting, there was a slight pause in conversation and he looked me in the eye and, with a smile, said, \u201cLet\u2019s fuck.\u201d Yes, please! He stood up and took off the almost-sweater. I ran to pee quickly. I happen to have fallen in love with the fancy heated toilet with front and back cleaning options. It is my new BFF \u2013 a thing of beauty. By the time I got back out to the living room, he was standing there in his underwear. Christ. His body. #icanteven\nI suggested putting on music and we ended up with a reggae mix. He led me into the bedroom and sat on the corner of the bed. Man Bun pulled me close to him and took off my cashmere sweater . Then he grabbed by ass and commented on its firmness. Remember that Man Bun hasn\u2019t seen me since August and that I am now a regular gym-goer. We kissed. It was familiar, but still passionate. He bit my lip. My neck. Having pulled my right tit out of my bra, he kissed it and sucked on my nipple, even biting it. I removed the bra (fucking stupid thing has to come off over my head) and threw it across the room. He tended to my other tit as I rubbed my hands over his back and arms. This man is solid muscle. If he were an animal, he\u2019d be a great white shark\u2026just pure power.\nMan Bun stood up and moved me to the side of the bed, pushing me down. He mounted me and kissed me again. He bit my chest like an animal. I knew this was going to be a good night when he stood up and peeled my pants off of me: \u201cLift up your ass.\u201d Whoosh! They were on the floor somewhere\u2026and so was my black thong. Gone. His underwear had disappeared, too. How the hell did I miss that?? He grabbed my legs and pushed me backwards on the bed and then? The oral sex.\nA guy going down on me is not at the top of my list of things that I want to do with a guy because so few have a clue of what to do down there. My genital piercings make this area even more confusing to the average man; however, Man Bun is not the average man. Before his mouth touched me, he slapped my pussy hard a few times (\u00e0 la PG). I was not expecting that, but I liked it. He then slapped my chest. Hard. Oh, is this how we\u2019re doing things tonight, Man Bun? #ilikeitrough\nFrankly, I was surprised that he ate me out because he said he doesn\u2019t usually do that with clients. His talented mouth sampled my pink bits and he delicately worked around my jewelry as I writhed and moaned and said \u201cfuck\u201d a lot. He spit on my clit as he worked me over manually while licking and sucking on my pussy. The man has skills. I arched myself up to be certain his face was properly up in my business. (I later would taste myself on his lips\u2026I smelled myself on his goatee. Fuck, that\u2019s hot.) After a few orgasms, he moved around to position his FAT DICK (I think it grew!) above my face, making me lift my head to take him into my mouth. As I deep throated his girthy cock, he fingered me so skillfully that I squirted. While his dick was in my esophagus, I let my hands move all over his ass, though I didn\u2019t venture to his asshole. One must not do that to a man as a surprise. ( Honeytoes\u2019 extra tip : Seriously. Do not do surprise anal play. No one wins. I speak the truth.)\nI didn\u2019t want to stop sucking his cock, but he pulled out of my mouth and moved his chiseled body between my legs, hovering above me. Much to my surprise, his naked (and fat\u2026did I say fat??) cock slid into my pussy and I gasped. Fo\u2019 reals, though. I think it got bigger since I last saw him in August . I\u2019m definitely not complaining \u2014 about his girth or about the lack of a condom. His hand almost immediately slid up to my throat. Oh. Hell. Yes. #chokeme His strong arm held me down easily and his hand clenched down firmly against my throat as his cock slid into and out of my screamingly wet pussy. His other arm slapped my chest again and then pushed my left leg as far back as it could possibly go. We were grinding into one another (he wasn\u2019t just pumping in and out and in and out like many men seem to do) and he finally removed his hand from my throat. Air!\nThen he put his head close to my chest and began to bite me. \u201cI\u2019m okay with bruises,\u201d I whispered. I don\u2019t see any bruises right now, but I\u2019ll let you know if any develop. Man Bun was definitely stepping up the aggression factor this time, but we had discussed that back in August. I told him the sicker the better and that he could go crazy the next time he saw me. He remembered! (Afterward he mentioned that he was going to bring a bag of goodies \u2013 rope, toys \u2013 with him, but he wasn\u2019t sure if security would search his bag coming into the hotel as a non-guest. Remember, this is Vegas, where that crazy person shot the fuck out of a bunch of people just a few months ago\u2026People are a little antsy about items that a \u201cnormal\u201d person would think belong to a serial killer. He said he\u2019d bring some stuff next time and suggested that I bring some toys because he wants to DP me, too!)\nLooking up at this beautiful specimen of manhood as he was fucking me, I thought how lucky I am. I know that fucking me is just his job, but for a little while, I suspend reality and tell myself that he is genuinely enjoying himself.\nMan Bun expertly flipped me over and gave my bubble butt some sharp slaps. I was surprised that he had it in him\u2026I wonder what other tricks he has yet to reveal. Let me just say that his cock in my ass is not where I thought this night would take us. Thank fucking god that my new BFF, the magic toilet/pink bit cleaner, was utilized earlier. He spit on my asshole and slowly entered me. I\u2019m pretty sure that his peen is the fattest one ever in my ass. Thank goodness PG had primed me on Monday night for this!! It was not easy, but Man Bun slid all the way in and we slowly gyrated into one another. If you have been reading my blog for a bit, you probably can guess what eventually happened. Yep, I came hard from anal. Again. I guess that\u2019s my thing now, eh? Man Bun came on my ass and then promptly dismounted to get a warm towel to clean up your girl Honeytoes. #chivalryisnotdead #cumrag\nWe looked out the window of the 54th floor and watched the lights as we talked some more about sex and many other things. He kept rubbing his leg against mine. That is when he mentioned the next time we get together and his desire for a DP, as mentioned above. He\u2019s no dummy. He knows that there will be a next time. We all know it. It\u2019ll be around my birthday, so if you want to get me a present, kindly make a donation to the Man Bun Fund, Money for Sluts .\nUPDATE! Please click here and read this post for a few details I missed writing the above last night. \n\u2026and always remember: Ho is life, y\u2019all!\nSluttily yours,\nHoneytoes\n#notesfromaslut #honeytoes #hoislife", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "monty python", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michelle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "man bun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "honeytoes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christ", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "spice girls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sky suites lounge", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "veuve", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:53.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e22b12d0a9c8eb453fcd05b4781dfd75c3436de9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_C0rNnsH4cV9Uom7ecxeWFVSQyDuwmrzkXgVWJDJ73LT0ARg7QXNBU3kCwyN5q9wZTJAz2J.KbgmqknEaydZPDU5M8XehVBu0Dy3JdI0FQeWQsnYhwrsEF9yxcMiAyhiU-", "site_full": "www.thesundaily.my", "site": "thesundaily.my", "site_section": "http://www.thesundaily.my/rss/latest", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "theSundaily.my Most Recent/Updated", "title": "Siti Noor Aishah's conviction stays but gets lesser jail term", "title_full": "Siti Noor Aishah's conviction stays but gets lesser jail term", "published": "2017-12-07T08:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.thesundaily.my/sites/default/files/thesun/Catalogue/HQ260417KG0_c2546630_17127_924.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 78239, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e22b12d0a9c8eb453fcd05b4781dfd75c3436de9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_C0rNnsH4cV9Uom7ecxeWFVSQyDuwmrzkXgVWJDJ73LT0ARg7QXNBU3kCwyN5q9wZTJAz2J.KbgmqknEaydZPDU5M8XehVBu0Dy3JdI0FQeWQsnYhwrsEF9yxcMiAyhiU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "theSundaily", "published": "2017-12-07T08:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "Siti Noor Aishah's conviction stays but gets lesser jail term", "text": "Siti Noor Aishah's conviction stays but gets lesser jail term   02:59pm Last updated on 7 December 2017 - 04:35pm Print \nPUTRAJAYA : Former public university Master's student Siti Noor Aishah Atam (pix) will spend a shorter time in jail for allegedly possessing 12 books related to terrorism. \nThis follows a decision by the Court of Appeal three-man panel today, comprising Datuk Ahmadi Asnawi, Datuk Kamardin Hashim and Datuk Abdul Karim Abdul Jalil, to reduce her jail sentence from five years to three years after allowing her appeal on the sentence. \nJustice Kamardin, who delivered the court's judgement, set aside the five years' jail sentence and substituted it with a three-year jail term to run from the date of her arrest on March 23, last year. \nHe said the five years' jail term imposed by the High Court was manifestly excessive. \nThe court, however, dismissed Siti Noor Aishah's appeal on her conviction on the grounds that her appeal did not have merits. \nJustice Kamardin said the court agreed with the High Court's findings that Siti Noor Aishah's defence did not raise a reasonable doubt against the prosecution's case. \nHe said the court also found that the High Court judicial commissioner did not make any error in his findings and in his decision to convict Siti Noor Aishah on the charge which warranted the appellate's court intervention. \nThe 30-year-old Siti Noor Aishah was found guilty by the High Court in Kuala Lumpur in April this year for the possession of 12 books on Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), Islamic State (IS) and Al Qaeda (AQ) at Lot 1241, Jalan Lapangan Terbang Sura, Dungun, Terengganu at 12.25 pm on March 22, last year. \nShe was initially acquitted and discharged by the High Court without entering her defence on Sept 29, last year but on appeal by the prosecution, the appellate court on March 27, this year ordered her to enter her defence and remitted the matter back to the High Court for her to do so. \nAfter the verdict, counsel Mohd Kamaruzaman A. Wahab said he would seek his client's instruction on whether to bring the matter up to the Federal Court. \nHe said since her jail term had been reduced to three years, Siti Noor Aishah is expected to be released by early next year as she had already served a year's jail and taking into account the one-third remission on her jail sentence.

Janet Evanovich has still got it \u2013 which is probably all you need to know, really. \nThe plot?   Oh, come on! - the plot is bonkers, of course.   It involves a giant boa constrictor and the apparent appearance of zombies in Trenton, among other things. In addition, Grandma Mazur is at the top of her eccentric game, Stephanie totals several cars which are duly replaced by Ranger and she has to choose which of three staggeringly sexy men she is going to sleep with.   (Which as Lula complains, is not fair as \"I'm depending on battery-operated devices.\")   No surprises there, then, which is just fine by me, because it's very funny and very readable. \nAfter all these years and all these books, Evanovich is still coming up with great dialogue, well-painted (if somewhat implausible) characters and situations which are absurdly comic but just believable enough to make an engaging story.   It's the dry wit which really keeps me reading, though.   Little exchanges like this between Stephanie and Morelli, her cop boyfriend, for example: \"Do you have any leads on this?\" \"Not a one,\" Morelli said. \"Lula thinks it's zombies.\" \"Okay, so now I have one lead.

That should help you to identify damaged files. Be aware, that it will also identify some non-critical errors within your files, but since you will be looking to repair your files, you may as well fix them all while you are at it.\nWhen it comes time to re-encode the files, I recommend HandBrake (free for PC/Mac) or any similar software.\nIf using HandBrake, start with the Fast 1080p 30 preset and enable 'Web Optimised' and on the Video tab, enable 'Fast Decode'.

Of course, life is unpredictable, and some things can spring out from nowhere and make it almost impossible to hit your goals. But before it comes to that, how can you possibly make yourself accountable for your weight loss resolutions ? \nThe key to progression is staving off any situation, habit, or relationships that will push you back to your routine. Read on to learn more. \n1. Change Your Daily Habit \nAdding more pounds in most cases has something to do with your daily behaviors and habits. For example, if you\u2019re totally inactive or depressed, you need to do something about it. Here, your goals should not be based on weight loss results, but things you can actually do. It can be something like walking 10,000 steps a day, and this is something that tech can help you with. \n\nYou can resolve to eat a fruit or vegetable every day and drinking plenty of water. You don\u2019t need to rely on your scale to see your progress. Typically, your goal is to change your habit and embrace a lifestyle that will cut down your calorie intake. 2. Get Someone Involved \nThey say it\u2019s easier to stay focused on goals and resolutions if you share them with someone. Typically, the act of sharing binds you. It will also work well if you both share the same resolutions as you can keep track and compare each other\u2019s progress. \n\nThere are apps and smart watches that can help you compare goals and progress. Seeing the numbers and the change can give you the push you need to attain your goals. 3. Don\u2019t Have One Large Goal \nThis is the typical mistake many people make when creating their resolutions. For example, you can\u2019t lose 50 pounds in just 3 months. Instead, have smaller goals like losing a pound every week. A series of more modest goals will keep you motivated and focused. \n\nEnsure your goals are specific, measurable and realistic. Plus, you should make them fun, and you can use an incentive program to reward yourself whenever you reach the goal. Don\u2019t make too many resolutions at once; one goal at a time is the best approach. 4. Always Have a Plan \nYou can\u2019t achieve your resolutions without a plan. With your goals broken into smaller ones, it\u2019s easy to plan for them either weekly or monthly. Make a list of everything you want to accomplish and ensure your plan doesn\u2019t pressure you. \n\nYour plan should not be just about activities and measures to cut pounds. It should be about wellness through lifestyle changes . Typically, it should be all-comprehensive featuring sleep, diet, exercises, and stress-reducing activities. 5. Write Your Goals Somewhere Visible \nFor each goal, you want to accomplish, make sure you write somewhere you can see daily. This can be a sticker in your kitchen or refrigerator or a note on your bathroom mirror. Some people will also have the goal set on their laptop and mobile phone home screen. \n\nThere are also tools, such as Trello, that allow you to create a board for your goals. Whatever way you use, be sure the goals are somewhere you can see daily or weekly. This will remind you that there is something you need to do. The Takeaway! \nWith the new year just around the corner, this makes a reasonable time to start planning for your new resolutions and plans. The truth about weight loss is that it needs commitment and sacrifice. But, it doesn\u2019t need to be a torture. With a great plan and realistic goals, it\u2019s possible to end the year with satisfactory changes in your weight.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:57.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "26ef38e1c0366150aa0e2b8fac1aaa902b8b37cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pjEE7ve6gczcSml.b8dIJ4VwRv9oI4_g3", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/sp/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/sp/ - Sports - 4chan", "title": "/cric/", "title_full": "/sp/ - /cric/ - Sports - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T11:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 71, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.012, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f602e8924d25691fdf0974ecf7b2c84f64562fd4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pjEE7ve6gczcSml.b8dIJ4dKAnHIMPLqxuXI0Ya6aWAE-", "ord_in_thread": 30, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T12:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>80177941\nBased raji, transcending language, truly a cerebral guy", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:57.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c1584060f95357d495dbf6e14673ba6ed62f5b19", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOp24ERhJrvnm00wIgo4_Kv0IPHEwThICgVkcgmlNHbppZym54Npsvi142tTedDR69MXPTeRTG6VviyQeutdDxHmP3UmdXjGBj8-", "site_full": "strawbspatch.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://strawbspatch.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Strawbs Patch", "title": "Christmas Card - Distress Oxides", "title_full": "Christmas Card - Distress Oxides", "published": "2017-12-06T15:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9f8cfbac15ab2fee0e85af3e7108489254019611", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOp24ERhJrvnm00wIgo4_Kv0IPHEwThICgVkcgmlNHbppZym54Npsvi142tTedDR69MXPTeRTG6VviyQeutdDxHmfjfaIf6I9JkmMF92L9fi1g--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Heather McMahon", "published": "2017-12-07T10:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Denise, I've never seen a prettier use of stickers.

Retailers are also shifting their attention towards better shelf experience and improved store planning with the help of 3D simulation. The need to increase brand value and strengthening relationships with customers can be met with the introduction of interactive technologies such as augmented reality. Another driver is the need for better point of sales (POS) system. Major restraint for this market, especially since most SMEs are not eager to invest huge amounts of money in merchandising, is the high cost of deployment of such technologies. Other hindering factors include lack of skilled labor, privacy regulations in some regions, and lack of awareness about new technologies. 3D Retail Merchandising Software Market in Consumer Packaged Goods Sector: Segmentation The segmentation for 3D retail merchandising can be done on the basis of user engagement channels, technologies, verticals, merchandising approach and region.

However, now it is easier than ever to start an online business, so it is possible to have the best of both worlds \u2013 gaining an income and keeping up your work experience, and also being at home all day to look after your kids! \nThere are lots of home businesses that work at home moms create, from freelancing or being a virtual assistant to blogging. However one good option can also be running an ecommerce business \u2013 and this is a lot easier to set up than you might think. \nSell What You Love \n\nThe first thing to decide is what you are going to sell in your store . If you plan to make your own products, for instance homemade candles, crafts, jewelry or clothing, then work on a range of products that you can start marketing and decide on your production schedule. Another option could be to sell digital products, such as eBooks you have written or the rights to your own photography or art. \nIf you want to sell physical products you did not make yourself, then you\u2019ll need to think about a niche where you can source products you believe in and market them well. It is far easier to sell things you are passionate about, so if you have any hobbies that suggest a niche, or you have a range of toys or kids\u2019 products you think are amazing, these could all be inspirations for your store. \nCreating Your Site \n\nThere are some very good ecommerce platforms you can use to get your business up and running online without having any technical or web design skills \u2013 click here to see one example of a company who provide this service to both large and small ecommerce site owners. Of course, creating the site from the functional perspective is just part of the job. You\u2019ll also need to decide on logos and branding, and write or commission product descriptions and content \u2013 as well as have some good product images. \nOnce all this is done, though, you\u2019ll have a site you can manage through an admin area where you can update it with new products \u2013 without knowing anything about coding! \nMarketing \n\nMarketing can be one of the most time consuming things you\u2019ll need to do for your new business, however it can also be fun and you\u2019ll learn a lot as you go! Social media marketing, search engine marketing and advertising on things like Google and Facebook are probably the first things to learn about and implement. Then, as you build up a customer base you should consider applying email marketing too. \nRunning a home ecommerce business can be ideal for moms, and a really interesting venture too. It is possible to start this kind of business without a huge amount of capital too, so this is another reason it can be a good option for first time entrepreneur moms!

Photograph: Manvender Vashist/PTI Photo Sometimes, perception is bigger than reality. Ten thousand rupees per month for a child's education is not a small amount. I could not have afforded it when my children were of school-going age. But I was not a soldier and I was not martyred. And there can't be any cap on the value of sacrifice. Period. \nThere are many martyr families who send -- and would like to send -- their children to the best schools and those schools are expensive. \nThis is what they dream about and they have a right to dream big. It is indeed our privilege and honour to ensure that their dreams come true. \nI would say reduce the perks and privileges of MPs, but let there be no reduction in the money spent on the education of the children of our martyrs. Limiting the educational grant for martyrs' children is a setback -- even if they are a minuscule number -- and spreads a false perception that the government is not doing enough for them. \nSome perhaps harbour the rich man's perception that visualises martyrs' children going to government schools as if the privilege of expensive public schools is reserved for the rich, bureaucrats and politicians. This class mentality must be destroyed. Why should we think so low, so self defeatingly? \nIs that the way to think about the children of our martyrs? \nIs martyrdom a small sacrifice that we should hurt the sentiments of our brave just to save some insignificant amount of money? \nIt must go to the Modi government's credit that in acknowledgement of the unabashed hardships the jawans face, the government has more than doubled the risk and hardship allowance for soldiers posted on the Siachen glacier and hiked the same for security forces deployed on counter-insurgency operations and in Naxal-hit areas. \nThis week, it doubled the honorarium for armed forces personnel who have received gallantry awards. \nNo other government has taken such financially bold decisions for the armed forces. The Modi government has done much more than all previous governments put together for our armed forces. Our finance minister, our defence minister respect and worship the armed forces like gods. The defence ministry's assurance that the capping decision will be reviewed is welcome. \nSuch a sensitive response can occur only within this government, a government that has taken major steps to help soldiers including the approval of OROP that was kept in abeyance for four decades. In all, approximately 3,000 martyrs' children get educational support. The amount the government spends on them is in the vicinity of Rs 15 crores per annum. \nThe saving after capping financial support for each child will be about Rs 3.5 crores per annum. \nTo save this amount, allowing an incorrect perception to gain ground would be ironical. \nWe must admit there are heartbreaking stories which need care and warmth. I know of a young army officer from Dehradun who married his childhood friend. He was martyred in the line of duty in Kashmir. \nTheir son, a sweet, bright, boy, is dyslexic. He was his dad's darling and his father would speak to him every night wherever he was posted. \nWith his martyrdom, a great support was lost. When his last rites were performed in Dehradun, the then Uttarakhand chief minister sent an office assistant to lay a wreath. The city's luminaries were absent at the martyr's funeral. \nThe biggest concern that arose was the continuation of the child's education. The mother was shattered, she needed psychological counseling, and family support to take care of her child. \nThe child needed a hostel so that he could concentrate on his studies and overcome the impact of the catastrophe that had befallen his family. \nThe then army chief's wife tried to help the martyred officer's widow. Dyslexia made it difficult for the boy to get admission in a school with special educators. Not all schools have this facility. \nFinally, a school in Dehradun agreed to admit the child but his mother had to pay a large fee for this. \nThe school authorities did not show any special consideration for the martyred soldier's child. But the boy's education was possible as the government bore the entire expense. \nNow his education will be critically affected. Life for a martyr's widow is a challenge every day. Not all of them remarry. The widow lives alone, guided by her himmat (courage) . \nPeople, often, sarcastically tell a martyr's widow 'you must have got a handsome amount from the government after your husband's death in action.' \nShe has to hear such cruel remarks and wipe her tears. \nBureaucrats weighing martyrdom against money often remain oblivious to the fact that India has yet to evolve a uniform policy for grants by state governments for martyrs' families. \nIt varies from state to state. It all depends on the situation and the chief minister. Even if the salaries of armed forces personnel is reduced, millions of parents continue sending their children to become fauji s. \nSuch is the spirit of patriotism and nationalism connected to being a fauji family among the people of India. \nOn Friday, December 9, the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun, will have its passing out parade. I have seen scores of families coming to watch their beloved sons passing out of the IMA at its famous Chetwode Hall. \nWe live and die for sentiments. \nA piece of cloth in a different colour scheme is called our national flag -- we fight to our last drop of blood for it. \nIt is the sentiment of being honoured by the nation that keeps the sense of pride in the hearts of our soldiers. Let that not be diminished. \nThank you Mr Prime Minister for assuring the nation that the capping decision will be reviewed. That's the difference people love and respect you for.
