| Virgin", "text": "Are the growing number of adult carers being unfairly penalised in the workplace? \nx When we think of 'family friendly' policies, we tend to think of policies for parents of younger children. Shared parental leave, for example. Emergency leave to cover when kids are ill. Or working flexibly to cover school pick-ups. \nMore and more companies are realising that if they want to keep talented employees who also happen to be parents, they need to say yes to their flexible working requests, and think of ways to make life easier for them. \nAviva, for example, has just announced that it will offer equal amounts of paid and unpaid parental leave to employees, \"regardless of gender, sexual orientation or how they became a parent - birth, adoption or surrogacy\". And that\u2019s a good thing. \nBut when you need time off to care for an adult, employers tend to be less sympathetic. gettyimages-468839765.jpg Image credit: Getty images \nChristmas is cancelled \nA user on parenting website Mumsnet recently shared her experience of having her booked Christmas leave cancelled, to allow a colleague who is a parent to spend Christmas Day with her children. \nThe poster pointed out that she had been planning to spend the festive period with her friends and family - and that not having children doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have a family. Her post attracted more than 600 replies, many from people in the same situation. They felt discriminated against by their employers, because their responsibilities outside work didn\u2019t fit neatly into the new-parent box. \nIt\u2019s now becoming more acceptable for both mothers and fathers to take time off work to care for children. The take-up of shared parental leave, introduced in 2015, is still low, but attitudes are slowly changing. It\u2019s high time that we saw the same culture change when it comes to those who don\u2019t have children but also have caring responsibilities. Read: Are we about to see a spike in family businesses? \nAn issue for everyone \nAfter all, this issue affects a lot of people. According to Carers UK, one in five people aged 50 to 64 are carers. Women do more caring than men: one in four carers are women, and one in six are men. Women are also more likely to be 'sandwich carers' - looking after both elderly relatives and their children. And they\u2019re also the group that\u2019s most likely to give up work when caring responsibilities and work life become impossible to balance. \nAnd there are likely to be many more of them in the future. Carers UK estimates that by 2037, the country will need an extra 2.6 million carers. That\u2019s a 40 per cent rise. Without this informal army of family and friends looking after mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles and grandparents, the NHS would collapse - they provide care worth an incredible \u00a3119bn per year. \nBefore the UK general election in May 2017, the Conservatives proposed the introduction of a year\u2019s unpaid leave to enable workers to take time off to care. But little has been said about it since. In our ageing society, it\u2019s clear that employers will need to take the lead and work out how best to help those with ageing family members. gettyimages-638681851.jpg Image credit: Getty images \nPractical help \nIn practice, this might mean looking more favourably on requests for flexible working from carers. This benefits both the company and the carer: research from Carers UK and the University of Leeds suggests that offering carers flexible working can boost productivity, company image and morale. \nEmployees could signpost carers to support services, and help raise awareness of their difficulties. Caring is a stressful business, and around 625,000 people every year have problems with their mental and physical health as a result. \nMany carers feel isolated and unable to discuss their issues with their line managers. Just as they did with parental responsibilities, companies need to make caring more visible, and help carers feel valued and engaged. It needs to be just as acceptable to leave early to pick up Mum from her sheltered housing, or come in a bit late because you\u2019ve accompanied Dad to a medical appointment. \nSo let\u2019s make sure that in the future, when we say 'family friendly', we mean the whole family - and not just at Christmas, but all year round. \nThis is a guest blog and may not represent the views of Virgin.com.

ESPN FC's Craig Burley is at odds with the loads of criticism heading in PSG's direction after a loss to Bayern in the Champions League. \nParis Saint-Germain were \"stupid\" to spend an estimated \u20ac400 million in signing Neymar and Kylian Mbappe if all they will win this season is the Ligue 1 title, the French Football Federation president Noel Le Graet has said. \nPSG are currently nine points clear at the top of their domestic table and well on course to reclaim the crown they let slip to Monaco last season with their squad bolstered by the summer arrivals of Neymar from Barcelona for a \u20ac222 million fee and Mbappe, in a deal that sources told ESPN FC was worth \u20ac180m . \nTheir Champions League campaign had been plain sailing until Tuesday night's 3-1 defeat at Bayern Munich that led the club's CEO and chairman, Nasser Al Khelaifi, to order Unai Emery's men to \"wake up now.\" \nAl Khelaifi, who saw PSG's unbeaten record in all competitions come to an unexpected halt at Strasbourg last weekend, was at the heart of the club's massive summer spending spree which was sharply focused on bringing European success to the French capital. \nLe Graet told RMC that the club's owners, Qatar Sports Investments, might regret spending so much if their only return this season is domestic trophies. \n\"PSG have great players and I'm convinced that it's a lesson they will learn well,\" he said. \"We need PSG. I have often said it as a joke, but if PSG signed those players to be French champions, it's stupid. \n\"You don't need to spend so much money to win the French title. But, at the end of the day, they have still finished top of their group.\" \nIan is ESPN's French football correspondent.

We have everything to lose if we fail to join in,\u201d Najib said. \nThe prime minister went on the offensive against the opposition, deriding DAP\u2019s dynastic leadership tendencies and former prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir-led Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia\u2019s ill-managed party meetings. \n\u201cHow can you expect to govern a country if you can\u2019t even handle your party meetings,\u201d he said in a sarcastic tone. \nNajib reserved his harshest words for Dr Mahathir, labelling him as a \u201cMelayu mudah lupa\u201d when the nonagenarian crossed the line and joined hands with his arch-political rivals to form a posse bent on attacking the government. \nOn the opposition\u2019s failure to see eye-to-eye on certain issues like the Goods and Services Tax (GST), he had this to say: \u201cThe only thing consistent with them as the opposition is that they\u2019re continuously inconsistent.\u201d \nOn the economic front, Najib who is finance minister rapped the opposition over claims that Malaysia was a failed state that would soon be bankrupt. \nHe said facts and figures did not support this, highlighting the country\u2019s GDP growth of 6.2 per cent in the third quarter of 2017 \u2013 among the highest in the world \u2013 an achievement proving that the country\u2019s economic management was on track. \nHe also alluded to the current foreign reserves of RM429 billion. \nNajib tabled a report card of sorts in what he and his administration had done for the people in areas like education, as health and other people-centric initiatives like the well-received 1Malaysia People\u2019s Aid programme and the Urban Transformation Centre \u2013 a one-stop public amenities facility. \u2013 Bernama Share this", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "datuk seri najib tun razak", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "\u2013 bernama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tun dr mahathir-led parti pribumi bersatu malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "datuk seri dr ahmad zahid hamidi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "datuk seri tengku adnan tengku mansor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahathir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "najib", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khairy jamaluddin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "datuk seri hishammuddin hussein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "datuk seri dr salleh said keruak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2013 bernama share", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "umno", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umno general assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barisan nasional", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umno youth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umno youth exco", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putra world trade centre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bangladesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dewan merdeka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putrajaya", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:09.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "663b4619e46bf912d84b0d10a01dec676b9784ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTV8CHljX_EbUmoAiGc5yaSqiw35F2g1Yc23RlUuShvHnwkChWSD0ioMKJ6oH1yGWy_XOz4Ll.t7Q--", "site_full": "forum.nationstates.net", "site": "nationstates.net", "site_section": "https://forum.nationstates.net/viewforum.php?f=23", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "NationStates \u2022 View forum -

Owen Gough \nThe Zurich SME Risk Index has suggested that many of the UK\u2019s small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) may be non-compliant on the GDPR implementation deadline, largely due to a widespread lack of awareness around the Data Protection Officer (DPO) employment requirements. \nThe survey of over 1,000 SME business owners highlights that, while 85 per cent would be affected by GDPR, nearly half (44 per cent) of those are not aware that employing a DPO or satisfactory equivalent will become a regulatory obligation for many businesses dealing with large amounts of data from May 2018. \nJust one in three (34 per cent) of those surveyed currently employs a DPO or satisfactory equivalent. Current estimates from Cybersecurity Ventures highlight that by 2021 there could be 3.5 million vacant cyber security jobs due to a chronic skills shortage in the field of cyber security, suggesting that a significant number of small and medium-sized businesses in the UK may face non-compliance due to a lack of adequately trained staff. \nFines for non-compliance with the GDPR can be as high as 4 per cent of a business\u2019 global turnover, up to a maximum of approximately \u00a318 million, yet just over a quarter (28 per cent) of SME owners can currently guarantee that they could continue operating following a fine of this magnitude. \nWith almost one in ten business owners saying that they would need to close down operations following a fine of this size, it appears that the penalties handed out following GDPR implementation could see a significant number of SMEs close for business. \nPaul Tombs, head of SME proposition at Zurich, comments, \u2018Cyber security trained staff are already a rare and highly sought after commodity and business leaders should be gravely concerned about their ability to find and hire data security personnel. \n\u2018If your business requires a DPO, then investing in training current staff is probably the quickest and simplest solution given the current job market for these individuals. Stomaching the investment in training now may be hard to bear, but the repercussions for no doing so will be dire.\u2019 Further reading on GDPR fines Firms not prepared for forthcoming data protection changes  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "owen gough", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul tombs", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zurich", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:10.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b391edc7a223f2899c764c4b4ebbeb6429e153bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTZRESS6s3A0g1vZehROMXbGE08Yi.p6AfNYMx.ZxC0P1B7kHtqPrtBNjvI2mbGkJg0kIbkpDNSdA8zR4h2lS9oUW48gnnjqbcjylS8Kvjvpw--", "site_full": "www.luxurydaily.com", "site": "luxurydaily.com", "site_section": "http://www.luxurydaily.com//feed/rss/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Luxury Daily", "title": "Louis Vuitton, Herm\u00e8s most-valuable French brands: BrandZ", "title_full": "Louis Vuitton, Herm\u00e8s most-valuable French brands: BrandZ", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 62465, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b391edc7a223f2899c764c4b4ebbeb6429e153bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTZRESS6s3A0g1vZehROMXbGE08Yi.p6AfNYMx.ZxC0P1B7kHtqPrtBNjvI2mbGkJg0kIbkpDNSdA8zR4h2lS9oUW48gnnjqbcjylS8Kvjvpw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brielle Jaekel", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Louis Vuitton, Herm\u00e8s most-valuable French brands: BrandZ", "text": "Herm\u00e8s' ready-to-wear fall/winter 2017.

for medically necessary treatment -- the longest ever recorded in more than two decades of tracking, according to an annual report .\nThe Vancouver-based Fraser Institute surveyed specialist physicians to measure the time between a referral from a general practitioner and a patient\u2019s treatment.\nThe median wait time was 21.2 weeks in 2017, which is 1.2 weeks longer than the previous year. When the group first began tracking wait times in 1993, it was just 9.3 weeks.\nThe problem appears to be focused on the Atlantic provinces. New Brunswick had the longest median wait times in Canada, at 41.7 weeks, followed by Nova Scotia (37.7 weeks) and P.E.I. (32.4 weeks).\nOntario recorded the shortest wait times, at 15.6 weeks, which is a slight improvement from last year. The only other province that saw wait times reduced was Newfoundland and Labrador, which dropped to 21.5 weeks from 26 weeks.\nWaiting too long for important procedures can have serious consequences for patients, the report warns, including lost wages, pain and worsened medical outcomes.\n\u201cThe simple answer of why these wait times have increased and why nothing\u2019s really changed is because we haven\u2019t seen any significant shift in policy to address the situation,\u201d Bacchus Barua, associate director of health policy studies at the Fraser Institute, told CTV News Channel on Thursday.\nHe said other countries with universal health-care systems have been able to manage wait times more effectively by partnering with private medical facilities, among other solutions.\nBarua said wait times not only prolong illness and pain for patients, but also have an economic impact since some people are unable to work while waiting for medical care.\nThe survey also analyzed different types of procedures and found that orthopaedic surgery (41.7 weeks) and neurosurgery (32.9 weeks) had the longest times. Medical oncology had the shortest wait times, at 3.2 weeks.\nFor diagnostic procedures, the report found that this year Canadians waited about 4.1 weeks for a CT scan, 10.8 weeks for an MRI and 3.9 weeks for an ultrasound.\nMedian wait times by provinces, in weeks \nNew Brunswick: 41.7\nNova Scotia: 37.7\nP.E.I.: 32.4\nBritish Columbia: 26.6\nAlberta: 26.5\nManitoba: 24.9\nNewfoundland and Labrador: 21.5\nQuebec: 20.6\nSaskatchewan: 19.8\nOntario: 15.4\nRelated Stories Pregnant woman without doctor 'not the norm' in Nova Scotia: health minister 'It's insane': Ont. patient told she'd have to wait 4.5 years to see neurologist Is Canadian health care as great as we like to think?

It's coding and not a human being. The only way it can work is by reacting automatically to your moves and taking some advantages. That will always be the only way a computer animated AI can work, no matter who makes the game. For it to be an actual challenge for the best players, it needs to be coded that it does things very fast and certain things even unrealistically good. Against the AI, there will always be small bugs that as a human player you can \"cheat back\" with. (Puck hogging etc.)\nAlso, it's called superstar for a reason . What's the point in having a superstar level if any player that buys NHL and starts playing HUT will win it? That's why you can get those evo collectibles if you win the hardest challenges. I understand it's very annoying when the good prizes are there and just out of reach, but that's why they give out good prizes. As someone said, if no one would win then it would be a different scenario.\nIt also helps if you have played a lot against AI's, because the style is a lot different to human vs human. Even with the super-no-look-passes I'm able to read the plays ahead and position my self so that they wont get good chances with their forehands (at least with my HUT team). Sometimes I just need to wait long in my own zone but eventually I'll get the puck.\n(Like others apparently) More often than not I get the hardest challenge with one try, so it doesn't mean it cheats to make it impossible to win.

Demographica CEO, Warren Moss. You say you\u2019re business is customer-centric and that CX is a core focus, but be honest - is it really? Moss says there\u2019s no denying the power of marketing strategies to create product or service awareness. But with so many agencies focused on just this, you need a specific innovative skillset and strategic commitment to it to stand out from the crowd.\nTying in with that, one of the specific challenges for the future mentioned by marketer respondents in the ScopenAgency Scope findings was that of finding agencies that understand consumer journey. Here, Moss sheds some light on why that\u2019s so crucial and how to go about understanding the consumer journey and customer experience the right way.\nLet\u2019s start with an overview of your Scopen 2017 Agency Scope wins and the role of design thinking in any marketing strategy.\nThe category we're most proud of coming tops in was the one focused around understanding the consumer journey. Recently I've sat in a lot of 2018/2019/2020 strategy sessions with our clients and all of them, bar none, have spoken about how they are applying design thinking when it comes to their customer value propositions (CVP).\nTeam Demographica. Design thinking as a concept is totally customer centric, putting the needs of the customer front and centre when it comes to designing of the various propositions.\nThe art of anthropology and B2B communication While the advertising world is often dominated by psychology, Claire Denham-Dyson writes that she believe there are many benefits to using anthropology in B2B marketing...\nBy Claire Denham-Dyson 24 Nov 2017\nDemographica has been advocating design thinking for a few years now, so it's real validation for us that it's been recognised. When I couple this with our anthropological approach to communication, it gives us great confidence that we're on the right track as a communications partner to our clients.\nWhy is it important to understand B2B businesses in particular in the direct marketing space?\nB2B communications are fundamentally different to B2C. Some of the deeper understanding comes into play when you consider the following:\nIn B2B, purchase journeys are significantly longer and more complex, fluid and often repetitive when compared to B2C, which is often linear The B2B buyer is almost always more than one person with multiple influencers, so communication needs to cater for the buyers and the influencers, and lastly The B2B buy generally carries a much higher risk than the B2C buy.\n#AfricaMonth: Demographica's Warren Moss on the business of B2B marketing Warren Moss was the only judge from Africa in the annual BMA B2 Awards, which recognise the top performing Business to Business (B2B) marketers around the world. He shares tips for success in B2B marketing...\nBy Leigh Andrews 29 May 2017\nGiven they\u2019re the basis of any successful strategy, why are customer experience or CX and the customer journey such tricky areas to excel in?\nCustomer journeys can often be pretty generic when they are analysed with an inside-out filter from within a company. We regularly see bankers designing CVPs for their banking clients, insurance practitioners designing CVPs for their insurance clients and ICT specialists designing CVPs for their clients. When this happens, you get customer journeys that are from the point of view of the internal business and don't take into account true customer pain points, triggers and motivators.\nLightwise \u00a9 \u2013 123RF.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "warren moss", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "moss", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "scopen agency scope", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cvp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:11.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d52ddeaa8a37ed79e59658c7058b6dd93961a655", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pE2uM1A5bIC0.FB6wagk7Tmv1nFpB0G3s", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/wsg/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/wsg/ - Worksafe GIF - 4chan", "title": "Vaporwave Thread", "title_full": "/wsg/ - Vaporwave Thread - Worksafe GIF - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-04T13:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 21, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d52ddeaa8a37ed79e59658c7058b6dd93961a655", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pE2uM1A5bIC0.FB6wagk7Tmv1nFpB0G3s", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-04T13:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "Vaporwave Thread", "text": ">>2002350\nI have this in my car, banging tune for night driving.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://soundcloud.com/daveroland/i"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:11.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d52ddeaa8a37ed79e59658c7058b6dd93961a655", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pE2uM1A5bIC0.FB6wagk7Tmv1nFpB0G3s", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/wsg/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/wsg/ - Worksafe GIF - 4chan", "title": "Vaporwave Thread", "title_full": "/wsg/ - Vaporwave Thread - Worksafe GIF - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-04T13:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 21, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cc2ef5a88f9f032fae46afd982d32a439b1cf144", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pE2uM1A5bIC0.FB6wagk7Ts7mwr4Vf4FcUfHtBMcjP28-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-04T13:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "HOME - Resonance", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:11.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f34232cc04a0eb33f20d394efde29db1da71d390", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6yfh9VRxupYuTzxdovbIeSC9hy_XTfGXqjswU7alhr5ZmPYJaF0m2NaBm82RcXyUtWB_JsK4sjXorvevL4Vq0gtYbPAEFE00rg--", "site_full": "community.betfair.com", "site": "betfair.com", "site_section": "http://community.betfair.com/horse_racing", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Horse Racing Forum &gt;

Owen Gough \nA new study into England\u2019s wine industry finds it is now worth over \u00a3130 million, a symbol of the market\u2019s buoyancy. \nThis is especially good news when you consider that English winemakers had warned earlier this year that the air frost that hit the country following a warm start to 2017 had caused \u2018catastrophic\u2019 damage to buds which had bloomed earlier than usual. \nWhile the headline stats are positive, just what movement have we witnessed within England\u2019s wine market in recent times? \nJoin specialist wine insurance provider Lycetts as they document the growth of the country\u2019s wine industry: 2016 growth \nBusiness finance supermarket Funding Options have crunched the numbers and found that English independent wine producers upped their turnover to \u00a3131.9 million in 2015/16. This is a 16 per cent rise on the \u00a3113.8 million turnover which was recorded in 2014/15, as well as a considerable jump from the \u00a355.7 million recorded just five years ago (2010/11). \nLikewise, 64 per cent of new wine producers gained a wine production licence in 2016, according to figures from HM Revenue and Customs. This increase set yet another record for the English wine industry. \nFunding Options founder Conrad Ford comments, \u2018English wine is going from strength to strength.\u2019 \n\u2018The English wine industry is not only gaining traction amongst domestic consumers, but is now being ranked with wines from traditional white wine-producing countries such as France and Germany. \n\u2018Wine growers need to reduce restrictions on production and capacity to ensure consistent, sustainable growth in the long-term. The fall in the value of sterling serves to showcase exactly how producers need to be able to increase capacity to react quickly to changing market conditions.\u2019 The accolades of English wine \nToday, England\u2019s wine scene is award-winning, beating the competition from international territories that are renowned for their wine-making capabilities. \nBack in May 2017, the world\u2019s best white wine was named as Winbirri Vineyards\u2019 Bacchus 2015. It picked up the Platinum Best in Show prize at the Decanter World Wine Awards. The Norfolk-based wine saw off competition from some 17,200 other entries and received a score of 95 out of 100 by a panel of 200 experts from across the globe. \nCEO of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, Miles Beale, says, \u2018It comes as no surprise to us that an English Bacchus wine has won a major international award. Up until now, English Sparkling Wine has been grabbing most of the headlines for its outstanding quality. It was only a matter of time before an English still wine showed the world it can also compete with the best.\u2019 \nThis isn\u2019t the only award English wines have scooped over the years. In 2010, both the Camel Valley winery in Cornwall and Nyetimber in West Sussex were recognised at the 2010 International Wine Challenge \u2014 the former for its 2008 Pinot Noir Rose Brut and the latter with its 2001 Blanc de Blancs. \nAt the inaugural Independent English Wine Awards, Good Life Farm Shop was awarded Silver for its 2013 Blanc de Noirs wine. Likewise, last year East Sussex-based Sedlescombe Organic Vineyard\u2019s 2015 Regent Rose was awarded the only \u2018Top Gold\u2019 medal at the 2016 International Organic Wine Awards. The size of the English wine industry \nThe English wine industry is now bustling, as statistics from English Wine Producers have shown. According to the marketing arm of the UK\u2019s wine industry, as of 2016 there were 503 commercial vineyards and 133 wineries throughout England and Wales. In 2015, these facilities \u2014 which have a total hectarage of over 2,000 hectares under vine \u2014 collectively produced an estimated 5.06 million bottles of wine. \nThere are many vineyards and wineries across England too. There are 13 wine producing regions in Mercia, seven in East Anglia, another seven in the South West, six in the South East, five in the Thames & Chilterns area and four in Wessex. \nEnglish Wine Producers\u2019 Julia Trustram Eve says, \u2018If you compare us as a wine-producing nation to most other regions in the world, we\u2019re miniscule. But if you look at our rate of growth, we\u2019ve more than doubled our hectarage in the last 10 years.\u2019 \nMany different types of wine are now produced in England and Wales. This is made up of approximately 66 per cent sparkling wine, 24 per cent still white wine and the remaining ten per cent red or ros\u00e9 wine. Further variety is seen when looking at the top ten grape varieties planted, which is based on 1,532 hectares of vineyards analysed: Chardonnay, which made up 23.06 per cent of production; a total area in commercial production of 353.37 hectares. Pinot Noir, which made up 22.01 per cent of production; a total area in commercial production of 323.14 hectares. Bacchus, which made up 8.39 per cent of production; a total area in commercial production of 128.52 hectares. Seyval, which made up 5.76 per cent of production; a total area in commercial production of 88.31 hectares. Pinot Meunier, which made up five per cent of production; a total area in commercial production of 76.65 hectares. Reichensteiner, which made up 4.72 per cent of production; a total area in commercial production of 72.35 hectares. Rondo, which made up 3.15 per cent of production; a total area in commercial production of 48.24 hectares. Muller Thurgau, which made up three per cent of production across a total area in commercial production of 45.94 hectares. Madeleine Angevine, which made up 2.57 per cent of production across a total area in commercial production of 39.34 hectares. Ortega, which made up 2.32 per cent of production across a total area in commercial production of 35.48 hectares. \nOn top of the above, it is also claimed by English Wine Producers that a million vines are to be planted in England and Wales in 2017 \u2014 the largest planting achieved in a single year. Changes to England\u2019s wine scene \nA major change is planned that will move England\u2019s wine scene forward on both a domestic and international scale. England\u2019s wine industry was recently voted for by both The United Kingdom Vineyards Association (UKVA) and English Wine Producers (EWP) for the two bodies to be merged into one single-industry representative body. Named UK Wine Producers (UKWP), this organisation will now be tasked with promoting, representing and supporting every wine producer and vineyard found across the UK. \nHattingley Valley owner Simon Robinson has been named as chair of the UKWP and said to Horticulture Week, \u2018We can now speak with a single voice, and can consult with a single membership, making it clearer to government what the industry thinks. \n\u2018The big issue now for us is Brexit. We want assurances that there will be no constraints on planting. In large parts of Europe, you can\u2019t plant a new vineyard unless you take one out. We aren\u2019t scouting for government support for production but would like support for sales and marketing, especially overseas, as other wine-producing countries do.\u2019 Further reading on wine Having a website still elusive for nearly one third of small businesses  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lycetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miles beale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julia trustram eve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ortega", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muller thurgau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "owen gough", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madeleine angevine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rondo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simon robinson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conrad ford", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "customs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukwp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "platinum best", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spirit trade association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wessex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pinot noir rose brut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "winbirri vineyards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "good life farm shop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom vineyards association", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hattingley valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cornwall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east anglia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mercia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west sussex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "camel valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south west", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:11.032+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "92677705782e553dac48c832f5fd8f613a63b5c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKxsceO7b9AYhCgxMcxRmCPQDaJJe6YtL8Gqmj2ETSzXBAEQa0hN6v.COD3dpmkVvrwHwnTdObiy9o2O4lId7O6YWLFCi3kZ7mRzJ0b.aqm7jg--", "site_full": "payingsomeonetodoyouressay.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://payingsomeonetodoyouressay.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "paying someone to do your essay", "title": "'How to find Happiness'", "title_full": "'How to find Happiness'", "published": "2017-12-07T12:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "92677705782e553dac48c832f5fd8f613a63b5c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKxsceO7b9AYhCgxMcxRmCPQDaJJe6YtL8Gqmj2ETSzXBAEQa0hN6v.COD3dpmkVvrwHwnTdObiy9o2O4lId7O6YWLFCi3kZ7mRzJ0b.aqm7jg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Taylor Ward (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "'How to find Happiness'", "text": "' merriment, kindred sombreness and anxiety, is genuinely ofttimes a versed condition.

By Jeff Stein The Washington Post  41 a.m.Updated: December 7, 2017 at 3:42 a.m. Credit: AP/ANDREW HARNIK House Speaker Paul Ryan poses for a picture with Ridley Brandmayr of Bozeman, Mont., before the lighting of the Capitol Christmas tree Wednesday evening on Capitol Hill. \nWASHINGTON -- House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Wednesday that congressional Republicans will aim next year to reduce spending on both federal health care and anti-poverty programs, citing the need to reduce America's deficit. \n\"We're going to have to get back next year at entitlement reform, which is how you tackle the debt and the deficit,\" Ryan said during an appearance on Ross Kaminsky's talk radio show. \"... Frankly, it's the health care entitlements that are the big drivers of our debt, so we spend more time on the health care entitlements -- because that's really where the problem lies, fiscally speaking.\" \nRyan said he believes he has begun convincing President Donald Trump in their private conversations about the need to rein in Medicare, the federal health program that primarily insures the elderly. As a candidate, Trump vowed not to cut spending on Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. \nRyan also suggested congressional Republicans were unlikely to try changing Social Security because the rules of the Senate forbid changes to the program through reconciliation, the procedure the Senate can use to pass legislation with only 50 votes. \n\"I think the president is understanding that choice and competition works everywhere in health care, especially in Medicare,\" Ryan said. \"... This has been my big thing for many, many years. I think it's the biggest entitlement we've got to reform.\" \nRyan's remarks add to the growing signs that top Republicans aim to cut government spending next year. Republicans are close to passing a tax bill nonpartisan analysts say would increase the deficit by at least $1 trillion over a decade. Trump recently called on Congress to move to cut welfare spending after the tax bill, and Senate Republicans have cited the need to reduce the national deficit while growing the economy. \n\"You also have to bring spending under control. And not discretionary spending. That isn't the driver of our debt. The driver of our debt is the structure of Social Security and Medicare for future beneficiaries,\" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said last week. \nWhile whipping votes for the tax bill, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, attacked \"liberal programs\" for the poor and said Congress needed to stop wasting Americans' money. \n\"We're spending ourselves into bankruptcy,\" Hatch said. \"Now, let's just be honest about it: We're in trouble. This country is in deep debt. You don't help the poor by not solving the problems of debt, and you don't help the poor by continually pushing more and more liberal programs through.\" \nTrump has not clarified which specific programs would be affected by the proposed \"welfare reform,\" though congressional Republicans are signaling that they aim to impose work requirements on food stamps and direct cash assistance for the poor. \n\"We have a welfare system that's trapping people in poverty and effectively paying people not to work,\" Ryan told Kaminsky on Wednesday. \"We've got to work on that.\" \nLiberals have alleged that the GOP will use higher deficits -- in part caused by their tax bill -- as a pretext to accomplish the long-held conservative policy objective of cutting government health care and social-service spending, which the left believes would hit the poor the hardest. \n\"What's coming next is all too predictable: The deficit hawks will come flying back after this bill becomes law,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, during a speech on the tax debate. \"Republicans are already saying entitlement reform and welfare reform are next up on the docket. But nobody should be fooled -- that's just code for attacks on Medicaid, on Medicare, on Social Security, on anti-hunger programs.\" \nA Section on 12/07/2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff stein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaminsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ron wyden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ridley brandmayr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bozeman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marco rubio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orrin hatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ross kaminsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate finance committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "finance committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap/andrew harnik house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-fla.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mont.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-wis.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-ore.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-utah", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:14.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3c216b53b9602aa6e175b8db0acf5ebbc4668ed1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.rZxEMSci6mQbElRh1OAqI5f9vsssiCtxpmuCmrM6.xmRqOihBvflPGdLj3uP8ENJltyWXDXpmuGf6EoJG1GQZknWthWQZONjvOFKkBF674GqGZ.r3n9v6", "site_full": "www.stockhouse.com", "site": "stockhouse.com", "site_section": "http://www.stockhouse.com/companies/bullboard/t.ker/armistice-resources-corp", "site_categories": ["religion", "sports", "football", "catholicism"], "section_title": "KERR MINES INC ( T.KER ) stock message board and forum - Bullboard Discussion - Stockhouse Community ", "title": "KERR MINES INC ( T.KER ) stock message board and forum - Bullboard Discussion - Stockhouse Community", "title_full": "KERR MINES INC ( T.KER ) stock message board and forum - Bullboard Discussion - Stockhouse Community", "published": "2017-12-05T18:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.035, "main_image": "http://www.stockhouse.com/stockhouse/images/stockhouse-logo-og.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 21479, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3c216b53b9602aa6e175b8db0acf5ebbc4668ed1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.rZxEMSci6mQbElRh1OAqI5f9vsssiCtxpmuCmrM6.xmRqOihBvflPGdLj3uP8ENJltyWXDXpmuGf6EoJG1GQZknWthWQZONjvOFKkBF674GqGZ.r3n9v6", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "wictor11", "published": "2017-12-05T18:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "KERR MINES INC ( T.KER ) stock message board and forum - Bullboard Discussion - Stockhouse Community", "text": "RE:Keep it coming Marty nice grades, how big is their drill program and when is it complete?

Hosts looked bit more concrete in the first halftime and took the lead just before the halftime whistle with a goal from N\u2019Koulou, but the visitors replied with bigger fighting spirit in second. \nOverall, second halftime was much more attractive and more open from both ends, with the players from Bergamo having more dangerous situations, but only managed to level up the result in 54th minute via Ilicic, risking less and less as the time progressed. The side is now at tenth position, having six points less than Europa League placed Sampdoria but overall giving pretty decent impression so far. Some rotation is possible, but not a lot since the team has their next game only one Monday away to Genoa. \nMidfielder De Roon (13/0) is doubtful for this one, while some rotation is expected. \nLyon, on the other side, come from important three pointer taken away from home against Caen on Sunday afternoon, as the team now remained in second position together with Monaco and Marseille, surely looking to continue with victories in domestic league since only second position grant direct placement to Champions League for the next season. \nOn the other side, PSG already has nine points more than them and the title race is probably already over \u2013 still their game away to Caen was anything but an easy one, as they managed to get the double lead via goals from Cornet in 10th and Diaz in 54th minute, with the home team being better in repetition but only managing to reduce the deficit with a goal from Santini in 90th minute, in a game that could have ended way differently on some other day. They visit Amiens on Sunday afternoon and some rotation is likely for this one. \nGuests will miss defender Morel (13/0), but also midfielder Grenier (1/0) and forward Traore (13/3). Last six matches of Lyon away from home have finished with over 2.5 goals. \nThis game will decide the winner of this group, while both teams have secured the progress into the knockout phase anyway. Since they both tend to play open and firstly looking to score, that will be my first betting option as well \u2013 both teams scoring and over goals in overall, I hope, a bit more relaxed atmosphere from both teams.
