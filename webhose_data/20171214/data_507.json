NZ Herald Share on Reddit reddit Australian online retailer Catch Group is relaunching Pumpkin Patch. Catch Group purchased the brand and its intellectual property, including its customer database, product designs and trademarks, for an amount understood to be about A$2 million ($2.2m), from receivers. In March the Herald reported that Catch Group was designing a new Pumpkin Patch range that would be sold online in New Zealand and Australia. A limited-edition collection is going on sale for the Summer before a complete range in released early next year. Advertisement Catch Group chief executive Nati Harpaz said: \"We are really excited to be relaunching this iconic and much loved brand. We can't wait to hear what the Pumpkin Patch fans think.\" Pumpkin Patch, which was founded in 1990, went into receivership in October last year owing about $76m. Receivers from the firm KordaMentha tried to sell the business as a going concern but had no option but to liquidate after it received no serious expressions of interest. All 160 Pumpkin Patch stores were closed, with roughly 1400 staff let go.

Name a tick and dr Nkululeko Nyangiwe of Stutterheim in the Eastern Cape will probably be able to tell you where in South Africa you will find it, and in what type of vegetation. In the past five years alone, he has painstakingly collected more than 8 000 ticks from cattle on 80 farms across South Africa. \nSince 2012, he has worked part-time on his doctorate in Entomology about the distribution and ecology of ticks that are of economic importance to cattle farmers in South Africa and Namibia, and especially also in the Eastern Cape. Dr Nyangiwe is one of 15 students of the Faculty of AgriSciences at Stellenbosch University who will receive their PhD degrees on 6 December during the institution\u2019s graduation week. \nAlthough dr Nyangiwe didn\u2019t have the luxury of dedicating his attention 100% to his studies, he says it did help that issues related to ticks and tick-borne diseases are also part of his day job. This production scientist at the D\u00f6hne Agricultural Development Institute in Stutterheim regularly conducts research trials, often with the health of livestock in mind. \nHard work recognised \nHis diligence has paid off. In September 2017 he received the Bronze Medal from the South African Society of Animal Science (SASAS) at the annual congress held in Port Elizabeth for the meritorious PhD study. In the same month, he presented some of his work on the range expansion of the economically important Asiatic blue tick ( Rhipicephalus microplus ) at the 3 rd International Congress on Parasites of Wildlife held in the Kruger National Park. \nNkululeko says it all started with small-scale studies that he conducted along with colleagues on the ecology and distribution of tick species in the Eastern Cape. \u201cThis led to the development of a much larger study that included localities with different agro-ecological zones, including aspects of animal management practices as well as veld management,\u201d he remembers. \nMajor research findings \nOne of his first significant findings was that the alien pantropical blue tick ( Rhipicephalus microplus) , a parasite that originated in Asia has spread to Namibia. It probably piggybacked on livestock imported to South Africa. The tick is linked to tick fever (babesiosis), and gall sickness (anaplasmosis) in cattle. \nIn his latest paper, published in the Journal of the South African Veterinary Association, he sets out how this tick has slowly but surely expanded its range across South Africa. It was previously thought to occur only in the northern and eastern parts of the country. Nyangiwe\u2019s studies have shown that the pantropical blue tick is now also present throughout the coastal region of the Eastern Cape, as well as the north-eastern region of the Northern Cape. One record was made for the Free State. In the Western Cape, it was found on animals from farms near Wellington, Stellenbosch and Kuilsriver. Many of these animals are part of breeding stocks that are regularly transported to and from the northern grassland and savanna regions of South Africa. \nThis recent finding means that the pantropical blue tick is now also comfortable in the Albany Thicket vegetation of the Eastern Cape, in the bushveld of the Northern Cape and isolated patches of fynbos in the Western Cape. \n\u201cIt is possible that the establishment of the Asiatic blue tick in vulnerable environments will result in higher disease incidence and tick-related deaths,\u201d he says. \u201cSeveral babesiosis-related deaths have already been recorded among vulnerable cattle that have not previously been exposed to this tick species.\u201d \n\u201cTicks and tick-borne diseases have a significant impact on the health of domestic animals worldwide. It is difficult to estimate, but ticks and tick-borne diseases could cost the industry between US$14 and US$19 billion.\u201d He explains the practical implications of his mapping exercise, and the role it plays in the provision of veterinary services. \u201cIf one is able to map where certain tick species occur, government and farmers are better able to coordinate control strategies.\u201d \n\u201cThe observed range changes may be facilitated by the combined effects of environmental adaptability by the tick and the movement of host animals,\u201d he says. \u201cTicks that used to be found only in colder regions are now also found in warmer locations, and vice versa.\u201d -Press release Related Posts", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nkululeko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elizabeth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyangiwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nkululeko nyangiwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stutterheim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eastern cape", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d\u00f6hne agricultural development institute in stutterheim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stellenbosch university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "veterinary association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international congress", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eastern cape", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern cape", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "namibia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stellenbosch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuilsriver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kruger national park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western cape", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wellington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:46.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a899fa54d445ad1202080585e556dc1b54b7a373", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRzlB.3lY..G7UaluR_p7DYryiLI_WTh.mvMxTItiqcKQjbwyUwVNOugRfcS8W.BSn4uGHkxqKSkVw4WDcnpTECHkxxd5MCl.sVnVO.V2D9bTEVsH4EBhBB", "site_full": "forums.opera.com", "site": "opera.com", "site_section": "https://forums.opera.com/category/5/opera-for-computers", "site_categories": ["bodybuilding", "sports"], "section_title": "Opera for computers | Opera forums", "title": "Dialog box disappears before I can tick relevant boxes", "title_full": "Dialog box disappears before I can tick relevant boxes | Opera forums", "published": "2017-12-07T14:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "EU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5f380b93652a28c8b3354faf1b7cd0c4?size=192&d=mm", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3197, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a899fa54d445ad1202080585e556dc1b54b7a373", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRzlB.3lY..G7UaluR_p7DYryiLI_WTh.mvMxTItiqcKQjbwyUwVNOugRfcS8W.BSn4uGHkxqKSkVw4WDcnpTECHkxxd5MCl.sVnVO.V2D9bTEVsH4EBhBB", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kalandaka", "published": "2017-12-07T14:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "Dialog box disappears before I can tick relevant boxes", "text": "Using DevonThinks Clip feature via the extension function in OperaBeta 50.0.

Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box - although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action. \n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" \nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. \nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way.

Naturally, this was exactly what colourful agitator and former senior editor for Breitbart News Milo Yiannopolous wanted: outrage, insensible anger, and heady adoration. Without any of these, he would vanish, a figure charged on a narcissism that would otherwise vanquish him. Left alone, and the shallowness would be overwhelming. \nHis visit to Australia triggered the usual fanfare over the credentials of controversy. Australian authorities tend to prefer their visitors to be of a milder sort, but Milo has touched a vein. He has shown himself, rather artificially, to be radical, contrarian, different. He is Right wing impulse made chic; prejudice made glamorous. \nMilo has also managed to marry a few curious themes that grate with the traditional left: he is flamboyant, gay and totally uninhibited, even if all of these seem forced. He, in fact, inhabits a confused being, a soul that sells anger while also charming establishment outlets. By his own admission, he can change, evolve, adapt. \nMichael Brull, writing for New Matilda , remarks pertinently that Yiannopoulous has been given expansive exposure on media outlets across Australia, more out of curiosity than anything else. The Murdoch Press, through The Australian , has offered him opinion space to tease and vent; Channel 7 has fawned and praised; and the Kyle and Jackie O show floated with his waves. \nHis Melbourne show itself resonated with customary fleshiness and garish distraction. Models were in ready supply, given the sponsorship provided by Penthouse. Preliminary photo shoots involved a gathering of up to 100 supporters. Then came the smoke, lights and music, the projected messiah, champagne glass in hand, gracing the stage. Other performances also supplied a private dinner option, if you dared. \nThe performances have wooed those present. Reservations evaporate. This is the impression from a far from critical Luke Kinsella : \u201cMilo is so unyielding, captivating and charismatic; it\u2019s easy to understand why a cult of followers has developed around him. He uses humour to make his point, and humiliate his opponents.\u201d \nBrull\u2019s uses a comparison that gives pause for thought. Gideon Levy, a progressive Israeli scribe not keen to play to the halls of lukewarm acceptance, is also on tour in Australia. He has garnered a relatively poor harvest in fielding reviews and interviews, including an aggressive session on Lateline . \u201cCertainly, no-one invited him on commercial television.\u201d Those \u201crare occasions\u201d which see leftists appear on television require the sort of balance that sees them drowned \u201cout with conventional wisdom.\u201d \nThe Melbourne event on Monday duly became rowdy, a process that made the police work for their brief. Hundreds from the Campaign Against Racism and Fascism squared off against the True Blue Crew. Two arrests, one from each side, were duly made. \nA battle of accounts began to circulate: who agitated whom? Avi Yemini , a self-proclaimed \u201cOzraeli\u201d and former Israeli soldier, insisted that there was \u201ca small group of pro-Milo supporters. People who are standing up for freedom of speech. People who are proudly announcing that they are Aussies. You don\u2019t have to agree with all their different schtick.\u201d \nYemini describes a scene of aggressive chaos, a kaleidoscope of \u201cMuslim women in burkas\u201d, \u201cAntifa with their face coverings\u201d, the enthusiastic sporting of middle fingers with calls of being a Nazi. There were flashbacks: \u201cI felt like I was in the Middle East on the Gaza Strip again where they were throwing rocks at the police.\u201d \nForces of occupation are hardly going to engender support, though Yemini\u2019s sentiment does point to the unnecessary attention given to Yiannopoulous. That he has generated that much incendiary interest from so-called members of progressive groups suggest the unfortunate mirroring of tribal anger, the great trap of incarnating an image he attacks. \nIf the streets are supposedly awash with the prospect of Islamic terror, best not try to please Milo by donning Islamic outfits and throwing rocks at police and rival supporters. This is music to the reactionary Yiannopolous machine showing, to a certain degree, Australia\u2019s troubled relationship with the rigorous engagement of free speech. \nThe political and sometimes legal response has tended to be the executive action of immaturity. Even Milo is onto this, suggesting that the country, suffering \u201ca deeper malaise in the state\u201d has \u201ca serious problem with free speech.\u201d \nYiannopolous promoter Damien Costas puts on a face that barely conceals the glee generated by the promise of violence. It is meant to be affirming: the left populated by blood thirsty loons keen to shut off avenues for discussion on the right. \u201cThere have been many death threats targeted at Milo, myself and others in the team.\u201d \nThe politics of Milo is the politics of anger speared with humour (not always of the ha-ha variety), but even more than that it entails the show of a pantomime driven poseur. He draws his detractors in, and mocks them for slipping up. It is school boy debating tempered by occasional evidence marked by a fashion statement. \nThe most pronounced effort at erasing influence would be to ignore him, allowing the fruit, in time, to fall into ecological oblivion. Much suggests that this will not happen \u2013 neither forces of the political spectrum will permit that to happen. Instead, the Milo show saw the need for a police presence at his Melbourne event to the tune of $50,000. The cost, perhaps, of aggressive free speech, whatever the substance. \nMore articles by: Binoy Kampmark Binoy Kampmark was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College, Cambridge.

Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box - although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action. \n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" \nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. \nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" \nTrump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \n\"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\"  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "catherine luceyassociat", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron david miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilan goldenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill galston", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east security program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faith and freedom coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:47.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "70051a9df0190a2a1457180fcb9f99b720fae8e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZn.VMxS0BTnzz91VQKBA6Xh", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/int/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/int/ - International - 4chan", "title": "/balk/ - Balkan Thread", "title_full": "/int/ - /balk/ - Balkan Thread - International - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T06:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 30, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3826a22e36085ccd76b0c87b97721d7cd1e39069", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZn.VMxS0BTnz.eEbuH5OwOcUWLb0lEouL0-", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T12:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Ku Jeni balk", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:47.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c8235ce5bc5978588f9ada1db17867ce63468f9c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSzHN3ayyqN_B80XcdQ8fjUEbih62WuhimFKnoBieMGenLPB8KkWg.RR.D7cQ8pMMmWvWnl6HVREx4UPA_iBMoF", "site_full": "phantompilots.com", "site": "phantompilots.com", "site_section": "https://phantompilots.com/forums/phantom-4-discussion.107/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Phantom 4 Discussion | DJI Phantom Drone Forum", "title": "32 Channel Hack working? | Page 2", "title_full": "32 Channel Hack working? | Page 2 | DJI Phantom Drone Forum", "published": "2017-11-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://phantompilots.com/styles/drift/xenforo/avatars/avatar_male_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 42906, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "653ea1d238a055b9e47d437e23ee69cd6ac45152", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSzHN3ayyqN_B80XcdQ8fjUEbih62WuhimFKnoBieMGenLPB8KkWg.RR.D7cQ8pMMmWvWnl6HVRE7_SvryQOH7i.QO829e7zBc-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "John Locke", "published": "2017-12-07T20:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Jeff said: \u2191 Does the Hack work with the Litichi App?

There are two bearish trend lines forming with resistance at $428 and $442 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via SimpleFX). The pair might correct towards $440-442 in the near term, but could face sellers. \nEthereum price declined sharply against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. ETH/USD moved towards the $410-400 levels and is currently correcting higher. Ethereum Price Decline \nThere was no major recovery in ETH price above the $460 level against the US Dollar. The price came under renewed selling pressure and traded below the $430 and $425 support levels. It almost tested the $400 handle and traded as low as $408.80. At the moment, the price is correcting higher towards $430. It has moved above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $460.54 high to $408.80. \nOn the upside, there are many resistances such as $440 and $460. There are also two bearish trend lines forming with resistance at $428 and $442 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The first trend line is near the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $460.54 high to $408.80. However, the most important resistance is around the $440 level and the second trend line. The 100 hourly simple moving average is also near $450 to act as a resistance. \nAn intermediate resistance is around the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $460.54 high to $408.80 at $435. Therefore, any major upsides are likely to be capped by the $440 level. On the downside, the recent low of $408 is a decent support. The most important support is near $400-395 where there can be strong bids. \nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD is placed well in the bearish zone. \nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI is moving higher towards the 40 level, but it is well below the 50 level. \nMajor Support Level \u2013 $408 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ethereum price technical analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "http://goo.gl/hazdli pages ethereum price technical analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:48.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aa5e53f6f84235bfd96878943b63e27437017add", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8xMR_zqDhVU24R8Gr303y2eFJY60f.Y2pF3PP4iMG4ulMYhf9WIK2YxcMxBpsWBktxbouYTFDnPjMrOl5XPhkzBa2hf.bErCgpuRc3hvKi9lipZNiUPVIIpS93k3NFjFYoiR1WW80UlHSGbmgs0CorxR7OhHbAgP8ApUHKSQivY2iS4FdbqRDNLh24ncsNvcuLhSPMKxDv_CKXhFLWkHcvQ7m_.swH_5qqyCip46kxJIvjkPYS1KYHnaL1_lYmO1rsxTjHGAZG3zwYwePEi3.4zUh5_7L4X.BcVY9Weq6zaQ--", "site_full": "www.juxtapost.com", "site": "juxtapost.com", "site_section": "http://www.juxtapost.com/feed/id/global", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Juxtapost - Recent Post Feed", "title": "Here's something you don't see everyday.

I was wondering how sometimes it direct plays with playing DTS and not others and also sometimes it plays Atmos via direct play and other times it doesnt until i looked at the file in MKVToolNix and noticed that although plex shows the default audio track with the logo, it still has an AC3 audio track in it which is the reason it has still been able to direct play.\nSo I was either stripping out the high quality tracks leaving only the AC3 or i was using ffmpeg to convert whatever audio format was there to AC3. All is great, the videos now play fine, however the audio is pretty bad quality. My AC3 videos converted through ffmpeg all converted to the max bitrate (640) but still isnt great to say the least so i thought well my soundbar supports DTS so ill use that instead. So I fire up a movie I have in DTS and guess what its transcoding?!?!\nso My question is, my manual says it supports DTS 2.0 yet its transcoding? is this somehow due to my soundbar only playing back in DTS 2.0 whereas regular DTS is 5.1 (if that is even the case)???? ive also read that the TV has to be turned on to DTS only when the movie starts playing but i dont see the option to do that (its greyed out)\nAlso, does anyone know of a way to mux video files to DTS from whatever format their in? ffmpeg seemed to be able to convert anything you throw at it to AC3 but cant find a similar program to do it for DTS?\nThanks.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://downloadcenter.samsung.com/content/UM/201709/20170906112008884/HW-MS650-651_XU-FULL_170828.pdf"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:49.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f85ea9796a8e6f6be73a5e87daa63018a0c523e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyje0PKxJXngNtvYolSL63WiAXsIQDVdUqcBWwUklnjll18EH6S9bj_SMd0lv2Qrl_mGBWXuh3CbKR72rGM.ZyXQjl0O4i7HqZHZgl5smRdgraGHNwTe6ztvSl4yp7iIdBtr0RnHIfggZJFwVRgJcM0ReucGzbDUGEhlFD81CnojnjnuAeW1zLt", "site_full": "peopletoday24.com", "site": "peopletoday24.com", "site_section": "http://peopletoday24.com/page/2/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "People Today 24 \u2013 Page 2", "title": "Disposable Protective Apparel \u2013 Lakeland Industries, Enviro Safety Products, Medline Industries", "title_full": "Global Disposable Protective Apparel Market 2017 \u2013 Lakeland Industries, Enviro Safety Products, Medline Industries \u2013 People Today 24", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f85ea9796a8e6f6be73a5e87daa63018a0c523e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyje0PKxJXngNtvYolSL63WiAXsIQDVdUqcBWwUklnjll18EH6S9bj_SMd0lv2Qrl_mGBWXuh3CbKR72rGM.ZyXQjl0O4i7HqZHZgl5smRdgraGHNwTe6ztvSl4yp7iIdBtr0RnHIfggZJFwVRgJcM0ReucGzbDUGEhlFD81CnojnjnuAeW1zLt", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mrsresearchgroup", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Disposable Protective Apparel \u2013 Lakeland Industries, Enviro Safety Products, Medline Industries", "text": "Disposable Protective Apparel Market\nLatest Disposable Protective Apparel market research report 2017 determines an array of factors including manufacture analysis, share, size, sales, forecast trends, production, supply, industry, demands, and CAGR.

Bowling \n(20) For there is not a just man on earth who does good  And does not sin.  (21) Also do not take to heart everything people say, Lest you hear your servant cursing you.  (22) For many times, also, your own heart has known That even you have cursed others. \n\n\"Others\" here is referring to another person; it could even refer to a stranger. What Solomon is giving us in this section (verses 15-29) is counsel for balanced living. \nVerse 20 shows that no one on earth does what is right all the time, never making a mistake. It is the character of a just man to do good, but that is not what always happens. \nThen verse 21 begins with the word \"also,\" which means \"in addition,\" \"likewise,\" \"too,\" \"in like manner,\" and \"furthermore,\" suggesting that verses 21-22 continue the thought of verse 20. \nIn just about every situation, sin is involved. Either we have sinned or others have sinned against us\u2014or both. \nSolomon advises us not to pay attention to or take to heart everything people say, even if we hear an employee or someone under our authority insulting us\u2014because we know that we have insulted other people many times. \nUnderstanding the word \"curse\" is important here. It does not mean \"to invoke or bring evil or misfortune upon\" or \"to damn.\" It is the Hebrew word qalal, which means \"to make light, trifling, bring into contempt, abate.\" Our English word abate means \"to make less,\" \"to reduce in quantity, value, degree, or intensity,\" \"to beat down,\" and even \"to deprive.\" \nThese verses do not give specific examples of what might have been said. Perhaps it was a defaming remark, an unwarranted comment, an angry threat, a joke at another's expense, or deliberate untruths. What was said is ultimately unimportant. \nBaptist commentator John Gill (1697-1771) writes in his Exposition of the Old Testament on verse 21: \nSeeing so it is, that imperfection attends the best of men, no man is wise at all times, foolish words and unguarded expressions will sometimes drop from him, which it is better to take no notice of; they should not be strictly attended to, and closely examined, since they will not bear it. \nA man should not listen to everything that is said of himself or others; he should not curiously inquire what men say of him; and what he himself hears he should take no notice of; it is often best to let it pass, and not call it over again; to feign the hearing of a thing, or make as if you did not hear it; for oftentimes, by rehearsing a matter, or taking up words spoken, a deal of trouble and mischief follows. \nIn the face of provocation, the true quality of self-restraint is displayed in our ability to take it patiently with forbearance and longsuffering. A person who is longsuffering is not quick to retaliate or promptly punish someone who has insulted, offended, or harmed him. \n\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ted e. bowling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "solomon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john gill", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:49.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "70051a9df0190a2a1457180fcb9f99b720fae8e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZn.VMxS0BTnzz91VQKBA6Xh", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/int/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/int/ -

He spoke on Thursday at the Foreign Ministry. \nNetanyahu says that \"we are already in contact with other states that will make a similar recognition.\" \nHe says the \"time has come\" and expressed confidence that others will follow suit and move their embassies to Jerusalem. \nMeanwhile, the Israeli military said it will be deploying additional troops to the West Bank ahead of Friday, when mass Palestinian protests are anticipated in response to Trump's move. \nThe army statement on Thursday says it will deploy several battalions to the territory while other troops have been put on alert to address \"possible developments.\" \nPalestinians went on strike across the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip on Thursday and protests are expected on Friday after midday prayers. \n___ \n11:25 a.m. \nThe top leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas is calling for a new uprising against Israel in the wake of President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nIsmail Haniyeh spoke to his followers in the Gaza Strip on Thursday and called the U.S. decision an \"aggression on our people and a war on our sanctuaries.\" \nHe says the uprising should begin Friday, the Muslim holy day. \nHaniyeh then added: \"We want the uprising to last and continue to let Trump and the occupation regret this decision.\" \nHamas killed hundreds of Israelis during an armed uprising in the early 2000s. But Hamas' ability to carry out attacks is more limited. Israel has imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip, and many of Hamas' supporters in the West Bank have been arrested. \nEven so, Hamas possesses a large arsenal of rockets in Gaza capable of striking many areas in Israel. \n___ \n10:30 a.m. \nSaudi Arabia's royal court, led by King Salman and his powerful son, are condemning the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nIt's a rare public rebuke by the royal court of U.S. ally and President Donald Trump. \nSaudi Arabia, a regional powerhouse that could help the White House push through a Middle East settlement, said on Thursday the kingdom had already warned against this step and \"continues to express its deep regret at the U.S. administration's decision,\" describing it \"unjustified and irresponsible.\" \nTrump's move puts the Sunni nation in a bind. The kingdom, particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. \nU.S. Embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa have warned American citizens of possible protests as a result of Trump's decision. \n___ \n9:40 a.m. \nSchools and shops are closed in the West Bank, as Palestinians are protesting President Donald Trump's recognition of contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nPolitical groups have called for protest marches in West Bank town centers at noon on Thursday. \nTrump's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. \nThe Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. In recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Trump was seen as siding with Israel which claims the entire city. \n___ \n9:30 a.m. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is accusing his American counterpart of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" by declaring the divided holy city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nErdogan also compared President Donald Trump to a \"blender\" that is stirring up trouble in the region. \nThe Turkish leader said, addressing Trump: \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it.\" \nErdogan added that \"political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace.\" \nHe also said: \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right,' he is mistaken.\" \nErdogan spoke to a group of workers on Thursday who had gathered at Ankara's airport, before he departed for an official visit to Greece. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nPalestinians, Israelis and the wider Middle East are bracing for the fallout after President Donald Trump's seismic shift in recognizing the bitterly contested Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was to travel to Jordan on Thursday to meet with King Abdullah II. The monarch is seen as Abbas' closest Arab ally, and the two leaders might try to coordinate a response to Trump's policy change. \nIn Wednesday's move, Trump defied worldwide warnings and insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, describing his decision as merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. \nTrump also said the United States would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable for that.

The Minnesota Democrat plans to make an announcement Thursday.\nIn a swipe at the GOP, Perez highlights accusations against both President Donald Trump and Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore.\nPerez says: \"The Republican Party has chosen to pursue power and push their radical far-right agenda at any cost. And they've continued to champion a president who has a long and disturbing history of misconduct with women.\"\n__\n6 p.m.\nA tweet sent from Sen.

The report cited an unnamed Democratic official who spoke to Franken.\nIn response, a tweet from Franken's account says the story is \"not accurate\" and \"No final decision has been made.\"\nFranken lost support in the Senate on Wednesday after a seventh woman came forward accusing him of sexual impropriety. He denied the allegation, but more than a dozen Senate Democrats, led by female lawmakers, called on him to step aside.\nFranken's office says he'll make an announcement Thursday, but has offered no more details.\n___\n5:06 p.m.\nThe top Senate Democrat says Sen.

Al Franken is denying an accusation by a former Democratic congressional aide that he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006.\nThe Minnesota Democrat says in a statement that the allegation \u2014 reported by Politico \u2014 is \"categorically not true.\"\nThe woman, who's not identified by name, says Franken pursued her after her boss had left and she was collecting her belongings.\nShe says she ducked to avoid his lips. And she says Franken told her: \"It's my right as an entertainer.\"\nFranken says in his statement that the idea he'd claim such behavior as a right as an entertainer is \"preposterous.\"\nThe senator is facing a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into previous claims by other women that he groped them.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "franken", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kirsten gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "claire mccaskill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john conyers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ron wyden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brandon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wyden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kamala harris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patty murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuck schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom perez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maggie hassan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al franken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mazie hirono", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "democratic party", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate ethics committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota public radio news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethics committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-minn.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-wash.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-mo.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new hampshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-n.y.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:50.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d6c4b2cefaa282c9239cfa85b2db7931f423fad4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT30u2jCZz3FQveQYgCXGFuf2FSwsJeqDh3vO6XMAutywytHbqb6eFxHayBfxOHssxN7WNbylnRDTWA2vC6R39.M44FbaXdz5F9COO8C.1IfUdJKqwL.wyq", "site_full": "www.counterpunch.org", "site": "counterpunch.org", "site_section": "https://www.counterpunch.org/2017/", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "2017", "title": "www.counterpunch.org \u00bb Negotiating with Trump: the Art of the Deal \u00bb Print", "title_full": "www.counterpunch.org \u00bb Negotiating with Trump: the Art of the Deal \u00bb Print", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.011, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23950, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d6c4b2cefaa282c9239cfa85b2db7931f423fad4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT30u2jCZz3FQveQYgCXGFuf2FSwsJeqDh3vO6XMAutywytHbqb6eFxHayBfxOHssxN7WNbylnRDTWA2vC6R39.M44FbaXdz5F9COO8C.1IfUdJKqwL.wyq", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michael Doliner", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "www.counterpunch.org \u00bb Negotiating with Trump: the Art of the Deal \u00bb Print", "text": "Photo by Guido van Nispen | CC BY 2.0\nAs someone who has been in on many real estate deals, I thought it might be useful to think about how I would negotiate with Trump as an agent sitting opposite him in a real estate negotiation. First of all, I must admit, I have never been a part of a deal near the size Trump made regularly and don\u2019t even know who would be in the room during one of those negotiations. But I do know that the more people you have on your side of the table the weaker you are. Bring lawyers, insurance men, structural inspectors, and the lone agent on the other side will beat you if he knows what he is doing. He might appear stubborn but he will know more and get his price. So let us assume Trump is in the room with his guys, for I don\u2019t think he would be alone. On the other side is me, alone. And assume my guy, my client, not at the table, is the seller, the tougher side in a commercial deal. After all, if you want to sell there must be something wrong.\nThe first thing a real estate agent must learn is that nobody is going to hit anybody in a negotiating room. Being tough is all mental. There\u2019s no real danger of getting slugged or shot. It is all theater. So there\u2019s never a need to be intimidated. You can do anything except lie. Let it rip!\nThe most important invisible factor in any deal is the desires of seller and buyer to make the deal. If the building is hemorrhaging money the seller might be willing to take a loss just to get rid of it. On the other hand, if the buyer needs the building to complete some plan he has already committed to, he might be willing to pay more than the property is worth. There are, or course, many other factors that might affect the desires of buyer and seller. I assume my seller is willing to allow me to play my risky game. For Trump could walk.\nI recognize that Trump does have an extraordinary talent, an eye for and a belief in glitz. He did an incredible job in popularizing and selling the ostentatious vulgarity he specializes in. I could never have done it. It would not be wise to underestimate him. It might be fair to say that he created a certain genre of \u201cprestige\u201d residence. He\u2019s good at what he does. Secondly, we must realize that much of this value is in bullshit, \u201cprestige\u201d. Trump is now able to make a good living by selling the use of his name on buildings with which he has nothing else to do. Since he lives this way himself we must conclude that this is not hucksterism in the sense that Trump is a real part of the customer base he is appealing to and not just a carnival barker selling snake oil to the rubes. The best bullshitters believe.\nI would be lost in this market since I pay attention to the numbers. Prestige value is not the result of doing the numbers. For we are dealing with, primarily, location, and secondarily, up to the minute vulgarity. The value is in the herd instinct of a herd that imagines itself elite. They want what others they admire want. It\u2019s all a matter of perception, perception that can be molded. In the evaluation of such a thing the numbers are all worthless. Trump is a vision guy. We all know Trump will tear down or extensively renovate whatever he buys to realize his vision. He is thinking about what he will build when he gets rid of my client\u2019s building. He hardly cares about what the income and expenses are now. Everything else I know about him confirms this.\nI know of other deals he has made in which he has overpaid considerably, at least as far as the numbers tell the story. For example, of the Plaza Hotel in New York Trump wrote. \u201c\u201dI haven\u2019t purchased a building, I have purchased a masterpiece \u2013 the Mona Lisa. For the first time in my life, I have knowingly made a deal that was not economic \u2013 for I can never justify the price I paid, no matter how successful the Plaza becomes.\u201d You can say that again. He lost a bundle on it. I suspect it was not the first time. So he has a weakness for \u201cprestige\u201d buildings, which the one I am selling isn\u2019t, but can be made into because of its location which is not great but could be made so with the right kind of bullshit. Otherwise Trump wouldn\u2019t want it. Even with his weakness for prestige he has often come out on top because of the demand for his renovated properties. Trump knows how to add \u201cvalue\u201d. He knows how to sell prestige and has an eye for what he can turn into prestige. But all this value is in his head and the heads of the nouveau rich.\nI would also expect his out-sized ego to be present and on full display. His large entourage will be trained to feed it, not think. I will be cast to play the patsy in his show. I will bungle and fumble and \u201caccidentally\u201d bring another bogus offer with me that somehow accidentally got into the folder of the property. The longer I can drag this deal out the more Trump will want the building. The more incompetent I look and irritating I am the more he will want to beat me and hate to lose to me. I will try to be the guy he would have fired right away on his show. I will try to get under his thin skin and shake his fragile ego. Think Paul Newman on the train in The Sting.\nAlthough I have none of Trump\u2019s strengths, I am good with numbers. I am also completely unimpressed with all that Trump admires. Prestige means nothing to me. I\u2019m not in awe of any human now on the planet except for Andrew Wiles. Trump could bring Bill Gates, Vladimir Putin, and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir with him and it wouldn\u2019t impress me at all. I look only at the numbers and don\u2019t really care how I look to him. If I were negotiating with another agent like me the whole thing would be a question of numbers. By the time it got down to intangibles such as location we would measure that too. Everybody would know everything they had a right to know. There would be a fairly close agreement about what a good price is. Of course a good part of it would be measured by the pressures to buy and sell. We would both be feeling one another out about this. But we both would know that the other would walk if the price was too out of line. I would never engage in such theatrics with a normal intelligent real estate agent.\nIn a commercial deal the seller has no obligation to disclose defects. It is strictly caveat emptor . For this reason the buyer\u2019s agent usually carries out extensive inspections of whatever seems relevant. The seller can refuse to allow these inspections. Since I am pretty sure Trump plans to tear down or renovate the building I would refuse to allow them. I would try to make any information as vague as possible. The numbers can only hurt me in this instance and would count on Trump\u2019s desire for the property to keep him in. His plan is to tear down or renovate, and therefore he is ultimately indifferent to the numbers in the deal except as a tool to attack my price,\nTrump would also want to look at the rent rolls and expenses, again for the sole purpose of beating me down. This is routine, but I would refuse. His banker would complain, but since he knew Trump\u2019s plan ahead of time he will not back out, and Trump might threaten to pull out, but he wouldn\u2019t because he would not want to lose to me that irritating little idiot, and hopefully, because I had made the location seem better with my boundless admiration for it. I would do everything I could to express my belief that he is no match for me. I would subtlety disrespect him, ask him if he understands what I am talking about. I would piss him off with delays, lost documents, whatever I could. At the same time, I would make it clear that I, like Trump think of the negotiation as a war. I would talk about the world being made up of winners and losers. How could he lose to this asshole! Pulling out would be losing, and Trump does not like to lose, especially to a fool. I will count on his competitive nature and fragile ego to hook him. With innuendo and body language I would express my skepticism over his ability to perform in the deal. I would suggest that perhaps he is financially unsound. I would joke about his whole way of doing things. I would challenge his real estate manhood and at the same time come on as an incompetent fool. I would make it personal, suggest, though not directly, that he was small potatoes. He would want to beat me in the worst way.\nHad Trump seen the numbers he would know that my asking price was ridiculously high, outrageously high, absurdly high. Or course he will still think and say that it is outrageously high even though I will insist that I am offering him a bargain. Any other buyer would have walked away from the deal when I refused to disclose information, assuming that my client didn\u2019t really want to sell. But Trump is mad and in a war and does not want to retreat. All Trump cares about is how much he thinks that particular location is worth and beating me. But the value of a location depends only upon what others think it is worth. However I could, I would hint that others had been interested, without of course, saying so. Every now and then I would say, \u201clocation, location, location\u201d in as stupid and naive way as I could if I couldn\u2019t counter some argument of one of his minions. I would toss his evidence back across the table with contempt, not even looking at it.\nMeanwhile, I would carefully monitor the mood at the other side of the table. I wouldn\u2019t budge until I saw they were at the edge of exasperation. Then, when they were practically out of their chairs, I would give in a bit, but just a bit. Maybe I would make some apology, some excuse for myself. I might even butter Trump up a bit about his toughness, for I know how susceptible he is to flattery. I would offer a slightly lower price. As soon as they were back in their chairs I would return to my intransigence. Painfully, interminably, modeling myself on the Israelis in the Israeli-Palestinian \u201cpeace process\u201d, I would let them slowly wear me down. Drawing it out, perhaps making a few telephone calls before yielding a little more, I would allow myself to get beaten down to a price that was still far above what I thought the property was worth. From that point I would not budge, and I would threaten to walk out the door. Finally, admitting defeat I would go down a tiny bit more and make the deal at a price far below my asking but well above the property\u2019s value. I would praise Trump on his negotiating skill and his toughness.\nTrump would think he won and I would think I won.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://uziiw38pmyg1ai60732c4011-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/dropzone/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-05-at-4.01.20-PM-300x194.png", "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/", "https://uziiw38pmyg1ai60732c4011-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/dropzone/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-05-at-4.01.20-PM-768x497.png", "https://uziiw38pmyg1ai60732c4011-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/dropzone/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-05-at-4.01.20-PM.png"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "guido van nispen", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew wiles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul newman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill gates", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mormon tabernacle choir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "plaza hotel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york trump", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:50.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6a92673a3bf055b0770346236a37659773b22910", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSy03S_B2zdIneI.euTs4vqw1ziIpF2I1Uz2ZoznyjVzRg6MXdyEfNEGy3w2mAE8d_gWhbxuEJNTA--", "site_full": "www.thedibb.co.uk", "site": "thedibb.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.thedibb.co.uk/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=48", "site_categories": ["travel", "theme_parks"], "section_title": "Trip Planning Florida - theDIBB", "title": "Aug 2018 Indirect Mia via MCO!", "title_full": "Aug 2018 Indirect Mia via MCO! - theDIBB", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.thedibb.co.uk/forums/images/OGlogo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 80855, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "00e44d6c4df2921add77cf855cec005d8fde3e91", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSy03S_B2zdIneI.euTs4vqw1ziIpF2I1Uz2ZoznyjVzRg6MXdyEfNEGy3w2mAE8d8bUXF8RgcRF0Klj0c5fiYC", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Alices Aunt", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Interesting article but the man in questions situation is different to yours and the judge rules his judgment non binding.
