Later that year, a research team led by danah boyd (she spells her name all lowercase) found that 95 percent of the parents whose 10-year-olds were on Facebook knew about it, and 78 percent of them helped their kids sign up. I haven\u2019t seen recent research showing how many pre-teens are using Instagram, Snapcat, Facebook Messenger, Kik and other apps aimed at teens and adults, but I suspect the numbers are into the millions. \nOne of the main reasons social media and messaging services try to block children under 13 is to comply with the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act. The act requires children younger than 13 to have verifiable parental consent before they can disclose personal information to a commercial service. But, because these services are all about sharing, it\u2019s nearly impossible to operate without collecting personal information. \nIn other words, \u201cofficially,\u201d these services are for teens and adults, which is one reason it\u2019s disturbing that younger children sneak in. Facebook has privacy protections for teens under 18, but these protections aren\u2019t designed for younger children who lack the maturity to navigate the choppy waters of social media. \nFacebook has long been looking for a way to serve children under 13. In 2011, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, \u201cThat will be a fight we take on at some point. \u2026 My philosophy is that for education you need to start at a really, really young age.\u201d \nMessenger Kids, announced Monday, isn\u2019t exactly an education app, but it\u2019s tailored to give kids 6 to 12 the ability to engage in conversations as well as exchange messages, videos and images with parent-approved friends and family. The app also allows kids to send photos, videos and text messages to approved adults, who receive the messages on their Facebook Messenger app. Kids also have access to a pre-approved library of stickers, GIFs, masks, frames and drawing tools to decorate their content. \nI was pre-briefed on the app in my capacity as chief executive officer of ConnectSafely.org , a nonprofit internet safety organization that receives support and advises several tech companies, including Facebook. \nOne big difference between Messenger Kids and other social media apps is that parents have to set up the accounts. Kids aren\u2019t allowed to do it. Parents must approve all contacts, and kids can\u2019t communicate with anyone who isn\u2019t pre-approved. \nAnother difference is that there is no advertising, and Facebook says that kids\u2019 data is not collected for commercial purposes. \nIt\u2019s also not a backdoor into other Facebook products. The company said that it doesn\u2019t plan to automatically migrate children to Facebook, Instagram, Messenger or any other service when they turn 13. Facebook also pledges not to intermingle data between Messenger Kids and other Facebook apps and services. \nChildren and their parents can remove contacts for any reason and can report inappropriate content. They can also block contacts, which prevents communication and also hides the child from that person. \nBecause of the approval process, Messenger Kids greatly minimizes so-called \u201cstranger danger,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t eliminate the need for oversight and internet safety training. When it comes to abuse, kids are statistically at greater risk from family members, family friends and other trusted adults than from strangers they meet online. \nParents also need to think about how much time they allow their kids to use this or any other app. Although they no longer issue arbitrary guidelines, the Academy of Pediatrics and most other experts agree that screen time needs to be balanced with other activities, including in-person relationships, exercise and other forms of play and communication. \nParents also need to discuss digital citizenship with their children. I\u2019m not aware of any technology that can completely prevent cyberbullying or other forms of abuse. Children need to learn how to behave and what to do if someone posts something that makes them uncomfortable. ConnectSafely, Family Online Safety Institute and other groups publish guides, tip sheets and other educational materials for both parents and kids. \nI think of Messenger Kids as training wheels for social media and messaging. It\u2019s also like a sandbox. Kids can injure themselves in sandboxes, but they\u2019re a lot safer than playing in the street. \nWhile limiting screen time is important, we\u2019ve already crossed the threshold. A recent Common Sense Media survey of parents of children 8 and younger found a \u201cspike in the number of young children who have their own tablet device (42 percent up from 8 percent in 2013) and that young children are spending an average of 48 minutes a day using mobile devices. It is higher when you factor in 10- to 12-year-olds. \nWhatever the age, what\u2019s important is how children are using these devices, whether they\u2019re setting aside time for other activities and what it is they\u2019re actually doing online.

Overall, the list proves that if you star in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you\u2019re set for a while.\n20. Mark Ruffalo\nEarnings: $13 million\nRuffalo got a nice payday from his role in the MCU. He\u2019ll be appearing next in \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d as Marvel\u2019s jolly green giant.\n19. Chris Pratt\nEarnings: $17 million\nPratt is also a staple in the MCU, with his starring role in the \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d franchise. He made 35 percent less than last year, but still manages to make the top 20.\nLatest entertainment videos Man Drives Candy Cane Car Around Rhode Island Storyful James Roday and Dule Hill reteam for 'Psych: The Movie' AP Olivia Munn says she faced threats over Brett Ratner allegations AP Lea Michele and her cat evacuate during California fires AP College student brings Hollywood stars to tears at breakfast AP Young Prince Harry and Prince William\u2019s Nativity Play Photos Will Melt Your Heart InStyleTime Hilary Duff Took a Dating Cue from Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber and Now Her Relationship\u2019s Great InStyleTime Margot Robbie Breaks Down How the Media Villainized Tonya Harding EWTime Sandra Bullock Says All-Female 'Ocean\u2019s 8' Cast \u2018Will Fight Right Back\u2019 Against Sexist Attacks EWTime Allison Janney Breaks Down All the Parts of LaVona Harding in 'I, Tonya' EWTime 18. Chris Evans\nEarnings: $18 million.\nLook another MCU veteran. Evans plays Captain America and is expected to earn an even bigger paycheck with his role in \u201cAvengers: Infinity War.\u201d\n17. Jeremy Renner\nEarnings: $19 million\nWe sense a pattern. However, Renner is on the list thanks to his role in \u201cArrival,\u201d which earned over $200 million at the box office.\n16. Matt Damon\nEarnings: $21 million\nDamon is expected to earn a huge paycheck with his upcoming film \u201cDownsizing,\u201d but multiple executive producing credits surely help.\n15. Ryan Reynolds\nEarnings: $21.5 million\nExpectations for \u201cDeadpool 2\u201d are high and his paycheck will be even higher.\n14. Ryan Gosling\nEarnings: $29 million\n\u201cLa La Land\u201d and an Oscar nomination really helped Gosling to make it onto the list, but the upcoming \u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d helped as well.\n13. Samuel L. Jackson\nEarnings: $30.5 million\nHe gets money from his deal with Capital One but the sheer number of movies he appears in contributes. He starred in \u201cKong: Skull Island,\u201d \u201cxXx: Return of Xander Cage\u201d and \u201cThe Hitman\u2019s Bodyguard\u201d in 2017 alone.\n12. Tom Hanks\nEarnings: $31 million\nA frequent member of the highest-paid actors club, Hanks raked in paychecks from \u201cThe Circle,\u201d \u201cSully,\u201d and the third Robert Langdom film \u201cInferno.\u201d\n11. Chris Hemsworth\nEarnings: $31.5 million\nThe best Chris? At least the highest-paid one. The Marvel actor saw the biggest increase in money earned this year of anybody else on the list.\n10. Akshay Kumar\nEarnings: $35.5 million\nMany inside the United States may not realize it but Bollywood is a big moneymaker. Kumar\u2019s films are some of the highest grossing in Indian history.\n9. Salman Kahn\nEarnings: $37 million\nAnother Bollywood star. Kahn has been one of the country\u2019s biggest stars for nearly three decades. He starred in the movie \u201cSultan\u201d in 2016.\n8. Shah Rukh Kahn\nEarnings: $38 million\nThey don\u2019t call him the \u201cKing of Bollywood\u201d for nothing. He had four film roles in 2016 and has three listed for 2017.\n7. Tom Cruise\nEarnings: $43 million\nLike Hanks, Cruise is another frequent flyer on this list. He earned massive paychecks this year for \u201cThe Mummy\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible 6.\u201d\n6. Robert Downey Jr.\nEarnings: $48 million\nBeing the highest-paid actor in the MCU will help those numbers. A lot.\n5. Jackie Chan\nEarnings: $49 million\nHe may not be as frequent in American cinemas but he\u2019s still the biggest star from mainland China.\n4. Adam Sandler\nEarnings: $50.5 million\nSandler is making big money from his deal with Netflix. Recently , the streaming service extended that deal for four more films.\n3.

Then I made everyone show up to his funeral in swimwear.\u201d 2. \nElectronic Arts \n\u201cMy prison filled with slave-artists was pretty grim. Everyone got a single cell, bed, toilet, sink, artist easel. There was a warden that lived above them on the ground level (all the cells are underground of course), who cooked for them, but they could only eat if they were turning out sellable art. \nMost of them went insane and died.\u201d 3. \nElectronic Arts \n\u201cMy teenage son decided waking up to his alarm and getting on the school bus was unimportant. So I locked him in a 1\u00d71 room until he peed himself and died in the puddle.\u201d 4. \nElectronic Arts \n\u201cIt\u2019s not too sadistic per-se, but it involved a lot of deaths. \nI wanted to make a church with a full, complete graveyard. So I built a small, simple structure moved in a family of 8, get them all inside, remove the door, fill with fire. Yay, 8 new tombstones! \nRepeat like 9 times, and you\u2019ve got a full graveyard of tombstones. Then I built the church and moved in a priest to live there and tend to the grounds. \nUnfortunately for the priest the grounds had been tainted by the dark rituals of the past and several dozen ghosts would materialize every night. Tormented by the crowds of specters, he himself died three days later due to never being able to sleep.\u201d 5. \nElectronic Arts \n\u201cI once broke up with a guy then invited him over and drowned him, just to keep his tombstone for our illegitimate child. It sounds so much worse when its put bluntly like that.\u201d 6. \nElectronic Arts \n\u201cSo, in my most recent Sims playthrough, I found this girl that I really wanted my Sim to marry. Problem is she already had a husband, so rather than just doing the (relatively) normal thing and just increasing the relationship and convincing her to break up with him, I instead became best friends with her husband, convinced him to move in with me, and then drowned him in a pool so I could marry his wife. \nThen I moved in with his wife (who lived in a HUGE mansion) and killed the rest of her family because I didn\u2019t feel like taking care of the other Sims that she lived with but I still wanted the house.\u201d 7. \nElectronic Arts \n\u201cI built a haunted house and killed like three families for the cemetery. The game literally gave me a pop up saying the Sims is a *life* simulation, and that I\u2019m killing too many Sims.\u201d 8. \n\u201cI made a guy who was a compulsive neatfreak. Put him in a really surreal little house with a wedding buffet and a hamster or something, deleted the door. Eventually he went insane from lack of cleanliness and depression over his little rodent friend dying, and starved to death once the banquet rotted. I put the resulting urn in the room. I then repeated an identical scenario several times, always keeping the urns in the room. Eventually the 10th iteration of this guy is up all night, every night, terrified of a parade of ghosts of himself.\u201d 9. \nElectronic Arts \n\u201cI briefly fell asleep while playing and when I awoke, CPS had taken the child away while the parents were gaming.\u201d 10. \nElectronic Arts \n\u201cI made my Sim have six kids, back to back, with four different guys. I move in with the most recent baby daddy and kill him off so that none of my kids know their fathers. While all this is happening, I also flirt with everyone in town who will give me the time of day, make them break up with their partner, and then ask them to be friends. I enjoy making enemies. \nI also go to the graveyard and write really demeaning things on the epitaphs.\u201d 11. \nElectronic Arts \n\u201cI think this was Sims 2 , I made a reality TV show house full of stereotypes, left them on free will mode, and had someone \u2018voted off\u2019 every three days based on whoever was the least popular. The person \u2018voted off\u2019 was murdered, naturally.\u201d 12. \nElectronic Arts \n\u201cIn Makin\u2019 Magic I had a brilliant dog called AJ who was loved by the whole family. He never had an off day and brought sheer joy to his owners. Decided to train my wizardry and get the spell that allowed you to turn pets into humans, so AJ could be even more a part of the family. \nHe turned out to be the biggest fucking assbag as a person and was abusive to his family, so we had to take care of him. I built a monolithic tomb, and trapped him inside. The family stood out front playing music to him as he slowly starved. They bought a new dog and played with it happily outside his eternal resting place to torture his trapped soul. Eventually a dragon burnt down the house and killed them all. \nWhat a game.\u201d 13. \nElectronic Arts \n\u201cI would train my son to be a good enough painter to do screenshot paintings. I then forced him to paint me naked or having sex with his mother/other women. I hung the paintings everywhere.\u201d 14. \nElectronic Arts \n\u201cI made a house filled with swimming pools so that everything was on an island. \nWith all of the constant swimming to eat, sleep, pee, play basketball, etc., not to mention constantly changing from clothes to swimsuit and back, my Sims spent their lives in perpetual exhaustion.\u201d Share this...

Tractor ploughing a field Charles Hooker says, \u201cOur software is easy to use, flexible and has created a central repository for AF to store invoices and other corporate data. It's an excellent example of where EDMS really delivers commercial value given a manual paper-based way of managing invoices has been removed.\" LONDON   Filestream announces that the largest not-for-profit agricultural purchasing organisation in the UK, AF Group, is using its electronic document management software (EDMS) to manage all the storage and indexing of invoices which total around 480,000 per year. With a turnover in excess of \u00a3230 million annually, The AF Group (AF) purchases around 10% of the UK\u2019s total farm inputs on behalf of its 3,500 stakeholder members. Working with 1,900 suppliers, it procures 200,000 tonnes of fertiliser, 80 million litres of fuel, 105,000 tonnes of livestock feed, 500 cars and over \u00a32 million worth of tyres. In addition, AF manages 14,000 mobile phone and 5,o00 fixed lines contracts. With its headquarters in Norfolk, AF formed in January 2003 as a result of the merger of two long established buying groups - Loddon Farmers and Mid Norfolk Farmers. Alex Morton, AF\u2019s operations manager, says, \u201cWe get greater buying power for our members through economies of scale, with an efficient back office service reducing their administrative overheads. It means farmers can get on and farm rather than dealing with all the invoicing and accounting tasks related to the purchasing of equipment and supplies for their businesses.\u201d EDMS solves the paper handling process each month With so many transactions and a membership growing year on year, managing the invoice process was a paper handling headache given that most came by post. Each month, AF used to collate all the invoices from suppliers, photocopy and then post the members the originals as a printed consolidated pack with a statement outlining the amount due. Self-evidently, this was hugely laborious, time-consuming, inefficient and error prone. To solve this, AF has worked closely with suppliers so that many now submit invoices electronically \u2013 via either email or XML \u2013 with an EDMS from Filestream purchased to store and index them. Today, 40% of invoices are processed via XML up from 20% in 2015. Error rates with billing are just 0.4% - an impressive figure given the quantity of invoices received. Paper invoices received are scanned and stored in File Stream, too. File Stream integrates with AF\u2019s bespoke built CRM called AFi which allows all staff in the office to view any invoice related to a supplier or member at the touch of a button. The use of XML also means that staff avoid having to rekey information into its systems thereby improving data capture. Alex Morton says, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to extract more data from our invoices so we can complete further analysis about what we\u2019re buying. Historically, if an invoice was received with 20 or so line items, for example, this would be entered as 1 line and coded to \u2018machinery\u2019, which is not very useful. Now we use a tool called Esker to extract all the detail from a PDF invoice and then business intelligence and data analytics software from Tableau to interrogate this further. This means ultimately we\u2019ll be in a better position to assess at a granular level precisely what we\u2019re buying and then negotiate better prices with suppliers on behalf of our members.\u201d The use of an EDMS to store copies of all invoices helps AF\u2019s back office staff to automate the generation of members\u2019 eBilling packs each month. Alex Morton says, \u201cOur eBilling process has become quite advanced, allowing us to consolidate 40,000 invoices each month and send packs to each member, 75% of which are e-mailed. Members can also view invoices via a portal called AF Interactive, and then download accounts data straight into their own software packages like Farm Plan.\u201d While 95% of the content stored in File Stream is invoice related, AF is also using the software to manage other corporate information such as membership renewal forms, contracts and order confirmations. EDMS delivers clear return on investment File Stream is delivering five key benefits to AF: 1. Productivity is enhanced through the removal of paper-based processes. Compared to the volumes in 2003, AF processes about ten times as many invoices each month but with the same number of administrative staff; 2. Service to members is improved as billing information is provided accurately to them and on time. 3. Levy costs to members per transaction have been maintained due to the increased efficiency of AF\u2019s back office operation. 4. Access to accounting and corporate information is quick and easy and available at a touch of a button. 5. Data retention policies can easily be set in the software so that auditing and compliance rules are met. Charles Hooker, Filestream\u2019s managing director, says, \u201cOur software is easy to use, flexible and has created a central repository for AF to store invoices and other corporate data. It is an excellent use case example of where EDMS really delivers commercial value given a manual paper-based way of managing invoices has been removed.\u201d About Filestream Limited Based in Wokingham, Filestream Limited is a supplier of electronic document management software. First developed in 2003, Filestream\u2019s EDMS is written in-house by developers using current Microsoft\u00ae technology including MS SQL and .net framework.

Talking about the things in your life that you are grateful for is one of the healthiest parts of celebrating the holidays. According to psychologists, practicing gratitude can help you gain both happiness and health. However, it is a shame that most Americans don't talk about what they are grateful for on an everyday basis. While it is great to give thanks once a year, doing it more often is even more beneficial. \nStudies have shown that being conscious of your gratitude has positive effects on your health. One way to increase the amount of time you spend focusing on what you are grateful for is to take a minute before every meal to consider how much work was put into preparing it. \nWhen thinking about all of the work that went into your meal's creation, from planting seeds to harvesting and cooking, you will appreciate the nourishment that it provides. The First Thanksgiving \nThanksgiving represents the first recorded feast in 1621 between the pilgrims and the Native Americans in Plymouth. It was attended by at least 50 pilgrims and 90 Indians, who walked for two days just to be at the feast. They ate food and played games for three days. Their meals consisted of venison, fish, and fowls. \nThis feast did not become an annual holiday until 1863. Instead, the feast that occurred in 1621 seems to have been an event on its own. The peace between pilgrims and the Native Americans did not last, and Thanksgiving is actually a controversial holiday for many people of Indian descent because of the reminder of ancestral pain. \nPilgrams and Native Americans lived together in peace for about a decade until thousands of new settlers came over to America after a plague cut the native population by more than half. The arrival of the settlers resulted in a fight for land and animosity. Stay Thankful for Thanksgiving \nWhile you may only be able to think of a few things to be thankful for, creating a great life requires you to work against negative thoughts and act in a positive way even when you don't want to. Evidence suggests that people can choose to practice gratitude, which helps increase happiness. \nOne way to show gratitude when life is not going right is to show thanks for things that may seem insignificant. This could be the passing smell of flowers or the taste of a nice dinner. Over time, you will find that you will be able to find gratitude easily in your everyday life. Health Benefits \nShowing thanks has been found to have health benefits, including: Increasing pleasurable feelings and emotions Improving the quality of your sleep Increasing the probability that you will workout Helps with your relationships Increases your competence at work Reduces stress Improves cardiovascular health Strategies to Build Gratitude \nYour sense of gratitude can be built with practice. Here are ten ways to practice strengthening your ability to show thanks. 1. Write in a daily gratitude journal \nUse a paper journal or an app on your phone to do this. People who keep a gratitude journal tend to exercise more and have fewer visits to the doctor than those who do not. 2. Write thank you letters \nGetting into the habit of writing thank you letters can help you express your gratitude in addition to just feeling it. 3. Nonverbal actions \nGive away smiles and hugs. They are free! 4. Be sincere, and choose your words wisely \nSay \"please\" and \"thank you\" when you truly mean it. This will allow the recipient to really believe you when you say these words. 5. Focus on the well-being of other people \nThis will help decrease your unneeded anxieties. Cherish the kindness of other people so you're less likely to take friends for granted. 7. Don't compare yourself to others \nChances are, you don't really know what is going on in everyone else's life. You probably have a lot of things that the next person would be jealous of as well. 8. Make a nightly gratitude ritual \nEach night before you go to bed, think about 3 things that you are happy about or thankful for from the previous day. Then think about 3 things that you can look forward to the next day. Even if these things are small, it can make a difference. 9. Spend money on activities rather than things \nActivities will leave you with memories to last a lifetime while things will come and go.

Lines Ltd, Tohoku Electric Power Co., Inc., and Namura Shipbuilding Co. Ltd have jointly earned an Approval in Principle (AIP) from Lloyd's for the design of an LNG-powered coal carrier. \nThe three companies have moved ahead with this project and recently conducted a Hazard Identification Study (HAZID) and finished the basic design. \nThis is Japan's first joint acquisition by three companies - a shipping company, cargo owner, and shipbuilder - of an AIP for a vessel powered by LNG. The vessel design ensures sufficient cargo capacity without making the hull larger by installing the LNG fuel tank at the stern. In addition, the study is pursued based on installation of the tank cover with an eye toward preventing an onboard fire from spreading to the LNG fuel tank while streamlining inspection work. \nAs stricter standards on exhaust emissions from merchant vessels have taken effect around the world, LNG (which can significantly reduce not only SO X , but also CO 2 , which is a cause of global warming, and NO X , which is a cause of acid rain and so on) is expected to see wider use as vessel fuel. In addition to researching the feasibility of using LNG as fuel, MOL also strives to reduce its environmental impact, while providing safe, reliable transport services. \nMOL will forge ahead with this cutting-edge coal carrier, which adopts expertise and technology gained through promotion of the R&D project \"ISHIN NEXT - MOL Smart Ship Project\".

Turner in a Memphis courtroom. Judge Lee Coffee told her he would not allow another such interruption, but he did not charge her with contempt of court. \nTurner was indicted Tuesday on a first-degree murder charge. His bail is set at $1 million. Turner told the judge that he was planning to hire an attorney and Coffee set a hearing for Tuesday. \nWright\u2019s body was found in a swampy field in suburban Memphis on July 28, 2010, 10 days after the 34-year-old was reported missing. He was shot multiple times. The seven-year investigation into his death has been one of the Memphis Police Department\u2019s most high-profile unsolved cases. \nProsecutors and police have declined to say much about the case. Police said last month that they had found a gun used in the killing in a lake near the small town of Walnut, Mississippi, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Memphis. \nAfter Marion\u2019s statement, Turner was led out of the courtroom in the custody of court officers. The judge called Marion to a microphone in the courtroom and told her he understands her pain because his father was killed.

Al Green, D-Texas, came to the House floor at 12:13 p.m. to offer articles of impeachment under special House rules requiring a floor vote; he returned to the floor at 1:34 to force that vote. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., offered a motion to table the resolution, which was adopted on a 364- 58 vote. Every lawmaker who opposed the motion was a Democrat, as were four others who voted present.The top two House Democrats both voted to table the resolution after coming out against Green\u2019s effort shortly before the House voted.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., issued a joint statement opposed to Green\u2019s push, though they stopped short of calling on Democrats to vote to kill it.\u201cDemocrats are firmly focused on taking real, effective steps to improve the lives of hard-working Americans and defeating Republicans\u2019 cruel barrage of attacks on the middle class,\u201d they wrote, pointing to their opposition to the pending Republican tax bill while acknowledging that Trump has \u201cmade statements and taken actions that are beyond the pale for most Americans.\u201d\u201cLegitimate questions have been raised about his fitness to lead this nation,\u201d Pelosi and Hoyer continued. \u201cRight now, Congressional committees continue to be deeply engaged in investigations into the President\u2019s actions both before and after his inauguration. The special counsel\u2019s investigation is moving forward as well, and those inquiries should be allowed to continue.
