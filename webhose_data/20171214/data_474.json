Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.), ranking member of House Appropriations subcommittee on state and foreign operations. Jerusalem - Embassy - Act - Congress - Position \u201cI was proud to vote for the [1995] Jerusalem Embassy Act, which demonstrated Congress\u2019 unified position that Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of Israel, and today\u2019s announcement is consistent with existing U.S. law,\u201d she said.\u201cI support the decision to recognize Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Israel and to move the U.S. embassy there,\u201d said Rep.

Debate - People - Tie - Jerusalem - Today \u201cThere is no debate that the Jewish people have a deep-rooted religious, cultural and historic tie to Jerusalem, and today\u2019s decision reaffirms that connection,\u201d they said.\u201cJerusalem is the capital of Israel, and I\u2019ve strongly supported acknowledging that simple fact,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Ct.). Hope - President - Announcement - Recognition - Jerusalem \u201cMy hope is that the president\u2019s announcement of his recognition of Jerusalem will be followed by meaningful steps to advance the peace process, including secure borders for Israel and a two-state solution.\u201dSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) did not issue a statement Wednesday but as recently as October called for Trump to move the embassy to...

Marquis Forneus is 1 of 72 demons listed in the Ars Goetia (the first section of the Lesser Key of Solomon). \nHis name seems to come from Latin 'fornus', 'furnus', oven.

I use the same signed certificate for all apps.This has worked fine up till now. However my latest app wont install.\nThe app itself is simple, it uses the cameras the switch on and off the flash. essentially giving me a torch. My phone is Samsung S4 and has Android 5.0.1\nI have connected is phone to laptop, Windows 10, for testing and debugging and it works perfectly. I then deleted this test/debug version from the phone.\nI created a signed release version , copied it to the phone ( using Bluetooth) and opened it using the default installer.\nThis is where the problem arises. The installer, after a few moments, just reports that the app was not installed.\nI appreciate that the query is very general, but is there anything I could be doing wrong. I am fairly sure this worked before without a problem. The only permission needed is camera.\nOne other app on the phone uses the same signing certificate. But this seems to be accepted practice ( in fact it seems recommended).\nI have reinstalled the debug version, using Android Studio and it works fine, and gives me the torch I wanted, but I would prefer to get to the bottom of this\nWould be grateful for any help. Or direction where I might start. I can post code and manifest files it that is any help.\nthanks for reading such a long post", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:28.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bc3ed7b4995214a60d936da383976239125c9f9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyGxEShyJjNVSczD5cZQHxPuVok48ZH3F6j9fCW.2ygwluMTUVWEVAPYEhPezPv0Zk-", "site_full": "forums.airshows.co.uk", "site": "airshows.co.uk", "site_section": "http://forums.airshows.co.uk/viewforum.php?f=7", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Aviation Photography", "title": "Seoul ADEX 2017 - image heavy", "title_full": "Seoul ADEX 2017 - image heavy", "published": "2017-12-07T00:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.366, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "932c39511753c411f0b57fc4fab9e92e60f65122", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyGxEShyJjNVSczD5cZQHxPuVok48ZH3F6j9fCW.2ygwluMTUVWEVAPBWxcOZUCNuWPcNVGGlYG.w--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "BriLlo", "published": "2017-12-07T00:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Amazing images of some stunning (and surprising) aircraft.

AFP / Robyn Beck The flames have swallowed about 80,000 acres (32,000 hectares) in just over a day since the fire broke out \nHigh winds caused another wave of wildfires to erupt overnight Tuesday, including one in Los Angeles' affluent Bel-Air neighborhood. \nThe area battled gridlocked traffic as residents fled ash and smoke that churned over the smoldering hillside in the United States' second-largest city. \nFire crews worked to save luxury homes threatened by the flames. \nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said more than 230,000 people had been forced from their homes in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. \n\"Very strong winds\" blowing from the northeast to the southwest were causing the fire to balloon, he said, warning Angelenos to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. \nIn Bel-Air, that's exactly what they did. AFP / Kyle Grillot Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said more than 230,000 people had been forced from their homes in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. \nThe \"Skirball\" fire ignited before 5:00 am (1300 GMT) and quickly grew to engulf about 150 acres around the district, home to celebrities and billionaires including SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and pop superstar Beyonce. \nPolice knocked on doors and used loudspeakers to make sure everybody left their mansions. \n\"They told even us to leave,\" one of the officers said. \nAmong the last to go was Evan Kleib, a bearded photographer, locking his door. He packed his camera and his dogs a his vintage burgundy car and left the home where he has lived for several years, its fate uncertain. \nUS media reported that the Bel-Air Moraga Estate of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, which contains a vineyard, was threatened by the wildfire. \nThe singer Lionel Richie cancelled a concert to help his ex-wife flee the area, while comedian Chelsea Handler and designer Adrienne Maloof were among celebrities tweeting that they had to evacuate. \nForecasters predicted that winds could cause fires to spread further, threatening more upscale homes and the acclaimed Getty Center museum. \nThe \"Skirball\" fire -- near a cultural center of the same name -- also prompted authorities to close the 405 Freeway, a major commuting corridor. \nResidents of wealthy LA neighborhoods between Mulholland Drive to the north and Sunset Boulevard to the south were part of the evacuation zone. \n- Flames menacing art - \nThe Getty arts institution -- home to masterpieces including those by Edouard Manet -- was closed until at least Thursday. \nMuseum authorities tweeted that \"air filtration systems are protecting the galleries from smoke.\" \nThe prestigious University of California, Los Angeles is near the same area and also ended up evacuating, after students began the day wearing masks. AFP / Robyn Beck US President Donald Trump tweeted a message of \"thoughts and prayers\" to California as it nears the end of its deadliest year ever for wildfires \nDozens of schools were closed, as was Santa Monica College. \nJust north in Ventura County the \"Thomas\" blaze continued out of control, after erupting in the hills of oak and scrub north of Santa Paula, powered by strong seasonal guests known as Santa Ana winds. \n- State of emergency - \nAt least 4,000 firefighters were deployed across the entire fire zone, including on the scene of the \"Rye\" blaze -- which had grown to 7,000 acres in the Santa Clarita area -- as well as the \"Creek\" fire north of downtown Los Angeles that had grown to more than 11,000 acres. \nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency over the area on Tuesday. AFP / Mark RALSTON A motorist involved in a traffic accident waits to get towed beside a wall of flames during the Thomas wildfire near Ventura, California \nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) said it had released funds for relief services. \nUS President Donald Trump tweeted a message of \"thoughts and prayers\" to California as it nears the end of its deadliest year ever for wildfires.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nAt least a third of teenagers living in Britain are putting their health at risk by being overweight, staggering new statistics have shown. \nA new study has shown 20 per cent of 14-year-olds in the UK are obese. \nA further 15 per cent were deemed to be overweight. \nLeading children's doctors said the study was further evidence of the \"childhood obesity crisis\" gripping the country. Read More Family of mum killed by flu in matter of hours issue warning over the virus \nThe new figures come from research conducted by experts at the Centre for Longitudinal Studies at University College London (UCL). \nResearchers from UCL's Institute of Education examined data from more than 10,000 teenagers who are taking part in the Millennium Cohort Study - a study tracking the lives of thousands of youngsters born at the turn of the century. \nYoungsters whose mothers had a low level of education were more likely to be of excess weight than those whose mothers had a degree. \nMeanwhile, the authors also found differences between white and black teenagers - with 48 per cent of young black people classified as having excess weight, compared to 34.5 per cent of white adolescents.

It's among the most important gout nutrients.", "text": "Potassium Citrate for gout. Helps alkalize urine which may excrete more uric acid. And it's useful for dealing with kidney stones \nThis page about potassium citrate for gout, was last reviewed or updated on 20 May 2013. \nPotassium citrate is one of the best vita-nutrients for gout. It can deliver huge benefits but you must do it right. \nIf you have gout, or are at risk of it due to uric acid levels above about 6.8 mg/dL(0.401 mmol/L), men, and 6.0 mg/dL(0.354 mmol/L),women, there is quite a risk of kidney stones developing. One estimate is that there is about a 20-25% chance that uric acid kidney stones will form in gout patients who have acidic urine. So your urine needs to be alkaline. \nRead our pH pages, starting here, if alkalinity is new to you . \nKeeping urine alkaline might also \u2013 eventually \u2013 help you avoid lithotripsy surgery for kidney stones. \nPotassium is very alkaline. The citrate form of potassium is best because it is better absorbed in this form. Another good point about potassium, is that it's cheap. \nRead on for other benefits of potassium for gout.... But please carefully note the cautions at the bottom of this page. Potassium citrate, like baking soda (bicarbonate of soda/ sodium bicarbonate) MUST be prescribed by a doctor (physician) who knows your medical condition and knows the other medications (pharmaceuticals) you may be taking. And your starting (baseline) serum (blood) level of potassium needs to be known . \nHow do you achieve alkaline urine? You take potassium citrate, or potassium-magnesium citrate, to raise your urine pH i.e. alkalize (alkalise) urine. Raising pH levels generally will probably raise urine pH, but potassium citrate has been found in studies to be good at raising urine pH. \nTest your urine pH levels with pH test strips (stix) . Testing tells you whether your urine is becoming more alkaline, and therefore whether what you are eating and drinking and/or the potassium citrate supplementation, is taking you towards the objective. With gout you need all the personal encouragement you can get and good news from the strips - also called stix - is one way of getting a psychological boost. \nThe testing procedure is easy. Make sure you follow the manufacturer's instructions' leaflet exactly and keep your doctor informed. Have him/her check your results periodically. \nNote that pH testing also tests the pH of saliva, but here we are talking about testing the pH of urine. \nAt what pH level is urine acidic? Acidic urine is a urine pH measurement of about pH 5.0 \u2013 pH 5.5. How alkaline should your urine be? Accounts vary. I have read of numbers ranging from pH 6.2 up to pH 7.5. It is probably somewhat individual-specific, which is another reason why you must work with a doctor. \nIn one study, healthy women who raised their urine pH from 5.9 to 6.5, ( a large amount because this is a logarithmic scale), using an alkaline foods diet, increased their uric acid excretion about 37%. From 302 mg a day to 413 mg a day.(1) \nWhen do you test? The best time to test is probably first thing in the morning before you have breakfast, since breakfast and subsequent foods affect pH levels. And because pH is more acidic in the morning. (The body it's said, becomes more acidic at night). In other words do it early, and always at the same time (more or less) , so that comparisons are more accurate. One pH expert says you should test the second urine of the morning, not the first. Or test urine pH before going to bed, but always at this time (more or less) for the same accuracy reason. So when you write a record, note the time, as well as the date, of your test. \nDissolving kidney stones Even if uric acid stones have formed in the kidneys, potassium citrate has been found to be often effective in dissolving uric acid stones. It may also dissolve the more usual kidney stones made from various kinds of calcium. Both kinds of stones can become present in the kidneys in tandem. Usually the calcium ones are more numerous than the uric acid ones, but in gout patients they may be exclusively uric acid stones. \nPotassium citrate for gout prevention Potassium citrate is also used to prevent urine acidity rising again and thus the patient's risk of kidney stones (of both kinds) re-forming. And it can reduce the risk of excess uric acid turning into MSU gout crystals and causing a gout attack. \nOther causes of low urine pH Low urine pH may be caused by diarrhoea, (diarrhea). Diarrhoea is a common side effect of most gout drugs and especially colchicine, but also allopurinol, febuxostat, benzbromarone, the corticosteroids, and the NSAIDs such as indomethacin, ibuprofen and naproxen. And perhaps, probenecid and sulfinpyrazone. \nLow urine pH may also be caused by dehydration i.e. not drinking enough water. That's another reason why you must drink lots of water on any gout treatment. \nDosage Take potassium citrate for gout ONLY as directed by your doctor, (physician). When more is learnt about how well it's working, the dose can be adjusted. Your starting level of blood (serum) potassium needs to be known. The amount in over the counter (OTC), and in for-sale-online potassium citrate tablets (99 mg), is not nearly enough. You need prescription (RX) potassium citrate at a much higher dosage. \nOn prescription (RX) it may come in liquid form, not as a tablet. If you find it unpalatable, consider mixing it with a fruit juice. Pure 100% cherry juice or 100% pure orange juice, made only from squeezed oranges, are good ideas because both are gout positive. \nAvoid juices with high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) or added sugar. \nPotassium citrate does not always work effectively. If so, you could try a more alkaline diet (see the pH foods list). Foods high in potassium are usually alkaline. Potassium-magnesium citrate and potassium-sodium citrate have also been found to be effective and could also be tried. \nIf you live in a country where you can't obtain potassium citrate, or the other forms mentioned above, try increasing your potassium intake from foods, and a more alkaline diet. As noted above, a more alkaline diet was successful in a study in raising uric acid excretion by about 37%, which is considerable. (1) Also, discuss using chelated potassium (the chelated type is also better absorbed) with your doctor. \nCautions! If you are taking potassium citrate your blood potassium levels should be regularly checked by a doctor. This is even more important if you have any form of kidney disease. Excessively high potassium levels can cause hyperkalemia. Some symptoms of this are nausea (feeling sick), an irregular heartbeat, and kidney failure. It can even be life threatening. Low potassium can cause hypokalemia. Some symptoms of this are muscle weakness and cramps, fatigue, irregular heartbeats, and heart failure. Certain medications increase potassium levels. \n(1) Aya Kanbara, Masayuki Hakoda, Issei Seyama Urine alkalization facilitates uric acid excretion.

United Kingdom Prime Minister, Theresa May just declared that her government will recognize Sioux City, Iowa to be the new capital of the United States! She has ordered the relocation of the UK\u2019s embassy by the end of December, and the embassy staff are busily preparing for the move. When asked the reason behind her announcement, Ms. May said that Donald Trump wished it, and as the nation\u2019s leader, he should be able to place the capital wherever he wishes, and that besides, Iowa is considered the heartland of the U.S., and the home to the first party contest, the Iowa Caucuses, in election years.\nOkay, that is a ridiculous notion, isn\u2019t it?

Lionel Messi Barcelona superstar, Lionel Messi, has broken silence on the World Cup draw which pitted Argentina and Nigeria in the same Group D. Messi, who has faced Nigeria several times at youth and senior level, is wary of the Super Eagles, saying that they can score plenty of goals if they find their rhythm. The Barcelona number ten was excused from November\u2019s friendly between La Albiceleste and the Super Eagles, in his absence, the South Americans lost 4-2 despite leading by 2-0 at a point during the match. Messi told TyC Sports on Wednesday: \"Nigeria are like that, they have two faces. If they have their day, they score four goals, \u201dThey have very good players it was clear in the second half; but they also allow you to play, they leave gaps and many spaces are generated. Nigeria captain John Obi Mikel voted for Messi in the Best FIFA Football Awards Men\u2019s Player of the Year. \u201dWe played many times against each other, but never talked. Simply a greeting and respect forever,\u201d added Lionel Messi. Including the youth teams, Messi has been directly involved in 6 goals (4 goals, 2 assists) Argentina has scored against the Nigerian teams in five appearances. Leave a Comment...
