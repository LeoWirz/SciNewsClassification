They discussed the event, which divided Hindus and Muslims in its wake quarter of a century back, at the Press Club of India at the invitation of news website The Wire. Referring to a \"classic\" news footage of the episode, Senior journalist Saeed Naqvi said none of those featuring in it spoke for Lord Ram or what the agitation was about, but the whole exercise was \"choreographed\" and was in fact directed against Pakistan. \"I was one of those stupid converts who thought that 'Babri Masjid' was negotiable. I thought the Hindu 'aastha' was for the Ram Mandir,\" said Naqvi who was a reporter for The World Report in 1992 -- the year of Masjid demolition. \"After Babri Masjid, Indian communalism reached a pitch from where it could never retreat ... and it's going to be extremely difficult for it to make a retreat,\" he said. He added that the Babri Masjid episode was but one aspect of the race between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress for the \"consolidation of Hindu votes\" against \"minority extremism\". Another journalist who worked as a Special Correspondent for Business India recalled her ordeal of getting molested and fatally attacked at the hands of vandals when she went inside the mosque during the demolition to see what was going on. \"It was packed with saffron-clad karsevaks... Someone heard someone say 'Musalmaan' and they tried to smother me thinking I was a Muslim. Some of them even molested me and tore my clothes, until I was rescued by one of them who recognised me as I had interviewed him a day before,\" Ruchira Gupta, now an independent journalist, said. \"When I approached Advani (L.K Advani) who was at the 'terrace' and told him to ask people to stop attacking journalists, he said 'apne sath jo hua wo bhool jao, itna aitihaasic din hai uski khushi me kuchh meetha khao (Forget what happened with you, have some sweets, it's such a historic day),\" she recounted. Advani concluded his every \"Rath Yatra\", Gupta said, with an exhortation to the crowd to build the temple where Babri Masjid once stood. \"The misogyny, the sexism has become part of the ruling party (BJP)'s framework,\" she added. Praveen Jain, a photojournalist with The Pioneer then, recounted how he came across a group of people doing a proper \"rehearsal\" of the moves which felled the mosque a day later. \"I was taken to a site near the 'masjid' by a BJP MP, who gave me a saffron scarf and Vishwa Hindu Parishad i-card also... I saw several men practising there with spades and ropes upon a mound made for the purpose. The methods were used the next day in bringing down the mosque,\" Jain, with Indian Express now, said. Mark Tully, Chief of Bureau at BBC then, said: \"What was completely disgraceful was that the authority of the government completely collapsed. There was no government in Ayodhya that day. Security forces remained parked in nearby areas and offered no resistance... 'Karsevaks' had complete control over things. Obscene slogans were shouted against Muslims.\" The Supreme Court on Monday began final hearing on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid issue after 2010, the year when a high court judgement had divided the site between three parties -- Sunni Waqf Board, Nirmohi Akhara and Lord Ram Lalla. -- IANS", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "musalmaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruchira gupta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "praveen jain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naqvi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "advani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nirmohi akhara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gupta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark tully", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "babri masjid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saeed naqvi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ram lalla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l.k advani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vishwa hindu parishad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waqf board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bharatiya janata party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bureau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ians", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "babri masjid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ayodhya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:07.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a42d829ff81928f4cbae41d6f76d0c5805b56fcb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1ptr64PLjVcc6AEto4TXQCFz6RpxlKmvCR", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/v/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/v/ - Video Games - 4chan", "title": ">the more effort you put in getting an ending the", "title_full": "/v/ - >the more effort you put in getting an ending the - Video Games - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T01:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 358, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e32a05461183ace521eb8a6f6b855ddf2ea2c87f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1ptr64PLjVcc6AEto4TXQCFylT7hVY2QGLfAOkYggltZg-", "ord_in_thread": 333, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T12:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>399238407\nThere is nothing that explicitly says that, maybe it is just a really comfy chair.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:07.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7dbc4d7359646dc08b0f4676df0a0afa85cdbd9d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9OkMgiM8Cuf8Io0f0PREr1x0WaYXG.hDGZSugWUwst8hndGN_nTT9FnYPIKrxFAL3kR.ePHZtkX1S9bwiKaVfodgbMIy4G_2lKTlmRNQfVgJ5vkZwfy6y._a74NCQGunA-", "site_full": "www.civicx.com", "site": "civicx.com", "site_section": "http://www.civicx.com/forums/general-10th-gen-discussions.2/", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "General 10th Gen Discussions | 2016+ Honda Civic Forum (10th Gen) - Type R Forum, Si Forum - CivicX.com", "title": "Experiences putting regular gas in Sport/Sport Touring Models?", "title_full": "Experiences putting regular gas in Sport/Sport Touring Models? | 2016+ Honda Civic Forum (10th Gen) - Type R Forum, Si Forum - CivicX.com", "published": "2017-12-06T14:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.civicx.com/data/avatars/m/7/7033.jpg?1507579006", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 95455, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d026e3976de80f2129138f9b70a789c10f28422e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9OkMgiM8Cuf8Io0f0PREr1x0WaYXG.hDGZSugWUwst8hndGN_nTT9FnYPIKrxFAL3kR.ePHZtkX1S9bwiKaVfodgbMIy4G_2lKTlmRNQfVgJ5vkZwfy6y..WFZwIKA7B0iQl633pnZmg--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "thatwhiteSi", "published": "2017-12-06T16:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I use 87 sometimes in my Si.

While eLearning has greatly helped in making training more effective and more efficient, its testing and assessment have some huge gaping holes. How Using Technology For Proper Language Testing Affects Training \nIn 2015, over 1 in 4 UK businesses and more than 1 in 6 US businesses reported that they lost business opportunities due to a lack of foreign language skills. How can businesses ensure that proper training and assessment is in place to ensure that they don\u2019t miss out on such opportunities? Current evaluation metrics look at the basics of language skills such as spelling, proper grammar, etc. which don\u2019t always translate well *pun-intended* in a conversational setting. \nStart with having the proper evaluation metrics, not building the perfect test. Evaluation Leaves Little For Experimentation \nHistorically, and by definition, evaluation has remained an area that requires some stability. As the evaluator, it\u2019s important to remain unbiased while positioning evaluations on a stable scale over time to make it easy to compare against other results. Meanwhile, those being evaluated expect fair evaluation criteria with the ability to compare themselves against others to understand their own skill-level and competencies. \nThis makes it all the more risky to change evaluation methods due to its intricacies. While changing the learning method might be precarious, it is important to maintain a stable evaluation process to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of these learning methods. But what can we do to improve evaluation methods without disrupting the effective purpose of evaluation? The Curious Case Of Foreign Languages \nForeign language testing is a particularly relevant example of a test format designed to be analyzable but not representative of test-takers\u2019 language skills. Without the proper evaluation criteria in place, proper testing, or training cannot take place. \nThe purpose of foreign language tests is to know if a person can communicate in a specific language. Previous evaluation criteria only accounted for grammar, spelling, and understanding, testing only the limited areas of language competency. The chasm between language tests and practical language skills could not be more apparent due to the focus on the actual testing versus what is being evaluated. \nTherefore, individuals are currently evaluated on their ability to understand from a closed set of words, whereas their language competence in a business setting may require the ability to express ideas and feelings on open topics or situations. Digital To The Rescue \nThe digital age has ushered in a new era of learning: eLearning. The eLearning market, as a whole, was worth $165 billion back in 2015 and, with a projected 5% growth rate, is set to hit $182 billion by the end of 2017. While eLearning continues to grow and influence the way organizations do train those within, not much has changed in evaluating how effective these training programs are. eTesting, for a lack of a better term, has long been overlooked and ignored. When it comes to learning and evaluating foreign language skills, eLearning has made it easier and more effective but the lack of proper eTesting has limited its efficacy. \nUntil recently, assessing the ability to express oneself in a foreign language meant a lengthy appointment with a language teacher. Not only was such a process complex and an expensive logistical headache, but it also limited its availability and efficiency. Going digital may have addressed most of these issues but leveraging digital technology correctly can be the difference between proper language mastery that accounts for cultural factors, and basic language proficiency. 3 Tips To Help You Develop Suitable Foreign Language Assessments \nSo, where do we go from here? Here are 3 tips you can have in mind before creating foreign language assessments: 1. Utilize Native-Language Speakers \nNative-language speakers may be your most valuable asset in evaluating language competencies. Not only do these native speakers know the strict use of language (i.e. spelling, grammar, punctuation, etc.), but they also have the knowledge of a conversational language. \nConversational language is more than the know-how of how to communicate verbally with peers. Knowing how to speak informally can signal to others a level of cultural understanding which, in turn, leads to more natural and organic business interactions. 2. Separate Test-Takers From The Test-Grader \nOften times, language tests put a tremendous amount of stress on both the test-taker and the evaluator. For the evaluator, they must constantly take into account what they observe with what they hear and what they feel during their conversation. Are they using proper grammar? Do responses feel formulaic and impersonal? Does their body language affect the message they are sending? \nWe have found that this stimulation overload can make it difficult to perform a proper assessment as an evaluator. But this overload can also be detrimental to the test-takers' typical performance, leading to an improper display of language skills. In the same way that an evaluator must account for multiple variables during this interaction, the test-taker must consider not only what they are saying but how they are saying it while also attempting to read the evaluator to gauge how they are doing. \nKeeping the test-taker and the test-grader separate leads to a more objective assessment of language skill. By utilizing recorded and written responses, the assessment can focus solely on language use, thereby leading to an appropriate evaluation of language skill. And likewise, for the test-taker, the specific focus on language skill will lead to a more natural display of language ability, leading to an effective and proper assessment. 3. Use Role-Playing Scenarios \nCommunication in another language is a two-way street: one must be able to understand and interpret what is being spoken or read, but it is also important that they are able to communicate their thoughts and opinions as well. The ability to carry or create organic and natural conversations should be the goal of any training program or testing assessment. The best way to test and evaluate an individual\u2019s ability to express ideas and thoughts on open topics, which are bountiful in a professional setting, is to utilize role-playing. \nRole-playing has been an effective method for teaching and learning languages but it has rarely been used when evaluating language skills. Often times, these role-playing scenarios require more deep and thoughtful responses that take time to prepare before actually conveying the message as a test-taker. Not only is this unnatural and formulaic in a personal conversation, but it is disruptive in replicating natural communication. \nUsing role-playing against a limited timeframe is a perfect method for assessing an individual\u2019s true ability in a language. Creating scenarios that reflect typical types of interactions within an organization can also lead to a stronger assessment of an individual\u2019s language skills with respect to organizational needs. A Few Final Words \nIn view of the efforts made by businesses today centered around training, it seems important to discuss the subject of evaluation. A good measure of skills will help guide learners better. How can one verify that training has been effective without a relevant and objective evaluation? \nDigital technology gives us access to a wide array of intelligence that is available at all times. Rather than using technology for the sole purpose of process automation, we must use digital technology to take a step back and completely rethink specific ways of operating. In the case of evaluation, it would be a shame not to take advantage of technology and continue evaluating today\u2019s learners the same way we have for the past 50 years.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:07.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4db19b982ba46b6daa9fb474e15491e18bfb09dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSrY3zTBFQr2qgROFi_9LlEtSh.a4kqwtJRa7TtcyqfyQ7wRCOMmu8UcWcagnIg9xQJJE3DLoDWgl35xzF4DAd", "site_full": "itunes.apple.com", "site": "apple.com", "site_section": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/ios-finance/id6015?mt=8", "site_categories": ["tech", "television", "shopping", "mac_support", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Finance - App Store Downloads on iTunes", "title": "Edward Jones Mobile", "title_full": "Edward Jones Mobile on the App Store", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/26/19/22/261922b8-d6b1-1f4a-b19f-0c0072602f7f/source/1200x630bb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 49, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2f7a4212e5183323d38d44f23a5fc0d933f4f02f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSrY3zTBFQr2qgROFi_9LlEtSh.a4kqwtJRa7TtcyqfyQ7wRCOMmu8UcWcagnIg9xQJJE3DLoDWnYMTsh.hXA6wDz5TjB6YpYDyZlK4OH5RB3zjaGOhWF2thqpV8Wkv9Y-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Shine247on", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Deleting the app and reinstalling fix\u2019s the crash on iPhone X", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 5.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:08.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3bb01450ffbfa4cd1ebecc11c758bfe93389a244", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4LzrP9xcgD9cCFT0PH.1vLy_airzTlLqg1S_huiGwXw8AGAXF.TqzDPJSay0X3l0qI.Q-", "site_full": "www.booking.com", "site": "booking.com", "site_section": "https://www.booking.com/hotel/it/agriturismo-palazzo-barbo.en-gb.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Apartment Palazzo Barb\u00f2, Pumenengo, Italy - Booking.com ", "title": "117 Verified Apartment Reviews of Palazzo Barb\u00f2 | Booking.com", "title_full": "117 Verified Apartment Reviews of Palazzo Barb\u00f2 | Booking.com", "published": "2017-04-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://t-ec.bstatic.com/static/img/facebook-image-else/566c7081f1deeaca39957e96365c3908f83b95af.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 105, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0baae211048964c6a84f95b32e2353c55aaae630", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4LzrP9xcgD9cCFT0PH.1vLy_airzTlLqg1S_huiGwXw8AGAXF.TqzDPJS7sfgZT9C0xetuuEvxqdE3ckQ8zeH3eXSJYifO0FGDvR0skVQWLxjOA--", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "Oleh", "published": "2017-11-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "\"Ideal place for quiet and romantic relax for families, group of friends and couples.\"", "text": "\ub209 Periodically problems with hot water supplying in the bathroom took place, but that was not serious problem.\n\ub207 Everything was fine!

MDA to host mental health meetings for farmers Department is partnering with U-M to provide meetings across the state in six locations this winter. Dec 07, 2017 \nThe Minnesota Department of Agriculture is partnering with a number of other organizations, including the University of Minnesota Extension, to offer free three-hour workshops to help agricultural advisers and others who work with farmers to recognize and respond when they suspect a farmer or farm family member might need mental health help. The workshops will be held early next year. \nStress factors are on the rise for Minnesota farmers. Many face financial problems, price and marketing uncertainties, farm transfer issues, production challenges and more. Ag advisers and other who work with farmers may know of clients and friends who are struggling with stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, feelings of indecision or suicidal thoughts. \nThose encouraged to attend the workshops include anyone who interacts with farmers on a regular basis \u2014county, state and federal agency staff, veterinarians, bankers, crop consultants, clergy, farm organization staff and board members, social service workers, nurses and other medical professionals, farm management and high school ag instructors, Extension staff and others. \nWorkshop attendees will learn: \n\u2022 How to recognize the signs of mental and emotional distress and crisis \n\u2022 Active listening skills \n\u2022 What local and regional resources are available to farmers in distress or crisis \n\u2022 How to improve confidence about delivering difficult information to farmers \n\u2022 When to use anger de-escalation strategies, if necessary \n\u2022 The importance of taking care of your own emotional and mental health in stressful situations \nPresenters at the workshops will be: \n\u2022 Ted Matthews, director of Mental Health Outreach.

Dele Alli in action for Tottenham this season MORE: Manchester United transfer news \nWith 39 goals in 114 games for Tottenham from midfield, it\u2019s little surprise to see the 21-year-old attracting so much interest from elite European sides as he looks set for a big future at the top level of the game. \nUnited could do with that kind of quality in attack after being somewhat reliant on Romelu Lukaku for goals this season, but Tottenham would probably rather lose him to a foreign club than a Premier League rival. \nGiven Alli\u2019s new links with Mendes, it seems that could end up leading to a move to Madrid if Don Balon\u2019s latest claims are anything to go by. \nThe report claims that Alli could favour Real over Barca, who themselves may be leaning more towards signing Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jorge mendes", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "jose mourinho", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "manchester united", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "dele alli recent", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "real madrid", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "locations": [{"name": "tottenham", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:09.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7f592edd3848ac1e47f595c4f4117d688b48da6a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LJXICgYNfZBmzdZ1kuumsJX0jlZoys5.jonAiA29T4imUgwFtjaGyiO.jeG3hyduAei5PsCLr86usS1FG8_I_WDZSH1nzvuomRfKUuT.LZbJnoUa1P3oz", "site_full": "www.webotopia.org", "site": "webotopia.org", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/WebotopiaDirectory", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "media", "tech"], "section_title": "Webotopia", "title": "Creditshout LLC", "title_full": "Creditshout LLC", "published": "2017-12-07T13:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7f592edd3848ac1e47f595c4f4117d688b48da6a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LJXICgYNfZBmzdZ1kuumsJX0jlZoys5.jonAiA29T4imUgwFtjaGyiO.jeG3hyduAei5PsCLr86usS1FG8_I_WDZSH1nzvuomRfKUuT.LZbJnoUa1P3oz", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T13:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "Creditshout LLC", "text": "  Business \u0165 B2B \u0165 Financial Services \u0165 Creditshout LLC Creditshout LLC \nProvides financial information on credit cards, credit score, loans, and wireless plans.

Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall.\nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation.\nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box \u2014 although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months.\nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters.\nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action.\n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\"\nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\"\nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East.\nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move.\nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\"\nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts.\n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.\nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\"\nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\"\nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court.\nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\"\nTrump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric.\n\"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\"\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=On%20Jerusalem%2C%20Trump%20delivers%20for%20supporters%20at%20home&url=http://nydn.us/2nFQ97Q"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ilan goldenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron david miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill galston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for a new american security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east security program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faith and freedom coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:09.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db9d34907481b9d87003fcb6f6ef89f70c2c7e06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYyoODA_sG6MMGxFh26nSAvLJ6w0UaF3CPvabZwKjyAdBlf88U.YW_oBFrMl852BWeTT8aAkq8XjQpFFSQIR1KIeSLXM8OPmM2CXspyV3qoWjSh54vrpB1RPb3SZ_62puPKPdsk_pzBTp8.A2QII9SyA--", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.co.za", "site": "tripadvisor.co.za", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/ShowForum-g274684-i94-Czech_Republic.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Czech Republic Forum, Travel Discussion for Czech Republic -

Post written by Josh Ong Josh Ong is the director of marketing and communications at Cheetah Mobile , the #4 mobile app developer in the world. Forbes Councils Shutterstock For some reason, popular perception has it that millennials are particularly brand averse. In fact, the opposite is true: Millennials are more likely than any other demographic to be brand loyal . But millennials don\u2019t choose which brands to be loyal to at random; instead, they are highly attuned to the story that a brand tells, as well as the values that the brand exhibits. Generally, millennials choose to vote with their wallets for brands that tell inspiring stories, conduct business ethically or contribute to their personal brands. At the same time, millennials have been gravitating away from established corporate brands and toward newer companies with less name recognition. It\u2019s become less about the logo and more about the product itself. \nInstead of a brand\u2019s cachet revolving around the ubiquity and recognizability of its logo, the focus has shifted to the values the brand itself espouses, which in turn translate to a kind of quality assurance. If a brand has shown itself to be upstanding in its business dealings, the theory goes, then its product is higher quality and more worthy of purchase by extension. \nA brand can be seen to be ethical in several ways: First, by announcing their commitment to the environment and taking care to remain environmentally friendly; second, by promoting the steps they take to ensure that the workers who make their product are well paid and treated well; and third, by offering their product at a lower price point than their competition, without the upcharge that a familiar brand name would charge. By incorporating one (or all) of these principles, a brand can present itself as an organization that performs a public service, instead of a company working to make a profit. \nAn easy way for brands to present themselves as ethical is simply by eschewing the traditional trappings of branding, such as logos, slogans and bright packaging. By distancing themselves from the established practices of large, well-known corporations, these brands can position themselves as being the antithesis of big business, instead focusing on providing a high-quality product for a lower price. It\u2019s not hard to see how this message would be appealing to millennials, given how important social activism and collective action are among the demographic. In fact, one survey conducted in the U.S. found that millennials were more likely to buy items associated with a particular cause. Forbes Communications Council is an invitation-only community for executives in successful public relations, media strategy, creative and advertising agencies. Do I qualify? \nA recent Kickstarter campaign centered around a company that wanted to make non-branded CPG products (e.g., soap with no brand name on it) that would be sold at a lower price point than typical drugstore products. The campaign ended up raising over $680,000 , nearly 34 times their initial target of $20,000. One of the first things you notice about the brand (called Public Goods) is how it packages its products: the bottles are sleek, white and, if you were to discount the plain black text across the front identifying the contents within, virtually indistinguishable from one another.

La gama Admiral ofrece diferentes versiones de correa, ya sea de caucho vulcanizado o piel, as\u00ed como una gran variedad de tonalidades. Dentro de esta l\u00ednea, destaca el original dise\u00f1o del Admiral AC-One 45 Chronograph Bronze en madera de teca y bronce patinado, un tratamiento exclusivo de la marca que confiere a la pieza un car\u00e1cter marino m\u00e1s pronunciado.

Corum tiene el orgullo de contribuir a perpetuar los valores y el buen hacer de la alta relojer\u00eda. Siguiendo el camino trazado por los fundadores, mantiene su lealtad a las colecciones legendarias sin por ello renunciar a enriquecerlas con un toque de modernidad que lleva el distintivo de la innovaci\u00f3n y los avances t\u00e9cnicos.

Director General of Civil Aviation ( DGCA ), B S Bhullar, said the pre-condition of taking clearance from the regulatory agency (called YA number ) will be removed for Indian-registered charter flight or private jets to fly out of the country from December 15. The regulator may extend this relief to foreign registered charter flight or private jets by January-end. \n\nCurrently both Indian aircraft owners and foreign jet setters find it tough to go abroad and fly in, respectively, due to a maze of rules. The situation is worse if business leaders or high net worth individuals have a last-minute travel plan on a weekend when government offices are closed and are unable to give the required clearances. \n\nAfter holding discussions with other government agencies like security and defence ministries on this issue, the aviation authorities decided to remove the pre-condition of YA number for Indian-registered business and charter aircraft jets to facilitate the ease of doing business. These operators will then just file their flight plan with air traffic control and go abroad. \n\nThe Indian charter industry is relieved at the prospect of YA number being done away with. Business Aircraft Operators' Association (BAOA) president Rohit Kapur had recently told TOI: \"YA number was required earlier when DGCA oversight on operators was limited and every (Indian-registered) aircraft leaving the country needed the regulator's nod which was given after ensuing the plane had the operational capability to do so. Now, DGCA oversight and certification process ensures that operators are given this clearance at the time of initial clearance itself and do not need case-to-case permission for every flight.\" \n\nKapur added that YA number was a requirement unique to India. \"Doing away with YA will ensure operators can fly overseas without delay and this will also free up DGCA resources,\" he had said. \n\nLast April, VistaJet \u2014 one of the world's largest private jet charter companies \u2014 had said getting clearances on a weekend to even overfly India was tough. Thomas Flohr , founder and chairman of this multinational company, had to fly from Myanmar to Dubai on a Monday last year. The company sought DGCA nod to overfly India on the preceding Friday.

No en vano ambas son producciones de la compa\u00f1\u00eda germano-brit\u00e1nica Magic Light Pictures, responsable de llevar al cine \"El Gr\u00fafalo\", otro t\u00edtulo de Julia Donaldson, o los \"Cuentos Revueltos\" de Roald Dahl, una producci\u00f3n por la que est\u00e1n obteniendo multitud de reconocimientos y que se pudo disfrutar recientemente en el certamen El Meu Primer Festival.\n\n\nDirigida por Jeroen Jaspaert y Daniel Snaddon en 2015, \"La Navidad del Hombre Rama\" ( Stickman ) es una producci\u00f3n de media hora de duraci\u00f3n que desarrolla una aventura \u00e9pica de un bastoncillo viviente que habita el tronco de un gran roble de un parque infantil con su se\u00f1ora Ramita y sus tres hijos, hasta que un d\u00eda que sale fuera de su \u00e1rbol una serie de percances le conducen muy lejos de su hogar, lo que da inicio a una odisea para tratar de volver con su familia a tiempo para Navidad.\nLa versi\u00f3n original cont\u00f3 con las voces de Martin Freeman como Hombre Rama, Hugh Bonneville como Santa, Rob Brydon, Sally Hawkins, Jennifer Saunders y Russell Tovey. Estrenada en la BBC se convirti\u00f3 en el cuarto programa m\u00e1s visto del d\u00eda de Navidad, con m\u00e1s de 9 millones de espectadores y un share del 41%.\nLos espectadores encontrar\u00e1n en esta pel\u00edcula de aventuras una historia vibrante que pone en valor la calidez de los lazos familiares y la importancia de ayudar siempre al pr\u00f3jimo. El Se\u00f1or Rama mostrar\u00e1 con su inagotable tes\u00f3n y determinaci\u00f3n lo importante que es para \u00e9l volver con los suyos, al tiempo que las situaciones por las que pasa demuestran que es un ser querido por todos aqu\u00e9llos que han recibido alguna vez su ayuda o su amabilidad, gestos que siempre acaban teniendo un retorno.\nLa propuesta se enmarca de nuevo en la l\u00ednea de las deliciosas producciones que la distribuidora Rita & Luca Films selecciona para los m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os, caracterizadas por ofrecer miradas a un cine alejado de las propuestas eminentemente comerciales, y en el que destaca el cuidado trabajo de autor y una narrativa especialmente pensada para el joven espectador.\n\n\n\"La Escoba Voladora\" ( Room on the Broom ) es una producci\u00f3n de 2012 dirigida por Max Lang y Jan Lachauer donde una bruja muy simp\u00e1tica permite, muy a pesar de su gato, que un perro, un p\u00e1jaro y una rana que la ayudaron a recuperar algunos objetos, monten en su escoba, haci\u00e9ndola demasiado pesada para volar. Pronto se encontrar\u00e1n perseguidos por el malvado drag\u00f3n que intentar\u00e1 por todos los medios comerse a la buena bruja. \nNominada a los Oscar, se trata de una aventura de 25 minutos cuya versi\u00f3n original cont\u00f3 con las voces de Gillian Anderson (Bruja), Rob Brydon (Gato), Martin Clunes (Perro), Sally Hawkins (P\u00e1jaro), Simon Pegg (Narrador), Timothy Spall (Drag\u00f3n) y David Walliams (Rana).\nLa alegre m\u00fasica y el tono divertido de la pel\u00edcula la convierten en una alternativa muy indicada para los ni\u00f1os y ni\u00f1as durante estas fiestas, que encontrar\u00e1n en ella una aventura excitante que les har\u00e1 pensar sobre los beneficios de la generosidad y del trabajo en equipo.\n\n\nLa pel\u00edcula se podr\u00e1 ver en castellano en Verdi Madrid y en catal\u00e1n en las siguientes salas:\nVerdi Park Barcelona Zumzeig Cinema Barcelona  Cinemes Girona Barcelona  Rambla de l\u2019Art Cambrils  Jca Cinemes Alpicat  Jca Cinemes Valls

Delante del objetivo de la famosa fot\u00f3grafa americana Cass Bird aparece su amiga Mia Kang (modelo, ex-agente de bolsa y campeona de Muay Thai), en una campa\u00f1a de im\u00e1genes que captan su belleza natural y su fuerza interior. El enfoque personal de las im\u00e1genes y el v\u00ednculo real entre la fot\u00f3grafa y la modelo muestran la conexi\u00f3n que experimenta una mujer a trav\u00e9s de una amistad \u00fanica. \u00f3n de fotos: \u201cCuando encuentras el punto medio entre belleza y fuerza o vulnerabilidad y humor es como si ganaras un partido. Eres capaz de sentir su humor y su aire pensativo al mismo tiempo. Mia fue la primera persona en la que pens\u00e9 en cuanto vi el perfil que se buscaba\u201d. Tras ver las im\u00e1genes de campa\u00f1a, Mia Kang a\u00f1ade: \u201cEl resultado es tan humano: esta soy yo y mis imperfecciones. La gente suele verme de forma s\u00faper humana\u201d. Al hablar de sus art\u00edculos favoritos de la colecci\u00f3n: \u201cEs un sujetador push up y hasta ahora no ten\u00eda ni idea de lo que era. Es muy c\u00f3modo y me hace sentir como si no lo llevara. Tiene una forma muy bonita y natural\u201d. Las ocho im\u00e1genes muestran a Mia con las piezas clave de la colecci\u00f3n Iris and Lilly. \u00c9sta se basa en la idea de que buscar la lencer\u00eda perfecta es como encontrar a tu mejor amiga. Te aporta confianza, compartes tus momentos m\u00e1s personales. Esa amiga divertida con la que salir de fiesta y, al mismo tiempo, con la que quedarte en el sof\u00e1 de casa. Esa amiga con la que te sientes tan c\u00f3moda que parece que os conoc\u00e9is desde siempre.Esta nueva colecci\u00f3n se compone de m\u00e1s de 500 prendas. Desde conjuntos delicados de encaje hasta modelos atl\u00e9ticos en colores clave como el rosa pastel, el azul met\u00e1lico o el negro cl\u00e1sico. Sarah Miles, directora de Iris & Lilly, a\u00f1ade sobre la campa\u00f1a: \u201cEl prop\u00f3sito de esta campa\u00f1a es el de capturar algo verdadero, una historia \u00fanica que muestre de forma diferente c\u00f3mo las mujeres eligen qu\u00e9 tipo de lencer\u00eda llevar y comprar. Y es algo que impactar\u00e1 a los clientes de Amazon Moda\u201d. Amazon Amazon se gu\u00eda por cuatro principios: enfoque en el consumidor, pasi\u00f3n por la invenci\u00f3n, compromiso con la excelencia de sus operaciones y visi\u00f3n a largo plazo. Opiniones de los clientes, compra en 1-Clic, recomendaciones personalizadas, Amazon Prime, Log\u00edstica de Amazon, Amazon Web Services, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire, Fire TV, Amazon Echo y Alexa son algunos de los productos y servicios pioneros ofrecidos por Amazon.

The court asked the central government and the DGCA to file their response and posted the matter for further hearing on March 20, 2018. \"This is very dangerous. These are matters where you (Centre and DGCA) need to take steps,\" the bench said. The court asked the aviation regulator to place before it the flight timings and duty timings of pilots. It asked the DGCA whether there was any law which allowed pilots to fly more than eight hours. The plea filed by Kerala resident Yeshwanth Shenoy alleged that the DGCA's norm on the FDTL was violative of rules, as it allowed air operators to stretch the duty hours of pilots resulting into fatigue to them. The prescribed norm for pilots was maximum eight hours flight time and six landings per day, but it was being flouted under the regulator's watch, Shenoy told the court.

LISTEN TO THIS EPISODE Podcast Subscribe Apple Podcasts Spotify Google Play RSS FROM THIS EPISODE \nIf, like me, you are obsessed with the welfare of P-22 and the rest of the mountain lions, coyotes, bears and other wild life struggling to survive the colonization of Los Angeles, you might like Walton Ford's new paintings. Walton Ford, \"Grifo de California,\" 2017 Watercolor, gouache and ink on paper 60 1/2 x 83 3/4 inches (153 x 212.7 cm) Courtesy Gagosian \nAt Gagosian in Beverly Hills, you'll find his watercolors of such animals, some endangered like mountain lions, or already extinct, like grizzly bears. Some are fantastical creatures, such as his hybrid of a condor rendered as a uniquely Californian griffin. All reside in a sun-bleached Southern California landscape of past and present, a mash of violent history and incomparable beauty. Walton Ford, \"La Brea,\" 2016 Watercolor, gouache and ink on paper Each 60 1/2 x 119 1/2 inches (153.7 x 303.5 cm) Courtesy Gagosian \nFord is well-known for an illustrational talent akin to that of John James Audabon, the 19th century painter of birds, but he works on a cinematic scale. An entire wall of the gallery is devoted to three five-foot long panels of the city at sunset. A familiar view of the LA basin, with grids of lights, gives way to a scene of saber-toothed tigers escaped from the La Brea Tar Pits and attacking a mountain lion. Walton Ford, \"La Madre, 1849,\" 2017 Watercolor, gouache and ink on paper, mounted on aluminum panel 108 x 144 inches (274.3 x 354.8 cm) Courtesy Gagosian \nDespite Ford's East Coast upbringing, or maybe because of it, he dives into a history of the area that can be lost in the relentless and overwhelming demands of the present. This state was named after the fictional island of California as described in the 1510 novel Las sergas de Esplandi\u00e1n by Garci Rodr\u00edguez de Montalvo. In the novel, the island is populated only by dark-skinned women ruled by the warrior queen Calafia. Their armor is made of gold, the only metal on the island. Though inspired by this lively story, Ford's paintings are indebted equally to the Wild West as imagined by Hollywood. The model for his painting of Califia is Naomi Campbell. Walton Ford, \"Los Ni\u00f1os,\" 2017 Watercolor, gouache and ink on paper 41 5.8 x 59 5/8 inches (105.7 x 151.4 com) Courtesy Gagosian \nIt is Ford's meld of fact and fantasy, his layering of current concerns with those of the past, which coalesce as an exhibition that is teasingly instructional and lavishly rendered. Chris Burden, \"Scale Model of The Solar System\" (detail), 1983 Installation at Gagosian Beverly Hills \u00a9 Chris Burden Photo by Jeff McLane \nIn the upper level gallery at Gagosian, there is a group show that includes Scale Model of the Solar System (1983), a rarely exhibited piece by the late Chris Burden. A golden model of the sun, 13 inches in diameter, hangs from the ceiling while vitrines around the gallery contain the planets Mercury, Venus and Earth, each in proportion to their actual size and arranged according to their proportional distance from one another in space. To maintain this concept, the rest of the planets had be installed outside of the gallery, which leads a dedicated viewer on a walking tour of Beverly Hills. Maps are available at the gallery. The furthest is the dwarf planet Pluto, almost a mile away, on view at Jersey Mike's Subs. \nThe shows continue to December 16.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chris burden walton ford", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "walton ford", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "chris burden  hunter drohojowska-philp", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "john james audabon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff mclane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris burden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calafia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naomi campbell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garci rodr\u00edguez de montalvo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ford", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gagosian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la brea tar pits", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "califia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wild west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jersey mike", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pluto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beverly hills", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gagosian gallery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gagosian beverly hills", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:13.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a42d829ff81928f4cbae41d6f76d0c5805b56fcb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1ptr64PLjVcc6AEto4TXQCFz6RpxlKmvCR", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/v/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/v/ - Video Games - 4chan", "title": ">the more effort you put in getting an ending the", "title_full": "/v/ - >the more effort you put in getting an ending the - Video Games - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T01:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 358, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e0c8153dc79fd942691a6e101d22ba877adfcc89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1ptr64PLjVcc6AEto4TXQCFylT7hVY2QGLgspW4i.lSK4-", "ord_in_thread": 344, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T13:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>399241675\nAlready beat ludwig.
