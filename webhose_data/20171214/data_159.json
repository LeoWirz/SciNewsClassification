Voice : Discord Loot : RC Loot Council Goal : Our goal is to complete Mythic progression before next expansion while working around real life and having fun together in WoW. We plan to establish this by creating/maintaining a cohesive, tight-knit, long-term family oriented team that can anticipate each other\u2019s play style and excel through content at a fun steady pace.\nWhat makes us different than many other raiding guilds:\nActivity - Weekly Antorus raids, Achieve runs, BGS, mythic + runs and more! Humor - Whether in guild chat/discord, there is always something to laugh about Understanding - Most of our guild is either in college or working adults with families. We understand real life schedules and family situations Honesty - We will always be up front and to the point from day one Helpful \u2013 We will assist with getting you raid ready so long as you are willing to put the same effort in advancing the guild. We will not just hold your hand.\nWe consider all quality applicants.

Elk, Moose, the bears I have killed, and various domestic cattle and horses are not as big or tough as cape buffalo, so if someone with actual experience were to tell me that the 300 Gr Noslet Partition was lacking on Cape Buffalo I would have to believe him, (especially if they had experience on several instead of just 1-2) but for anything I have hunted, they have been as close to perfect as a bullet could be.

Samsung also announced an app for YouTube on its 2016 and 2017 models. \nPhilips partnered with Roku to launch a line of smart-TVs that use Roku's platform, which simplifies remote control needs and content navigation. \nIndeed, more than 50% of U.S. broadband households find voice control appealing for entertainment and smart home devices. \nLast year, consumers bought an estimated 14 million voice-controlled smart speakers with personal assistants, and companies such as Roku, TiVo, and Comcast bowed voice-enabled remote controls. \n\"Voice recognition and control \u2026 will be a key trend in connected CE for 2018,\" said analyst Dina Abdelrazik. \u201cWe expect to see more voice innovations in streaming services and connected platforms at CES this year.\" Related Links :", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "erik gruenwedel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roku", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer kent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dina abdelrazik", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "amazon music", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philips", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tivo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "comcast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parks associates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:54.054+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9da725d3319e0afbc69154db2a2ea7369cf715a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9D2Qkpp6vWSMwMM8NxS2qQ4nMVF4sMvv9Bob7v5bEBIiZGAzw.Y2i2CMuZXRehESroSpYgwxQZUG_m9nBZS8a5Uoq36Hs4RMoEVO7YfY8gpvuuHN5JjWEt", "site_full": "www.lse.co.uk", "site": "lse.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.lse.co.uk/share-chat.asp?page=216", "site_categories": ["united_kingdom", "travel", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Share Chat on London South East.

Bob Walsh First the good news. The house has passed HR 38 on to the senate. This is the national concealed carry reciprocity bill. If it passes into law you will be able to carry your gat in New York or Illinois while traveling thru if you have a permit from elsewhere, or if you live in a state that does not require a permit to carry. Another good thing the Republicans have done recently. Now the bad news, another tragic and stupid accidental death. A five-year old in Anchorage found a loaded gun in a night stand and managed to kill himself with it in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. There was no evidence of drugs or drunk parents, just ordinary stupidity and carelessness. I don't know what, if any, laws Alaska has about gun storage and rugrats but it is still a tragedy no matter what way you slice it..", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bob walsh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "illinois", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anchorage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alaska", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:54.069+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "004c65fe6d099f70e1ea47622898b394b6d19e85", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ.mqIAMzQIBZFbVhxXEQze55Q96aeWEJP8WSEv5AZxzjeaDHpDEICSmTy6XA3AGZzHMaByUcBjzRi0CBTSe9dVBbpWK0XjwEtHgKcAjNztaCQmjBVRYMSnB4jgDnvB58A-", "site_full": "www.power987.co.za", "site": "power987.co.za", "site_section": "http://www.power987.co.za/feed", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "POWER 98.7", "title": "Khaya Majola Cricket Week identifying South Africa\u2019s future heroes", "title_full": "Khaya Majola Cricket Week identifying South Africa\u2019s future heroes", "published": "2017-12-07T09:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.power987.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Lesego_Senokwane_of_North_West_during_day_2_of_the_Coca-Cola_Khaya_Majola_Week_at_Sinoville_Oval_2.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "004c65fe6d099f70e1ea47622898b394b6d19e85", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ.mqIAMzQIBZFbVhxXEQze55Q96aeWEJP8WSEv5AZxzjeaDHpDEICSmTy6XA3AGZzHMaByUcBjzRi0CBTSe9dVBbpWK0XjwEtHgKcAjNztaCQmjBVRYMSnB4jgDnvB58A-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sport Reporter", "published": "2017-12-07T09:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "Khaya Majola Cricket Week identifying South Africa\u2019s future heroes", "text": "Khaya Majola Cricket Week identifying South Africa\u2019s future heroes 9 Subscribe Form here \nKhaya Majola Cricket Week is where South Africa\u2019s future cricket heroes are made. The U19 cricket tournament will see over 200 of the top young players from around the country and neighbouring country Namibia, battle it out in an action-packed week. This year, the tournament returns to Johannesburg and will take place from 17-21 December 2017. \nThe tournament, which is synonymous in showcasing the best in the country\u2019s, up and coming, youth cricket talent, has produced more than 80 Proteas since South Africa\u2019s readmission into the international cricket arena. The recently capped Protea, Wiaan Mulder, captained Gauteng at the 2016 Coca-Cola Khaya Majola Week, when he returned to the tournament for a third year in a row. In the same year, the allrounder was promoted to franchise cricket and played his maiden game for the bizhub Highveld Lions. \nFollowing a brilliant 2016 cricket season, Mulder was chosen to lead the SA Schools team as they took on the SA Colts team during the annual Cubs Week tournament. This year proved to be a breakthrough year for the 19-year-old as he was selected to captain the Coca-Cola u19 team in matches against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, played in the SA A side and also made his debut for the Proteas in an ODI match against Bangladesh. \nPhindile Phiri, Coca-Cola Africa\u2019s Senior Communications Manager, Brand Experience commented, \u201cCoca-Cola Africa has been a proud sponsor of the Coca-Cola Khaya Majola Cricket Week for the past 39 years and we have witnessed some of the best cricket talent come through its ranks. It\u2019s great to see players like Wiaan Mulder, who played in the tournament a year ago, be part of the Proteas setup. The Coca-Cola Khaya Majola Cricket Week is a platform for identifying the best in youth cricket. We look forward to seeing more talent being unearthed at this year\u2019s tournament.\u201d \nAt this year\u2019s Coca-Cola Khaya Majola Cricket Week, Coca-Cola will once again be recognising standout players with the prestigious Coca-Cola Hero of the Day award. The Coca-Cola Hero of the Day is not necessarily the best player on the field, but the player that really stood out during the match. He could be the wicketkeeper who made an amazing dive catch, a tail-ender who smashed a reverse sweep for six to win the match or even the player showing sportsmanship and embodying the spirit of the gentleman\u2019s game. \n\u201cThe aim of the CSA Pipeline is for CSA to be the best cricket playing nation in the world and to achieve this each level of the pipeline needs to play its strategic part,\u201d commented CSA General Manager: Cricket, Corrie van Zyl. \u201cSchools cricket has always been the backbone of the pipeline and it is important that this remains the case.\u201d \nLook out for the future heroes of South African cricket taking part at this year\u2019s Coca-Cola Khaya Majola Cricket Week from 17-21 December 2017.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "khaya majo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mulder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phindile phiri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wiaan mulder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corrie van zyl", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "khaya majola cricket week", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coca-cola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coca-cola khaya majola week", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "highveld lions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coca-cola khaya majola cricket week", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sa colts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coca-cola africa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gauteng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bangladesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sri lanka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "namibia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:54.070+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b7b7a53146aab11746823073a38d93058ec5d12c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRISb1AZdTREhGihql.sj7pudjPBfIkoMKQsI0npE45Xdo5DeekHZP1ofYDdMnW0H0qh.FGfqND7w--", "site_full": "boards.cruisecritic.com", "site": "cruisecritic.com", "site_section": "https://boards.cruisecritic.com/forumdisplay.php?f=634", "site_categories": ["travel", "cruises"], "section_title": "Ask a Cruise Question - Cruise Critic Message Board Forums", "title": "All Dining Times Waitlisted on Carnival", "title_full": "All Dining Times Waitlisted on Carnival - Cruise Critic Message Board Forums", "published": "2017-06-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 18, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.r.cruisecritic.com/logos/CruiseCriticLogo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4904, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f9bf2946236b36be45d8c4e0109b080c1571387f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRISb1AZdTREhGihql.sj7pudjPBfIkoMKQsI0npE45Xdo5DeekHZP1ofYDdMnW0H3S2j5opTnBCnZ549ecOluQ", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "ThottiCruise", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : J.

Despite an ongoing investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department, no charges have been filed, according to The New York Times . \nIn a statement, Masterston decried the allegations. \n\u201cLaw enforcement investigated these claims more than 15 years ago and determined them to be without merit,\u201d said the actor. \u201cI have never been charged with a crime, let alone convicted of one.

Captain Munnerlyn has 20 tackles and two sacks this season for the Panthers. Tim Fuller/USA TODAY Sports \n\u201cI think there was a certain number they didn\u2019t want to go past,\" Munnerlyn said of the Vikings. \u201cI let my agent handle it. But to come back here was a no-brainer for me. I still had my house here. This is the organization that drafted me, that gave me the opportunity to play the game I love.\" \nBut yes, Munnerlyn added, \u201cI left millions on the table. But it\u2019s OK. I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\" \nThe Panthers selected Munnerlyn in the seventh round of the 2009 draft out of South Carolina. They wanted him to stay after the 2013 season, but then-general manager Dave Gettleman had salary-cap issues and couldn\u2019t compete with the money Munnerlyn was offered in the free-agent market. \nMunnerlyn admitted he chased the money when he signed a three-year, $11.5 million deal with the Vikings. \nWhen Gettleman had money to compete this past offseason, Munnerlyn didn\u2019t hesitate to return. \n\u201cHow can I say this?

Read More Cheeky students rip off more than \u00a31500 of coffee from University of Glasgow machine \nThey are working to scale up the technology using real ethanol fermentation broths, which contain up to 90 per cent water along with other impurities. \nProfessor Duncan Wass said: \u201cThe alcohol in alcoholic drinks is actually ethanol \u2013 exactly the same molecule that we want to convert into butanol as a petrol replacement. \n\u201cSo alcoholic drinks are an ideal model for industrial ethanol fermentation broths \u2013 ethanol for fuel is essentially made using a brewing process. Scientists will be testing whether they can convert the ethanol in beer into a petrol replacement (Image: AFP/Getty) \n\u201cIf our technology works with alcoholic drinks \u2013 especially beer, which is the best model \u2013 then it shows it has the potential to be scaled up to make butanol as a petrol replacement on an industrial scale.\u201d \nProf Wass said beer would not be used on an industrial scale but was an \u201cexcellent readily available model\u201d to test the technology. \nThe team will now build a large-scale version of their technology \u2013 but the project could take up to five years, even if it runs smoothly.

Also if you have any more ideas, write down below. Thank you\nThe main goals of the web that I will focus on: PRIMARY : Getting new player\n Secondary : Shop sales\n Secondary : Info for new/old players\n1 . First of all, I would start with the landing page. Most definitively there is missing a \" DOWNLOAD or PLAY NOW \" button a.k.a CTA ( call to action ). Which HAS to be visible throughout your entire time of site searching. It should be fixed on top of the site, so wherever you go, you can click the \"play now\" button. People need to see this option at all costs, for obvious reasons\n2. SHOP. Lack of CTA ( call to action ) button . On top of that, when you check the store- first what you see is a big red warning of what not to do. It is okay, but it's not the main goal of what you're trying to achieve when you open your shop, is it? What I suggest is to move this \"warning\" to the bottom of the site. Also, items are outdated and not up to date. I would add everything that is for sale, I would divide it to certain categories: such as: weapons/ mounts/ clothes etc... ( the items radu decides to sell only ). Also on top of that, I would display each and every item that is being offered for sale. People like to see what they're buying. So the overall structure would be changed and sorted. Also it is only at the middle of site- I would scratch that to the entire width. Buttons,images, texts, subtexts would be added.\n3. Important info/ \"useless\" info.\n Here, I would divide the site into 2 sites . On the \"main\" site, there would be all the things you need to know/see. For example: PLAY NOW button/ SHOP/ Screenshots/ Forums/ Some sort of promotional video/ News etc...\n Then, there would be the \"full site\", where we'd put all the other infos, such as: Manuals/stories/blog/calendar etc...\n Would need to take some time to sort things out.\n4. As far as graphics goes, I would renew it. Hiring a graphics designer, that would do the custom graphics for EL site. It hurts me to say this, but I would go with similar look Runescape has. ( http://www.runescape...dOgdY/community ). All subsites would have it's own custom design. More details would be talked over with the graphics designer.\nThese are 4 key components I would suggest EL website needs.\nMain goal is to get the newcomer to download the game. To make the first impression really good and comfortable.\nThis is just a part of things I would change.\nWhat are your thoughts? Leave a comment below.

One side is talking about several feet, while the other is talking about literally thousands and hundred of thousands of acres.\nHave you dealt with national monuments at all involved in regard to the regulations?

Revit would notice those links were different than the version it had a record of during a SwC, even though it does not reload links during a SwC. I imagine it takes note of the file date or something high level that defines the DWG in the database. The solution then was to reload those links before using SwC.\nIn this case, it isn't about DWG files.

Lost both so I bought the new style. I absolutely hate it! The bottle is wide so it does not fit comfortably in my hand and does not offer a natural feel/ fit/ hold like the old one did. It does not hold as much water. The bottle \"lid\" is a step down from the old version. I have the SJ vest (love it) and this new style bottle will not fit in the bottle holders so the products are not inter changeable anymore. The pouch: it is bigger and if I push my phone will fit in it (Iphone7 w/ Lifeproof case). If I run with my phone I take my vest, so I normally just need to put a gel, $1, and some hard candy in the hand held pouch, but I can see how the bigger pouch would be nice for people that carry a phone. So I would rate the pouch as \"OK\". Over all I really wish UD would bring back the old style and carry both styles as I do realize some people will see the new \"features\" I hate as great improvements, but as my review it is a step down. UD please bring back the 20oz Fast draw! I did talk to UD (online chat) and they said the market was moving to a smaller bottle, but UD makes a lot of products for trail and ultra running. When I hit the trail I do not want to need to refill by bottle more often. 10oz vs 20 oz means twice as much refilling. Also as a company that makes a products for trail and ultra runners and puts the best ultra runners names on them, it suprizes me that they have made this item to hold less (H2O) and be more bulky.

lack of dog waste bins or the lack of emptying the dog waste bins within CBW and the airfield. The 4 x dog waste bins within the married quarters area off camp and the 2 x dog waste bins on camp are contracted to be emptied by ISS who work on behalf of Carillion Amey (CA). If you notice that the bins are full please report this issue to either the QM, RQMS GSU or HIVE who will in turn report it to CA. If they are full then please take your own dog waste back home and deposit in your   own   black bin; do not discard in the local area which is becoming common practice. \nThe 2 x dog waste bins on the airfield have no contract and they were only emptied by 2 x volunteers who have since ceased to complete this role due to the conditions in and around the bin by dog users. We are in the process of setting up a contract with a local disposal agency but this may take time. In the meantime may I request that all dog owners again take their own dog waste home and deposit in their  own  black bins; do not throw dog waste bags into the undergrowth. \nA gentle reminder to all dog owners that they are responsible for clearing up their own dog mess. Anyone seen in breach of this responsibility may be reported to the local authorities. The airfield is not owned by DIO or UDC so they are not responsible for the dog bins in this area and they have to be emptied via volunteer means or by using CBW money that could be spent better elsewhere. \nMay I also remind dog owners that the camp is not a thoroughfare to the airfield but if you are using the camp that all dogs are kept on a lead and again you take responsibility for any dog waste. \n\nPlease help us to help you! \n\nMajor Burgess RE ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "burgess", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carillion amey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cbw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "udc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gsu", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:59.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ebe9fbec5a45e6f3e043b1dbab77ff7e44689c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_XQnuQnGxNl8nF8fS5Uj51Sk2kRJgKUQwsWHOPTdRedW2vnhFCbUsYae2kQcLbWskjtDqF1sNq4lf8bbcrOOTw", "site_full": "www.neilvermillion.com", "site": "neilvermillion.com", "site_section": "http://www.neilvermillion.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Neil Vermillion", "title": "I Have Bridged The Gap On Your Behalf", "title_full": "I Have Bridged The Gap On Your Behalf", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 98, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bc6063062f9bd7a14e0bac2d9eb2e967d746c0a6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_XQnuQnGxNl8nF8fS5Uj51Sk2kRJgKUQwsWHOPTdRedW2vnhFCbUsYae2kQcLbWskjtDqF1sNq4kVKhYhXZJENLwi_lXmR650-", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "Neil Vermillion", "published": "2017-11-27T11:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "\nRest in the assurance of who I am and my plans for you.

So take a moment to reflect and remember. Be deliberate and intentional in remembering my words, promises, plans, and character. For in doing so, your knowledge and remembrance of me will supply you with unshakable stability to whether any storm. (2)\nDo not resist the direction I am guiding you towards. For though you may not like it, and though it may be truly difficult, painful, or humiliating, it will bring about good fruit in your life. Everything works out for the good of those who love me. And as you have accepted the call placed upon your life, also remember you belong to me, just as I belong to you. In this know I will take care of you and supply your necessary provision as we walk this journey together. We will grow in not only knowledge, wisdom, and experience, but also in our love, friendship, and power too.

The decision to sell products online may come suddenly and you should always do proper research that what is trending in the market. \n\nIt makes a whole lot of difference on what CMS to choose for what type of website. If these things are not kept in mind, then the choice of CMS can seriously go wrong in the future. \nFirst CMS that is much popular across the web development world is Magento website development. It is because Magento has some completely unmatchable default functionalities.  \nThis open-source platform is a revolutionary E-commerce web development tool which lets every Magento developer create some awesome cutting-edge websites with performance-oriented and value-driven e-commerce websites. \nMagento: An Unrivaled E-commerce Platform \nWhy is the ecommerce business catching trend with the people across the world. We can owe this to the ease with which people want to buy the products sitting in the comfort of their homes. Sitting at home, one can explore the latest trends in every niche in the market and even find out about the prices of everything that is available online. A surprising fact is that some brands launch the products online and doesn\u2019t launch them offline.  \nAnother advantage of e-commerce web development is that people can buy the products sitting online and the products can be searched 24*7 in the day or at night at complete convenience and those products can be ordered at anytime. The orders can be even delivered next day or within 7-10 days. Why would people go to market if same products are available online and that too at discounted prices. \nA website should have the following features which a Magento developer should keep in mind while developing a dynamic and cutting-edge website for their clients: \n\u25cfA shopping website should have a great UI/ User Experience so that the users feel attracted to the website and they can visit the website again and again. \n\u25cfAnother feature is the safety and security of the payment gateway of the website when the user makes any transaction. \n\u25cfVariety of products should be displayed on the website in a very attractive manner and in a visually appealing way so that the users can spend a lot of time on the website and turn into conversions/leads. \nOf course, there are many advantages of using Magento in the E-commerce web development which we are going to discuss below: \n1. Magento websites are completely customizable: \nThe reason being that Magento is free and open-source like PHP, the websites created with Magento are highly customizable. Also, tailor-made websites can be created according to the requirements. This makes the task easier for a Magento developer also. This amazing versatility and flexibility makes Magento a favorite among the ecommerce web developers. \n2. Websites with ultimate UX design can be developed: \nA website should give an ultimate user-experience to the audience. Navigation of the website should be seamless. A smooth website with no glitches is the key to success in the e-commerce web development industry. \n3. Websites created with Magento are highly scalable: \nMagento is so flexible a platform that you can create any type of website whether it\u2019s a small scale website or a website which is large scale. Magento can mould into any requirement. \n4. Multi-store Management Feature: \nMagento can even handle multiple stores which let you handle multiple stores and the best part is that all the stores can be managed from just one admin panel. Much time is saved when multi-store management feature is used in Magento. \n5. Mobile-friendly highly responsive websites: \nAs much of the traffic comes from mobile so smartphones friendly websites are a must.

I will guide your thoughts so you can dwell on what is good, righteous, holy, noble, excellent, and praiseworthy. And in this state of thought you will not be discouraged, nor left feeling depleted, but rather you will experience my comfort, presence, essence, and sentiment of my heart. (1) \nI will reveal myself to you in many indirect ways. And because it is indirect it will not always be obvious to you it is my voice and my spirit impacting you. However, as you begin to be more sensitive, and continue to stop and smell the roses frequently you will gradually begin to discern and appreciate my voice, spirit, and the small, subtle nudges I give you throughout the day. And in this knowledge and appreciation you will be encouraged as you experience me more frequently, in smaller, less dramatic ways. (2)\nIn this engagement you will experience security and will become more and more sensitive as you discern my voice and my activity in your life. You will see me as I am, in small things, not only the big, important, and dramatic events. You will see my hand at work daily, and will feel my breath upon you. You will not fear for you will know with complete certainty I am not only aware of all these little things, but also involved in them too. (3)\nSo rest in the assurance of all I have for you. Rest in the knowledge and experience of my overwhelming love for you. For in me you will find all the joy, all the fulfillment, all the hope, and all the peace you could ever imagine, and even more.

Know these days of new beginnings are challenging and difficult, but also know they are necessary in order for you to grow, develop, and progress forward according to the call upon your life. (1) \nSo do not despise these days, even though they are uncomfortable. Lean on me, and rest in my guidance for your life, for I will guide you in spite of the pain you are experiencing. I will speak to you, in spite of the loss you are experiencing. I will make sense of these days, and give you perspective to see and understand, but also to enable you to mitigate the hurt and maximize the joy, peace, and satisfaction. (2)\nAnd through it all you will come through these days stronger. You will come through these days knowing I am with you, and that nothing will separate you from my great love. You will come through these days wiser, more mature, more collected, more disciplined. So do not resist these days of transition, for they are birthing the greatness already placed within you. Do not let your heart grow weary, but share these days with me, knowing they are merely transitional, and are not permanent in their duration. (3)\nWalk in the confidence, not in your own strength, but in the strength of who I am, and the assurance of my plans for you. Let go of your hurts, worries, and fears, and embrace the comfort of my spirit.

In the past new things meant one thing, but today new things will mean something different. So do not be alarmed. Do not be afraid. Do not be apprehensive as you encounter these new things, for new things of today will be blessings for you. The new things you experience and discover will not harm you, but will bless you. The new things in store for you will be a reward for you, not a penalty. (1) \nRemain faithful but also remain alert and watchful. In doing so, do not scrutinize what I am saying to the point you miss the very blessing I am giving to you. Do not hyper-analyze what I am saying to the point you miss the result and outcome of all the struggle and preparation you have already endured. Be mindful, but allow me to guide you and confirm these things as I bring them to you. (2)\nIn doing so you will open the throttle for your advancement and blessings. You will open the door to provision and experience. You will open the window to so many wonderful blessings and encounters too numerous to mention. You will enjoy the process as you let go of the foolishness of control, and realize all these things have been taken care of already. In doing so not only will you encounter a lighter, easier burden and way of living, but you will also encounter and receive many more blessings as you unhinge the tethers and restraints currently encumbering you. (3)\nEmbrace what is set before you this day, though it is new and unfamiliar. Embrace what I am saying. Walk through the doors I have opened before you. Engage with me in the experiences of new discoveries. As you do, enjoy yourself and let go of all your fears and worries, for you will find I am better than you thought I was. I am more loving, more forgiving than you thought. I am kinder, and gentler than you thought. I am more generous, more merciful, more patient than you thought. You will experience me in every capacity, and in every capacity you will find I am so much greater than you ever thought I was.

Prepare to be stretched and pressed beyond what you\u2019ve experienced lately. Prepare to feel out of control, and feel as though you have been lost. For all these experiences are all part of the process, and are normal. (1) \nRely on me, and follow the sound of my voice as I lead you through the mess and confusion of this experience of expanse and advancement.

I will guide you and lead you, and will do so in a more excellent, more righteous, more rapid manner than you would choose for yourself. (2)\nYour timeliness are different than mine. Your perception of value and what is important is different than mine. Your concept and estimation of process and direction is different than mine. So trust in me, and allow me to guide you into the realms beyond what you can understand, for it will look entirely contrary to your own evaluation. (3)\nBe patient with yourself as you journey forward, for confusion is part of the process initially. As you encounter new things, ideas, people, and customs you will not understand how to respond, and will experience confusion. So remain faithful and follow my voice, for I will lead you through the confusion, past the barrier of the unknown, and bring you safely into the realms of understanding, comfort, and security. All the while I will be by your side. All the while you will be completely safe. All the while you will never leave my sight, never be forgotten, never be neglected. (4)\nRest in the assurance you have been placed in my hands, and no one will snatch you out of them. Even though the storms in your life are very real, so also is my comfort. My hope for you is firm, because my comfort is greater than your affliction. (5)\nEncounter me in your fears. Embrace me in your confusion. Engage with me in your offense and anger. As you do, you will find not only am I with you already, but I am the answer and solution to all these things. I am the solution to all your problems, the answer to all your questions.

I am here with you always, and will never leave you.

But today is not like days passed, for you are experiencing expanse, and doing so as a result of the previous years of pruning. In this day you are expanding and increasing. You are acquiring more than you can hold and contain. You are advancing forward and accumulating momentum. (1) \nThere have been many days in which it seemed you were going nowhere. There were many days in which it seemed my hand was against you for no reason except to stop you. There have been many experiences in which the pressure felt too heavy, the progress seemed too slow, and the price seemed too costly. Remember these days and appreciate them, but do not project these experiences and memories on to your present day experience. The timelines of Yesterday are not the timelines of Today. The process may be the same, but the results and manifestations are not. (2)\nDo not worry about changes you are experiencing. Do not attempt to control the tides of the ocean. The tides will rise, and they will fall, and there is nothing you can do to accelerate it, to stop it, or to increase it. Rest in the calmness and peace afforded you by the union of my spirit. Do not toil over the things you cannot control. Do not avoid your necessary growth in your quest to find comfort, but understand there will be days and seasons in which you will advance, just like there will be days and seasons in which you seem to regress. (3)\nThere will be a different pace for different days, so remain watchful and alert. Do not fall into the pitfall of apathy or hopelessness, but understand I am with you in all things, and all these things are working for your good. And though the road seems long and pointless, know every little detail matters. Every single lesson you learn is valuable and intentional. Every person you encounter is valuable and worthwhile. Every move of your heart, and tear that is shed is recorded. None of it goes to waste. None of if it worthless. None of it is for nothing.

This one is a beer that features on the updated version of the 1001 beers list and is quite a highly rated beer online where it sits as the 25th highest rated gueuze on the BeerAdvocate website. I managed to find a bottle of this one in one of Brewdog\u2019s Glasgow bars recently, having previously spotted it on the menu of other bars in the past but it\u2019s never been available when I\u2019ve asked for a bottle until now.\n\nAppearance (4/5): Fairly bright looking with some cloudy touches through the body and a white head on top that was more of a thin lacing around the sides but about what I\u2019d expect from the style.\nAroma (7/10): Opening with plenty of tart and funky notes, the beer is fresh and lively with some nice lemon zest and subtle spices, citrus definitely being the strongest on the nose initially. It was quite an easy-going beer on the nose with some apples and pears coming through around the middle and some acidity rounding things off.\nTaste (7/10): Following on well from the nose, the beer opens with plenty of tart and citrus flavours, some orange accompanying the lemon this time around with a few pale malts towards the middle. It wasn\u2019t the most complex tasting beer but some grapes and pears made themselves known further on with some subtle spices and herbal touches adding to freshness of the beer.\nPalate (4/5): Light-medium bodied and quite crisp with a fresh feel to it throughout thanks to the citrus tang and lively carbonation levels. It was a balanced and easy to drink beer that had plenty tart initially with some funky flavours throughout as well.\nOverall (16/20): Quite a fresh and crisp beer from the start, it was lively with some nice tart and funky flavours kicking things off alongside plenty of citrus and a few subtle spices. Further on there was some lighter fruits with apples, grapes and pears all featuring at points before some acidity seen things out. It was a balanced and easy-going offering that I enjoyed and would definitely have again.\nBrewed In: St Pieters Leeuw-Vlezenbeek, Belgium\nBrewery: Brouwerij Lindemans\nFirst Brewed: circa. 2000 \nType: Lambic \u2013 Gueuze\nAbv: 6.0%\nServing: Bottle (375ml)\nPurchased: Brewdog DogHouse, Glasgow, ScotlandGueuze Cuv\u00e9e Ren\u00e9\nPrice: \u00a35.00 (approx.)

You will reflect on your past and see how you have undoubtedly become prepared, not as a string of hardships and failures. (2)\nEngage with me, in this day.

I am making myself known to you, and also making my will known to you. I am not hiding myself from you, but pursuing you in our relationship together. I am encouraging and empowering you to hear from me and to receive me, just as I am, without distortion or misunderstanding. You are not far. You are not out of my sight. You have not been forgotten. You are near to me now, just as you always have been (1). \nAnd with my spirit speaking to you now, listen to my voice, and do not continue to criticize what I am saying. For your skepticism is a good trait, because it prevents you from believing anything and everything you hear. But as you recognize my voice, and recognize my signature of what I am saying, do not continue to remain skeptical, for your criticism will hinder your hearing and understanding.\nInstead open your heart to listen. You may not understand what I am saying at first, but do not worry about this. Over the course of I time I will continue to speak to you, and I will remind you of what I have said, and I will also reveal the meaning of what I have said. So do not concern yourself with trying to understand it all at first, but simply receive it.\nAs you receive you will come to drink the secondary benefits, not only the primary benefits. And as you drink from the fountain of my voice, and imbibe of the presence of my spirit you will come to know what you did not know before, and come to manifest what you did not believe before. I will supply you with what you lack, and surely this is a wonderful and obvious blessing to you, but I will also remove things from you as well (2).\nI will remove the dross and the clutter. I will remove the noise and debris. I will remove the lies, presumptions, and misunderstanding clouding your understanding and field of vision, and will do so as you continue to sit with me, receive me, and listen to me openly, without skepticism or criticism. So listen and receive what I have for you, for in doing so you will know I am with you in all things, but you will also benefit as I give you what you need, and remove what you do not (3).\n(1) John 17:25-26 (2) Philippians 4:19, Romans 8:32 (3) Isaiah 45:2, Luke 3:5\nClick here to share this with your friends on Twitter . \nThe Removal Of Noise, Clutter, and Debris is a post from: Neil Vermillion .

And though they have been a long time coming, these are the days of great advancement, but also great fulfillment for you too. \nSo do not sleep the day away. Do not continue to plan and prepare. Do not philosophize and strategize, as if there is nothing to be done. Make yourself busy and active with all I have been set before you. Occupy yourself with the call upon your life and the manifestation of my spirit through your talents, gifts, and skills. For the world needs what I have given you. Do not remain shy or bashful about it, but share it openly, courageously, and generously. Share your talents with those who will receive it, for in doing so you are letting your light shine before men, so they will see your good deeds, and give praise to your father in heaven. (2)\nDo not wait any longer, but take action today. This is the time your planning and preparation will meet its opportunity. Take action, work hard, remain faithful but flexible, for I am guiding you into the deep realms of experience and fulfillment, in ways you have already imagined, and even more!
