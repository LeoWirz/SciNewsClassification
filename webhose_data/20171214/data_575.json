Using M1's 4.5G HetNet, the drone was flown around M1's premises at International Business Park, as well as two fields in Wan Shih Road and Old Holland Road. \nConventional drone operations use an unlicensed spectrum such as 2.4 GHz band to provide short range line-of-sight wireless connectivity but it is susceptible to radio signal interference. In contrast, a well-optimised 4.5G HetNet provides secured, low latency and high throughput mobile connectivity, enabling drones to fly beyond visual range in an urban environment. \nIn addition, drones could send real-time data and telemetry feeds during flight, with their precise aerial locations monitored over M1's 4.5G HetNet. This paves the way for a dynamic and robust fleet traffic management solution required for the smart utilisation of Singapore's urban airspace and its surrounding sea-to-shore coverage. \nTo further the collaboration, M1 and ATMRI signed a Memorandum of Understanding today, to research and develop M1's 4.5G HetNet for the traffic management of UAS in Singapore's urban environment. The findings from this research could provide valuable insight for unmanned operations using future 5G Ultra Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) network. \nMr Denis Seek, Chief Technical Officer of M1, said, 'This collaboration is another innovation to accelerate Singapore's transformation towards a Smart Nation. Interest in drones has already taken off beyond recreational and hobbyist groups, into serious commercial applications. Mobile technology has the potential to expand and extend the capabilities of drones to enable incredible new applications such as using drones to perform search & rescue operation at remote or inaccessible sites, aerial infrastructure surveillance, delivery of parcels quickly and efficiently, and even new entertainment channels such as first-person view drone race.' \nNTU Singapore Professor Vu N. Duong, Director of the ATMRI , said command and control of UAS is a topic of critical importance especially when commercial usage of drones is taking off. \n'NTU Singapore is at the forefront in both autonomous vehicles as well as air traffic management research. We are working now to establish an air traffic system which can effectively control and regulate UAS traffic in a congested airspace. By working with key industry partners like M1, we aim to translate our knowledge into practical applications beneficial to Singapore and other megacities,' Prof Duong said. \nLeading this joint research project will be Professor Low Kin Huat , an expert in robotics and UAVs from NTU's School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and ATMRI senior research fellow Mohamed Faisal Bin Mohamed Salleh . \nTogether with engineers from M1, NTU researchers will map out the signal strengths and end-to-end latency of M1's HetNet for Singapore's entire urban airspace using drones, up to 130 metres (400ft), the height of a 36-storey building. This will help researchers to identify suitable airspace for reliable command and control of drones, including flights out of visual range. \nOne of the key enabling technologies required for such an air traffic management solution is a Command and Control (C2) Link for unmanned aircrafts, which is critical to ensure operational efficiency and safety of drones, especially in a dense urban environment like Singapore. \nThe joint project is expected to last three years, with M1 providing usage of their network and their engineering expertise, while NTU provides the expertise in traffic management of unmanned aircraft systems. \nM1 Limited published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 09:41:06 UTC . \nOriginal document https://www.m1.com.sg/AboutM1/NewsReleases/2017/M1 NTU embark on Singapore first research on use of 4_5G HetNet for secure drone ops.aspx \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/927C25E471D13126EC7609515FF71F406847C346", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "duong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vu n. duong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "low kin huat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denis seek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohamed faisal bin mohamed salleh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hetnet", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "ntu", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "nanyang technological university", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "air traffic management research institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "civil aviation authority of singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ntu singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atmri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "school of mechanical and aerospace engineering", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caas", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international business park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wan shih road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "old holland road", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:05.035+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a70060198caa04c5d86e7f7574e1bc800deafb04", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqIBRdCDNqED9Jz.CCdbf8xVEER6zMOAcB7EdIENtJnoYjw4qjUwVYs5e_F_ZGm855zcz1bJryLxsKDKKu4IIBywOudKS1DT_z0QhE5h5WZQgrUhEGspS4qj5sWJo4SPTgZFV0YljWH1GQlc7PgoxnpkPYoqQA89b5", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/geek/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Geek links", "title": "(9829655) As of today, Steam will no longer accept bits of string as payment for games.

(AP) - Southern California has felt yellow wind, orange wind, and red wind. But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

Uganda\u2019s most valuable agricultural export commodity, contributing US$ 544 million in 2016/17, about 20 percent of total export earnings. Furthermore, the crop, employs over 3.5 million households. \nHowever, despite such rosy status, a recent study by the Economic Policy Research Centre (EPRC), shows that the advent of climate change is a double blow to the technologically constrained coffee production system in Uganda. \n\u2018Between 2007 and 2016, Uganda lost coffee seedlings worth US$ 10 million. In 2015/2016 alone, seedlings worth US $ 3 million did not germinate due to drought\u2019, the EPRC Policy Brief indicates in part. \nAccording to EPRC, predictions demonstrate that climate change is likely to stifle the coffee development program in Uganda at three levels: by reducing survival rate of coffee seedlings to expand coffee acreage, exacerbate productivity challenges in an inherently constrained rain-fed low input coffee production system. \nIt is also likely to contribute to reduction in quality of coffee beans leading to low export earnings. \u2018This is likely to slow down the low middle-income status by 2020 target of exporting 20 million (60 Kg bags) annually\u2019, warns the Brief. \nFurther, the evaluation report by the Operation Wealth Creation together with the President\u2019s Office shows that because of drought, the survival rate of 93 million coffee seedlings planted during the first season of 2016 was only 42 percent, with 39 million seedlings surviving. \nRising temperatures, the Brief notes, are expected to render certain low altitude areas less suitable or even completely unsuitable for Robusta coffee growing, implying that fewer parts of Uganda will be suitable for coffee production. \u201cWith an increase in temperature of only 20C, there would be a dramatic decrease in amount of land suitable for growing Robusta coffee in Uganda. As suitable Robusta coffee growing areas reduce, some farmers will try to push further up the mountains. This will bring coffee into conflict with other land uses and driving migration out of coffee-producing areas to sustain production,\u201d it adds. \nThe Brief further notes that expanding acreage has been the main option pursued by government to get to the 20 million bags of coffee target by 2020. \u2018It is apparent that since early 2000s till 2015, Uganda has by and large promoted coffee acreage expansion from about 320 to about 402 thousand hectares, while paying minimal attention to improving productivity\u2019, it says. \nAuthors of the Brief note that an average threshold of 600 kilograms per hectare has been maintained in Uganda-under \u2018rain-fed\u2019 production farming system. \u201cAs a consequence, this has had limited impact on output-which has remained stuck at 3.5 million bags,\u201d they say. \nThey say that countries such as Vietnam aggressively adopted both extensive planting and irrigation intensification to raise yield per hectare to 2,100 kgs. \u2018For Vietnam, this approach led to steady progress in increasing coffee production and export and by 2015, the country had attained annual export volumes of 23.4 million bags of coffee\u2019, they note in the Brief. \nGiven the devastating effects of climate change on coffee, the Brief says farmers will have to cope with additional farm investments required to adapt to climate change. One of the avenues, the Brief says, is allowing farmers have a fair share of profit margins that accrue deeper along the value chain as proposed and practiced by the National Union of Coffee Agribusinesses and Farm Enterprises (NUCAFE). \nBut most coffee farmers in Uganda are ill prepared to tackle climate change, and are unlikely able to invest in small innovation strategies to cope with climate change, the Brief notes, calling for strong and effective institutional arrangements that guarantees stability in incomes from coffee and hence high returns on coffee farm investment. The farmer ownership model now provides a sustainable value chain adaptation strategy the Uganda Coffee Development Authority (UCDA) should scale up for more efficient climate smart agriculture, it says. \nNUCAFE, estimates that if Uganda were to roast and package all coffee beans exported as raw green beans worth US $ 400 million, the export earnings could more than quadruple to US$ 2 billion.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name":

But that's not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge. \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" \nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n- Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n- Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n- Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C. \nFor the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point. For Medicaid recipients, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points.

You\u2019ll be surprised to know that the stolen BTC now worth over $70 million-in less than 24 hours. \nFounded in 2014, NiceHash is a cloud-based crypto-mining marketplace that connects people from all over the world to rent out their spare computing power to other in order to create new coins. \nOn Wednesday, several NiceHash users reported that their BTC wallets had been emptied, which was later confirmed by NiceHash after its service went offline claiming to be undergoing maintenance. \nAt the time of writing, the NiceHash service is still offline with a post on its website, confirming that \u201cthere has been a security breach involving NiceHash website,\u201d and that hackers stole the contents of the NiceHash Bitcoin wallet. \nThe company did not provide any further details about the security incident, but it did say that NiceHash has paused its operations for next 24 hours while it figures out exactly how many numbers of BTC were swiped from its website and how it was taken. \nAlthough NiceHash has not confirmed the number of bitcoins stolen from its virtual wallet, some of its customers have circulated a wallet address that suggests around 4,736 BTC-worth more than $70 million based on today\u2019s price-in total were drained from the company\u2019s wallet. \nNiceHash has initiated an investigation into the matter, and has reported the incident to the \u201crelevant authorities and law enforcement\u201d and has been \u201cco-operating with them as a matter of urgency.\u201d \nThe company also assured its customers that it is \u201cfully committed to restoring the NiceHash service with the highest security measures at the earliest opportunity,\u201d but it\u2019s still unclear how the company will manage to settle everything if it is unable to compensate the total loss. \n\u201cWe understand that you will have a lot of questions, and we ask for patience and understanding while we investigate the causes and find the appropriate solutions for the future of the service. We will endeavor to update you at regular intervals,\u201d the company says. \nFollowing the security incident, NiceHash is recommending its customers to change their passwords-both on NiceHash and other services, if they are using the same credentials. \nNiceHash is the latest cryptocurrency company to suffer a significant blow in recent months. Another major hack took place last month due to a flaw in Parity\u2019s wallet that caused over $160 million in ETH (Ether) to be frozen, while nearly $32 million in ETH was stolen by hackers in July.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nicehash", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicehash", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:10.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f3490c939c334a64763fa890cbe20efb5e259563", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqwVEBNS8V3ElQL3gimKJUfIhxh_omoor.z8XuvhKh4F4YEf5kUrcKo9erBm1QI__XZ1uRmSXFttQLmtO12_n4OAs7KHUzU_WNA--", "site_full": "www.thesun.co.uk", "site": "thesun.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Sun", "title": "North Korea warns nuclear war is now INEVITABLE after US stages huge drills involving hundreds of fighter jets", "title_full": "North Korea warns nuclear war is now INEVITABLE after US stages huge drills involving hundreds of fighter jets", "published": "2017-12-07T11:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/dd-composite-jets1.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=100&#038;w=750&#038;h=500&#038;crop=1", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 2180, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1173, "comments": 3, "shares": 1173}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f3490c939c334a64763fa890cbe20efb5e259563", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqwVEBNS8V3ElQL3gimKJUfIhxh_omoor.z8XuvhKh4F4YEf5kUrcKo9erBm1QI__XZ1uRmSXFttQLmtO12_n4OAs7KHUzU_WNA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Patrick Knox", "published": "2017-12-07T11:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "North Korea warns nuclear war is now INEVITABLE after US stages huge drills involving hundreds of fighter jets", "text": "Health News NO GOING BACK North Korea warns nuclear war is now INEVITABLE after US stages huge drills involving hundreds of fighter jets \nKim Jong-un\u2019s mouthpiece issues doomsday warning after a huge aerial armada deploys for war games on the Korean peninsula By Patrick Knox 7th December 2017, 9:45 am Updated: 7th December 2017, 9:48 am NORTH Korea has warned nuclear war was now inevitable after the United States staged huge drills involving hundreds of advanced warplanes. \nThe chilling prediction comes after two US B-1B nuke capable bombers were confirmed to be among aircraft staging large-scale aerial exercises near the hermit state.

We are hoping to find him. We want to find him alive but there have been no sightings of him for eight months,\u201d he said. \n\u201cAnd we have had that conversation. We are bearing up but there\u2019s no doubt about it, we are under pressure. \n\u201cChristmas is at a standstill really. This is just our cross to bear at the moment. \n\u201cWe are just hoping now to finalise this but we are not sure if we can.\u201d David\u2019s parents Carmel and Con O\u2019Sullivan. \nDavid studied English and Philosophy in UCC. He worked in a filling station on the Cork Road in Midleton, and was inspired to take on the Pacific Crest Trail, which runs from southern California to Canada, after reading the book Wild last year. \nHe left Ireland on March 20 and set off on the hike alone from the American/ Mexican border on March 22. \n\u201cHe hoped to find himself,\u201d Con said. \u201cWe had concerns. Of course we had concerns. But he had hiked before a lot in Ireland. \n\u201cHe is fit, disciplined and he\u2019s a black-belt in karate. He\u2019s quiet, but once you started talking to him, and found common ground, he couldn\u2019t stop talking. He was a good steady lad.\u201d \nDavid had hiking gear, a very distinctive backpack, a non-smart phone, and a tablet. However, he had no international phone plan and was relying on local wifi spots to contact his family. \nHe reached the town of Idyllwild near Big Bear City, close to San Bernadino in California on April 5. David\u2019s parents received an email from him on April 7 detailing his hike so far. There has been no contact or sightings of him since. \nHis family raised the alarm about a week later, and following contact between garda\u00ed, the Department of Foreign Affairs, Interpol and the US authorities, a missing person alert was subsequently issued in California. \nHowever, despite investigations which revealed no banking activity, no activity on his mobile phone from March 22, and several searches of the Pacific Crest Trail around Idyllwild involving specialist search teams, there has been no sign of or trace of David, or his distinctive rucksack. The group of volunteer searchers who will join a massive search for David this weekend. \nMurietta Police Department believe he may \u201cmay have gone off the trail to avoid heavy snow\u201d. \nCon said this weekend\u2019s searches for David, organised by a local volunteer, Cathy Tarr, will focus in and around the area in which he was last seen. \nHowever, he said it is extremely remote and challenging terrain with the trail a one-hour drive by jeep along dirt trails from the nearest town, and at an altitude of around 2,500m in desert-like mountains. \nThe Department of Foreign Affairs is providing consular assistance. \nCon, who was involved in the massive search for the body of Robert Holohan in Midleton in 2005, said his family is now grateful for all the help and support they\u2019ve received from people in Midleton and beyond, from the garda\u00ed, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the US police and local volunteer search teams, especiallyMs Tarr. \nNow friends of the O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s, Padraig O\u2019Neill and Brian Schafer, have launched a fund to help the family cover some of the costs associated with the ongoing search operations. \nThe donations page can be found here. \nThe IBAN is IE04 BOFI 9027 0963 2988 36. \nDavid\u2019s younger brother, Niall, a trainee teacher, said every single cent will be used to help find David. \n\u201cAny extra money will be donated,\u201d he said.
