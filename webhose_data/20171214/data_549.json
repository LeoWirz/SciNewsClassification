Under standard economic theory, the latter should always be better. In the first scenario, you have one option: don't do it. In the second, you have two options, including the same option as before.\nThis is not how the human mind works.\nOne part is obvious: would you rather starve, with no options, or starve in front of a beautiful cheesecake, just out of reach? Or worse, in front of a cake out of reach to you, but with other people feasting on it? This is not just \"envy\", it's loss, in the second case we're losing out and we're extremely loss adverse.\nThe other part is less obvious but no less real: we average the cost of options. A set of 11 plates with one of them broken is worth less to buyers than a set of 10 good plates, because the average value of 1 plate in the first case is less than in the second one. This has been demonstrated many times.\nWhen you go from one option at no cost (slow lane) to one free option + one paying option, then the perceived value/cost of the \"free\" option isn't free anymore, it goes up because people average the cost.\n(That said, tolls are probably the best possible solution; but the transition is always going to be painful).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:04.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "044211dc15d2c35391c605e92d5fab6fc96417aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTzW1XIcyCxIKJ78R_I43R_HKqCR94vekklCLmlm0JZBzKo_y.GZnL", "site_full": "news.ycombinator.com", "site": "ycombinator.com", "site_section": "https://news.ycombinator.com/rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Hacker News", "title": "$40 road tolls offer insight into commuter psychology", "title_full": "$40 road tolls offer insight into commuter psychology | Hacker News", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 91, "participants_count": 72, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2232, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "210565b44dbed8cab6d4cabd0659157bc6ee1b7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTzW1XIcyCxIKJ78R_I43R_HKqCR94vekklCLmlm0JZDjHDNjGI_QB9j5Ml7HURd0-", "ord_in_thread": 71, "author": "philsnow", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "If you make one friend with someone in your neighborhood or your workplace and carpool the express lane is free.
