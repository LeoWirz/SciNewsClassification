Archive photo: Ciaran Ryan 7 December 2017 Women in polygamous customary marriages have won a major victory. \nThokozani Thembekile Maphumulo was the second wife in a polygamous customary marriage. She was never registered as a joint-owner of her home. \nWhen her husband died, a will surfaced that stated, incorrectly, that her husband was unmarried. It left all his property to the eldest son of his first wife, Simiso Maphumulo. Since then, Simiso has been attempting to evict Thokozani from the home she has lived in for a number of years. \nThokozani\u2019s is one of two stories that was at the centre of a case decided by the Constitutional Court on 30 November (the other story is very complicated so we have not told it). The court unanimously decided that section 7(1) of the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act, 1998 was invalid. This is because it unfairly discriminates against women by treating polygamous customary marriages before the Act came into force differently to monogamous marriages and polygamous marriages that took place after the Act was passed. For people in Thokozani\u2019s situation this is very welcome news. \nThe Act was created to reform customary law, particularly where it discriminated against women. \nAn example is property: Under customary law, it used to be that a husband was given exclusive control and ownership of all matrimonial property, irrespective of whether the marriage was polygamous or monogamous. The Act changed this so that customary marriages were automatically \u201cin community of property\u201d. This means that each spouse owns an equal share of the property and has equal control of the matrimonial property. (This can be changed if both spouses agree and have a court-approved antenuptial contract.) \nBut section 7(1) of the Act meant that this reform would not apply to marriages that took place before the Act was passed. This meant that women who entered polygamous marriages after the Act was passed were given equal control of matrimonial property but women who got married before the Act was passed had no control unless their husbands and the other wives agreed to change the ownership scheme. \nIn 2008, the Constitutional Court declared the section invalid for pre-Act monogamous customary marriages but it still applied to polygamous marriages. The Court left the question on polygamous marriages open for Parliament to decide what should happen. But Parliament has taken no steps to clarify the position of women in polygamous marriages pre-1998. This has meant that, since 2008, monogamous marriages and polygamous ones that took place after the Act were automatically \u201cin community of property\u201d. But women who entered into polygamous marriages before the Act had no say in how the matrimonial property was used. \nIn this case, the High Court ruling found that section 7(1) discriminated on the basis of both gender as well as race and ethnic and social origin. Since no reason was provided to justify this discrimination, the High Court held that the section was inconsistent with the Constitution and invalidated it. \nThe High Court then made an order giving women in pre-Act polygamous customary marriages equal control and ownership over matrimonial property until Parliament passed legislation to govern these polygamous marriages. The High Court limited this invalidity so it would not affect customary marriages that had been terminated due to death or divorce. This meant that the applicants could not benefit from the High Court order. \nThe Constitutional Court had to confirm the declaration of invalidity by the High Court. Thokozani only became aware of the High Court judgement after it was made. Represented by the Legal Resources Centre, she successfully applied to join the case. The Women\u2019s Legal Centre Trust also joined the case as a friend of the Court. \nJustice Madlanga, who wrote the judgment, found that section 7(1) perpetuated \u201cinequality between husbands and wives\u201d who were in polygamous marriages before the Act. \nMadlanga referred to the previous Constitutional Court decision, finding that the section discriminated on the basis of gender in a way that limited the dignity of wives in Pre-Act polygamous customary marriages. The judge also found that the section discriminated based on marital status. Section 9 of the Constitution forbids unfair discrimination on the basis of gender or marital status. \nMadlanga noted that people in pre-Act polygamous customary marriages had the option to apply to court to have their matrimonial property situation changed if the spouses agreed. However, Madlanga found that where there was no agreement, women in these marriages were \u201cat the mercy of their husbands\u201d. This meant that the section infringed the right to dignity and the right to equality, and Madlanga found that the section was constitutionally invalid. \nThe Constitutional Court decision confirmed the High Court\u2019s order to invalidate part of the Act but it changed the terms of the order, and went further by saying it could apply to to marriages that had already ended by death, such as the case of Thokozani. However, Thokozani will need to go back to the High Court to prove that her case falls under the court order. But the court also suspended the order of invalidity for 24 months to allow Parliament to rectify the unconstitutional section. \nUntil then, however, the Court felt that women urgently needed a way to redress the discrimination. So it gave them very comprehensive interim relief. Until Parliament passes the legislation, women who entered into polygamous customary marriages before 1998 will have joint ownership over matrimonial property, equal to their husbands. Also, each spouse will retain ownership over their personal property. This new regime will not apply to any estates that have already been wound up or to the transfer of matrimonial property that was finalised before the judgment, unless the people transferring the property knew about the judgment. If Parliament fails to fix the legislation within 24 months, the Court\u2019s interim order will continue to operate. \nThe decision is an important step towards undoing historical discrimination against women.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "simiso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madlanga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ciaran ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simiso maphumulo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thokozani thembekile maphumulo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thokozani", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "constitutional court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "high court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "until parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "legal resources centre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "women\u2019s legal centre trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pre-act", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thokozani", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:20.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1d229af6712e2df5c48347c32b7df07eb5910891", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQVFhaxBkJPTwFsG.4oshfzLOPoOSy7RLAxa3vhE2XRStAleEPGsgQ17Y7hxaFICIkoxkxua6OCTg--", "site_full": "www.groundup.org.za", "site": "groundup.org.za", "site_section": "http://www.groundup.org.za/sitenews/atom", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "GroundUp News", "title": "Cape Town\u2019s sluggish judges", "title_full": "Cape Town\u2019s sluggish judges", "published": "2017-12-07T11:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.groundup.org.za/media/_versions/images/photographers/Masixole%20Feni/CapeHighCourt/Court2-MasixoleFeni_extra_large.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1d229af6712e2df5c48347c32b7df07eb5910891", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQVFhaxBkJPTwFsG.4oshfzLOPoOSy7RLAxa3vhE2XRStAleEPGsgQ17Y7hxaFICIkoxkxua6OCTg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "Cape Town\u2019s sluggish judges", "text": "Cape Town\u2019s sluggish judges One judge has six judgments outstanding for more than a year Sixteen reserved judgments at the Western Cape High Court are late.

One acting judge has six judgments that have been outstanding for a year. \nPrompted by concerns raised by litigants and lawyers, GroundUp looked into the problem of tardy judgments. According to norms laid out for judges in 2014 by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, judges should hand down their judgments \u201cno later than three months after the last hearing.\u201d \nAccording to the list of reserved (outstanding) judgments in the Cape High Court for 30 November, 16 judgments have been reserved for three months or more. But we list here only the 11 judgments that have been outstanding for more than two recess periods. These breaks are supposed to be used by judges to write their judgments.

A further five judgments are past the three-month deadline set in the judicial norms and standards. \nBesides the judge with six reserved judgments over a year old, one judge is listed three times in the list and two other judges once each. Judges are expected to list their reserved judgments but there is no formal process to ensure they do. It\u2019s possible that more judgments are overdue. \nThe judicial norms also say: \nJudges must run their cases efficiently, effectively and quickly. \nEvery effort must be made to make sure that courts have enough judges. \nHeads of court are responsible, on a daily basis, for monitoring the performance of judges. \nThe Chief Justice has overall responsibility for monitoring the performance of judges. \nWe sent requests for comment to Judge John Hlophe, the president of the Western Cape High Court, as well as the four judges in the list above (via the Judge President, and one directly via her email). We also sent a request for comment to Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. We have received no responses. \nJustice in South Africa is slow. Police and prosecutors are frequently blamed, usually correctly, for cases being delayed. But some judges are also bottlenecks in the system.

If you agree, add your name now and back our call >> https://t.co/GvgvjzCGST pic.twitter.com/XKMCnBhQSU \n\u2014 Liberal Democrats (@LibDems) December 6, 2017 \nBut Mr Davis appeared to have dodged threats of an investigation for alleged contempt of Parliament, after the committee ruled that he had adequately fulfilled the terms of a Commons motion requiring him to hand over 58 sectoral impact assessments believed to have been drawn up by the Department for Exiting the EU. \nThe committee split on party lines, with 10 Conservatives and one Democratic Unionist agreeing that Mr Davis had complied with Parliament\u2019s requirements by handing over 850 pages of analysis of sectors of the UK economy, given that no impact assessments of the kind described in the motion existed. \nEight opposition MPs voted that the Brexit Secretary had not complied with the motion. \nDavid Davis gives evidence to the Commons Exiting the EU Committee (PA) \nThe 850-page cache of documents, handed to cross-party committees in the Commons and Lords but not yet published, are understood to describe existing conditions in various sectors of the economy, but not to forecast how they will be affected by Brexit. \nLord Jay told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that his committee was \u201cgoing through them pretty systematically now\u201d. \n\u201cThey are quite interesting but they are pretty underwhelming,\u201d said Lord Jay. \n\u201cThey don\u2019t really include an impact assessment, as far as I can tell. \n\u201cI would have thought there would have been a proper impact assessment, a proper assessment of what the impact of leaving the EU is going to be on different sectors of the economy. \n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve got is interesting, and there\u2019s a lot of good information there, but I can\u2019t really say it\u2019s a real impact assessment. It\u2019s a fairly underwhelming report.\u201d Update: Earlier this afternoon I wrote to the Speaker of the House of Commons calling on him to initiate contempt of Parliament proceedings and bring forward a debate on a resolution of contempt of Parliament after @DavidDavisMP was shown to have misled and lied to Parliament. https://t.co/J63TewJzFU \n\u2014 David Lammy (@DavidLammy) December 6, 2017 \nTransport Secretary Chris Grayling said there had been a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d about the nature of the work being done within Government. \n\u201cWe have done extensive work on the impact of European law on different sectors of the UK economy,\u201d Mr Grayling told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \n\u201cWe have done it in my department on the different areas of transport, other departments have done the same, and there are 800 pages of analysis that have been prepared and supplied to the Brexit Committee. \n\u201cWhat we haven\u2019t done is rework all the arguments from the referendum campaign all over again. \n\u201cThere are people who believe we are doing the wrong thing\u2026 who want us to produce detailed analyses saying \u2018in this scenario, this situation will occur to this business\u2019. \n\u201cThe truth is that we have to approach the negotiations right now in the best possible way for Britain and the work we are doing is to prepare the UK for these negotiations, to understand all the areas affected by EU law.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grayling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris grayling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david lammy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bailiwick express", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of commons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc radio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc radio 4\u2019s today", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic unionist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of lords eu committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:21.050+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "362b17b8fa18f53d7fe99e6379f59484d452e95e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4Lzogt5DPC.AEg2v2vDajMQwdoLs47ZmSgmMaqTeosH6Dfd3A3eXUbS7y", "site_full": "www.booking.com", "site": "booking.com", "site_section": "https://www.booking.com/hotel/sc/pieds-dans-l-eau.en-gb.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Aparthotel Pieds dans L'eau, Anse Royale, Seychelles - Booking.com ", "title": "118 Verified Reviews of Pieds dans L'eau | Booking.com", "title_full": "118 Verified Reviews of Pieds dans L'eau | Booking.com", "published": "2017-01-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 22, "participants_count": 21, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://t-ec.bstatic.com/static/img/facebook-image-else/566c7081f1deeaca39957e96365c3908f83b95af.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 105, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8505e09b44bbe76ae47077c702771d6629df30a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4Lzogt5DPC.AEg2v2vDajMQwdoLs47ZmSgmMaqTeosH6DfWVN1gEig7kdctXgrGGKqYQPTnTTcdicrCreU632qcBXYLr0pRJdiD0-", "ord_in_thread": 22, "author": "Wieslaw", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "\"Nice place to start holidays.\"", "text": "\ub209 AC unit mounted directly over bed.

(Official White House Photo by Benjamin Applebaum) \n(CNSNews.com) \u2013 Welcoming President Trump\u2019s momentous Jerusalem policy shift, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu Wednesday urged other countries to follow suit, although there was little sign of any immediate steps to do so. \n\u201cI call on all countries that seek peace to join the United States in recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and to move their embassies here,\u201d Netanyahu said, after Trump\u2019s announcement. \nThe governments of Australia and Canada, two countries known for taken a sometimes lonely stand against anti-Israel sentiment at the United Nations, both indicated they will not take up the invitation. \n\u201cCanada is a steadfast ally and friend of Israel and friend to the Palestinian people,\u201d Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said in a statement. \u201cCanada\u2019s longstanding position is that the status of Jerusalem can be resolved only as part of a general settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli dispute.\u201d \nHer Australian counterpart, Julie Bishop, said the government in Canberra does not intend to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. \n\u201cThe Australian government remains committed and optimistic that the way to achieve enduring peace between the Israelis and Palestinians is a negotiated two-state solution,\u201d she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \n(Three years ago Australia\u2019s government attracted the ire of the PLO when it refused to call eastern Jerusalem \u201coccupied\u201d territory.) \nOne development Wednesday that did draw attention was a statement by the Czech foreign ministry which commentators on social media characterized as the European nation formally recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. \nA closer reading showed that Prague is limiting that recognition to western Jerusalem, however. \nEnjoying your CNSNews.com article?

Enjoy your article! \n\n\u201cThe Czech Republic currently, before the peace between Israel and Palestine is signed, recognizes Jerusalem to be in fact the capital of Israel in the borders of the demarcation line from 1967,\u201d it said. \nThe so-called 1967 line \u2013 the 1949 armistice lines that were in place up until the June 1967 Six Day War \u2013 divided the city between the Israeli-controlled west and Jordanian-occupied east, which included the Old City and its Temple Mount, Judaism\u2019s holiest site. \nThe foreign ministry said the Czech Republic, in line with E.U. policy, \u201cconsiders Jerusalem to be future capital of both states, meaning the State of Israel and the future State of Palestine.\u201d \nIt added that the Czech Republic could only consider moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem \u201cbased on results of negotiations with key partners in the region and in the world.\u201d \nStill, the statement went further than others from Europe, which generally condemned Trump\u2019s move. \nWith the exception of Ukraine, all European countries currently on the U.N. Security Council called on this month\u2019s council president, Japan, to hold an emergency meeting in response. \nIn doing so Britain, France, Italy and Sweden were joined by non-European council members Egypt, Bolivia, Uruguay and Senegal. The meeting is expected to take place on Friday. \n\u2018The gates of hell\u2019 \nThe international response was most harsh in the Islamic world, with reactions veering between warnings of violence and implied threats of violence. \nJerusalem\u2019s Temple Mount is home to the Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam\u2019s third-holiest site after the Ka\u2019aba in Mecca and the Mohammed mosque in Medina, both in Saudi Arabia. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is calling an \u201cextraordinary\u201d summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Istanbul next week to discuss \u201cjoint action,\u201d his spokesman said. \nThe Islamist Turkish leader consulted Wednesday with the leaders of Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Malaysia, Tunisia and Sudan. \nHis prime minister, Binali Yildirim, said Trump\u2019s declaration has opened a \u201cPandora\u2019s box\u201d in the region \nAhmed al-Tayeb, head of Egypt\u2019s Al-Azhar Mosque, considered the highest seat of learning in Sunni Islam, said the U.S. policy shift \u201cthreatens world peace\u201d and warned it would open \u201cthe gates of hell, in the West before the East.\u201d \nIn Tehran, supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the \u201cZionists\u201d will be \u201cdealt a severe blow\u201d as a result of the decision on Jerusalem taken by \u201cthe enemies of Islam.\u201d \n\u201cThe Islamic world will definitely stand against this plot,\u201d Khamenei told a meeting of Iranian officials and ambassadors from other Islamic countries. \u201cDear Palestine will be undoubtedly liberated at last.\u201d \nCondemnation also came from Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas and the governments of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Qatar and Syria\u2019s Assad regime, among others. \nSalah Al-Bardawil, a leader of the Palestinian faction Hamas, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization, said \u201cthe world must understand that our resistance and uprising will not show mercy to all those responsible for the oppression of the Palestinian people and their schemes that aim to distort our Palestinian history.\u201d \nIn his announcement Trump acknowledged there would be \u201cdisagreement and dissent.\u201d \n\u201cThis sacred city should call forth the best in humanity, lifting our sights to what it is possible; not pulling us back and down to the old fights that have become so totally predictable. Peace is never beyond the grasp of those willing to reach,\u201d he said. \n\u201cSo today, we call for calm, for moderation, and for the voices of tolerance to prevail over the purveyors of hate.\u201d \nTrump repeated a call made at the U.S.-Arab-Islamic summit in Riyadh last spring for those who desire peace to drive out the extremists among them. \n\u201cIt is time for all civilized nations, and people, to respond to disagreement with reasoned debate \u2013 not violence,\u201d he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

An appeal might end up in the Minnesota Supreme Court. \n\u201cIt would be great, in some senses, if this was appealed, because it would create some case law and give us some guidance and a template of what our options are,\u201d Jandt said, according to the news agency. \u201cThis really is uncharted water.\u201d \nHowever, some Houston County Commissioners might not support a ban on frac sand mining, as Miller told the news agency that he would \u201crather not say\u201d if he supported a ban.

Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), ranking member of House Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cThis decision is long overdue and helps correct a decades-long indignity.\u201d \nSen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), ranking member of Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Trump\u2019s announcement \u201cimplements what Congress affirmed in 1995 with the passage of the Jerusalem Embassy Act: Jerusalem is the capital of the State of Israel and the location of the U.S. Embassy should reflect this fact.\u201d \n\u201cGoing forward, it is critical that all religious and ethnic groups continue to have access to Jerusalem,\u201d he added. \n\u201cThe president\u2019s decision today is a recognition of existing U.S. law that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and that the U.S. embassy should ultimately be located in the capital,\u201d Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.), ranking member of House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa, said in a joint statement with the subcommittee\u2019s chair, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) \n\u201cThere is no debate that the Jewish people have a deep-rooted religious, cultural and historic tie to Jerusalem, and today\u2019s decision reaffirms that connection,\u201d they said. \n\u201cJerusalem is the capital of Israel, and I\u2019ve strongly supported acknowledging that simple fact,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Ct.). \n\u201cMy hope is that the president\u2019s announcement of his recognition of Jerusalem will be followed by meaningful steps to advance the peace process, including secure borders for Israel and a two-state solution.\u201d \nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) did not issue a statement Wednesday but as recently as October called for Trump to move the embassy to Jerusalem \u2013 and to do so now, as Israel marks the 50th anniversary of the city\u2019s reunification. \nA cautious response came from Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), who affirmed that Jerusalem is Israel\u2019s capital but voiced concern that Trump\u2019s \u201cannouncement today \u2013 absent support from regional partners and allies, and outside the confines of a plan \u2013 undermines the prospect for negotiations and risks destabilizing an already volatile region.\u201d \n\u2018Another diplomatic blunder and unforced error\u2019 \nOutright opposition to Trump\u2019s move came from a number of Democrats, including Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who said that \u201cJerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish homeland\u201d but that \u201cin the absence of a negotiated settlement between Israel and the Palestinians, moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem now may needlessly spark mass protests, fuel tensions, and make it more difficult to reach a durable peace.\u201d \nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) called Trump\u2019s decision \u201ca major setback to a two-state solution,\u201d and one that \u201crejects decades of bipartisan policy and undermines our standing with the Palestinians and our partners in the region.\u201d \nImplicitly responding to criticism of her opposition despite her support \u2013 both in 1995 and again just six months ago \u2013 for moving the embassy to Jerusalem, Feinstein said that the vote in 1995 was to move the embassy \u201cin the context of the Oslo peace process.\u201d \n\u201cToday, there are no direct negotiations, and by taking this action there\u2019s a real potential to further inflame the Middle East,\u201d she said. \nSen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), ranking member of Senate Armed Services Committee, called the move \u201canother diplomatic blunder and unforced error by President Trump.\u201d \n\u201cThe timing of this announcement and the way it was unveiled could trigger a backlash against Israel and American interests and personnel overseas.\u201d \nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said he was \u201cvery concerned that President Trump\u2019s announcement will further s\u200eet back efforts to achieve a two-state solution. I support \u200ethe longstanding U.S. policy that Jerusalem\u2019s permanent status needs to be decided by the parties in final peace negotiations.\u201d \nKaine also expressed concern about negative reaction around the world and the potential impact the move could have on the safety of U.S. personnel abroad. \n\u201cCampaign promises to score political points, without careful consideration of U.S. national interests, rarely make good policy, and I fear this is a particularly dangerous example of that,\u201d opined Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) \n\u201cI firmly support Israel\u2019s security and believe this announcement is harmful to both U.S. and Israeli interests,\u201d said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) \n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the president chose to ignore warnings from many U.S. allies and partners around the world about his decision\u2019s negative impact on the peace process and the heightened tensions it will cause.\u201d \nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, in a statement ahead of Trump\u2019s announcement, said, \u201cWhat the U.S. should be doing now is bringing adversaries in the Middle East together to seek common solutions, not exacerbating tensions in this highly volatile region.\u201d \nEnjoying your CNSNews.com article?

the curse of Lindsay Lohan ever be lifted? Ever since 2010\u2019s disastrously hilarious but tragic meeting between this house and \u201cthe actress turned self-bronzer entrepreneur,\u201d as Nicole Phelps finely phrased it in her review, a noxious cloud of disdain has hung over Emanuel Ungaro. Fausto Puglisi\u2019s recently ended tenure there was neither complete catastrophe nor total triumph, although it met a sticky end because of production issues \nThere have been other failures in the interim between the year of Lohan and the now too tiresomely meh to mention. Would Marco Colagrossi\u2014the Giorgio Armani and Dolce & Gabbana alum who showed his first runway collection as creative director today\u2014be the man to lift the sword from the stone, slay the dragon, and kill the witch? If you listened to the deliciously uncharitable murmurings from some of the showgoers as we left, then no. This did not go down well. However, I say look again. For if Ungaro is ever to be rehabilitated\u2014rescued from the fate toward which Lanvin is plummeting\u2014then the cycle of Lohan-established license to ridicule (so delicious for those editors who have been cowed to never cast aspersions on the houses that keep them) must at least be challenged. \n After negotiating a stupidly handled entrance (note to the Lohan-esque, red-headed door chief: When you\u2019re representing a house already lamed, why shoot it in the foot afresh by ignoring editors from the Financial Times and, ahem, Vogue Runway to wave in your random pals?), Colagrossi talked a good game preshow. He was humble, and he was right to be.\n\nColagrossi said: \u201cThis is an homage. If I am part of the audience that comes to Ungaro, I want to see Ungaro. Nobody knows Marco Colagrossi and nobody cares. Maybe next season, if I have the chance to continue this work, you will see more from Marco.\u201d \n So, great philosophy. But what about the clothes? Colagrossi paid due diligence to the codes of Ungaro (I thought) rather well. He used a superfine menswear cotton in gray to make tailored pieces cut in with violet organza. Of course, he inserted floating-stitched polka dots of corduroy in vibrantly violent color combinations. The punchy floral jacquards in softened \u201980s shapes\u2014puff skirts with trains!\u2014were nods to a time that is really not our time, but which needed to be noted if this latest iteration of the house was going to work. Beneath the garishness and the bow-tied neck details was evidence of a keen and seasoned hand. The white unfinished toile section that preceded the Matisse-inspired color blast of collage at the end was a clear expression of the disarray and incompleteness into which this house has fallen: the pretty acknowledgment of an ugly problem.
