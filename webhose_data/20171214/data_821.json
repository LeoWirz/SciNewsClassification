The truth is we all have faced this particular battle at one point or another. Some people are fortunate to have overcome it, others are not always as successful. \nHow to fight lust & porn with God\u2019s words (godlydating101) Today, we search the scriptures to discover how our Heavenly Father wants us to overcome these temptations. Here are top 10 Bible verses that show us how to fight lust, porn and other sexual desires. 2 Timothy 2:22 warns, \u201cSo flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.\u201d In other words, run away like Joseph did from Potiphar's wife . Run away from these desires and run TO God, not other things. First Corinthians 6:18 offers a similar warning, \u201cFlee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body.\u201d Don't entertain it, just flee from it. \nHow to fight lust & porn with God\u2019s words (pinterest) 1 Thessalonians 4:3\u20134 tells us wants God wants for us, \u201cFor this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each one of you knows how to control his own body in holiness and honour.\u201d Proverbs 5:18\u201319 reminds us that sexual desires are not bad as long as it is with your spouse. \u201cLet your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth, a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight; be intoxicated always in her love.\u201d \nBe like Joseph, who was able to resist temptation (ubdavid) For singles, Lamentations 3:25\u201327 tells us to hang in there for our spouse and not give into our desires, \u201cThe Lord is good to those who wait for him, to the soul who seeks him. It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord. It is good for a man that he bears the yoke in his youth.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "potiphar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "timothy 2:22", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "god", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:03.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dfb3f3e6d1f0153d7dae67051d12d1e5e041aafe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Q.mD6qQ5T7ZW8Oktf9_bOY3edjJ6YVuLCYCL0m4lq8HzAWqDI9G6RsvswGOmwORM-", "site_full": "www.cntvboxnow.com", "site": "cntvboxnow.com", "site_section": "http://www.cntvboxnow.com/forum-23-1.html", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "\u65e5\u97d3\u7d9c\u85dd\u7bc0\u76ee\u5c08\u5340 - \u516c\u4ed4\u7bb1\u8ad6\u58c7 - Powered by Discuz!", "title": "170903 KBS \u5169\u5929\u4e00\u591cS3 E657", "title_full": "170903 KBS \u5169\u5929\u4e00\u591cS3 E657 [\u97d3\u8a9e\u4e2d\u5b57] - \u65e5\u97d3\u7d9c\u85dd\u7bc0\u76ee\u5c08\u5340 - \u516c\u4ed4\u7bb1\u8ad6\u58c7 - Powered by Discuz!", "published": "2017-09-07T13:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f290fa95639658252f8f6ac2df328dd22bebce4d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Q.mD6qQ5T7ZW8Oktf9_bOY3edjJ6YVuLCYCL0m4lq8HzAWqDI9G6Ri9ohWqrXlv.w5fwTnrkIwQ--", "ord_in_thread": 11, "author": "ricky0942", "published": "2017-12-06T16:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Thanks for sharing", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:03.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eb8fe852f0edd4c0c1f2c937983eaa47a66882b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Xs9dwluKAcmvrqW3hxvQiPsi0iUV8uKdKbuVBMlXRyeej9z0QQqTvEtkQhJFcg4pGQlawU.f8yQ--", "site_full": "www.greekchat.com", "site": "greekchat.com", "site_section": "http://www.greekchat.com/gcforums/forumdisplay.php?f=24", "site_categories": ["tennis", "sports"], "section_title": "Greek Life - GreekChat.com Forums", "title": "Redmi 5 Plus packs 64GB storage!! - GreekChat.com Forums", "title_full": "Redmi 5 Plus packs 64GB storage!! - GreekChat.com Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.458, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb8fe852f0edd4c0c1f2c937983eaa47a66882b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Xs9dwluKAcmvrqW3hxvQiPsi0iUV8uKdKbuVBMlXRyeej9z0QQqTvEtkQhJFcg4pGQlawU.f8yQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bscott862", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "Redmi 5 Plus packs 64GB storage!! - GreekChat.com Forums", "text": "Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus packs 5.99-inch display, 2GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 625 14nm Mobile Platform with Adreno 506 GPU, 4GB RAM with 64GB storage, Fingerprint sensor, Infrared sensor, 4000mAh battery and runs android nougat.\nGotham Season 4 Episode 11 Live Stream The Big Bang Theory Season 11 Episode 10 Live Stream Mozart in the Jungle Season 4 Episode 1 Live Stream Life in Pieces Season 3 Episode 6 Live Stream The Orville Episode 12 Live Stream Young Sheldon Episode 7 Live Stream Mom Season 5 Episode 6 Live Stream S.W.A.T.

David Blackman reports. Photography by Belinda Lawley \nSponsored by: \nHousing association business models are under the spotlight amid increased ambition to address housing need and renewed political pressure to deliver more homes and services. \n\nRecent debates over ways to increase financial and development capacity have tended to focus on efficiency, mergers and off-balance sheet vehicles, but have also reopened the long-running discussion about whether equity has a place in a non-profit sector. In the meantime, new-to-sector funding and delivery models have gained traction this year, namely in the form of real estate investment trusts (REITs). \n\nTo explore how associations are shaping up in a changing landscape, Social Housing and Devonshires Solicitors brought together housing leaders, funders, REITs and advisors for a round table discussion. \n\nThe event took place a week before last month\u2019s Budget, with the outlook for housing associations brighter than it has been for many years. \nPositive outlook \nJonathan Walters, deputy director of strategy and performance at the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA), said: \u201cThe world has moved on a lot. Two years ago, it felt like [the sector] was being kicked from a number of different angles. Now it is seen as a key delivery partner \u2013 but if it doesn\u2019t deliver there will be political consequences.\u201d \n\nMatthew Bailes, chief executive of Paradigm Housing Group and formerly of the HCA, said that the government\u2019s more emollient approach to the sector is a pragmatic response to wider economic and political uncertainties. \n\n\u201cThey see the need for a countercyclical buffer, mostly due to Brexit, but also due to the inevitable rise of interest rates. \n\n\u201cIf market sentiment becomes very difficult, a lot of people are going to catch a cold in the South.\u201d \n\nGiven the likelihood of another three to four years of economic uncertainty, he said the sector is \u201cwell placed to sustain its position round the table\u201d. \n\nPhil Jenkins, managing director of Centrus, questioned to what extent housing associations can still be described as countercyclical actors in the housing market. \n\nHe said: \u201cIf you look at where development is concentrated at the top end, a lot of models are based on outright and first tranche shared ownership sales to make schemes stack up.\u201d \n\nMr Walters warned that associations are at risk of becoming too wedded to the vagaries of the wider housing market: \u201cThe more pro-cyclical the sector becomes, the more it destroys its key unique selling point with government and investors: the sector needs to think quite hard about how it balances its market against its core product.\u201d \n\nBut others argued that systemic shifts in the housing market mean that the sector is obliged to respond to a wider spectrum of need than it has historically. \n\n\u201cThe meta-economics of owner-occupation mean that almost nobody could afford it if you took it off them,\u201d said Brian Cronin, chief executive of North West-based Your Housing Group (YHG). \n\nHe said the government wants to be presented with a solution for the increasing numbers of 25 to 40-year-olds who are renting privately with no security of tenure. \n\n\u201cThere are some people who will never be owner-occupiers who would have been 20 years ago; therefore we need to plan for and manage that. \n\n\u201cThere are a lot more people getting a bad deal in the housing market,\u201d he said. \n\nAllowing this trend to continue, which would effectively replace owner-occupation with private renting for an entire generation, would be \u201cdeeply difficult\u201d without wider pension saving and housing reforms. \n\u201cThe model of high rents and no pension saving is a time bomb for everyone, including the generation affected,\u201d Mr Cronin said. He added that it is not a \u201ctenable future\u201d to force this cohort to keep working so they can keep a roof over their heads, or to make the state pick up the tab. \n\n\u201cThese are big tax and cultural issues for government to tackle,\u201d he said, adding that it is more likely to make an effort to get the next generation onto the housing ladder. \n\nIn order to cater for this growing group, he said YHG is trialling the introduction of lifetime tenancies in its private rented stock. \n\nMr Bailes said that while social landlords have traditionally focused on the relatively small proportion of people who rent social accommodation, they are now gearing up to cater for an entire generation. \n\nAmid the renewed focus on the sector\u2019s traditional core social housing demographic in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster, he said associations have to be careful not to lose sight of this wider population. \n\n\u201cWe have obligations to a whole range of people in the market and a whole age group.\u201d \n\nBuild on strengths \nAndrew Cowan, a partner at law firm Devonshires, suggested that in this changing landscape social landlords could use their balance sheet strength to boost supply: \u201cAssociations have a capital base to intervene, create new markets and then exit like Waitrose did with Ocado,\u201d he said. \n\nBut adopting this more entrepreneurial approach poses challenges to how housing association finances are structured. \n\nMany associations\u2019 financial covenants have not changed in line with the shifts in their underlying business, he pointed out. \u201cTo make that shift you would have to be prepared to refinance all your loans with bond debt where you would end up with different kinds of financial covenants.\u201d \n\nCentrus\u2019 Mr Jenkins added a note of caution. \u201cYou still have to manage your business to a reasonable level of interest cover to satisfy a ratings agency or a regulator,\u201d he said. \n\nHousing associations\u2019 traditional charitable status also came under the microscope at the round table. \nHelen Collins, director at Savills Housing Consultancy, mooted the idea that associations reinvent themselves as what she termed \u201cethical property residential developers\u201d. As long as they agreed that at least 50 per cent of their activity should cater for those excluded from the market, adopting this ethical developer model would give organisations more control over their futures. \n\nThe sector could more fully realise its hugely powerful asset base, without abandoning its social purpose, Ms Collins said. \n\nMr Cowan, meanwhile, was not convinced the public really understood what is meant by housing associations\u2019 not-for-profit status. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sacred cow beyond being a regulatory requirement to keep enough cash in the business,\u201d he said. \n\nFor Mr Cronin the red line was maintaining associations\u2019 status as not-for-profit bodies. \n\nThe introduction of new equity financing will also pose challenges to associations\u2019 traditional business models. \u201cThis sector has been built on high grant rates and low cost of debt, but that\u2019s changing,\u201d said Mr Cowan. \n\nAlex Gipson, lending manager at Legal & General, said the sector remains attractive to investors: \u201cThere is plenty of money out there.\u201d \n\nHowever, several participants at the round table expressed concern that it is becoming too dependent on institutional investment. \n\nMr Gipson said associations have a \u201cdangerous history of being reliant on a single source of capital\u201d, recalling how the sector used to be wedded to bank lending. \n\nHe pointed to HCA figures showing that the sector\u2019s debt is projected to rise from \u00a366bn to \u00a377bn by 2021/22. \n\n\u201cWe have a problem now. Unless we have different types of capital we will be reliant on the investment grade institutional market, which won\u2019t be able to cope.\u201d \n\nMr Jenkins noted what he described as a \u201cslightly destructive tendency in the housing sector to carry on borrowing until we can\u2019t\u201d. \n\n\u201cIf you started with a blank sheet of paper, you wouldn\u2019t start with the capital structure we have. The traditional reliance on debt was fine when you had 50 per cent grant in there because you could manage a sustainable growth position, but without grant you are borrowing more and more against the same asset base.\u201d \n\nThere needs to be a more sustainable way for the sector to deliver, he added. \n\nEquity options \nKen Youngman, chief \ufb01nancial officer of the recently launched Residential Secure Income REIT, said the social housing sector is becoming much more akin to the corporate world, where a mix of debt and equity is common. Historically, he said, the sector\u2019s ability to draw down grant has enabled it to build up equity at no cost. \n\nMr Gipson said associations\u2019 balance sheet strength provides a robust platform that could be leveraged. \u201cThe sector has been sheltered by nil-coupon government grant and has some ability to leverage further,\u201d he said. SPONSORED ARTICLE \nMr Youngman said that equity could also help organisations to absorb losses during a downturn. \u201cYou still have to pay coupon on debt, whereas equity gives the ability to ride that period out.\u201d \n\nHowever, Paradigm\u2019s Mr Bailes doubted that associations could use equity to finance their traditional mainstream provision. \u201cSocial housing without subsidy is not really an investable proposition. It\u2019s difficult to see how that would work in affordable housing because without subsidy the returns would not service the debt or equity,\u201d he said. \n\nIn addition, there are potential reputational risks for associations when tapping equity providers, said Mr Jenkins. He said: \u201cYou have to understand the capital you are getting into bed with.\u201d \n\nHe noted that boards are more likely to be cautious when dealing with US hedge funds than long-established UK institutions like L&G. \n\n\u201cIf you are getting a board to agree a transaction you will get a very different view of reputational risk if you are trying to do a deal with Blackstone as opposed to L&G. Those organisations have a very strong vested interest in their own reputation.\u201d \n\nMr Cowan queried whether this should necessarily be the case. \u201cL&G is much more susceptible to political interference than a non\u2011UK fund,\u201d he said. \n\nMore broadly, Mr Jenkins said there is plenty of scope for misalignments of interest between associations and investors. \n\n\u201cAs a housing association you have a very long-term mind set: you can take a 100-year view.\u201d \n\nBy contrast, he said, for many City of London funders, taking a long-term view means seven or eight years. \u201cIf you put those into a structure together it causes real problems down the track.\u201d \n\nAndrew Dawber, director at Civitas Housing Advisors, said much depends on the nature of the investor. He said: \u201cThere will be some very short-term money that is quite aggressive and is not suitable for this sector at all. Equally there will be money that is very passive, has a 20 to 30-year time horizon and is matching liabilities which would be very suitable.\u201d \n\nHe added that the increasingly sophisticated nature of associations means they no longer need just patient capital. \u201cMost housing associations now have a core bit that needs [long-term capital] and other bits that need something different. \n\n\u201cThis sector needs some impatient capital as well because some stuff is short-term development.\u201d \n\nHowever, Mr Gipson said that the increasingly opaque nature of housing association balance sheets means that broad-brush ratings no longer provide a clear picture.\u201cLots of organisations are taking capital out of their business and investing it somewhere else to make a greater return. \n\n\u201cA large London housing association that is rated A+ probably has an AA-rated housing association with a sub-investment grade-rated developer in there,\u201d he said. \n\nThis lack of clarity means some investors are uncomfortable about where the business as a whole is heading, Mr Gipson said, giving the example of a large London developing association that could shed more light on its private rented sector (PRS) returns. He added: \u201cIt needs to bring those investors with it on the journey.\u201d \n\nCentrus\u2019 Mr Jenkins agreed: \u201cThe problem for lenders has been lack of clarity on what value at risk is in which parts of the group.\u201d \n\nHe added that the way Thames Valley has structured its Fizzy Living PRS subsidiary is \u201ca very good template\u201d for other housing associations. \n\n\u201cIf the sector is a bit more honest about where it is going you can get the right capital in the right part of the business,\u201d he said. \n\nThe HCA\u2019s Mr Walters raised concerns over associations\u2019 use of off-balance sheet vehicles. \n\n\u201cThe concern we have with off-balance sheet is that when you go through a few distressed situations, you find that things not on balance sheet have a way of coming back on.\u201d \nSharing the load \nJoint ventures offer another way for associations to boost their capacity. \n\nFenella Edge, treasurer at The Housing Finance Corporation, said that some housing associations have been \u201cnaive\u201d about entering into JVs. \n\nRay Tierney, relationship director for social housing at Lloyds Bank, said the key is to avoid getting into a JV with an organisation that has very different aims. \n\nWorking together, as L&Q is doing with Trafford Housing Trust, could be a better value-for-money option than merger, he said. As an example of the downsides of tie-ups, he pointed to the \u201cstaggering\u201d sums associations have spent on rebuilding IT systems after merging. \n\nBut Mr Cronin said that housing associations remain handicapped by their relatively low output levels compared to house builders, which can secure better procurement deals. \n\n\u201cIf you want to set up an entity that was going to get significant value chain savings, you are talking about 20,000 units per annum so you would probably need 40 to 50 associations to come together in one entity.\u201d \n\nOn a more modest scale, Savills\u2019 Ms Collins told the event that she was working with Devonshires on a bid by Greater Manchester\u2019s housing associations to set up a development vehicle that aims to deliver 500 homes per annum on land released by the conurbation\u2019s local authorities. \n\n\u201cPoliticians are incredibly positive because it\u2019s Greater Manchester which is so much more mature as a combined authority than any other. On the other hand, it\u2019s horribly complicated: I hope that it comes to fruition because it\u2019s very positive.\u201d \n\nThe changing nature of the sector\u2019s business models also raised questions over how it is regulated. Mr Cronin suggested that the housing regulator should adopt a new model, like The Pensions Regulator. \n\n\u201cRather than spending loads of time and effort making sure everyone stays afloat, they have the ability to step in when somebody doesn\u2019t. We manage to make some people stay afloat who shouldn\u2019t.\u201d \n\nHe argued that this different way of regulating the sector should provide lenders with sufficient reassurance.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "housin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew cowan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gipson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex gipson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youngman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian cronin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew bailes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phil jenkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew dawber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ken youngman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jenkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david blackman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "collins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belinda lawley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fenella edge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bailes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helen collins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan walters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ray tierney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cronin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cowan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ocado", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "social housing sponsored", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "housing finance corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greater manchester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "communities agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "your housing group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paradigm housing group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lloyds bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "savills", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social housing and devonshires solicitors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "savills housing consultancy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l&g", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blackstone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "legal & general", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grenfell tower", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "civitas housing advisors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trafford housing trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centrus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "devonshires", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fizzy living prs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "greater manchester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thames valley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:03.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f8cdc014b8aed7570dfea8312d83020858023f4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQujfav8g98PjRMi_ogV.5EwBTfg476RyR00IsoRycVC1nt7Y.6p3oUJQpJs65KqnjA0N35GjXCbx9KM5NV8iFpcnTwTfYJSmc1FDU94hLM38XZbifn7sJa.JgRuyDFqI8p7MLGF48bix_2nY1bgg6Z", "site_full": "www.thelincolnianonline.com", "site": "thelincolnianonline.com", "site_section": "http://www.thelincolnianonline.com/feed", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "The Lincolnian Online", "title": "Rayonier (RYN) & CatchMark Timber Trust (NYSE:CTT) Head to Head Review", "title_full": "Rayonier (RYN) & CatchMark Timber Trust (NYSE:CTT) Head to Head Review", "published": "2017-12-07T12:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/rayonier-inc-logo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f8cdc014b8aed7570dfea8312d83020858023f4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQujfav8g98PjRMi_ogV.5EwBTfg476RyR00IsoRycVC1nt7Y.6p3oUJQpJs65KqnjA0N35GjXCbx9KM5NV8iFpcnTwTfYJSmc1FDU94hLM38XZbifn7sJa.JgRuyDFqI8p7MLGF48bix_2nY1bgg6Z", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Paula Ricardo", "published": "2017-12-07T12:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "Rayonier (RYN) & CatchMark Timber Trust (NYSE:CTT) Head to Head Review", "text": "2.19% \nDividends \nCatchMark Timber Trust pays an annual dividend of $0.54 per share and has a dividend yield of 4.1%.

Macular edema is the state when fluid and protein start accumulating under macula resulting swelling in the eye. Due to this swelling, central vision of eye get distorted. Macular edema is classified into two types namely cystoids macular edema (CME) and diabetic macular edema (DME). The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye and the macula is the part of the retina responsible for sharp, straight-ahead vision. Diabetic retinopathy is common cause for macular edema which happen to people due to diabetic. Macular edema can also be diagnosed in patient after eye surgery for cataract, glaucoma, or retinal disease. \nView Report Preview @ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/macular-edema-therapeutics-market.asp \nThe diseases which damage blood vessel in retina can also cause macular edema. Wavy or blurry vision to noticeable vision loss are primary symptom of macular edema. If one eye affected, there is 50% probability that other eye can also be affected. Macular edema is confirmed by some eye examination such as visual acuity test, dilated exam test and tonometry. The main aim for treatment of macular edema is to stabilize vision by sealing off leaking blood vessels. Focal laser treatment is often used to reduce swelling of the macula. \nThe change in life style have the increased rate of diabetic patients is major driving factors of macular therapeutics market globally. The change in climatic conditions nowadays have huge impact on human health due to which several eye diseases can occur. The increase patient of diabetic retinopathy causes loss of vision have increase the demand of macular edema market globally. Growing aged population have shown increase in eye diseases dramatically. Failure of eye surgery cataract, glaucoma, or retinal disease can also rise the market of macular edema therapeutics worldwide. \nRequest to View Sample of Research Report @ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/13717 \nThe increase of aged population have become leading issue for increase of edema therapeutics market globally.

reveals all about Ibrahimovic's first day at Manchester United Jose Mourinho has discussed Zlatan Ibrahimovic's road to recovery following his serious knee injury. \nAs you might imagine, after signing on a free transfer last summer, Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasted little time asserting himself on his first day at Manchester United. \nAs recalled by teammate Juan Mata, the Swede didn't let nerves get the better of him on his arrival and instead set about striking fear into the hearts of United's kit men. \n\"The day he arrived, we were away on preseason, so he was on his own with the kit men at the training ground,\" Mata told FourFourTwo magazine. \n\"They had never met him before and he's the sort of guy that garners instant respect because of the way he carries himself. \n\"Zlatan

Why? Let\u2019s look at the signposts around us. \nHousing need \nDemand for our core product of social or affordable rented housing is rising. The population is growing, both in absolute and household formation terms, and the proportion of our population able to meet its housing needs in the private market without subsidy is shrinking as the cost of housing grows in real terms and real wage growth fails to keep up. \n\nOn average, there are 25 households on the waiting list for every affordable home the sector provides, rising to more than 80 in some London boroughs. \n\nThis is despite current levels of grants which have, at least in the government\u2019s eyes, been generous (although we know that the total amount goes less far than it did as costs rise). \n\nAt the same time, the total sector surplus has been rising year on year, to well over \u00a33bn. That is, of course, a good thing. But we have to be careful how that is viewed by politicians and customers. \n\nThe customer base is widening as housing need creeps ever upwards across a range of income levels. \n\nOn any measure of affordability, average house prices as a multiple of earnings are too high, and therefore housing costs as a proportion of total household income are unsustainably high for many. \n\nDiversifying \nThe sector is meeting that challenge through diversification, as clearly shown by the rising contribution to the surplus made by sales. \n\nBut more private sales and market renting bring a greater risk of a pro-cyclical financial performance in step with the housing market. \n\nSince the 2008 crash, the sector has been fortunate in riding a benign cycle of house prices. \n\nMoreover, at a crude level, there is some correlation between RPs\u2019 asset values and house price inflation, as well as the trend in market rents. \n\nThis is particularly true, of course, of values on the basis of MV-T, which should have led over this period to greater debt capacity for many (subject to that borrowing being serviceable). \n\nThe latest figures from the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) certainly show that appetite is there \u2013 additional borrowing requirements identified by RPs to the HCA total about \u00a325.8bn over the next five years (net \u00a313.5bn). Asset values of course have a huge role to play in supporting that increased borrowing. \nRoads ahead \nSo those are the signposts; what about the choice of roads ahead? \n\nFirst, as far as asset values are concerned, the deregulatory measures introduced in April put a good deal of power in RPs\u2019 own hands in terms of freedom around asset management decisions and thus the creation of helpful market evidence. \n\nAs has been well publicised during the year, valuers are engaged with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and other stakeholders to change the definition of EUV-SH, to bring it back into line with recent legislation. That could lead to increases in EUV-SH valuations, whether in support of debt or on balance sheets, depending on RPs\u2019 behaviour and the evidence this generates. \n\nI appreciate, however, that funders need to come to terms with those proposed changes and the scale of any resulting increases in valuations. But they should take confidence from the sector\u2019s zero-default track record; the relationship between EUV-SH values and market values with vacant possession; and the unchanging ethos which underpins their borrowers\u2019 management and governance. \n\nBut it is not just about asset values. It is also about RPs\u2019 ability to service that debt, and there are certainly some challenges in terms of operational risk on the road ahead. Chief among these are welfare reform and the impact of Universal Credit on cashflow, the ability to drive efficiencies out of the current wave of mergers and rent policy beyond 2025. \n\nMoreover, the tragedy of Grenfell Tower in June must be recognised as a watershed moment for RPs, councils and government. If any good is to come from the dreadful loss of life, it will be in political recognition of the need for investment in buildings to minimise the chance of this ever happening again. \n\nBut, for many RPs and councils, the necessary investment will divert cash from other areas. \n\nIt is right and proper that the money be spent, and while the Autumn Budget may have brought some positives for housing overall, difficult financial choices remain for many RPs. And if we can overcome all those challenges, we have still got to build the new homes we need. \n\nThe significant challenges of an ageing and shrinking workforce, compounded by Brexit, and building cost inflation running at almost four per cent per annum, underlines the scale of the task. The number of planning applications going in, and approvals given, are on the rise but implementing them is not going to be easy. \n\nEmbracing the opportunities of modular construction will certainly have its part to play. \n\nDespite all these challenges, the government has given us almost all we asked for as a sector with partial deregulation (yet still with the security of strong regulation), CPI+1% coming back, \u00a32bn of additional support on offer \u2013 and there is some strongly supportive rhetoric, combined with a number of the more challenging policies being kicked into the long grass. \n\nAs a sector, we must therefore seize the agenda government has set out for us and get on with building. \n\nIf we do not show that we can do that quickly, on a sufficient scale, with sufficient ambition, government of any colour is not likely to allow us to dither long at the crossroads.

The data reflects the growing difficulties first-time buyers in London face trying to get onto the property ladder. \nLONDON \u2014 The average first-time buyer deposit in London could soar to an eye-watering \u00a3250,000 within a decade, according to new research from broker L&C Mortgages. \nThe firm said average deposits in the capital could rise from \u00a3140,000 this year to \u00a3245,000 by 2027, which represents a 75% rise. Nationally, average deposits could rise from \u00a352,000 to \u00a381,000 in the same period, nearly a 60% rise. \nONS House Price Index to extrapolate what the average dwelling price and mortgage advances were given to first time buyers in the UK's 17 key cities over the past 20 years. From the gap between the average dwelling price recorded and the average mortgage advance received we were able to calculate what deposits were put up front by first-time buyers. \nWhile the \u00a3140,000 figure may seem high, it is not far off other estimates of the current average deposit. Halifax calculated in July that Londoners are putting down an average deposit of \u00a3106,577 to get on the housing ladder. The bank said the average price paid by a first-time buyer in London now stands at around \u00a3410,000. \nThe data reflects the growing difficulties first-time buyers face trying to get onto the property ladder, particularly in London, where high demand and a shortage of housing stock means price growth has outstripped the rest of the UK for over two decades. Data from Hometrack found the average house price in the capital is already 14.5 times the earnings of an average Londoner, the highest level on record. \nnull (L&C) \nHere's how L&G's predictions break down for other UK cities: Mortgage costs are expected to rise due to higher house prices and because higher prices usually mean that the proportion of the dwelling value that needs to be covered by a deposit increases in order to make the mortgage payments affordable. \nFigures from the Office for National Statistics earlier this week show that the value of land in the UK has grown fivefold since 1995 and is the country's most valuable asset, worth an estimated \u00a35 trillion. \nThe average house price in London was \u00a3484,000 in August 2017, according to the Office for National Statistics, compared with a UK average of \u00a3226,000. Estate agents Savills forecasts that prices will dip 2% next year before returning to robust growth. |", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "office for national statistics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "savills", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l&g", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "notting hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hometrack", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "halifax", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:05.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f52946fe30a45f87fc21f3ae3427c44545a18f52", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWYwvU1LUg0AEB6HKr0DIoR8kjFTeqrVA1pyAdgnKSqK6l3XGHGTAcU5DQWWUiJF35BG5HitNpk3H.tKDzwxDpGu.d5CBxgK.UVgLGLp8mWkLx5smnZH9.Xp_5g2ayvNruA-", "site_full": "homemadewoodworkingjig.blogspot.co.il", "site": "blogspot.co.il", "site_section": "http://homemadewoodworkingjig.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Homemade woodworking jig", "title": "woodworking machinery suppliers ireland", "title_full": "woodworking machinery suppliers ireland", "published": "2017-12-07T12:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f52946fe30a45f87fc21f3ae3427c44545a18f52", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWYwvU1LUg0AEB6HKr0DIoR8kjFTeqrVA1pyAdgnKSqK6l3XGHGTAcU5DQWWUiJF35BG5HitNpk3H.tKDzwxDpGu.d5CBxgK.UVgLGLp8mWkLx5smnZH9.Xp_5g2ayvNruA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Supa Zaka (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "woodworking machinery suppliers ireland", "text": "woodworking machinery suppliers ireland woodworking machinery suppliers ireland Quality woodworking equipment for sale in ireland, briquetting machines, new woodworking machines, used woodworking machinery, the best price in ireland.

Turns out, you might be able to do that. Or\u2026maybe not. \nThe disappointing truth is that while some items we expect to increase in value can pay off handsomely, many others don\u2019t. (Sorry, beanie baby collectors.) \u201cThe main drivers of value appreciation are scarcity, item condition and cultural relevance,\u201d says Sam Bright, eBay\u2019s EBAY, +0.05% general manager of art and collectibles. \u201cFor example, the recent, well-received \u2018Wonder Woman\u2019 movie led to a spike in demand and prices for associated collectibles such as comics, Funko Pop and entertainment memorabilia.\u201d\nWondering whether your stuff is worth hanging onto for the long term? We looked at 11 popular collectibles and which are likely to actually increase in value (or not).\nDesigner handbags Starting with the bad news: Designer handbags aren\u2019t likely to increase in value. However, certain brands, like Gucci and Louis Vuitton, LVMUY, +0.46% could reasonably sell for about 50% of their original price tag on resale marketplaces like Vestiaire Collective or Rebagg. Just keep in mind that most consignment sites take a large cut of your profits, and the bag should be in excellent condition.\nBaseball cards Rare, in-demand baseball cards in good condition have significantly increased in value over the years, Bright says. For example, In October, a 1952 Mickey Mantle card sold for more than $40,000, and a 2013 Aaron Judge autographed card sold for $14,655. Not quite as dramatic, but more contemporary cards could also net double-digit earnings from the right buyer: A 2017 Ian Happ rookie card sold for $19.99 recently, and a 2014 Mookie Betts rookie card sold for $36.\nEngagement ring If you\u2019re selling an engagement ring, chances are there\u2019s some emotional baggage attached and any money you get might feel like a bonus\u2014which is good because you probably won\u2019t get much. While preowned rings are selling from about $1,000 to $20,000 on sites like I Do Now I Don\u2019t and Have You Seen the Ring, you\u2019ll likely only recoup a fraction\u2014perhaps as low as 20% \u2014 of the original purchase price. \nWhen you buy a ring from a jeweler, you\u2019re not just paying for the jewelry itself\u2014you\u2019re also covering the cost of other materials, labor, marketing and even the store\u2019s operating costs.\nFancy sneakers Sneakers like Nike NKE, -1.16% Air Jordans have been hot since they were first released in the 80s. If you\u2019ve held on to originals, you can likely earn a couple hundred or more per pair on eBay or at a consignment store\u2014but even new releases could offer a quick return: Last year, the Air Jordan 1 Top 3 was released on Cyber Monday with a price tag of $160, but the shoes now sell for more than $450 , even at Wal-Mart. WMT, -0.56% \nDesigner clothes Spending a fortune on your wardrobe isn\u2019t likely to help your budget today or tomorrow. Designer clothing resales are more about buyers getting great deals than sellers earning income. Currently, designer duds like Chanel and Herm\u00e8s RMS, +0.29% are selling for up to 90% off on resale site The Real Real. If you\u2019re still looking to unload some pieces, consider swapping on sites like Snob Swap and Haute Trader.\nDolls It\u2019s not impossible to get rich off your doll collection\u2014a porcelain doll from 1916 sold in 2014 for $300,000 , for example\u2014but it\u2019s unlikely, especially if your closet is full of Cabbage Patch Kids and American Girl dolls. You can easily nab a Cabbage Patch Kid on eBay for about $10, and many American Girl dolls are selling for well under their original price of $100-plus.\nStamps \u201cHighly graded, rare stamps have increased and are likely to [continue to] increase in value,\u201d Bright says. An eBay seller recently sold a sheet of the world\u2019s most famous stamp, the Uninverted Jenny Error Stamp Sheet , for $71,200. The stamps were completely unused and never folded, so the perfect condition drove up the price.\nIf you like to hunt for unique stamps and hold on to them for several years, this collection could also pay off on a smaller scale: One couple paid 10 cents for an interesting old stamp and then sold it for $200.\nAction figures Some rare figures can be big moneymakers: As new \u201cStar Wars\u201d films are released, original Star Wars action figures are selling for five and six figures on eBay. As for everything else? Most wrestling and sports figures are generally worth just a few bucks each.\nComic books Everybody knows one of those guys with a stash of old comic books in the attic\u2014and the good news is that some of those comics could be worth more than the whole house. The original comic books that go along with new movie releases have been among the most successful in recent years.\nFor instance, a 50-year old Spider-Man book sold on eBay for $24,500 after the movie released in 2012. And last summer, after the release of \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d a collection of three Wonder Woman comics sold on eBay for hundreds of thousands.\nVideogames Got a box of videogames leftover from your childhood (or last year)? Some are likely to net a nice payday\u2014or at least help you get your money back. For instance, a copy of Turok Rage Wars for Nintendo 64 recently sold on eBay for $119.99, Shadow of Earth for XBOX One sold for $45 and Call of Duty: WWII for PlayStation 4 sold for $44.19.\nHot wheels Getty Images Enjoy playing with your Hot Wheels, they aren\u2019t worth much. If you\u2019re holding on to these mini cars and trucks for a big payday, it\u2019s time for a new get-rich plan. While 80s and 90s kids may feel nostalgic about their Hot Wheels, toy maker Mattel MAT, -4.95% made so many that the marketplace has been flooded. Plus, the company continues to release about 250 new models every year. With so many Hot Wheels available, none of them are worth very much money.\nRead the original article on Grow .\nMore from Grow: Retire at 30? Save $1 Million on a $55,000 Salary?

In D.C., shoppers pay 289% more than the national average on gifts.\nTo produce its ranking, Millennial Personal Finance used data from the U.S. Census Bureau cost of living index compiled by real-estate data firm Onboard Analytics. The index was based on the cost of a range of gifts including apparel, accessories, cash, recreation and household furnishings, among other items. \nBut you don\u2019t need to live steps from the White House to be paying more when shopping for gifts than the national average. Alaskans pay nearly double the national average for presents. In eight other states \u2014 Hawaii, New York, Michigan, New Jersey, California, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Maryland \u2014 people will fork over upwards of 20% more to buy gifts during the holidays.\nAlso see: These holiday gifts could increase the value of your friend\u2019s home \nIn some cities though, gifts can be even more expensive. Stony Brook, N.Y., is the worst culprit in this regard \u2014 gift shopping there will cost a consumer more than 78 times the national average. Not far behind is East Lansing, Mich., where gifts are nearly 77 times more expensive than the national average. \nAs for the cheapest places to shop, West Virginia and Arkansas are the best at the state-level, with gifts costing 15% less than the national average. And Playa Vista, Calif., a suburb of Los Angeles, is the cheapest metropolitan area on the ranking \u2014 gifts there will be 44% cheaper than the national average.\nDon\u2019t miss: Help your children save for college and pay off student debt \nSo why are some places cheaper than others when it comes to holiday shopping? There\u2019s no one reason. Some point to the Balassa-Samuelson effect, which The Atlantic nicknamed the \u201cnanny effect.\u201d This economic theory suggests that as wages rise in a given location (whether a city, state or country), then prices of goods will also rise.\nReal estate also plays a role \u2014 if rents are more expensive, stores will need to sell more goods or sell them for a higher price to make ends meet. Similarly, if fuel prices are higher in a given place, then transporting items gets more expensive, creating a similar trickle-down effect. That\u2019s likely the case for places like Alaska and Hawaii, which import far more than other states due to their location.\nMore from MarketWatch How to give gifts that truly pay off for friends and family These gifts will improve your life more than a new sweater Read this before you buy someone bitcoin as a gift", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "onboard analytics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. census bureau", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "district of columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mich.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balassa-samuelson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stony brook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arkansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new jersey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "playa vista", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.y.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east lansing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alaska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:06.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3b521626fd307ee51ca992cfbd30bbca8e2a2f8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTcaEpr0Q7xVsXO92W1D1CnUVoiWU5T6aL7X2g_B2fyZACGHG.CfrObzMigDkUKVY5zRfaj4UsJE3lhr4aY6aSCFV1S809ZAexxafSDf9WRp3BxvdiI3Vc3zQ--", "site_full": "www.heraldscotland.com", "site": "heraldscotland.com", "site_section": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/homenews/", "site_categories": ["media", "climbing", "sports"], "section_title": "Home news from the HeraldScotland", "title": "Controversial Named Persons plan stopped in its tracks", "title_full": "Controversial Named Persons plan stopped in its tracks | HeraldScotland", "published": "2017-12-06T20:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7150407/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31684, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9aa00976f551075c5a975bdaf2ffea8629b885a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTcaEpr0Q7xVsXO92W1D1CnUVoiWU5T6aL7X2g_B2fyZACGHG.CfrObzMigDkUKVY5zRfaj4UsJE3lhr4aY6aSCFV1S809ZAexxafSDf9WRp3CvDtMjvlsUALKQTBZXaPf3", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "richard richardson", "published": "2017-12-07T09:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "1. \\\"Nine highly respected and mainstream children's charities support the Named Person Scheme\\\" \\n\\nEveryone supports the aims behind the scheme!

guardian for every child in Scotland have been stopped in their tracks \u2013 18 months after they should have been rolled out.\nThe troubled policy was dealt a blow in July when the Supreme Court ruled elements of the so-called Named Person scheme were unlawful.\nAfter MSPs voted yesterday to block a bill designed to fix the scheme, opponents urged Mr Swinney to ditch the policy and accused the Deputy First Minister of \u201ccack-handed\u201d management.\nIn doing so, the Education Committee rejected a personal plea from the minister to back the key bill with a crucial stage one report.\nThe committee said they would withhold support until details of the rules set to be issued to teachers, health visitors and other named persons were published.\nThe Children and Young People (Information Sharing) bill was introduced by Mr Swinney after the Supreme Court ruled in July that elements of the 'Named Person' policy were unlawful.\nIt is designed to clarify the law on when and how confidential information about children can be shared, enabling ministers to press ahead with the policy.\nBut Scottish Conservative Shadow Education Secretary Liz Smith said that since the Supreme Court ruling ministers had only succeeded in making named person proposals more confusing.\nShe added: \u201cThis is a very unusual step for any committee to take but it is the right one.\n\"Frankly, this whole parliamentary process is a mess and the responsibility for that lies solely with the Scottish Government .\n\u201cIt is little wonder that so many members of the public are telling John Swinney to cut his losses, ditch the bill and start again with a different policy.\u201d\nScottish Labour \u2019s education spokesperson, Iain Gray, said his party backed the scheme, but added: \u201cJohn Swinney\u2019s cack-handed incompetence has created a situation where his own policy is falling apart.\n\u201cMr Swinney\u2019s Bill as it stands is unworkable and deemed illegal \u2013 and now he has failed to convince the Scottish Parliament \u2019s Education Committee that he knows how to fix it.\nA spokesman for the Scottish Government said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the committee\u2019s decision, and ministers would consider the implications for the information sharing bill.\nThe committee scrutinising the policy \u2013 the Education and Skills Committee \u2013 wanted more details of how the scheme would work in practice but the Scottish Government said they could not produce them until an independent expert panel \u2013 set up by Mr Swinney \u2013 reports back in September 2018.\nThe committee\u2019s refusal to endorse the bill was a direct snub for Mr Swinney whose wrote last Thursday warning members they risked undermining confidence in the named persons policy and derailing flagship childcare policy Girfec (Getting it Right for Every Child).\nThe decision appears to leave the minister and MSPs at an impasse, delaying named persons for at least another nine months. According to parliamentary rules, a law cannot proceed at Holyrood until the \u201clead committee\u201d reports that it agrees the general principles of the bill.

One more granita di caff\u00e8 at Tazza D'Oro. One more impromptu softball game in Santo Stefano di Sessanio together. One more.\n\n\nJust like this blog started eight years ago as a journal of thoughts followed by recipes, today I'm honoring the memory and the greatness of my Dad by assembling an ideal menu made up of all the dishes he loved, the majority of which were Italian\u2013\u2013or so I like to think. I'm going to cook them all for him.\n\nSo here goes, Dad, I hope you enjoy it.\n\n\nAntipasto \nProsciutto e Melone \u2013 Dad, you loved this classic Italian hors d'oeuvre. If prosciutto was unavailable, you'd sprinkle salt on your cantaloupe. This created the same perfect umami contrast. You often told a story of your Navy days in the Philippines. One of these memories was of you and a fellow officer riding on a boat to a local's house. It was a sweltering hot day. In the distance you saw the woman whose house you were headed to standing on the jetty, holding a jug of what looked like pulpy orange juice. You hated pulpy orange juice more than you hated blue cheese. A mix of disgust and fear of being impolite when declining to drink the beverage washed over you. Imagine your surprise when you soon realized the contents of the jug was crushed cantaloupe melon! You said you didn't let anyone else have much of it. Eating melon will never be the same for me. I will always smile and think of you with every bite.\n\nPrimo piatto \nAnything al Pesto \u2013 You had this thing with pesto sauce. When you'd come visit us in Rome, this was always your first pasta choice. I remember this one time you came to visit when E. was 2 and for the welcome dinner I made gnocchi al pesto for you, a classic go-to and, modestly, a personal showpiece. Well, that night the gnocchi turned out to be a disaster: a collapsed, sticky mass sunken at the bottom of the pot. I fished it out and attempted dressing it with my homemade pesto sauce, which somehow had oxidized and looked dark gray instead of bright green. You ate a full helping of it and feigned appreciation, but I could sense the effort each time you swallowed a bite. Maybe you would have rather eaten my pesto lasagna. Damn, I wish I had baked that for you instead.\n\n\nSecondo piatto \nScaloppine al limone \u2013 I think these were your favorite over saltimbocca alla romana . Whichever veal cutlet recipe it was, the competition was close. I remember how you savored each bite, carefully cutting small portions with your knife and fork, eating them slowly in order to make the joy last.\n\n\n\nRemember that great Christmas we all celebrated together in Rome, when Amy and the Anderson gang came over, and we celebrated Christmas Day all together ice skating and then dining in my small apartment? Well, the day you arrived from the airport we went out to eat at La Scala. I'm pretty sure your entree was scaloppine al limone that night.\n\nContorno \nInsalata di finocchi e rucola \u2013 You taught me to enjoy shaved fennel bulb and arugula salad. You'd order this side dish at the restaurant, or enjoy eating it at home when you lived in Italy while married to Mamma. The simple condiment, a thread of extra virgin olive oil, a pinch of sea salt and a few turns of the peppermill was all it needed. One side dish we would never dream of serving with lunch when you were in town was broccoli. In a later time of your life you actually did come around to eating broccoli, but as long as I can remember, you hated the stuff as much as you loved mangling its name, \"brrrahcklee!\"\n\n\nHow I loved your voice, Dad. It was deep and melodious. When I'd curl up on your chest as a little girl, scared or crying for some reason, you'd breathe out with a deep, vibrating hum. That sound was so soothing and calming. It was like Om , but better.\n\nBread \nFocaccia \u2013 I'm so bummed that the restaurant Cesarina is no longer what it used to be in the Seventies. You always said how amazing the food was: authentic dishes from Bologna (a sad lack of which we suffer in Rome), courteous service, a legendary Felliniesque host and the balloon focaccia.\n\n\nYou loved that flatbread! Maybe more for the show than the actual taste. The large rolled out dough was baked so that it would puff up into beach-ball size and then swiftly sliced horizontally to obtain two large discs. What I'd give to see you working your way through one of those again.\n\nDolce \nRicotta e caff\u00e8 \u2013 I don't know how you learned about this typical Roman dessert. It's not really a dessert, it's more of a snack for mid-afternoon merenda , but you loved to eat it at the end of the meal. You'd scoop a couple spoonfuls of fresh sheep's milk ricotta \u2013 a Rome specialty \u2013 and use a fork to mix it with powdered coffee and sugar. I have a image of you flattening out the resulting beige paste and leaving fork marks all over the surface, and then slowly lifting small bites of it. Sometimes there'd be bread involved too. Or cacao powder.\n\n\nOne thing you were on the other hand very swift at eating was gelato . You adored your Italian frozen delight, and in particular tartufo . Given the amount of tartufo you ingested during your time living in Italy made you a virtual shareholder at Tre Scalini. You ate gelato so quickly that you'd get terrible brain freeze and would moan in pain holding your temple with one hand while wolfing it all down with the other.\n\n\nVino \nYou were never a drinker. I remember you sometimes ordered non-alcoholic beer, but that fad didn't last very long. I don't think you ever drank liquor regularly. There's a story told in the family of when you went to ask my Grandfather for my mother's hand in a Paris restaurant. Waiting to approach the subject during the meal, table manners included sipping some wine. You were in France, what did you expect? When the waiter arrived carrying a 1955 bottle of Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion swaddled like an infant, you accepted a glass but before toasting poured half a pint of Evian in it to water it down. The waiter nearly fainted and I don't know how Nonno reacted. Mom may have kicked you under the table.\n\n\nI'll end this meal with a treat I know you loved. I made it myself and E. whipped the cream, so there's snow-white spatterings everywhere, including on the kitchen ceiling. We froze the espresso coffee in a shallow tray and scraped it several times to the desired texture. It's not summer, but in heaven there are no seasons, so enjoy. Don't rush it, though.\n\n\nThose interested in learning more about my Dad's amazing career, can read this beautiful obituary published on the Hollywood Reporter .\n\nBuon appetito, Dad\nyour Doodah\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nonno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santo stefano di sessanio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cesarina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "secondo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bologna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "navy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tre scalini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dolce  ricotta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "contorno  insalata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tazza d'oro", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bracciano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anguillara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rome", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la scala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:07.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4dbe1c4b84051150977723953b901e8e00b2070d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFezcExh04WcIkvbqDMRI0lqHXU3Bf6UDJgt.cXlKHQ8lrhuAnTTHT1.TJFsuyPu6I3a67__MFxxo7._2m9w5v0tuALFfkrAi_7kZoVihBTKKEJnn_YyjvWFt2pUHKeWVRcqyY88UEZe9WH.FKJoaoYy1UoF_7zEkgQRdORvN4MnTxJLOZLgQDXNg--", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/shop-storage/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Computer Storage with the Best Prices in Malaysia", "title": "Seagate Backup Plus Slim External Hard 2TB Rose Gold", "title_full": "Seagate Backup Plus Slim External Hard Drive 2TB Rose Gold | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2016-03-21T05:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 90, "participants_count": 77, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fab8f1897efd1dcea470b65675ce382e38f2a5f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFezcExh04WcIkvbqDMRI0lqHXU3Bf6UDJgt.cXlKHQ8lrhuAnTTHT1.TJFsuyPu6I3a67__MFxxo7._2m9w5v0tuALFfkrAi_7kZoVihBTKKEJnn_YyjvWFt2pUHKeWVRcqyY88UEZe9WH.FKJoaoYy1UoF_7zEkgQRdORvN4MnTzfaZDR5DcY_42iYBVOmJbb", "ord_in_thread": 90, "author": "Nora Zeera Wahhab", "published": "2017-12-06T03:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "Good", "text": "It\u2019s a good item", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:07.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4dbe1c4b84051150977723953b901e8e00b2070d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFezcExh04WcIkvbqDMRI0lqHXU3Bf6UDJgt.cXlKHQ8lrhuAnTTHT1.TJFsuyPu6I3a67__MFxxo7._2m9w5v0tuALFfkrAi_7kZoVihBTKKEJnn_YyjvWFt2pUHKeWVRcqyY88UEZe9WH.FKJoaoYy1UoF_7zEkgQRdORvN4MnTxJLOZLgQDXNg--", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/shop-storage/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Computer Storage with the Best Prices in Malaysia", "title": "Seagate Backup Plus Slim External Hard 2TB Rose Gold", "title_full": "Seagate Backup Plus Slim External Hard Drive 2TB Rose Gold | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2016-03-21T05:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 90, "participants_count": 77, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6bd2a82332c049b323a8e7dbe6b9f5ee12ff27e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFezcExh04WcIkvbqDMRI0lqHXU3Bf6UDJgt.cXlKHQ8lrhuAnTTHT1.TJFsuyPu6I3a67__MFxxo7._2m9w5v0tuALFfkrAi_7kZoVihBTKKEJnn_YyjvWFt2pUHKeWVRcqyY88UEZe9WH.FKJoaoYy1UoF_7zEkgQRdORvN4MnTy6xfaGUTYKbmh96aDHbykT", "ord_in_thread": 86, "author": "D.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of low-level ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) and ultrashort-pulse (USP) blue laser irradiation on osteoblasts.\nStudy Design/ Materials and Methods The MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cell line was used in this study. Following LLLI with a 405\u2009nm newly developed UHF-USP blue laser (80\u2009MHz, 100\u2009fs), osteoblast proliferation, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were assessed. In addition, mRNA levels of the osteoblast differentiation markers, runt-related transcription factor 2 ( Runx2 ), osterix ( Osx ), alkaline phosphatase ( Alp ), and osteopontin ( Opn ) was evaluated, and extracellular calcification was quantified. To clarify the involvement of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in LLLI-induced biostimulation, cells were treated prior to LLLI with capsazepine (CPZ), a selective inhibitor of TRP vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), and subsequent proliferation and ALP activity were measured.\nResults LLLI with the 405\u2009nm UHF-USP blue laser significantly enhanced cell proliferation and ALP activity, compared with the non-irradiated control and LLLI using continuous-wave mode, without significant temperature elevation. LLLI promoted osteoblast proliferation in a dose-dependent manner up to 9.4\u2009J/cm 2 and significantly accelerated cell proliferation in in vitro wound healing assay. ALP activity was significantly enhanced at doses up to 5.6\u2009J/cm 2 , and expression of Osx and Alp mRNAs was significantly increased compared to that of the control on days 3 and 7 following LLLI at 5.6\u2009J/cm 2 . The extent of extracellular calcification was also significantly higher as a result of LLLI 3 weeks after the treatment. Measurement of TRPV1 protein expression on 0, 3, and 7 days post-irradiation revealed no differences between the LLLI and control groups; however, promotion of cell proliferation and ALP activity by LLLI was significantly inhibited by CPZ.\nConclusion LLLI with a 405\u2009nm UHF-USP blue laser enhances extracellular calcification of osteoblasts by upregulating proliferation and differentiation via TRPV1.

Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) affecting both men and women globally. The gonorrhea bacteria infects cervix, uterus and urethra etc. mucous membranes, which are soft tissues and not covered by skin or outer layer. Changes in urination pattern, pain during sex, unusual discharges from male and female sex organs, bleeding, bumps, and sores, pain in the pelvic or abdominal region, and burning or itching in the vaginal area are some of the most common symptoms of gonorrhea. Long-term pelvic pain, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, proctitis, and prostate gland infection are major complications caused by gonorrhea. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), direct fluorescent tests, and several others tests are recommended by health care specialists to confirm the gonorrhea disease. According to WHO report, over 10 million people are diagnosed with gonorrhea globally each year. Generally, antibiotics and antibacterial medicines are used to treat gonorrhea. Report Overview and TOC @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/gonorrhea-drugs-market.html \nThe global gonorrhea drugs market is expanding significantly due to increasing gonorrhea prevalence. Rise in incidence of unprotected sex has led to an increase in the prevalence gonorrhea. Low voluntary screening rate for the disease is a major restrain of the market. Awareness about gonorrhea infection diagnostic tests is extremely low in countries in Africa. Hence, companies are facing challenges with regard to market penetration in the region. Moreover, several low- and middle-income countries depend on government grants for the provision of rapid diagnostic tests in the event of an epidemic. Therefore, direct reach to customers is weaker in these countries. These factors hamper the market in the region. Request for Broucher @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=34046 \nThe global gonorrhea drugs market can be segmented based on drug type, distribution channel, and region. In terms of drug type, the market can be categorized into sulfonamides, tetracycline, aminopenicillins, and macrolides. Macrolides are a class of antibiotics derived from Saccharopolyspora erythraea bacteria. Erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, and roxithromycin are the most recommended macrolides. In terms of revenue, the macrolides segment held a significant share of the gonorrhea drug market in 2016. Tetracycline is an antibiotic that fights infection caused by bacteria such as Neisseria gonorrheae and is the second major drug after macrolides. \nIn terms of distribution channel, the global gonorrhea drugs market can be classified into hospital pharmacies, retail pharmacies, and online pharmacies.
