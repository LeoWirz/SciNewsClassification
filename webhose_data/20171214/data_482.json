We present the first study addressing molecular effects of fractional non-sequential ultrapulsed CO 2 laser treatment using a 3D skin model that allows standardized investigations of time-dependent molecular changes ex vivo. While histological examination was performed to assess morphological changes, we utilized gene expression profiling using microarray and qRT-PCR analyses to identify molecular effects of laser treatment. Irradiated models exhibited dose-dependent morphological changes resulting in an almost complete recovery of the epidermis 5 days after irradiation. On day 5 after laser injury with a laser fluence of 100 mJ/cm 2 , gene array analysis identified an upregulation of genes associated with tissue remodeling and wound healing (e.g., COL12A1 and FGF7), genes that are involved in the immune response (e.g., CXCL12 and CCL8) as well as members of the heat shock protein family (e.g., HSPB3). On the other hand, we detected a downregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g., MMP3), differentiation markers (e.g., LOR and S100A7), and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1\u03b1.\nOverall, our findings substantiate the understanding of time-dependent molecular changes after CO 2 laser treatment. The utilized 3D skin model system proved to be a reliable, accurate, and reproducible tool to explore the effects of various laser settings both on skin morphology and gene expression during wound healing.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2AzlrSw", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "co", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:20.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c003fdb28c5f66189fa1f7067beb1780d451b1ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg90J5ryLRQGL1xdpYtB6y8tsJ2wPJiUVmiugmQZyh4bqILaUDcztsTTIpRbuhQuQsvRf7m9wIzGgCAxEtHXgwFzXq1HB.UtGz0-", "site_full": "www.topix.com", "site": "topix.com", "site_section": "http://www.topix.com/forum/city/kingsville-tx", "site_categories": ["entertainment"], "section_title": "Kingsville Forum \u00bb Topix", "title": "sueann garza", "title_full": "sueann garza - Discussion on Topix", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//static.topixcdn.com/ext/t9/topix-og-image-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1199, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a78e2d00d0739f266b56165a296e176d2fcd5962", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg90J5ryLRQGL1xdpYtB6y8tsJ2wPJiUVmiugmQZyh4bqILaUDcztsTTIpRbuhQuQsvRf7m9wIzGgCAxEtHXgwFzvGzKbUilcHnoSPWtgOiCMw--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "wuuuuuut", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "joseph was sleeping with her daughter????!!?!?!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:20.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fb7e92c21dec3d3149420c9de220c5935c7444c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRISb1AZdTREhGihql.sj7pudjPBfIkoMKQsI0npE45Xdo5DeekHZP1VPXnzruR5lrQ2JvXIhK0pQ--", "site_full": "boards.cruisecritic.com", "site": "cruisecritic.com", "site_section": "https://boards.cruisecritic.com/forumdisplay.php?f=11", "site_categories": ["travel", "cruises"], "section_title": "Cruise Discussion Topics - Cruise Critic Message Board Forums", "title": "St. Kitts, Antigua, St. Thomas, Grand Turk Suggestions", "title_full": "St. Kitts, Antigua, St. Thomas, Grand Turk Suggestions - Cruise Critic Message Board Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.r.cruisecritic.com/logos/CruiseCriticLogo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4904, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fb7e92c21dec3d3149420c9de220c5935c7444c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRISb1AZdTREhGihql.sj7pudjPBfIkoMKQsI0npE45Xdo5DeekHZP1VPXnzruR5lrQ2JvXIhK0pQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "LONG TIME, NO CRUISIN'", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "St. Kitts, Antigua, St. Thomas, Grand Turk Suggestions", "text": "St. Kitts, Antigua, St. Thomas, Grand Turk Suggestions\n Going on an 8 day cruise over Christmas and our stops are St. Kitts, Antigua, St. Thomas, and Grand Turk.\nWe are going with our 3 children and my mother in law.\nI have already booked a dolphin adventure on St. Kitts.\nWe definitely want to do a snorkel excursion and maybe a zipline excursion.

The latest to add to the list is their announcing Viswanathan Anand, the chess maestro, as their Brand Ambassador. The announcement came in at a time when there are an array of poker leagues( both online & offline) trying to establish their foothold in the country. Vishwanathan Anand , Brand Ambassador for Poker Sports League while announcing his association with the league said, \" In the last couple of years, we have been observing a paradigm shift in people's mindset for Poker as a sport. The zeal displayed by poker lovers has given rise to a lot of platforms which are not only encouraging the sport in India but also opening doors for youngsters who are keen to explore a career in the game. Like many other international universities, we also have Poker being taught as a course now in IIM (Kozhikode) to establish that it\u2019s a game that\u2019s played with skill\u201d He further added, \" My association with PSL is an attempt to establish the fact that Poker, like the game of chess, is indeed a game of skill, which involves a lot of strategy & a defined skill set. I have played chess all my life and when I was introduced to poker I could instantly draw the parallels, which made me connect better with the game.\" Mr. Amit Burman, Co Founder Poker Sports League mentioned, \" Chess and poker are frequently compared as both games are based on strategic thinking and decision making. A chess game is broken up into an opening phase, the middle game and the endgame, often with blurred lines between each phase. Depending on your overall strength as a player, each part has varying levels of importance as to what is best to improve next. Similarly the whole theory behind poker brings to light facts like, how to figure what the best plays would be in different sorts of situations. A lot of it involves reading the other players at the table. Bluffing is the other key aspect of the skill edge in poker.\" When asked about his views on this association, Pranav Bagai, Co founder PSL said, \"PSL's main objective is to establish poker as a mind sport in India. We approached five time world chess champion - Viswanthan Anand who is the biggest name in mind sports in the country. He plays poker and enjoys the game at an amateur level. We are super proud that Viswanthan Anand agreed to be our brand ambassador. It's the biggest move ever - towards changing the negative perception of poker in India.\" Unlike last season, this season opened with bids for 2 more teams last month, garnering a lot of attention in response to which, PSL has been able to add another team from South India (Andhra Bullets) & the bid for a team from east (Kolkata) is still open. PSL aims to sportify poker and test it on a team level. PSL will give a chance to Indian poker players to showcase their skills and get the ultimate shot at glory. The Poker Sports League is one unified poker league which offers Indian poker players, the chance to be a part of 12 teams who fight it out for ultimate glory in poker.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "viswanathan anand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pranav bagai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vishwanathan anand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amit burman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "viswanthan anand", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "poker sports league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "psl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andhra bullets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "co founder poker sports league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "co", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kozhikode", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kolkata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:21.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7e89d60135d5c8d3c80afee4bc18c27742b73fc2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMr7LUzpl3YeSmJfuTnyn13GsO9QfmP_LxYkIXGTcjltzczo.L22LmP7Oqoo1vcHye_Ipgkgp835L1moQd7b2wmi", "site_full": "texasfishingforum.com", "site": "texasfishingforum.com", "site_section": "http://texasfishingforum.com/forums/ubbthreads.php/ubb/postlist/Board/28/page/1", "site_categories": ["saltwater_fishing", "freshwater_fishing", "fly_fishing", "sports"], "section_title": "Off Topic | Texas Fishing Forum", "title": "calling Dafanman", "title_full": "calling Dafanman | Off Topic | Texas Fishing Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T12:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.147, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb56ada1690ebef38eae47af3b81c115e81cdfd6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMr7LUzpl3YeSmJfuTnyn13GsO9QfmP_LxYkIXGTcjltzczo.L22LmP7Oqoo1vcHye_Ipgkgp835Lw5dhQbVOuPoFZ6XzthwKdg-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "dafanman", "published": "2017-12-06T12:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Thank you very much", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:21.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3b5cb64f115bd67009934eb1f9fddba7c1677183", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW6NFzk0RR32Xts_ks8Zm04o1mNks11CaJwwGSZzbHpztaKs2sC5LfzazY0S8dtfX1r2vh5AawxpIQXxdLm31JX", "site_full": "news.chennaipatrika.com", "site": "chennaipatrika.com", "site_section": "http://news.chennaipatrika.com/syndication.axd?format=atom", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "International News, Local News, Press Release, Chennai Events - Chennaipatrika", "title": "Fukrey Returns", "title_full": "Fukrey Returns", "published": "2017-12-07T10:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3b5cb64f115bd67009934eb1f9fddba7c1677183", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW6NFzk0RR32Xts_ks8Zm04o1mNks11CaJwwGSZzbHpztaKs2sC5LfzazY0S8dtfX1r2vh5AawxpIQXxdLm31JX", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ednaren", "published": "2017-12-07T10:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "Fukrey Returns", "text": "Tweet \u201c Experience Fukrey Returns with animated stickers and live filters on Hike \u201d New Delhi : As Fukrey Returns gears up for its release, Hike has created a bunch of stickers and live filters customized for fans to enjoy the quirky essence of the movie.

The companies within the Thomas Cook India Group that were a part of the survey included SITA-Travel Corp (India) Ltd, Thomas Cook India and SOTC. In India, women who work full time are also responsible for managing household chores ranging from cleaning, cooking, taking care of their children, social and religious obligations, etc. Unfortunately the maturity to accept women as equals is often lacking in the country, with a rather traditional/patriarchal attitude exhibited. This social attitude tends to spill onto the workplace as well. Against this backdrop, it was important for Thomas Cook India to take a stand and empower its women workforce to get their fair share, be confident and feel safe in their work environment. The Company launched a unique initiative, Women of Will (WOW), as a platform for this dynamic workforce, enabling them to share their dreams, their challenges and support each other and the organization to achieve their professional and personal goals. Thomas Cook India aims at establishing a working environment that encourages all its employees to fully demonstrate their capabilities in the workplace and has incorporated various measures, policies and programmes that address issues such as organizational development, vital to motivate all employees to fully demonstrate their capabilities without regard to gender. Ms. Mona Cheriyan - President & Group Head, Human Resources, Thomas Cook (India) Ltd. , said, \u201cWe strive to give equal opportunities for growth to both women and men at the workplace. We are hence delighted with the honour of being counted among the Top 100 Best Companies for women in India. We have a fair number of women leaders and continue to mentor women in the workplace to take on more strategic roles. The leisure industry lends opportunities for women and we ensure that some roles where women have special skills and an eye for detail are staffed with female employees.\u201d Ms. Cheriyan reiterated, \u201cAs an organisation the Thomas Cook India Group aims to have an inclusive culture. We do not discriminate between genders. We are clear that the competencies of a person are not necessarily in line with the person\u2019s gender!\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas cook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mona cheriyan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cheriyan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india) ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas cook india group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sita-travel corp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sotc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tweet chennai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:21.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c003fdb28c5f66189fa1f7067beb1780d451b1ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg90J5ryLRQGL1xdpYtB6y8tsJ2wPJiUVmiugmQZyh4bqILaUDcztsTTIpRbuhQuQsvRf7m9wIzGgCAxEtHXgwFzXq1HB.UtGz0-", "site_full": "www.topix.com", "site": "topix.com", "site_section": "http://www.topix.com/forum/city/kingsville-tx", "site_categories": ["entertainment"], "section_title": "Kingsville Forum \u00bb Topix", "title": "sueann garza", "title_full": "sueann garza - Discussion on Topix", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//static.topixcdn.com/ext/t9/topix-og-image-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1199, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dd179485f7b999bd73cde1aa704cb3323df37a50", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg90J5ryLRQGL1xdpYtB6y8tsJ2wPJiUVmiugmQZyh4bqILaUDcztsTTIpRbuhQuQsvRf7m9wIzGgCAxEtHXgwFzvGzKbUilcHlIc90OU1fQ.w--", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Sue", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "How do you do?

There is a method called \"Directed Acyclic Graph\" (DAG for short), which has as different set of benefits and constraints. ByteBall uses it to good effect. I think (not sure) that IOTA uses it too. It looks like a VHS/Betamax thing though, where blockchain will probably prevail because it got the network effect of popularity, and a lot more people have heard of it, even if only a minority have a decent understanding of what's under the hood (which isn't necessary anyhow - you don't need to understand it, you just need to understand what it *is*).\nFor those curious, in simple terms it's a way to have an accounting ledger that is public and takes care of a problem known as \"double spending\", where people think of digital information as easily copy-able. In the use case of money, copying is a no no, as you could have 100 baht and keep re-spending it wherever you go, and nobody would know which is the original one and who owns it. Blockchain is a way to ensure the integrity of transactions without a central authority having to be trusted not to print more than they say, and ownership changes are recorded not by some super high tech black box software (it's wide open for any curious minds to inspect or improve). It does it by making it trustless - that is, all participants can check and verify all of everything if they want to (that's why there's a lot of processing power involved). You get the game theory known as \"Prisoners Dilemma\", which to use a metaphor \"it's only when a mosquito lands on your own junk that you realise that violence isn't always the best solution\" - translates to - stealing money at the risk of making all your own money valueless makes a risk model that ensures all participants have an interest in being a 'good actor'.\nI'm as certain as anyone can be that it isn't going away. Being software however it can evolve it's standards and behaviours, so it's highly likely that what we know of today will be barely recognisable in a decade or two. As government fiat is soaked up by open source coins/tokens, the way we do things will change, as will the power base. If you take the exponential rise of crypto as a chart and invert it, you could say that is the USD (or any other gov't fiat) being shown in its true colours. The Bolivar or Zimbabwe dollar are just advanced cases, but all of them go that way eventually.\nI don't see things like Bitcoin being a good currency any time soon whatever the merits of the tech, or at least not until all the fiat that is prepared to move has already done so, and people are prepared to spend without thinking that it would be better to wait another day as it will be more value tomorrow. At the same time that makes it an excellent asset as a store of wealth. It can do what gold can do for the most part, except it's programmable, portable, invisible etc. Ironically, people who like physical gold should find a friend in Bitcoin, as it has the potential to crush the paper gold manipulation and let physical gold rise to its true market value, which surely must be at least several orders of magnitude more than the markets are pretending.\n<6 months ago I knew in person only 3 people that had any crypto, despite 6.5 years of evangalising. Now in December 2017 I don't do that, they find me, and I'm trying to get people up to speed so that they can take on some of the load of helping their friends instead of taking all of my time.

What if a newer, better technology comes up? ...\nTo use USD as an example, the quantity has increased 4x in a decade. If they didn't do that then it wouldn't lose value. They do though, and they have to in order to maintain power. We're told inflation targets are say 2%, yet we all know that the cost of consumables is not far off 100% per decade, and nobody is making a fuss. Frustrating doesn't begin to describe it.\nIf you pick a crypto, then choosing one that has a finite quantity would be a pre-requisite, otherwise the same dilution would occur. Maybe as a currency it's good to have as much as is required for fungibility, but nobody should be storing their wealth in fiat. A petty cash float with an ATM card is all that is required if your main store is something liquid (a rare piece of art wouldn't be something you could chip a piece off and turn into baht, though people have their reasons for wanting it, and presumably have several layers of storage and liquidity).\nAs for a better tech than blockchain comes up then we can all move with the times. Probably best not to get married to one technology.

A waiter serves pizza Margherita at L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele in Naples, Italy December 6, 2017.

Italy had argued the practice of pizzaiuolo - from preparing and flipping the pizza dough to baking it in a wood-fired oven - was part of the country\u2019s cultural and gastronomic tradition. Traditional Neapolitan pizza has a relatively thin crust with the exception of the rim, which, when baked, bloats like a tiny bicycle tyre. Staff members of L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele pose with pizza in Naples, Italy December 6, 2017. REUTERS/Ciro De Luca It is rigorously made in a wood-burning brick oven and has two classic versions: Marinara (tomato, garlic, oregano and oil) and, the most famous, Margherita (tomato, mozzarella, oil and basil). Slideshow (8 Images) Tradition holds the Margherita pizza was created in 1889 by a local chef in honour of Queen Margherita, who was visiting the city. It has the red, white and green colours of the Italian flag. UNESCO also accepted Chogan, an Iranian horse-riding game accompanied by music and storytelling, and the craft of millers operating windmills and watermills in the Netherlands. Traditional boat making on the Indonesian island of South Sulawesi, and Nsima, a maize-based culinary tradition from the African country of Malawi, also joined the list. Food culture already on the UNESCO list includes Turkish coffee culture and tradition, the gingerbread craft of northern Croatia and the traditional ancient Georgian method of Qvevri wine-making.

But most people who know say it\u2019s mostly China. \nDennis Richardson, for example, when he retired as Secretary of Defence, said the Chinese Government was not just watching, but controlling parts of the Chinese community in Australia. \nThe Federal Government has moved to stave off foreign interference with new laws; at the same time as Labor Senator Sam Dastyari is once again in trouble for seemingly pandering to China by warning a Chinese businessman that his phone might be bugged by the Australian authorities. media_camera Former defence secretary Dennis Richardson. \nAustralia needs China; this week the State Government announced megastar Huang Xiaoming as an ambassador for the state, to bring in more tourism dollars. \nAnd Chinese students are worth about a billion dollars a year to the state. \nWhich brings us to the Confucius Institutes. There are about a dozen of them in Australia, and now there are also Confucius Classrooms in high schools. \nAround the world there have been accusations that the centres are a foot in the door for propaganda from the Chinese Communist Party. They are partly funded directly from Beijing, ostensibly for cultural understanding. But others say they are there to spread propaganda, and to remind Chinese abroad that Big Brother is watching. \nThe Australian Parliament has been warned that they exist to manipulate how China is seen, that they exercise surveillance and control over students \u2014 students who have travelled to a free, democratic country to learn. \nRecently the head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Frances Adamson, spoke at the University of Adelaide\u2019s Confucius Institute encouraging students to engage with life in Australia, and warned of \u201cuntoward\u201d interference. She is rightly concerned about the students\u2019 welfare. \nThe National Association of Scholars in the United States has called for the centres to all be shut down. media_camera Labor Senator Sam Dastyari. \nOne source told The Advertiser that universities recognise the problems, but are \u201cs. t scared\u201d of doing anything that might threaten the lucrative flow of students from China. \nThe University of Adelaide says its institute is the third oldest in Australia and \u201cfocuses on the enhancement of intercultural understanding through the promotion of Chinese language and cultural awareness in the wider community\u201d. They get almost a quarter of a million dollars a year from Hanban. Hanban is an agency of China\u2019s Communist Party. \nChongyi Feng is an Associate Professor in China Studies at the University of Technology, Sydney. He has been a fearless commentator on China, and a critic of Beijing\u2019s growing influence in Australia. Earlier this year, on a visit home, he was detained and questioned. \nProf Feng won\u2019t be silenced so easily. The Advertiser asked him what he thought of Confucius Institutes and he said \u201cgreed\u201d prompted universities to accept the money from Beijing, and in return, they \u201chand over political censorship\u201d. \nThe Advertiser also spoke to James Leibold, an Asian Studies expert and Associate Professor in politics at La Trobe University. To him, the important thing was transparency. He said each institute should be looked at on a case-by-case basis, and that the money was \u201ccoming with strings attached\u201d. \nEven if China is not always interfering directly, there is the danger of the \u201cchilling effect\u201d that knowledge of their power can have throughout universities. Dastyari questions 'covered Chinese concerns' 1:32 \nLabor's Sam Dastyari reportedly asked top officials 115 questions representing China's concerns. December 7th 2017 /display/newscorpaustralia.com/Web/NewsNetwork/Network News/National/ Dastyari questions 'covered Chinese concerns' \nClive Hamilton, a Professor and the holder of the vice-chancellor\u2019s chair in public ethics at Charles Sturt University, has found this out first-hand. \nThe publishing of his book Silent Invasion \u2014 an examination of Beijing\u2019s influence in Australia \u2014 was delayed by publisher Allen & Unwin because they feared legal retaliation from China. \nThe Advertiser revealed that one of the flow-on effects of A&U\u2019s decision was that Prof Hamilton will not appear at Adelaide Writers\u2019 Week, a critical part of the Adelaide Festival. \nIt is rare and newsworthy when the Chinese government is seen to influence Australians. What we don\u2019t know is to what extent they control their citizens in Australia, here in a free country. Our universities, particularly, should be a safe space for all students to discuss and research any topic without fear of surveillance or intimidation. \nAs Confucius once said: \u201cAn oppressive government is more to be feared than a tiger\u201d.

We present the first study addressing molecular effects of fractional non-sequential ultrapulsed CO 2 laser treatment using a 3D skin model that allows standardized investigations of time-dependent molecular changes ex vivo. While histological examination was performed to assess morphological changes, we utilized gene expression profiling using microarray and qRT-PCR analyses to identify molecular effects of laser treatment. Irradiated models exhibited dose-dependent morphological changes resulting in an almost complete recovery of the epidermis 5 days after irradiation. On day 5 after laser injury with a laser fluence of 100 mJ/cm 2 , gene array analysis identified an upregulation of genes associated with tissue remodeling and wound healing (e.g., COL12A1 and FGF7), genes that are involved in the immune response (e.g., CXCL12 and CCL8) as well as members of the heat shock protein family (e.g., HSPB3). On the other hand, we detected a downregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g., MMP3), differentiation markers (e.g., LOR and S100A7), and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1\u03b1.\nOverall, our findings substantiate the understanding of time-dependent molecular changes after CO 2 laser treatment. The utilized 3D skin model system proved to be a reliable, accurate, and reproducible tool to explore the effects of various laser settings both on skin morphology and gene expression during wound healing.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2AzlrSw", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "co", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:24.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "40e348de3d6af47eb43d0ac9dbc40016cd66b70f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg86l2XgusbaA0P5u0YQycu_b9mZth4_6PxvcBnXt7tTPK3hq9GIFEzy", "site_full": "www.careersportal.ie", "site": "careersportal.ie", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["jobs", "career_planning"], "section_title": "", "title": "Open Day at The Lir Academy - The Lir National Academy of Dramatic Art at Trinity College Dublin", "title_full": "Open Day at The Lir Academy - The Lir National Academy of Dramatic Art at Trinity College Dublin", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.937, "main_image": "http://www.careersportal.ie/images/clients/courseproviders/135.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "40e348de3d6af47eb43d0ac9dbc40016cd66b70f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg86l2XgusbaA0P5u0YQycu_b9mZth4_6PxvcBnXt7tTPK3hq9GIFEzy", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Open Day at The Lir Academy - The Lir National Academy of Dramatic Art at Trinity College Dublin", "text": "Upcoming Events Saturday, December 09, 2017 Open Day 1:30 AM to 3:30 AM <p>This year Open Day will be held on Saturday 9th December 2017.</p><p><strong><img src=\"https://careersportal.ie/mce/plugins/filemanager/files/Claire/openday.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" /></strong></p><p>There will be two presentations</p><p><strong>Bachelor in Stage Management and Technical Theatre - 1.30pm</strong></p><p>As well as a detailed presentation on all that this three year practical course has to offer, there will also be an opportunity to tour the various facilities eg the wood and metal workshop, scenic art workshop, the costume and wardrobe room, design studio, theatres and various rehearsal spaces as well as time to speak with students who are currently studying stage management and technical theatre at The Lir Academy.</p><p><strong>Bachelor in Acting and Foundation Diploma in Acting and Theatre - 3.00pm</strong><br />As well as a presentation covering all aspects of these courses, there will be an opportunity to tour the facilities including rehearsal spaces, the dance/movement studio, theatres, design studio, costume room, green room, dressing rooms etc.Students will also have the opportunity to talk with current students in first and second year of their studies.</p><p>NO BOOKING NECESSARY<br />ALL STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS WELCOME</p><p> ;</p> Thursday, February 01, 2018 LIR Closing Date for Application for UG Programmes 5:00 PM to 5:00 PM Anyone wishing to apply for entry onto the undergraduate courses at The Lir in September 2018 needs to have their applications submitted by 5pm on Monday 1st February.

The smart-sync function guarantees that no matter what deck is playing (A, B, C or D), when you press the Sync button the other decks will be in perfect sync with it.\nFor musically perfect mixes you can lock (master tempo) or change the key to your desired one to achieve not only beat-matched but also key-matched performances. The app even detects the key of a song/video to considerably simplify harmonic mixing.\nThe waveform graphic display gives you real time audio signal monitoring, information about the audio signal and the beat rhythm. It can be configured to display more or less of the song, using the zoom in and zoom out buttons. Each deck has 3 waveforms: a full waveform, a horizontal zoomable waveform and a vertical waveform. The vertical waveforms are all located above the mixer, next to one another so that you can visually align the beats of all 4 tracks.\nThe playlist has evolved into a practical instrument of quickly finding and loading the tracks you want.
