With a new 4K tv being able to access UHD is suddenly more of a priority for me but at what price!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:25.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b2ae83adbd21afb2cedf482755cb13c14ce041a1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsK2I0a_pMmQvyyF7aWcvZJ25zu77OIO5CpjUfk8QmPNQ8", "site_full": "community.servicenow.com", "site": "servicenow.com", "site_section": "https://community.servicenow.com/community/feeds/allcontent?community=1&showProjectContent=false&recursive=true&tagSet=-1&visibleTypes=109016030%7C1%7C18%7C3%7C100509913%7C38%7C102%7C3227383%7C96891546%7C1100%7C-960826044&showPopular=false&showAnswered=false&showUnanswered=false&showUnreplied=false", "site_categories": ["business_software", "business"], "section_title": "ServiceNow Community : All Content - All Communities", "title": "Mandatory list collector field value (from Catalog Item) is missing in RITM and Task for ITIL users under Variables section (Admin is able to see though)", "title_full": "Mandatory list collector field value (from Catalog Item) is missing in RITM and Task for ITIL users under Variables section (Admin is able to see though)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 22428, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b2ae83adbd21afb2cedf482755cb13c14ce041a1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsK2I0a_pMmQvyyF7aWcvZJ25zu77OIO5CpjUfk8QmPNQ8", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Akash Kodiganti", "published": "2017-12-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "Mandatory list collector field value (from Catalog Item) is missing in RITM and Task for ITIL users under Variables section (Admin is able to see though)", "text": "What could be the reason for this.

Figure 3. \nSTEP 2: ListPicker for connecting Lego EV3 \nWe use a ListPicker to show paired devices with your Android device and connect to it by selecting in the Listpicker. This is a better approach and less chance of type error for user to input EV3\u2019s Bluetooth address in a TextBox. \nBefore we click the Listpicker, we must set its elements first (ListPicker1.BeforePicking event). Here we have to set its element to paired devices (BluetoothClient1.AddressAndNames). Figure 4a. Initialize and what\u2019s inside the ListPicker \nClick to open the ListPicker, we are going to connect (BluetoothClient1.Connect) our paired EV3 by selecting it (ListPicker1.AfterPicking). If connect successfully, Listpicker will be disabled, and Ball1 will show up at the center of Canvas, means user can touch the canvas to drive the robot. Figure 4b. Select an item to connect to Lego EV3 \nSTEP 3: Drag finger to move the robot \nThis is the largest code of this project, including three parts: move origin of coordinated to the center of canvas and calculate theta and r move the ball component and calculate speedL/speedR drive motor \nLet\u2019s discuss them in detail: move origin of coordinated to the center of canvas and calculate theta and r \nFirst take a look of the relationship of these variables. We would like to transfer the current touch point coordinate to motors\u2019 speed. According the figure below: Figure 5a. \nThe origin of canvas is at the top-left corner not the center, so we have to shift the origin: representing by _X and _Y: _X = (currentX - 160 ) /1.6 _Y = (currentX - 160 ) /1.6 \nAnd for theta and r, we will use trigonometric function to calculate the angle theta.

No single method of reduction works universally. Reduction still must be addressed on a case-by-case or category-by-category basis. \n\u201cIt is unlikely that it will be possible to reduce the acrylamide content in many foods without changes in the food (colour, flavour, texture) and consumer acceptability. Food safety concerns must also be considered, as also any potentially involving diet-nutrition-health consequences.\" \nThe new statement can be read in full here along with the IFST\u2019s six other chapters on acrylamide. \nThe Food Standards Agency (FSA) and British Hospitality Association (BHA) are working on guidance to help the catering and foodservice sectors comply with the new laws.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "institute of food science & technolog", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institute of food science & technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "food standards agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "british hospitality association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ifst", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:25.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "30a15fef59bc7a306d49998ab1caeac3a4b20287", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9s7BCK1Px0NkxubFHbtUAq.K1KYPNF.WIuRy6BoaqBdofXTTkdErEqcVlNSmWGeadqggSOMmVDYBtHconk2Cd3ozskRCkr1SsfeAogdX4RcnS5k_lmJ8eaVR8L_u7Tzv9ER5nqo_ssg--", "site_full": "www.acne.org", "site": "acne.org", "site_section": "https://www.acne.org/messageboard/forum/70-general-acne-discussion/", "site_categories": ["dermatology", "health"], "section_title": "General acne discussion - Acne.org Community", "title": "please help me. acne and health struggle.. what\u2019s going on?", "title_full": "please help me. acne and health struggle.. what\u2019s going on? - General acne discussion - Acne.org Community", "published": "2017-11-23T13:23:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.019, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31242, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3bebc3d530705ab8824fdfb55023c67344b0d947", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9s7BCK1Px0NkxubFHbtUAq.K1KYPNF.WIuRy6BoaqBdofXTTkdErEqcVlNSmWGeadqggSOMmVDYBtHconk2Cd3ozskRCkr1SsfeAogdX4RcnS5k_lmJ8eaVR8L_u7TzvH7ZCruuIZiJdhUAdUaCOOnXLU3bGrkfw-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Fcntcsy", "published": "2017-12-07T07:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I'm not a doctor, but based on a lot of personal research, your symptoms could indicate low estrogen.

(AP) - Southern California has felt yellow wind, orange wind, and red wind. But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

People on Medicaid are prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But a new survey says that\u2019... \nBy RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVARAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - People on Medicaid are more prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But that's not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge. \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" \nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n- Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n- Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n- Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C. \nFor the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point. For Medicaid recipients, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points.

The new cover, accessible exclusively through online perk platform Perkbox, means Deliveroo riders can claim 75% of their average weekly income for up to 26 weeks if they are unable to work due to illness or as a result of an injury while working. \nParticularly important for riders covering territories where protection from motor traffic is poor, the cover will give Deliveroo riders up to \u00a32 million in public liability insurance, a product previously unavailable to those working on a bicycle. \nThe policy is wide ranging, with other measures including: \u25cf Up to \u00a32,500 in annual medical expenses cover \u25cf \u00a31,500 annual cover for an overnight hospital stays, and up to \u00a3750 for family members to accompany them during their stay \u25cf Up to \u00a32,000 for dental repair \u25cf 20 days of jury service cover up to a total of \u00a3700 \u25cf Up to \u00a3200 phone cover if damaged during an injury causing accident \nThe availability of the new Bikmo product through Perkbox comes following Deliveroo\u2019s recent submission to the Government\u2019s Taylor Review, in which the company outlined its commitment to end the trade-off between flexible working and security. \nCommenting, Deliveroo Managing Director UK&IE, Dan Warne said: \u201cThis is the first income protection insurance for on-demand food delivery riders in the UK. This new industry-leading insurance package is hugely important for all those who ride with Deliveroo. We know the thing our riders value the most is flexibility to fit their work around their lives, rather than their lives to work. But they also deserve security while they\u2019re out on the road. This new insurance gives riders security in the event of an injury while maintaining the flexible work they value. \n\u201cWe would like to go further, in offering the security we offer riders, but we are currently constrained by the law. As we outlined to the Government\u2019s Taylor Review, we\u2019re committed to providing the flexible work that riders want, alongside the security we believe they deserve. Giving riders access to these products is just one way that we are working to do this but we also want to see the law updated so on demand companies can offer both flexibility and security. We are grateful for Perkbox\u2019s collaboration in making this happen, and look forward to continuing to work together in the future.\u201d \nDavid George, CEO at Bikmo, added: \u201cWhether our customers ride to live, or live to ride, our role is simply to give people support and assurance we have got their backs so they can get out there and get the most out of work and play. As the fastest growing cycle insurer, we\u2019re stoked to be supporting riders on their mission with the fastest growing on-demand food provider.\u201d \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bikmo mark sutton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david george", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bikmo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deliveroo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perkbox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan warne", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "government\u2019s taylor review", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taylor review", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bikmo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:26.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5c1acef9a42275ce8cd0de1cb3b45576a6193552", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Udd0feKJ5GGQ5RIg3Ch2nfC4hVgOUmUyoUFHergCdr5_HKRn8g25R_s2skq9aCw3Gktsov3zUo79iNEEVsR33VE", "site_full": "dorysbackyard.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://dorysbackyard.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Da DB Boyz", "title": "Heeee's Baaaa !!!", "title_full": "Heeee's Baaaa !!!", "published": "2017-12-07T08:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8a5d9471fae532bdc50e6d45a689b189ecc86b30", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Udd0feKJ5GGQ5RIg3Ch2nfC4hVgOUmUyoUFHergCdr5_HKRn8g25R_s2skq9aCw3Gktsov3zUo79twk8TJCNAaE..Yi0pp0sV0-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "Yamini MacLean", "published": "2017-12-07T11:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hari OM\nThat elf is a creator of mischief... what does that make all of you???

To that end, President Obama retreated from many of America\u2019s commitments in the region, allowing the Iranians to widely expand the reach of their influence\u2014from backing the Houthi rebels who had just assassinated Yemen\u2019s President Saleh to bankrolling Hezbollah\u2019s murderous brigades in Lebanon. Israel, of course, was one of this shift\u2019s biggest losers, with a number of its mortal enemies empowered by America\u2019s exit and Iran\u2019s money. And Russia was arguably its biggest winner, gaining the foothold in the region America had fought bitterly for six decades to deny it.\nJudging by the president\u2019s first year in office, Trump, sadly, seems committed to following in his predecessor\u2019s footsteps, with many of the same facilitators in place. Instead of his statement the other day, he could\u2019ve simply refused to sign the waiver that delays the embassy\u2019s mandated move to Jerusalem, in accordance with the 1995 law. He didn\u2019t do that. Nor did he gut Obama\u2019s disastrous Iran deal, another one of his campaign\u2019s promises.\nInstead, he leaves untouched a Middle East in which Teheran continues its march towards regional hegemony, gleefully threatening to wipe Israel off the map, failing to prevent Iran from establishing bases inside Syria and completing its takeover of Lebanon while shamefully continuing to fund the Lebanese army, which Iran and its proxies now control. He has also failed to take any significant action to protect the Kurds or to provide Israel with anything more substantial than loud proclamations.\nIsrael understands this grim reality clearly, which is why it reportedly attacked an Iranian base inside Syria last week. No matter its official statements, Jerusalem knows that it\u2019s now alone in defending itself against a growing roster of threats and that it can\u2019t count on any real help from Donald Trump any more than it could count on Barack Obama.\nAmerican Jews would do well to adopt a similar approach and refuse to be played for suckers by yet another president\u2014this one seeking to underline his pro-Israel bona fides from the right, just as Obama sought to underline his bona fides from the left. Those among us who promised that Obama felt his support for Israel \u201c in his kishkes \u201d and would never use a nuclear deal as a device for turning over the keys to the region to Iran faced no shortage of evidence that their beliefs were wishful thinking. And those among us who entertain similar fantasies about Donald Trump\u2019s love for the State of Israel and deep concern for the people of the Middle East have just received yet another wake-up call.\n***\nLike this article?

Despite the quite high potential to become a law-breaker that way (violations of OS-licenses did end up in court a few times already) -\nthe \"general rule\" I thought was, that those with next to no knowledge about a topic should adapt to (or aspire to become like)\nthose who know significantly more about the thing in question (not the other way round).\nBeside that, it's simple ethics, morals ... down to simply acknowledgment (of somebody),\nor even \"simply not being ignorant about things\", which play into that topic.\n@Elroy\nE.g. when you write, that \"all the software at your customers end\" is licensed by you under GPL-V3,\nand you made use of a module from a different developer, who released that code under e.g. BSD,\nthen you already \"break the law\" (or a least \"the rules\") - because not all OS-licenses are compatible with each other -\nor may not simply be \"re-licensed\" by yourself (in most cases only the author may do that).\nI don't really get, why a simple:\n\"understood, I will try my best and read about it\"...\nis so very hard to do (it may take a day or two, but then one has at least a basic understanding)\nWhat I'd expect (willing to answer and discuss - same goes for Tanner I'm sure) - would be\na few follow-up-questions about certain things which were not understood (by googling that topic).\nThough such a healthy discussion so far never happened.\nInstead comments like Eduardos seem to be the norm\n(coming across then, as kind of \"seeking reassurance in the like-minded, anonymous masses\").\nIt's not really \"uplifting\" to comment and \"speak up\" when such stuff comes up, because one will risk,\nto be immediately painted into the \"elitist\"-corner, just for telling some things as they really are.\n\"Ain't nobody interested in truthfulness anymore\"?

Now you are being judgemental and quite rude (not trying at all, \"to respect their decision\").\nOk, let's make a simple test now - and see how you react:\nIf you'd care to read about (and understand) the goals (I've posted them here often enough) -\nwhat I want to accomplish with the RIchClient in the end, you'd know that it is a lot of work\nthat still remains (to finally come up with a compatible IDE and compiler and new classbased Runtime).\nIf you now say:\n\"Ok, I find the goals worthwhile and am willing to contribute over at least one year,\nabout one hour per day on average, to help you reach that goal for the benfit of all\"...\nthen I will in turn:\nImmediately send you the current sources of the RichClient (since there's no reason\nnot to trust you, is there? - and the sources will be helpful in your \"daily contribution to the over-all project\").\nBTW, a few developers here already have the sources (because they help, or were helpful in the past).\nSo, is the above offer vanity on my part?\nI'd say not - and am quite sure that on the other hand, you will now weasel out of\nthe whole thing, because you have no intent at all to really contribute to something,\nwhich would bring the VB-community forward.\nOlaf", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:26.046+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3d5c1d24b35db80edb33e8216ed3a2b143c73e52", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.mAvHLv3FY8nKaasVeVAXWmUEr0LcdUplxeBLcR5nozJF2Oer4HatbNt0xzYuS5EdPlOZ9N6e6C3NMe4._z.F3", "site_full": "www.santacruzsentinel.com", "site": "santacruzsentinel.com", "site_section": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/section?template=RSS&profile=4004663&mime=xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "RSS Feed from Santa Cruz Sentinel: http://www.santacruzsentinel.com", "title": "62nd Dads Club Tournament: Sending in the 'red coats'", "title_full": "62nd Dads Club Tournament: Sending in the 'red coats'", "published": "2017-12-07T08:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NE/20171206/SPORTS/171209791/AR/0/AR-171209791.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 61826, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3d5c1d24b35db80edb33e8216ed3a2b143c73e52", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.mAvHLv3FY8nKaasVeVAXWmUEr0LcdUplxeBLcR5nozJF2Oer4HatbNt0xzYuS5EdPlOZ9N6e6C3NMe4._z.F3", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Julie Jag", "published": "2017-12-07T08:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "62nd Dads Club Tournament: Sending in the 'red coats'", "text": "Boys Basketball 62nd Dads Club Tournament: Sending in the \u2018red coats\u2019 Bobbie Wilson goes up for a hook shot while playing for the Santa Cruz High lightweight team in the early 1950s.

Inside, just as with any upscale production at the theatre, they will be met by well-dressed ushers who can answer questions of all ilks, ranging from the location of the bathroom to the time of the next show. \nOnly, in this case, the show is a drama played out in real life by high school boys basketball teams from San Jose to Salinas. \nFor decades, the Emmett Thompson Memorial Dads Club Tournament has been played at the Civic, its old hardwood floor serving as center stage for the fans peering down from a steeply pitched horseshoe of seats. For nearly as long, fans have been guided into those seats and around the auditorium by the crimson-blazer-adorned ushers known as \u201cred coats.\u201d That is, until this weekend\u2019s tournament, when that fleet of soldier-like volunteers will be rechristened \u201cBobbie\u2019s Bunch.\u201d \nThis will be the first Dads Club Tournament without Bobbie Wilson, who for more than 40 years served as the general of the \u201cred coats.\u201d Wilson, a 1954 graduate of Santa Cruz High, the tournament\u2019s host, died April 9 at age 80. \n\u201cThat was why Dads Club always had special aura around it, because Bobbie always brought in a great group of characters and special guys to handle it,\u201d said Geoffrey Dunn, a Santa Cruz historian who served as a \u201cred coat\u201d for several years. \u201cWhat always made it special for me, even if I wasn\u2019t doing it, was there would always be this special group there doing it.\u201d \nThe men and women wearing the red blazers are community members who agree to dedicate a Thursday, Friday or Saturday night to the tournament in exchange for free entry and access to the event\u2019s vaunted hospitality suite, which features homemade baked goods, sandwich fixings and chili provided mostly by team parents and sponsors. During Wilson\u2019s tenure, though, they were anything but a ragtag group of freeloaders. A former Army man who played on the Mules\u2019 softball team in tournaments around the country, Wilson ran the \u201cred coats\u201d with precision and discipline. He told, not asked, volunteers about their assignments and kept detailed notes of their schedules and whereabouts during the tournament. \n\u201cHe just was always there. The constant force. The presence. The rock,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cHe was a fun guy, but he took that job very seriously. I think all the \u2018red jackets\u2019 did too because of it. He made sure things got done. You made sure your door was watched and no one went through that wasn\u2019t supposed to.\u201d \nWilson never got to play in the 62-year-old Dads Club Tournament. He excelled in the sport, playing for the Cardinals\u2019 lightweight team and was named captain the all-Central Coast Athletic League \u2014 which reached all the way down to King City. His son, John Wilson \u2014 a now coach of the Cabrillo College women\u2019s team \u2014 and a grandson did play in the tournament, though. In fact, Wilson first became involved during John\u2019s senior year at Santa Cruz in 1982. Advertisement \nJohn Wilson said he remembers his father would store the red blazers at his home and dust them off every December for the tournament. \n\u201cHe wanted them to feel that they were doing a job, and putting on a jacket showed the people coming to the tournament that they were official,\u201d John Wilson said. \nThe \u201cred coats\u201d will be Wilson\u2019s lasting legacy, but Santa Cruz boys basketball coach Lawan Milhouse said his institutional knowledge of the tournament carried even more weight. When Milhouse took over the Cardinals, and thus the organizing of the Dads Club Tournament, in 2014, he said Wilson was invaluable. \n\u201cBesides (the) parents, the \u2018red coats\u2019 are pretty much the backbone of the tournament,\u201d Milhouse said. \u201cHe\u2019s been doing it for so long. That\u2019s one thing I didn\u2019t have to worry about because he knew everything. He knew more about the tournament, the ins and outs, than I did. My first year, he helped me out a lot just because he knew everything and had been around so long that he\u2019d dealt with so much. He was a great resource to have. \n\u201cHe was a great guy, really great to be around. It\u2019s really unfortunate that he\u2019s not physically here with us but we know he will be in spirit.\u201d \nThe tournament tips off Thursday afternoon with a game between Watsonville and Harbor at 3:30 p.m. That will be followed with Scotts Valley vs. Salinas at 5 p.m. and Soquel vs. Pioneer at 6:30 p.m. Milhouse\u2019s Cardinals, winners of two straight titles, will take on San Lorenzo Valley at 8 p.m. In their second-round game Friday, they could find themselves up against a Pioneer squad that they barely edged, 61-59, for the 2016 title. \nThe championship is schedule for 6 p.m. Saturday.

By Matthew Marczi December 7, 2017 at 05:00 am \nThe journey toward the Super Bowl is now well under way with the Pittsburgh Steelers back practicing at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex, still informally referred to as the \u2018South Side\u2019 facility. With the regular season standing in their way on the path to a Lombardi, there will be questions for them to answer along the way. \nWe have asked and answered a lot of questions during the preseason and through training camp, but much of the answer-seeking ends in the regular season, and teams simply have to make do with what they have available to them. Still, there will always be questions for us. \nYou can rest assured that we have the questions, and we will be monitoring the developments in the regular season and beyond as they develop, looking for the answers as we evaluate the makeup of the Steelers on their way back to the Super Bowl, after reaching the AFC Championship game last season for the first time in more than half a decade. \nQuestion: What role will rookie cornerback Cameron Sutton serve during Sunday\u2019s game against the Ravens? \nMany were surprised on Sunday night when the Steelers opened the second half of their game with the Bengals lining up rookie cornerback Cameron Sutton at left outside cornerback. Having only been activated prior to the game before, it was the first snaps of the third-round pick\u2019s career, in any capacity. \nThe reason that he was playing at all, of course, was because of the struggles of veteran journeyman Coty Sensabaugh , who was beaten for two touchdowns in the first half of the Bengals game, and a couple more touchdowns in the few games leading up to it. \nAnd he was only playing because of the fibula injury suffered by starter Joe Haden , who remains out for I would guess at a minimum one more week, and quite possibly longer, meaning that there are still snaps yet to be fulfilled, and as I wrote about yesterday, I don\u2019t see a compelling reason for Sensabaugh to be the one taking those snaps. \nBut he would not necessarily have to start to contribute. Given the injuries at inside linebacker, we could see an increase in usage of the dime defense, which could help him earn a couple of snaps. and there are multiple roles on special teams that he can play. \nWhile he did say that he took some reps in practice as a punt returner, he also said that it had been no more than usual since he was brought back, so I would not exactly bank on him taking over that role from either Antonio Brown or Eli Rogers , unless, for example, Rogers muffs another kick. \nHe can be used as a gunner, however, or a jammer, or on kick coverage. There is an opening on the kick coverage unit in Tyler Matakevich \u2019s absence. J.J. Wilcox did himself no favors in the last game with two special teams penalties. Just thinking aloud here, but there are logical places for him to play.

This year\u2019s decline in volume, load factor and increased yield reflect a normalization of the traffic volumes. \u2022 Scheduled traffic (RPK) decreased 6.1% and the capacity (ASK) was up 0.9%. \u2022 The load factor decreased by 5.1 p.u. versus last year to 68.6%. \u2022 Scheduled number of passengers amounted to 2.3 million in November. \u2022 The preliminary currency adjusted yield and PASK increased 9% and 1% respectively in November 2017 vs. last year. The nominal yield increased 6% and the PASK decreased 2% in November 2017 vs. last year. \nMarket development and capacity outlook The capacity in the Scandinavian market has accelerated during the autumn in line with SAS\u2019s expectations. This development is expected to continue during the winter program 2017/2018. SAS\u2019s overall load factor and traffic volumes declined versus last year at the same time as the yield improved strongly. This is explained by last year\u2019s 70 year\u2019s anniversary campaign, that resulted in record high volumes and weak yield, combined with the phase in of larger aircraft in 2017. The traffic volumes in November 2017 and load factor are therefore more in line with the levels prior to 2016. This trend is expected to continue during the winter program 2017/2018. \nIn fiscal year 2017/2018, SAS plans to increase capacity (ASK) by around 1\u20133%, driven by longer European routes and the fact that the Airbus A320neo has more seats than the aircraft being replaced. \nSAS scheduled traffic development in November SAS increased its scheduled capacity in November by 0.9% and the traffic decreased by 6.1%, resulting in a load factor of 68.6%, 5.1 p.u. lower than last year. This is driven by last year\u2019s campaign and larger aircraft. \nSAS\u2019s intercontinental capacity was reduced by 2.6% and the traffic decreased 12.8%. During the next months, the capacity on SAS\u2019s long haul routes is also planned to decrease as one wet leased Boeing 737 was phased out in August 2017. \nThe traffic on SAS\u2019s European/Intrascandinavian routes decreased by 1.5%. At the same time the capacity was increased 3.5%. The traffic continued to grow on leisure oriented routes in Europe. \nOn SAS\u2019s domestic routes, the capacity was increased by 1.3%, driven by higher capacity on Danish domestic routes. The traffic decreased by 2.1%.

Sometimes known as the Theodosian Long Walls, they built upon and extended earlier fortifications so that the city became impregnable to enemy sieges for 800 years. The fortifications were the largest and strongest ever built in either the ancient or medieval worlds. Resisting attacks and earthquakes over the centuries, the walls were particularly tested by Bulgar and Arab forces who sometimes laid siege to the city for years at a time. Sections of the walls can still be seen today in modern Istanbul and are the city\u2019s most impressive surviving monuments from Late Antiquity. Making the City Safe \nAlthough the city had benefitted from previous emperors building fortifications, especially Constantine I when he moved his capital from Rome to the east, it is Emperor Theodosius II who is most associated with Constantinople\u2019s famous city walls. It was, though, Theodosius I (r. 379-395 CE) who began the project of improving the capital\u2019s defences by building the Golden Gate of Constantinople in November 391 CE. The massive gate was over 12 metres high, had three arches, and a tower either side. It was entirely built of marble and decorated with statues and was topped with a sculpture of a chariot pulled by four elephants. The Golden Gate probably marked the start of triumphal processions which ended in the Hippodrome. Two decades later, Theodosius II was alarmed at the recent fall of Rome to the Goths in 410 CE and set about building a massive line of triple fortification walls to ensure Constantinople never followed the same fate. The man credited with supervising their construction is Theodosius\u2019 Praetorian Prefect Anthemius. The walls extended across the peninsula from the shores of the Sea of Marmara to the Golden Horn, eventually being fully completed in 439 CE and stretching some 6.5 kilometres. They expanded the enclosed area of the city by 5 square kilometres.   The inner wall of three was almost 5 metres thick, 12 metres high, & presented to the enemy 96 projecting towers. Design & Architecture \nThe defensive walls were made of a combination of elements designed to make the city impregnable. Attackers first faced a 20-metre wide and 7-metre deep ditch which could be flooded with water fed from pipes when required. The water, once in, was retained by a series of dams. Behind that was an outer wall which had a patrol track to oversee the moat. Behind this was a second wall which had regular towers and an interior terrace so as to provide a firing platform to shoot down on any enemy forces attacking the moat and first wall. Then, behind that wall was a third, much more massive, inner wall. This final defence was almost 5 metres thick, 12 metres high, and presented to the enemy 96 projecting towers. Each tower was placed around 70 metres distant from another and reached a height of 20 metres. The towers, either square or octagonal in form, could hold up to three artillery machines. The towers were so placed on the middle wall so as not to block the firing possibilities from the towers of the inner wall. The inner wall was constructed using bricks and limestone blocks while the outer two were built from mixed rubble and brick courses with a limestone facing. Access to the city when not under attack, besides via the Golden Gate, was provided by ten additional gates. \nThe walls were built on a rising embankment so that the defenders could easily fire down on the structures in front of them if necessary. The plan of the fortifications ensured that the enemy could not place their siege engines anywhere near the all-important inner wall, and even artillery fire from a distance was presented with a much more limited target than in more traditional, single-wall fortifications. The distance between the outer ditch and inner wall was 60 metres while the height difference was 30 metres. A formidable obstacle indeed, especially when the defenders also had their secret weapon, the incendiary liquid known as \u201c Greek Fire \u201d which could be poured down upon or fired in grenades at the attackers. Defenders were organised according to the factions of the Hippodrome of the city. The four supporter groups were also responsible for the upkeep of the walls. By stocking up on food, rounding up livestock and with plenty of water in the city\u2019s massive cisterns, Constantinople was ready to withstand all comers. Significant Sieges \nThe city was severely tested several times in its long history but the massive walls never let down the capital\u2019s inhabitants. There was an unsuccessful siege in 626 CE by the army of Persian king Kusro II helped by his Slav and Avar allies. One of the most persistent attacks came with the Arab siege of 674-678 CE when the walls withstood siege engines and artillery fire from massive catapults. Another Arab siege came in 717 CE, this time an all-year-round affair involving 1,800 ships and an army of 80,000 men. Rumours of the approaching army provoked the Byzantine emperor into insisting that any family without three-years\u2019 worth of provisions flee the city. In the end, the harsh winter did more harm to the attackers than the defenders, and Constantinople survived yet again. The next to try his luck was Thomas the Slav, who besieged the capital in 821 CE but, predictably, the city held on. In 860 CE, 941 CE, and 1043 CE Russian attacks proved as ineffectual as any that had gone before.   \nMother nature was not always friendly to the city either, and repairs from earthquake damage were needed every so often, notably after the destructive quakes of August and September 478 CE after which repairs were made by Emperor Anastasius (r. 491-518 CE). There was another major quake on 26 October 740 CE. The damage was then so severe that the convention of the city\u2019s inhabitants, having to club together to maintain their own defences, was overridden and emperor Leo III (r. 717-741 CE) funded the repairs from the state treasury, albeit raising taxes by 8.5% for the purpose. Inscriptions on several of the wall\u2019s stone blocks record this work, and they can still be seen today at the end near the Sea of Marmara. Theophilos (r. 829-867 CE) and Michael III (r. 842-867 CE) were other emperors noted for their defence repair projects during the troubled 9th century CE. \nFinally, after 800 years, the city\u2019s defences were breached by the knights of the Fourth Crusade in 1204 CE, although the attackers got in through a carelessly left-open door and not because the fortifications themselves had failed in their purpose. Byzantine emperor Michael VIII (r. 1261-1282 CE) rebuilt the fortifications in the 1260s CE, but they could not withstand a second successful attack on them when the walls suffered severe damage from Ottoman canon fire in 1453 CE. \nLarge parts of the Theodosian Long Walls, including many towers, can still be seen today in Istanbul, where portions have been significantly restored. The Golden Gate still stands, too, as it was made part of the castle treasury of Mehmed II in 1453 CE.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mark cartwright", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "anthemius", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kusro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leo iii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael iii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael viii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "constantine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mehmed ii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theodosius", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas the slav", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anastasius", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theodosius ii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bulgar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "rome", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "golden horn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theodosian long walls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "constantinople", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "golden gate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "istanbul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marmara", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:27.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "efe75dea395c8dab032a1ebbb28cb73dd5a98142", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQNMdO2.qCTwSFqXveee.7HIZJ10HQOxL_XJBU6nINqpBdEKZGyQrXsCzSRn4FiL5U-", "site_full": "www.savantmag.com", "site": "savantmag.com", "site_section": "http://nuwomb.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Savant Magazine \u2013 Professional Product Reviews", "title": "Top 10 Best Roller Skates for Kids in 2017 \u2013 Reviews", "title_full": "Top 10 Best Roller Skates for Kids in 2017 \u2013 Reviews", "published": "2017-12-07T11:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.savantmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Roller-Skates-for-Kid.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "efe75dea395c8dab032a1ebbb28cb73dd5a98142", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQNMdO2.qCTwSFqXveee.7HIZJ10HQOxL_XJBU6nINqpBdEKZGyQrXsCzSRn4FiL5U-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Webb", "published": "2017-12-07T11:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "Top 10 Best Roller Skates for Kids in 2017 \u2013 Reviews", "text": "Top 10 Best Roller Skates for Kids in 2017   \nIf your kids are passionate about roller skating as many young kids tend to be, then you will without a doubt be searching for a good pair of roller skates to help them get the most out of this experience.

The final stage comes with the complete benefits of forward and backward skate rolling, allowing him or her to become that little champ they aspire to be. \n  \nChoosing The Right Skates for Kids \nWe should perhaps start off by saying that there isn\u2019t a universally high standard that all the good roller skates adhere to but that there certainly are considerations one must take in account when buying, selling, and manufacturing these skates. While some people go for style or comfort, some skates are better built to be flexible and reliable, which is why a kid\u2019s input on the matter should always be seen as the main determining factor. Other than that, here is what you should pay attention to when buying a pair of roller skates for kids: \nType \nMost roller skates fall into two main categories \u2013 inline skates and quad wheel skates. Inline skates are designed to offer superior maneuverability at the expense of their ease of use, mostly in regards to how hard they are to master. Quad wheel skates, on the other hand, are much easier to use and they provide a decent standard of balance, which makes them perfect for beginners who aren\u2019t in full control of their movement. \nConstruction \nOne must always consider the material used in a pair of skates\u2019 making, not only in regards to their durability but also as a matter of weight. It is somewhat common for skates to either have a steel or hard plastic frame and a chassis to match. For the best possible durability, you want skates with a steel frame or at least a pair of skates that enjoys a reinforced frame guaranteed to stand the test of time. \nAdjustability \nAnother thing to consider when buying a pair of skates is how easy they are to use. You find this out by reading reviews and by asking questions of their retailers. For the most part, these skates are designed to be easy to use, especially skates that are aimed at young children. On a related note, keep in mind that children grow and that you may have to buy them a new pair every year, thus the need to find a brand that maintains some form of consistency in their design. \nPurpose \nAs we already pointed out, there are different types of skates to choose from, each with their own particularities. Depending on what your kids plan to do with them, you can choose a quad wheel pair of skates designed for maximum comfort and entertainment. If, however, your kid is interested in skating for more than entertainment, then a pair of quality inline skates is what you want to be looking for. Keep in mind that the latter are more expensive and more likely to show signs of wear and tear over time. \nTrucks and Stoppers \nIt is very important when buying a pair of roller skates to consider the trucks and stoppers they employ. While the majority of skates come with nylon fiberglass or aluminum alloy composite trucks, some of these trucks are made of metal. We should point out that metal truck skates are slightly more expensive yet much more reliable at the same time. In regards to stoppers, look for skates with a dual locking system, both for the front and the back of the skates. These skates are by far the safest and most reliable, characteristics you should teach your children to always look for when it comes to sports gear of any kind. \nSizing \nAs a parent, you should keep in mind that as your children grow, you are going to have to buy a new pair of skates every year or so. For this reason, it is very important to always buy the right size, both to ensure your children are safe from injuries and that they feel comfortable wearing the skates. Most manufacturers use the term J or JUV when listing the size of a pair of skates, but remember that JUV sizing and adult sizing are two entirely different measurements. \nStraps \nOnce you have figured out your kids\u2019 size, you should ensure that your choice of skates can be fastened to provide a tight fit. The last thing you want from a pair of roller skates is to be loose on your feet, not only because it takes away from their stability but also because it may cause long-term injuries. A reliable strapping system, as long as you\u2019ve chosen the correct size, will provide your children with the mobility and flexibility they require. \nManufacturer \nEven though it\u2019s entirely possible for you to find a good pair of inexpensive roller skates, cheaper models tend to have structural problems that might end up causing problems in the long run. That said, it is also likely that you will spend a few bucks more for no good reason when getting a high-end model, yet you have to keep in mind that big brands tend to also provide a lengthy warranty and all the customer support you could possibly require. All in all, reputable brands offer reliability more than anything else, which is precisely what to look for seeing how you will be buying more than one pair as your children grow.

All I know is that I am a decisive person and I don\u2019t sit in, like or approve of La-Z-Boys. I like to read. To do this I either a) sit in a straight back winged chair or b) lay down on a bed and read on my side. I have guts. I pick one. I occasionally like to watch TV. I either a) sit upright on the couch or b) lay down on the couch and watch TV while lying on my side. My wife reads in the La-Z-Boy and my daughter watches TV in the lazy boy. They can\u2019t decide if they want to sit or lay. They can\u2019t make up their minds. They exist in some semi-prone, semi-upright, semi-conscious position. They then have lost their ability to put their feet on the floor or lift their feet up by themselves to lie on a bed or couch. I think that Woodrow Wilson and Jimmy Carter sat in la-Z-Boys. They have to adjust the footrest of their chair, which raises their feet to some odd 32-degree angle while their back is at a 68%-degree angle going in the opposite direction as they watch or read. I think that the indecision comes from the fact that in their inverted combination Z or S position, human blood cannot circulate. It must be this process which inhibits oxygen flow to the head and extremities that causes the indecision. When one sits in a good Republican upright, American redneck winged back chair, the circulatory system works in its normal way. The blood leaves the heart and travels straight down to the butt area. It picks up speed as it flows. This is the same principle as the water coming down from a water tower. With that head of steam built up, when it hits the butt area it quickly makes the 90 degrees turn and shoots out to the knee. As it gets towards the knee, it\u2019s rate of flow does decrease a bit, but then it gets to the knee area and heads over the knee cap waterfall area where the cascade effect provides the force necessary so that the blood, when it hits the foot area, can rush out to each of the toes. All parts of the body south of the heart now are full of the red stuff and superoxygenated. One must note that when sitting in the upright position that half of the blood that shoots down from the heart to the butt bounces back up past the chest all the way up to the brain. When one is fully reclined as on a couch or on a bed in a 100% prone position, the blood just gently flows back and forth like the current on a lake. All parts covered at all times, fully oxygenated. In both of the above-mentioned scenarios, the body and the brain have the blood and oxygen necessary to make decisions at all times. But, if you are in one of those fancy, newfangled liberal leaning La-Z- Boys, this just isn\u2019t going to happen. You are stretched out from here to there and then from there to who knows wherever. How can the blood figure out what to do? Your back is at a 28-degree angle so the blood, when it leaves the heart, barely flows to the hips. It does not pick up the pressure necessary for the trip out to the knee which now is not a straight shot but back up hill about 31 degrees. If by any chance some of the blood can make it to the knee and over the knee area waterfall, the calves are sticking almost straight out so it doesn\u2019t pick up enough steam to carry blood to the feet and toes which are now completely perpendicular. So little blood can make this trip that most of the body is left with poor oxygenation. Blood trying to leave the heart for the brain will find that there is no longer enough force or bounce to get much blood up to the brain, therefore no oxygenation. It must be this process inhibiting oxygen flow to the head and extremities which causes the indecision in life. Therefore, I can conclude that the La-Z-Boy chair is responsible for the decline in SAT scores, the loss of jobs to overseas markets and the election of what\u2019 his name. \nThe Higgs Weldon is a humor website with funny stories, articles, cartoons, and one liners.

I never really gave this pivotal question much thought, vaguely imagining, as many of us do, that I\u2019d stumble upon some kind of spontaneous meeting\u2014maybe meeting my dream guy while browsing Victorian literature in a bookshop or standing in line for a concert. What I discovered, however, as many people do, is that it can often take a lot more work than you envisioned to meet someone you\u2019re actually compatible with. \nFor this reason more and more millennials are experiencing dating app fatigue and are turning to professional matchmakers as a result. And yet, while plenty of Millennials would trust a stranger or an algorithm with their dating lives, we are still somewhat reluctant to turn to our friends and family\u2014the people who arguably know us best. \nI ended up meeting my husband through my sister; he began to know my family and had quite a few Sunday lunches with them before I ever met him. Ultimately, the fact that he got on so well with my family was an essential part of what made our relationship initially click. \nI may not have been \u201cset up\u201d with my husband by my family in a traditional sense, but I do have a close friend who met her husband via more formal matchmaking on her mother\u2019s part. My friend, Anusha*, is a British Indian, from a practicing Hindu background, and she tells me that virtually every Indian friend from her background turns to this cultural tradition when they are ready to meet their future spouse. \nIntrigued, I asked Anusha and her husband Vikram what it\u2019s like to date within a culture that accepts family matchmaking as the norm. While the system they describe is far from perfect, it may open up your mind to allowing your nearest and dearest to set you up. \n*Note: Names have been changed. So, how does it all work? \nAfter you reach a certain age (often in your twenties) you announce to your family that you want to start dating more seriously. When my friend reached that point, her mom started giving her the details of different guys, and their family member or friend would give them her details, and then the suitor would get in touch with her. They\u2019d text back and forth a bit, and then arrange to meet up. She was only allowed to see one guy at a time; if she didn\u2019t like him, she\u2019d tell her mom, who would then give her the details of the next guy on the list. \n\u201cMy parents are so traditional, my mum desperately wanted to find me my husband\u2014she would have been really disappointed if I hadn\u2019t met my husband this way,\" explains Anusha. \"But it\u2019s not just traditional families who do things this way; it\u2019s very common in British-Indian culture. I\u2019d say roughly 75% of people my age from my background are dating to find their partner this way.\" What goes on this epic-sounding matchmaking list? \n\u201cMy mum is always in contact with loads of people who are asking if she knows any girls or guys, and she\u2019s been keeping a list with lots of names and details of different people; half of the time it\u2019s not even for her own children, she\u2019s just being the messenger for someone else,\u201d explains Anusha. It's a very much a community-driven initiative. \nAnusha wanted the guys her mom chose for her to be maybe a few years older than her, \u201cbut not too old,\u201d to live in the same city, to be \u201cthe same height or taller, not shorter\u201d than her, and not to be living with their parents. (Luckily for her, her mother didn\u2019t listen to that last rule, because her future husband was actually living with his parents when he met her\u2014unlike the loser she had imagined, he was cutting back on rent so he could save for a house.) \nAnusha\u2019s mom was also following some strict traditional criteria that Anusha herself didn\u2019t care about much either way: \u201cFrom her perspective, he had to be from the same background, come from a good family...and he had to be able to provide for me, which means having a good education, or a good job.\u201d Essentially, her mum believed he needed to have his professional life in order before he was ready to start a family. How long does the process usually go on for, and what is it like? \nAnusha dated this way for about three years, and Vikram for about two. \u201cI think when you first start you\u2019re not sure what to expect; you hear a bit about what it\u2019s like from other people, and it\u2019s fun to start with because you get to meet lots of new people,\" shares Anusha. \"Even though it\u2019s serious in the sense that it\u2019s about trying to find the person you\u2019re going to marry, it can still be fun if you take a relaxed approach to it.\u201d \n\u201cThe best advice I had was to just go out and have fun,\u201d says Vikram. \u201cWhen I met Anusha we had a good time and got to know each other slowly.\u201d What are some of the benefits of this way of dating? \nThe most obvious benefits are that if it works out, your family is bound to approve of the match (no small thing for some families), you share a similar background and upbringing, and also, you know you have the same end game going into the relationship. \u201cYou both want to eventually get to marriage, whereas with a dating app, it\u2019s different\u2014it could just be a bit of fun,\u201d says Anusha. \nAnd then there\u2019s the fact that being set up by people you know forces a certain level of accountability and good manners: \u201cWhen your mum sets you up with someone, you have to play it a bit careful; you\u2019re both more committed to it going well,\u201d explains Anusha. \nVikram was a bit more explicit: \u201cYou can\u2019t do the nasty things that you can do on a normal date with a random person, like seeing them in a bar and deciding you don\u2019t like how they look, and turning around and leave before they see you. If you do something like that it will get back to the people who set you up\u2013your reputation is on the line. Everyone has to be polite.\u201d Are there any downsides? \n\u201cEven though it\u2019s a lot more laid-back with our generation than it used to be, I\u2019d say the majority of people feel some kind of pressure and expectation on them from their families,\u201d says Vikram. \u201cThey feel pressure not to act a certain way in case it gets back to their parents.\" This is especially a problem if you\u2019re not close to your parents, or if your parents don\u2019t know you as well as they think they do. \u201cPeople 100% feel like they have to report back to their parents after the date,\u201d Anusha adds. After all, if she didn\u2019t click with the guy, she had to explain why in order to get to the next name on the list. \nVikram also says that he met a lot of people who didn\u2019t seem interested in being there: \u201cIt felt like they were being forced to be there\u2014people who said yes to their parents but they didn\u2019t actually want to get married. I got to a point where I had to tell my mum that she was choosing the wrong kind of people.\u201d \nJust like any other method of dating, you can get burned out and weary of the process, so it\u2019s no magic bullet. \u201cYou do definitely get to a point where you meet a few people in a row and they\u2019re just not right, and you don\u2019t want to keep going, you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s all worth it,\u201d says Anusha. It just so happens, that\u2019s the point Anusha found herself at when she met Vikram. \nAs it turns out, even when you\u2019re being set up on dates by your mother, the same laws of attraction and compatibility apply. When you do find the right person, however, having your family involved from the get-go can keep you both on the same page.

Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio, left, and Keith Gregg, the county's Chief Information Technology Officer, right, speak at a press conference Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, at the Government Center about t... \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

Get used to the publishing process, the lingo, the difference between Green and Gold Open Access, and so on. \nWhy not share your work in a different way?

The CPISRA World Games aren\u2019t a junior competition, so I know I\u2019ll be competing against athletes who are much older than me but I am looking forward to the experience.\u201d \nWith this being Freeman\u2019s first-ever World Games, still at the tender age of 14, the Worthing racer is realistic about his chances and said: \u201cI want to gain international experience but it would be amazing against an older and tough field to come home with a medal. \n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly made me more focused on my training programme and determined to work and train as hard as I can.\u201d \nFreeman has had a busy and successful 2017, something which he hopes to continue, starting at the World Games early next year. \nHe added: \u201cI\u2019d like to further my international sporting career and I think every athlete\u2019s dream is to one day represent Great Britain. I don\u2019t ever predict when as I know the selection process is incredibly tough but one day. \n\u201cI will continue encouraging my fellow Worthing & District Harriers wheelchair racing club members and would like to become a coach in future years. \n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that when my coach Julian Stevens and I started the wheelchair racing club four years ago I would now be selected for England. \n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have achieved what I have without the support of my family and coach.\u201d Trending  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nathan freeman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julian stevens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "freeman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julia stevens", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "worthing & district harriers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "worthing wheelchair racing club", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "england worthing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "great britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:30.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f312da529fd565219c01030e58f7152df79b4b57", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAioh7l_u9JjlQWeP7I0CcPWA-", "site_full": "groups.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://groups.google.com/a/googleproductforums.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=categories/gmail/computer-email-program-please-specify-apple-mail-outlook-thunderbird-etc", "site_categories": ["business"], "section_title": "Gmail Help Forum - Google Product Forums", "title": "Innocent personal email server blocked", "title_full": "Innocent personal email server blocked - Google Product Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.google.com/images/icons/product/groups-128.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9ad23061f59b7cc6bb0dd9f99a2a9e1f27a85b98", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAioh7l_u9JjlQaYQQFILEuNPIbC19u1tqbg--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "catzrule", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "starbeamrainbowlabs.com has PTR issues.\nHave you seen https://support.google.com/mail/answer/81126?hl=en ?

Looked like diamond shining brightly from 10 miles away disc up close \nDuring a visit to san antonio, tx. i accompanied my brother to visit friends. after midnight, we drove home on hwy 281, before there were expressway 37. when we stopped for gas right before we intersected loop 410, i noticed an object south of us that shined like a diamond. as we approached the object, it was hovering on a hill to the west of the hwy 281. we thought it was a water tower that had been decorated with christmas lights. but then the ship started to float down from the top of the hill and stopped right above our car. my brother and i looked out of the car windows and could not believe what we were seeing. the ship then crossed the hwy 281 towards the east and stopped on the other side of the northbound lane. we had to proceed south until we reached the turnaround and came back to where the ship was still hovering. i was driving and got out of the car and told my brother to stay by the car and try to stop any cars that were approaching. no cars approached during this time. i walked on to the grass area away from the hwy 281 and went under the ship to examin what it could be. i sensed there were two giant figures in front of me and i kept asking what they wanted or who were they. i got no answers but as soon as i stepped back to use the upcoming full moon to silhouette the figures or their ship, and it immediately moved north about two bloks, so i got in my car and followed it. but as soon as i got out again, it moved back to its original spot. i had to cross over and go back to where i first parked. the ship moved east again and i ended up having to go south to turn around and come back to the same spot. the ship seemed to react to me trying to use the moon to get a better sense of the shape, but then it moved north again and i moved my car to where it had moved to, but as soon as i got out of the car, the ship moved to the original spot and then floated and moved west along the hill top and we lost track of it. we then decided to drive home. we told our parents what had happened, but it was hard for them to believe. then in 1992 around november, i woke up in my bedroom and four small grey aliens were floating me through a wall and headed to my bed where mu wife was sleeping. i could not move and was floating in the air about three feet above the floor. i could not move my body, but i could move my head. i could not talk, but i started grunting to try to wake up my wife. she finally stirred and sat up on the bed and proceeded to rub her eyes to wake up and see what the noise was. as soon as the four little aliens realized she was going to turn and see me being accompanied by these greys that they instantly disappeared and i plummeted to the floor without the ability to move my arms. i hit the floor very hard and hurt my wrists. i still could not talk and my wife got out of bed, without seeing the creatures, and helped me get up and pushed me to the bathroom. i could not talk so i was gasping for air and bent down to the sink to try to put water in my mouth, but at first i could not swallow, so i straighted up and saw myself in the mirror and was shocked to see that my neck was stretched out from my earlobe to my shoulders, and i realized what had happened to me i put some water in my mouth and finally a small trickle went down my throat and suddenly my throat oppend up and i was able to swallow water and my neck shrunk back to normal. my wife and now ex-wife still does not believe what happened to me. in other words, i have not been able to solve my experience but i know i woke up on them and they were startled to see me awake and actually get to see them. they come when you are asleep and bring you back and leave you asleep and when you wake up, you don't remember what happened. i want help because something made me wake up and i want to persue that so that we can learn what made me wake up and give this knowledge to the world, unless i am in the wrong and am supposed to keep quiet. i am 68 years old and i don't want to die without getting any help from anyone. please contact me before i am no longer available to share this story. if you can help, please let me know. i don't want to become a mufon investigator, as i was once when i was trying to get help. mufon only wanted me for that. i am getting tired and losing hope. i want to help you solve this mystery. i don't know if i am dealing with god or his messengers or something else completely.Thank you for providing me with this form of communications. i wait anxiously. your friend always. \nLatest UFO Sighting \nCredit: MUFON \nAny duplication, in part or in whole, is forbidden without permission of copyright holder.
