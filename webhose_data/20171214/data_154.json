But that\u2019s not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid\u2019s health care challenge. \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama\u2019s health law, it\u2019s become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama\u2019s expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\u201cWe now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\u201d said Kavita Patel , a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who\u2019s also a practicing physician. \u201cThis really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\u201d \nIn small town , Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don\u2019t take matters into my own hands,\u201d said Rose, who\u2019s in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\u201cInstead of waiting on everyone else, this time I\u2019m going to do it for myself,\u201d said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n\u2014 Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n\u2014 Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n\u2014 Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that\u2019s only half the story. \n\u201cJust because they smoke more, doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t have an interest in their health,\u201d Witters said of those with Medicaid. \u201cTheir interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups\u2026although I think they are swimming upstream.\u201d \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who\u2019ll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo National Association of Medicaid Directors , cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\u201cThe Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\u201d said Salo. \u201cIt is people who have health conditions.\u201d \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \u201cDepression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\u201d he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan , for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some figuring out to do,\u201d Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5 , with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C. \nFor the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point. For Medicaid recipients, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vickie rose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan witters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kavita patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "witters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "matt salo national association of medicaid directors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicaid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mid-delta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clarendon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:19.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1aa8f7d1651695bb476fc5a3f5a9f42423473d82", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju34DG7cV9ElC3rn4Zvv5G.uvyHDZByNzlOhDVwZs0ZPxoLwy6SYPC4TGXvDuhct_16ib_DsKgSTUtXrScvwGgElDmP0r790TsJI-", "site_full": "www.ign.com", "site": "ign.com", "site_section": "http://www.ign.com/boards/forums/the-vestibule.5296/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "The Vestibule | IGN Boards", "title": "anyone else get really watery/teary eyes when you yawn?", "title_full": "anyone else get really watery/teary eyes when you yawn? | IGN Boards", "published": "2017-12-06T19:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "http://www.ign.com/boards/styles/default/ign/ign-logo-100x100.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 383, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2055be06dd822b1af5e10d6befed9093541f1486", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju34DG7cV9ElC3rn4Zvv5G.uvyHDZByNzlOhDVwZs0ZPxoLwy6SYPC4TGXvDuhct_16ib_DsKgSTUtXrScvwGgElDLeAa_hcWvSn5nQNVg3kt1Q--", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "Some_Random_Aussie", "published": "2017-12-07T20:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Yup, happens all the time\nYou might shed a tear or two.

The President added that his government had played significant roles in restoring peace and harmony in the North East. \u201cWe have recorded tremendous successes in our efforts to achieve the three agenda of my government; security, economy, and fight against corruption. \u201cNigeria, Chad and Niger Republic have succeeded in crushing Boko Haram insurgents in the Northeast.

Gunter Dr. Gunter is a professor of political science at Tennessee Technological University and the author of 14 books on Kurdish and Armenian issues.\nRecep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u2014 Turkey's current president (elected 2014) and former prime minister (2003-14) \u2014 in his first decade in power, won three parliamentary elections by ever-larger shares of the popular vote because he had helped to build Turkey into a burgeoning economic powerhouse and a moderate Islamic democracy. In the past half-decade, however, despite winning Turkey's first popular election for president in August 2014 and presiding over another great parliamentary victory in November 2015, Erdo\u011fan's increasing authoritarianism has helped precipitate the disastrous decline of the nation as well as his own inevitable fall from power. What happened, and what lessons can be gleaned? Can Turkey's decline be reversed and its progress revived?\nDOMESTIC AFFAIRS Erdo\u011fan created the Adalet ve Kalkinma Partisi (AKP), or Justice and Development Party (JDP), as a moderate, social-conservative party with Islamic roots in August 2001 after the two previous Islamic parties \u2014 the Virtue Party (Fazilet Partisi) and the Welfare Party (Refah Partisi) \u2014 had been banned, along with their longtime leader and Erdo\u011fan's former mentor, Necmettin Erbakan (1926-2011). 1 Erdo\u011fan had already earned an admirable reputation for honesty and efficiency as the mayor of Istanbul during the mid-1990s. Having apparently learned a lesson from his earlier political experiences as an Islamist politician, Erdo\u011fan specifically declared that the AKP did not have a religious agenda and would work within the secular-democratic framework. Barely a year later, in the parliamentary elections of November 2, 2002, the AKP swept to victory. After solving a brief problem concerning an earlier conviction for having publicly read lines from an Islamic poem, 2 Erdo\u011fan became prime minister of Turkey in March 2003, a position held until becoming the first popularly elected president in August 2014.\nWhen he first assumed power, many critics warned against Erdo\u011fan's supposed secret Islamic agenda. This did not materialize, though the economy kept expanding, to the advantage of many who had usually been left behind. Erdo\u011fan seemed to have proven his critics wrong; indeed many began to compare the AKP with Europe's democratically-oriented and economically progressive Christian Democrats. In addition, Erdo\u011fan began to tame and then politically defang the military, Turkey's ultimate political arbitrator. 3\nOne of Erdo\u011fan's goals in reforming Turkey's political and economic situation was to win membership in the European Union (EU), with which accession negotiations began in October 2005. The effort eventually foundered, 4 but as a reward for his worthy accomplishments, the international community too sought to reward the Turkish leader. The West held him up as a moderate Muslim alternative to the Islamic extremism plaguing much of the Middle East. 5 And to his credit, Erdo\u011fan achieved real successes: a record 7.5 percent average annual growth rate, foreign investments that jumped from $1.2 to a record $20 billion and a decline in inflation. In addition, AKP social-welfare networks played an important role in reducing the negative consequences of a shift to a market economy. Turkey's chronically inflation-ridden currency was replaced by a new lira that held its value. As the economy took off and incomes sharply rose, so did Erdo\u011fan's popularity. He was duly rewarded with even more votes in the national elections of 2007 and 2011. 6\nErdo\u011fan also sought a solution to the Kurdish problem by emphasizing Islamic unity. As a result of skillful positioning in the ideological marketplace and portraying itself as the party of opposition to the \"system\" while being \"sensitive\" to the Kurdish problem, Erdo\u011fan's AKP was able to secure an amount of support in the ethnic Kurdish regions. 7 In August 2005, he also famously stated publicly in Diyarbakir that Turkey had a \"Kurdish problem\" and needed more \"democracy\" to solve it. 8 After his AKP won an even greater electoral victory in July 2007 against strong military opposition and elected his then-friend and colleague Abdullah Gul as Turkey's new president, however, Erdo\u011fan and his party were soon put on the defensive by a nearly successful attempt in the Constitutional Court to ban them as a threat to Turkey's secular order.\nHaving barely survived this threat to his political existence, Erdo\u011fan and the AKP seemed to lose their reformist zeal and became a party of the status quo. Addressing the Kurdish issue during the campaign for the local elections of March 2009, Erdo\u011fan called on his Kurdish opponents in the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) to love Turkey or leave it. 9 This remark by the security-oriented prime minister of 2009 provided a sharp contrast to the one who in 2005 had called for more democracy to solve the Kurdish problem.\nNevertheless, Erdo\u011fan engaged in negotiations with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) from 2008 to 2011 at meetings in Oslo (the Kurdish Opening). 10 In addition, on June 30, 2012, Erdo\u011fan met with the iconic Kurdish political spokeswoman and member of parliament (MP) Leyla Zana, who declared that she had confidence in his ability to solve the Kurdish problem. 11 However, this meeting caused a great deal of bitter debate in the Kurdish community. Furthermore, Erdo\u011fan advanced few concrete proposals, and the Kurdish Opening eventually closed.\nNevertheless, Erdo\u011fan approved further negotiations, which finally led to a ceasefire with the PKK in March 2013. These too eventually failed; neither side was willing to compromise enough. 12 Following the failure of the AKP \u2014 for the first time since it came to power in November 2002 \u2014 to retain its majority in the parliamentary elections of June 7, 2015, heavy fighting began again. Many believe Erdo\u011fan purposely goaded the PKK into it so that he could unite the Turkish nationalist vote and regain his majority. He did just that in the snap parliamentary elections of November 1, 2015.\nBased on his performance to date, one might conclude that Erdo\u011fan does not grasp the depth of the Kurdish issue because he has little sense of ethnic or civic nationalism. His dominant identity is Muslim, and he thinks that Islamic identity will magically solve the problem. 13 Although he has been somewhat more concerned with the Kurds than most other Turkish leaders, Erdo\u011fan has failed to develop any coherent policy. Indeed, since his ceasefire with the PKK broke down in July 2015, Erdo\u011fan has seemingly turned his back on any approach other than military force.\nIn recent years, Erdo\u011fan has also attempted to convert Turkey's government into a presidential system that would grant him significant new powers. 14 Indeed, he became Turkey's first popularly elected president in August 2014, forcing former ally and one-time president Abdullah Gul out of politics and hand-picking his new prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu \u2014 whom he then fired in May 2016 to appoint the even more compliant Binali Yildirim. Erdo\u011fan has also jailed many perceived political opponents: journalists, academics, military officers, and Kurdish leaders, among others. Media freedom in Turkey, as ranked by Freedom House, 15 Reporters Without Borders 16 and Bianet, 17 has deteriorated at an alarming rate as Erdo\u011fan aggressively used the penal code, criminal defamation legislation, and the country's antiterrorism law to punish critical reporting. Journalists have faced growing violence, harassment and intimidation. Can Dundar and Erdem Gul \u2014 editor-in-chief and Ankara bureau chief, respectively, of the leading opposition newspaper, Cumhuriyet \u2014 are two examples of this egregious situation. Erdo\u011fan personally filed a criminal complaint against them for leaking state secrets, and both were sentenced to five-year prison terms in May 2016 for reporting on how Erdo\u011fan's government had tried to ship arms to jihadists in Syria. Zaman , a well-respected (but Gulenist\u2013run) newspaper and Turkey's largest, was placed under state control, another instance, among many, of Erdo\u011fan's effort to curb public criticism of his actions.\nThe Ergenekon trials of supposed ultranationalists and retired military officers charged with planning violent campaigns to destabilize Erdo\u011fan's AKP and seize power began on July 28, 2008, and continued until February 2011. 18 The original 2,455-page indictment (ultimately reaching 8,000 pages) described an elaborate plot ultimately connecting 531 military officers, mafiosi, ultranationalists, lawyers and academic figures who supposedly attempted an illegal intervention against the Erdo\u011fan government. Critics, however, accused Erdo\u011fan \u2014 in league with his then-Gulenist allies, who had infiltrated the police and judiciary \u2014 of simply trying to take revenge on their military and Kemalist opponents with all these charges.\nOn August 5, 2013, Istanbul's High Criminal Court sentenced 275 of the accused, including the former chief of the General Staff, General Ilker Basbug, to life or long prison terms. However, on April 21, 2016, the High Court of Appeals overturned the convictions because of procedural flaws and the case's lack of merit. Although a new trial remained possible, many felt that dismissal of the case indicated that the original charges were based on little more than conspiracy theories promoting Erdo\u011fan's and increasingly the Gulenists' agenda. 19\nIt has proven difficult for Erdo\u011fan to amend the Constitution to his satisfaction, 20 so he has used de facto executive power over the political system to achieve some of his aims. To symbolize his vision of a strong president, he built a huge (1,000 rooms) Pure White Palace ( Ak Saray ) so large that aides move around the grounds by means of shuttle vehicles. Given that this new structure was built on supposedly protected land, Erdo\u011fan's opponents have referred to it as the Kac-Ak Saray , or illegal white palace, in reference to Erdo\u011fan as a would-be sultan. In 2013, Erdo\u011fan turned on his erstwhile Islamist allies, the Gulenists, after they accused him of corruption. The wide-scale Gezi Park riots in June 2013 against his perceived authoritarianism created more opposition to Erdo\u011fan's rule.\nFailed Coup On the night of July 15, 2016, a failed coup occurred in Turkey; its aftermath has led to drastically changed conditions likely to make the political situation, including the Kurdish problem, much worse. At least 260 people were killed and more than 2,000 were injured, according to government reports. Erdo\u011fan himself, however, declared to his supporters that the failed coup was a \"gift from God.\" 21 The failed coup gave him an excuse to further his own authoritarian ambitions, while purging his few remaining opponents.\nAmnesty International (AI) reported that the Turkish government had fired or suspended at least 50,000 people from various institutions, including judges, teachers, soldiers, police and journalists. 22 The government was labeling \"terrorists\" anyone it did not like or agree with. AI also reported it had credible evidence that post-coup detainees, including generals, were being beaten, tortured and raped/sodomized either digitally or by gun barrels. Turkish police were keeping detainees in stress positions for up to two days at a time, beating them and denying them food, water and medical treatment. The detainees were being held arbitrarily, denied access to lawyers and family, and not properly informed of the charges against them. AI termed these reports \"extremely alarming, especially given the scale of detentions.\" In the vast majority of cases, lawyers added that no evidence establishing reasonable suspicion of criminal behavior was presented against their clients.\nThe Turkish government also declared a sweeping three-month state of emergency, giving it the power to rule by decree and bypass the duly elected parliament. Under one decree, suspects could be detained for as long as 30 days without charge, and the government could listen in on all their conversations with attorneys. As already mentioned, opponents of the government, even peaceful ones, were being accused of \"terrorism.\" To make room for the thousands of post-coup detainees, Erdo\u011fan released from prison thousands of supposedly nonviolent criminals not connected to the attempted coup.\nThe Kurds This new state of emergency was added to the government-enforced curfews that had allowed its forces to roam freely against the civilian Kurdish population since the summer of 2015, when the Turkish-PKK ceasefire broke down and heavy fighting resumed. Kurdish leaders in Turkey tried to dissociate themselves from the attempted coup \u2014 many of the military leaders now under arrest had been involved in the government's war against the PKK. Erdo\u011fan, however, still needed the PKK as an enemy to unite Turkey's nationalist vote behind him. After all, the pro-Kurdish Halklarin Demokratik Partisi (HDP, People's Democratic Party) had cost him an absolute majority in the parliamentary elections of June 7, 2015. Thus, even though HDP co-chair Selahattin Demirtas had immediately denounced the coup, Erdo\u011fan chose not to thank him or invite him to the presidential palace, unlike the leaders of the Republican People's Party (CHP) and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), the other main parties in parliament that had condemned the coup. This snub was clearly intended to isolate the peaceful pro-Kurdish party.\nMany Kurds in Turkey feared that the HDP's exclusion from Erdo\u011fan's post-coup rallies and other peaceful events would further push the Kurds toward greater extremism. They believed this was Erdo\u011fan's intention in order to secure Turkish-nationalist support. His earlier attempt to criminalize the 1,128 Turkish and Kurdish academics who signed a petition in January 2016 asking the government to end its renewed violence in the southeast, 23 and his successful campaign to strip HDP co-leader Selahattin Demirtas and other HDP MPs of their parliamentary immunity so they could be tried on trumped up charges of treason, had already served to marginalize the Kurds. Thus, if conditions had become so bad for many ethnic Turks \u2014 military officers, judges, lawyers, journalists and teachers, among others \u2014 what could hated and feared minorities such as the Kurds expect? As close friends of the Turkish Kurds concluded: \"Kurds across the country are now threatened with suspension of their civil rights and freedoms by the widespread crackdown that Erdo\u011fan has launched in the wake of the attempted coup.\" 24\nAt the end of May 2016, a subsequent report stated that Turkey's continuing war against the PKK had cost about $400 billion over the past three decades, adding that since the new fighting had begun in July 2015, \"About 5,000 rebels have been killed in the southeast and in airstrikes in northern Iraq\u2026, while 438 security personnel, including 296 soldiers, have died, according to the state-run Anadolu news service.\" 25 Although state censorship prevented complete coverage of the ongoing fighting, another report claimed that \"Turkey deployed 20,000 soldiers and police officers to Mardin and Hakkari Provinces in March 2016 as part of a new wave of operations to expel the PKK from several district capitals.\" 26\nFOREIGN RELATIONS Erdo\u011fan's hand-picked former prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, once touted the policies of \"zero problems with neighbors\" and strategic depth. These have morphed into nothing but problems with neighbors and a strategic quagmire. The 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq \u2014 and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein \u2014 is a major background cause of this catastrophe. Iraq has been shattered into its sectarian and ethnic parts; it exists as a state only in the minds of true believers in the United States. 27 The resulting instability has opened up opportunity spaces for both the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq 28 and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria/the Levant (ISIS/ISIL). 29 More recently, the Syrian civil war has also boosted ISIS, as well as institutionalizing Rojava (western or Syrian Kurdistan) as a second de facto autonomous Kurdish state (in this case, closely linked to the PKK). 30 ISIS and Rojava, two dynamic non-state actors, have all but erased the borders drawn in the Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1916. Moreover, in all of these new situations, including his early call for the demise of Bashar al-Assad's regime, Erdo\u011fan has arguably come down on what seems to be the losing side.\nIn a well-documented, misguided attempt to facilitate the overthrow of Assad and restore stability to his southern Syrian neighbor, Erdo\u011fan allowed jihadists from all over the world to transit Turkey and cross into Syria. 31 Erdo\u011fan also hoped to reduce or even eliminate the perceived threat from Rojava, which Erdo\u011fan saw as a proto-PKK state that would consolidate its success against ISIS into a contiguous territory along Turkey's southern border. Thus, Turkey passively watched ISIS try to destroy the Syrian Kurds holed up just across the Turkish border in Kobane from September 2014 to January 2015.\nAs Erdo\u011fan explained, support for the Syrian Kurds in Kobane would be tantamount to aiding the PKK, a terrorist enemy that had been trying to dismember Turkey for more than 30 years: \"For us [the] PKK is what IS [ISIS] is.\" 32 Why should Turkey get involved when the United States, its superpower NATO ally, would not do more? It suited Erdo\u011fan that ISIS and the Syrian Kurds were weakening each other while Turkey sat idle.\nFurthermore, many Turks felt betrayed: by giving the Syrian Kurds air support against ISIS, their American NATO ally was strengthening Syrian Kurdish attempts to gain autonomy, and this could encourage separatism among Kurds in Turkey as well as the seizure of Arab land near the Turkish border. 33 On June 15, 2015, for example, Syrian Kurdish forces \u2014 led by the PKK's closely associated Democratic Union Party (PYD) and its militia the Peoples Defense Units (YPG) and women's branch, the YPJ \u2014 took control of the Syrian border town of Tal Abyad. This supposedly forced its non-Kurdish population to flee to Turkey, where a burgeoning refugee population of 2.7 million was destabilizing the country.\nMoreover, illustrating the law of unintended consequences, blowback had already led to the capture of 49 Turks when ISIS overran Mosul in June 2014. They were only released after who-knows-what bribes and threats. Subsequently, Erdo\u011fan came to blame ISIS for deadly attacks that killed ethnic Kurdish citizens in such Turkish cities as Suruc (Kobane's twin) and Ankara in July and October 2015. These attacks furthered the Kurdish belief that the Turkish government was unable or unwilling to protect them. Some actually claimed that Erdo\u011fan had turned a blind eye to further the perception of Turkey under siege and increase his fortunes in the elections held on November 1, 2015. Such a wag-the-dog strategy might have helped Erdo\u011fan regain power in the short-run but would certainly hinder his chances of restarting the Kurdish peace process.\nIn the summer of 2015, Turkey finally claimed to have entered the struggle against ISIS, allowing the United States to use the Incirlik air base to carry out bombing raids. 34 However, most Turkish air attacks hit the PKK bases in the Qandil Mountains along the border of the KRG and Iran, and even on occasion Syrian Kurdish YPG forces in Rojava. This led some to conclude that Erdo\u011fan was simply using ISIS as a foil to really go after the PKK and the PYD. 35 The situation grew even more complicated on September 30, 2015, when Russia began air strikes against Syrian rebels, only to have a Turkish missile destroy one of its jets on November 24, 2015.\nCemil Bayik, the co-head of the PKK's umbrella Kurdistan Communities Union (KCK), claimed that Turkey was really supporting ISIS and that Russia might begin directly supporting YPG/YPJ forces in Syria. 36 The Turkish action against Russia also had the potential to draw the United States into a confrontation with Russia, which might be supporting the U.S. bombing campaign against ISIS in a civil war that was becoming a Hobbesian struggle of all against all. As 2015 came to a close, Erdo\u011fan did begin a domestic crackdown against ISIS, arresting several hundred suspects. It came too late, however, to prevent worse problems.\nIn the autumn of 2015, the Syrian crisis expanded when more than a million Syrian refugees, among others, began entering Europe from Turkey. This desperate sea of humanity threatened the stability of the European Union and soon led the EU to offer Turkey $6.8 billion, progress toward visa liberalization and a revitalization of Turkey's moribund EU accession process in return for Turkish help in stemming the refugee flood. 37 However, this deal had become problematic by the summer of 2016, as Erdo\u011fan's increasingly arrogant behavior repelled the EU. 38\nThe Syrian civil war has presented Erdo\u011fan with additional daunting obstacles to peace in Turkey. As of September 2016, at least 18 separate bombings connected in one way or another with Syria had killed more than 350 people in Turkey during the previous 12 months. The deadly blast in Istanbul on January 12, 2016, that left 13 foreign tourists dead was followed by another on February 17 against a bus filled with Turkish soldiers in what had been considered the most secure district in Ankara, killing 28 while wounding more than 60. A horrific attack against the Istanbul Ataturk airport on June 28, 2016, killed 45 and wounded 230; the bombing of a Kurdish wedding party in Gaziantep on August 20, 2016, killed 54 and wounded even more. There were several other such strikes, illustrating the deteriorating situation.\nTurkey blamed ISIS for the Istanbul bombing; the PYD's YPG militia or the PKK offshoot, the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK), for the one in Ankara; and ISIS for the Istanbul airport and Gaziantep wedding-party assaults. Although the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurds denied culpability, it was clear that all four of these attacks were at least partial blowback from the violence radiating out of Syria as well as the renewed Turkish-PKK fighting. 39 What is more, the February Ankara bombing elicited vituperative recriminations from Erdo\u011fan against the United States for its aid to the YPG. 40 (Denunciations of the United States increased exponentially when Turkey began to blame Washington for allegedly supporting the Fethullah Gulen Terrorist Organization [FETO], or parallel state, which Turkey accused of backing the failed coup of July 15, 2016.) 41\nFor its part, the United States declared that the YPG was not a terrorist organization and urged Turkey to stop shelling its operatives in northern Syria, action that had begun when the Syrian Kurds crossed west of the Euphrates River in mid-February 2016 in their drive to join the isolated Kurdish canton of Afrin (Kurd Dagh) in Syria's west with the already unified Syrian Kurdish cantons of Kobane and Hasaka (Jazira) to the east. 42 The PYD \u2014 now the lead organization in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a coalition of 13 Kurdish and Arab fighting groups from northeastern Syria that had been patched together on October 10, 2015, becoming the main boots on the ground for the U.S.-led military campaign against ISIS \u2014 was seeking to eliminate the Manbij pocket that anchored the 98-kilometer ISIS foothold on the Syrian-Turkish border and connected it with the Syrian headquarters of ISIS in Raqqa to the south. Erdo\u011fan bitterly opposed the SDF; its success in eliminating the Manbij pocket presented Turkey with an almost unified, pro-PKK southern border that Erdo\u011fan saw as an existential threat, especially after the renewal of his struggle against the PKK in Turkey.\nIndeed, in March 2016, the PYD had already announced the establishment of an autonomous region based on federalism in Syria for the three Kurdish cantons of Jazira, Kobane and Afrin, territory that included large Arab minorities. 43 The area in question contained a large portion of Syria's resources: nearly two-thirds of its gas and oil reserves and important cotton and wheat-growing areas as well as almost two-thirds of its water resources, ten dams and much of its grazing land. Although all the inhabitants of this putative federal region would theoretically be represented in a decentralized bottom-up administration divorced from the oppressive nation-state \u2014 based on PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan's theory of democratic autonomy lifted from the writings of American anarchist Murray Bookchin 44 \u2014 it was clear that the real power would be centralized in the hands of the PYD/PKK.\nBoth Turkey and the Assad regime, despite their mutual animosity, bitterly condemned this move, while the United States and Russia took a more neutral view. Thus, on August 24, 2016, Turkish forces entered northern Syria and with their jihadist allies quickly pushed a demoralized \u2014 or possibly compliant \u2014 ISIS out of the border town of Jarabulus, demanding that the Syrian Kurds and their allies (the SDF) pull back east of the Euphrates River. The Turkish purpose was to halt the expansion of Rojava, a move the United States partially supported, given Turkey's importance in the struggle against ISIS, but also found problematic: it has a de facto alliance with the Syrian Kurds, after all.\nIf Turkey continues to become more involved in Syria to counter both Rojava's expansion and Russia's support for Assad, all three of which Turkey sees as its principal foes, a disastrous escalation could ensue. This could even include an indirect clash with the United States; the SDF coalition provides the most viable boots on the ground against ISIS, which the United States views as the main enemy.\nTurkey should recall that the United States refused to support it in Cyprus in 1964, when the Soviet Union had threatened intervention. 45 Similarly, NATO might not support Turkey in a Syrian incursion that produces a clash with Russia, much less the United States, which supports the PYD/YPG/SDF. If a Turkish invasion of Syria goes badly, Turkey might even end up losing Hatay, the province Ataturk's patient and astute diplomacy added to the country in 1939 but Syria has never recognized. Erdo\u011fan made a visit to St. Petersburg on August 9, 2016, in an attempt to mitigate these dangers \u2014 as well as to mend fences with Vladimir Putin and bring lucrative Russian tourism back to Turkish beaches \u2014 but it is not likely to reverse the overall strategic situation.\nThe Russian-Assad advance in Syria that began early in 2016 has clearly improved their strategic position. This will include deciding who would be invited to future peace talks and under what conditions. The Turks will continue to face challenges to their statecraft as they attempt to avoid further immersion. In addition, Erdo\u011fan should work more closely with his U.S. and NATO allies instead of just pretending to do so while actually supporting jihadist oppositionists. Furthermore, Turkey should get over its unreasonable fear of the Syrian Kurds and seek to embrace them, just as it successfully reversed its opposition to the Iraqi Kurds in 2007. Despite Erdo\u011fan's errors, once the Syrian civil war ends, Turkey likely will remain the most powerful country in the region as well as the sixteenth-largest economy in the world. The Syrian Kurds will have no alternative other than to embrace Turkey \u2014 to the mutual benefit of both. Meanwhile, Turkey should avoid confronting Russia (or the United States) in a senseless war that cannot be won.\nCONCLUSIONS In his drive to protect and increase his authoritarian ambitions, Erdo\u011fan seems largely impervious to the damage he is creating for himself and Turkey. Although his approval rating jumped from 47 to 68 percent after the failed coup, 46 it is likely that some of this new support stems from modern Turkey's disdain for coups. In addition, there are those fearful of being branded supportive of the coup if they oppose Erdo\u011fan's methods. However, Erdo\u011fan has created too many enemies and too much chaos, both domestic and external, for his own good. Human-rights abuses are expanding and, since the failed coup, involve many elite Turkish groups \u2014 the military, the judiciary, journalists and academics, among others \u2014 in addition to peaceful Kurds. Many prominent Turks are embarrassed by how Erdo\u011fan has abused the system to further his own glory, damaging the state in the process. Scholars are hesitant to publish these facts, fearing that their families and friends might be the objects of retribution.\nIn some ways, Erdo\u011fan's ongoing struggles and crises remind one of the fevered situation Mao Zedong created during China's Cultural Revolution in which one erstwhile supporter after another was \"revealed\" to be an enemy. Finally, however, came Thermidor and a more rational leadership. Once the current dictatorial aberration is corrected, the well-established Turkish ship of state will be righted and its more natural progress resumed.\n1 For a brief period (June 1996-June 1997), Erbakan was secular Turkey's first Islamist prime minister, but was forced to resign by the military for violating secularist provisions of the Constitution.\n2 \"The Mosques are our barracks, the domes our helmets, the minarets our bayonets and the faithful our soldiers.\"\n3 The military successfully staged coups in 1960, 1971 (indirectly), 1980 and 1997 (indirectly), seeing itself as the ultimate guardian of the Turkish Republic originally founded by Kemal Ataturk, supreme military commander in Tukey's epic War of Independence during the early 1920s. However, when it tried again indirectly to influence the parliamentary elections in July 2007 by posting on its website the so-called e-memorandum (e-muhtira) warning against the threat posed by the AKP, Erdo\u011fan prevailed.

He died a year later. Erdo\u011fan had secured amendments to the Turkish constitution allowing Evren's trial.\n20 For background, see Michael M. Gunter, \"Turkey: The Politics of a New Democratic Constitution,\" Middle East Policy 19 (Spring 2012): 119-125. The Turkish constitution provides two different ways for its amendment: 1) through a two-thirds majority in parliament (i.e., 367 out of the 550 MPs voting in favor), or 2) a three-fifths majority (330 votes) plus passing a popular referendum. Currently, Erdo\u011fan's AKP has only 317 MPs. This gives him yet another reason to court the ultra-right MHP, which has 40 MPs. Erdo\u011fan might also seek to call new elections in the hope of the pro-Kurdish HPD failing to cross the 10 percent threshold, with the result that his AKP would win most of the HDP's current 59 MPs.\n21 Cited in \"After the Coup, the Counter-coup,\" The Economist , July 23, 2016, 14.\n22 A subsequent report increased the figure to 80,000 civil servants suspended from their jobs and more than 20,000 arrested.

For a strong case that the Gulen movement did indeed mastermind the failed coup, see Michael A. Reynolds, \"Damaging Democracy: The U.S., Fethulllah Gulen, and Turkey's Upheaval,\" Foreign Policy Research Institute, September 26, 2016, fpri.org/article/2016/09/damaging-democracy-u-s-fethullah-gulen-turkey's-upheaval, among others. Fethullah Gulen is an important interfaith Islamic scholar and imam who heads the Gulen or Hizmet (Service) Movement, which is an international network of universities, hospitals, charities, business associations, news outlets and schools spread across more than 150 countries. He has lived in exile in the United States since 1999. Some dismiss him as a dangerous cult leader infiltrating existing state structures such as those of Turkey, while others hail him as an enlightened beacon of interfaith ecumenicism. Apparently, he is both. Formerly an ally, he became a bitter political enemy of Erdo\u011fan in 2013 after accusing Erdo\u011fan of corruption. The two actually had already begun a power struggle earlier. Erdo\u011fan accused Gulen of masterminding the failed coup and demanded that the United States extradite him. As of October 2016, the United States has refused on the grounds that there was no credible evidence indicating Gulen was guilty. On the other hand, given how many Gulenists have infiltrated various Turkish institutions, it is likely that some of them were involved. However, this does not prove that Gulen himself was even aware of the attempt, much less masterminding it. Gulen has been ambivalent toward the Turkish-PKK peace process. For background, see M. Hakan Yavuz, Toward an Islamic Enlightenment: The Gulen Movement (Oxford University Press, 2013). During my trip to Turkey in October 2016, I spoke with some who suggested that the Turkish Armed Forces Assistance (and Pension) Fund (OYAK) also might have been involved in the failed coup because Erdo\u011fan was threatening to eliminate its lucrative benefits for retired Turkish military officers.\nMany Turkish conspiracy theories argue that former CIA official Graham E. Fuller, who did originally help Gulen obtain a green card to remain in the United States, masterminded the attempted coup. This is doubtful since Fuller is now retired from the CIA and teaches as an adjunct professor of history at Simon Fraser University in Canada. Fuller is very knowledgeable about Turkey and other related subjects, and he recently self-published an insightful analysis: Turkey and the Arab Spring: Leadership in the Middle East (Bozorg Press, 2014). Another fanciful conspiracy theory has it that Henri Barkey, an American academic who happened to be in Turkey at the time attending a conference, also masterminded the attempted putsch. Although it is true that the United States did not denounce the coup until it had clearly failed and many in the U.S. government had become frustrated with Erdo\u011fan's behavior, it is unlikely that the United States was behind the failed coup. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden repeated this denial during his visit to Turkey on August 24, 2016. \"U.S. Had No Foreknowledge of Turkey Coup Attempt: Biden,\" Press TV, August 24, 2016, http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2016/08/24/4815/Biden-US-Turkey-coup-yildi\u2026 , accessed August 26, 2016.

The built-in iOS Photos app will display your Raw photos, but it'll display them as a low res JPEG preview without any sort of warning attached.Once you've got your Raw file captured (using Halide, Lightroom Mobile, or any other photo app that supports Raw capture) don't go viewing it in iOS Photos. Load it in Darkroom, Snapseed, VSCO, or Lightroom Mobile, or you'll see a low-res, blurry mess. \nCheck out the before and after shots in the gallery above, and then head over to de With's full Power of Shooting RAW on iPhone post to read more about the advantages, disadvantages, and \"did you know?\" tidbits about shooting Raw on an iPhone.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "lightroom mobile", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:20.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ba5821814a313bfd4fc22a91e1103b929ea90adc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwhKmPvBJ1ssX4fBJyDV0m9Zo6l7gU1q9i.FfddpibIhEaw4l8TRWpbx4L8JCBYW0Q4TII8tjyoQA--", "site_full": "foro.fciencias.unam.mx", "site": "unam.mx", "site_section": "http://foro.fciencias.unam.mx/foro2/syndication.php", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "ForoCiencias - Todos los Foros", "title": "Smart shop rose prozac", "title_full": "Smart shop rose prozac", "published": "2017-12-07T11:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "MX", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1629, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ba5821814a313bfd4fc22a91e1103b929ea90adc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwhKmPvBJ1ssX4fBJyDV0m9Zo6l7gU1q9i.FfddpibIhEaw4l8TRWpbx4L8JCBYW0Q4TII8tjyoQA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "Smart shop rose prozac", "text": "I took this medicine for OCD.

But there are some interesting differences between the two motorcycles. Here's the top five things that separate the two machines from each other. and BMW G310R both use the same trellis frame but the Apache's bolt-on subframe is different Frame and BMW G310R both use trellis frames that are nearly identical. There is one major difference though, which is the different rear subframe on the Apache RR 310 which has been developed by TVS to suit its purpose as a sportsbike better. Also see: TVS Apache RR 310 walkaround video The engines on the Apache RR 310 and G310R are identical but TVS uses its own custom ECU for better responses ECU In terms of technology and hardware, the 313cc, liquid-cooled, reverse inclined single-cylinder engine powering the TVS Apache RR 310 is identical to the BMW G310R's, but TVS Motor has gone in for its own custom ECU to offer better engine and throttle responses, given its more aggressive positioning as compared to the G310R. The fully-faired Apache RR 310 is positioned as a sportbike, also meant for commuting and touring Purpose While the G310R is BMW Motorrad's smallest motorcycle yet, the Apache RR 310 is TVS Motor's largest motorcycle yet and also its new flagship product. That aside there is a big difference between their purposes too. The G310R is positioned as a naked motorcycle meant primarily for street riding and commuting, while the Apache RR 310 is a faired sportsbike intended to be ridden on track, apart from being used for commuting and touring as well. uses a six-speed gearbox with the same ratios as the BMW G310R, though the final drive on the Apache is different Gearing Both motorcycles use the same six-speed gearbox but the final drive on the Apache RR 310 is different from the G310R's. The Apache RR 310 uses a larger rear sprocket, with 41 teeth, as opposed to the 40 toothed one on the G310R to improve the motorcycle's initial grunt. A larger rear sprocket also means a lower top end, but that's where the aerodynamics of the Apache RR 310 come into play, as the TVS boasts a higher top speed. Also see: ride review Fairing The biggest visual differentiator between the Apache RR 310 and the G310R is the fairing on the TVS. The Apache RR 310 uses a full fairing given its positioning as a sportsbike, and TVS Motor claims the motorcycle has been tested extensively in a wind tunnel and on an air strip to offer best in class aerodynamics.

About BRIO \n\u201cIt\u2019s important to distinguish between entertainment and growth. For BRIO, toys are not about entertaining or pacify children . A successful toy is able to stimulate the child\u2019s imagination and be part of the child\u2019s growth through play \u2013 even at different ages. Take our famous Toddler Wobbler, for instance it can be used to help the child learn how to walk. When the child is a bit older, the child might use the wobbler to store different objects. And later in the child\u2019s development, it\u2019s used to transport other toys. It should be possible to use toys at different levels as the child grows. We think a lot about these things.\u201d ~ Daniel Mauritzson is a toy designer at BRIO One Winner will Receive: My First Take Along Set Light & Sound Firetruck \nOne lucky reader will receive these three fabulous toys from BRIO ! \nNow go and enter the giveaway and remember to come back for the daily entries.

It was absolutely unexpectedly to me as in spite of fatigue and moderate weight loss there were almost no changes in my health condition recently. But when my doctor enumerated all possible symptoms I understood that many apply to me. I had a blood test afterwards and it showed higher thyroid levels I have gone through the symptoms and many apply to me. I get tired very quickly, feel strong panic at times and my heart beat goes sky-high. In addition to all that I have chest pain and due to panic attacks and high heart rate can't fall asleep for hours sometimes. After a long consultation and many tests my doctor decided to put me on Carbimazole. He says this is the most effective drug he has applied for hyperthyroidism in his practice, it brings the thyroid gland back to normal functioning without creating additional problems. I started on Carbimazole immediately after the prescription and in a month the results were obvious - no more symptoms, perfect stamina and lots of energy, good temper and cool mind. And what is very important - no side effects! Carbimazole is a great drug when it comes to hyperthyroidism. I recommend it to others. Best Offers - Buy Methimazole (Carbimazole) Online And Save Up To 75% I am thirty years of age and I have been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism about five years ago. At that time I didn?t even know what the word means. And before the diagnosis I didn't know what was happening to me. It all looked as a weird bunch of symptoms that could be related to almost every disease in the world. Now I understand that the first symptom of hyperthyroidism was weight loss but when it started I paid no special attention to it. Weight loss is not a big problem if any. So I gradually lost about 50lbs but even that didn't warn me. Sometime after me heartbeat changed dramatically, it was racing and I couldn't cool it down. I was as if overthrilled, sweating nonstop and gradually developed panic attacks. When this condition got stable I had to call a doctor as because of general anxiety I couldn't even sleep at night. That was the first time when I heard about thyroid storm and was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. I started reading a lot about the condition and now I?m much better educated in that field. I take Carbimazole to bring my thyroid level to normal and this medication is very helpful. It allows me forget about panic attacks and many other symptoms by relieving my condition quickly and easily. The effect is pretty stable according to my health screenings. Hope one day I will be able to go on without meds at all. methimazole generic name price can i purchase methimazole canada buy methimazole online us methimazole purchase now visa usa generic methimazole for thyroid tree medicine walter thyroid generic and brand names canada thyroid treat thyroid ace vs there generic methimazole 5mg breaking brand methimazole ever wash methimazole herr price shoppers drug mart buy jump vidalta hong kong expat know methimazole coupon canada 2016 exactly vidalta brand substitution online circus methimazole fast delivery online tanks thyroid medicine hyperthyroidism from canada chinese methimazole streets tablet canada thyroid 5mg recovery kit purchasing knew thyroid cure thyroid in cancun shop priest methimazole guidelines We have full assortment of the most popular medicines, we work on different directions selling drugs of absolutely different types cheap serve vidalta 5mg europe cvs brand methimazole animal side effects colored methimazole 10mg 478 people who have side effects while taking methimazole from fda and social media buy carbimazole expecting leicester", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rachel griffiths", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:22.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f27f87ea3afcd143a4ec251ebe3af163215d07a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwhKmPvBJ1ssX4fBJyDV0m9Zo6l7gU1q9i.FfddpibIhEaw4l8TRWpbx4L8JCBYW0TsXz8_kFj2vA--", "site_full": "foro.fciencias.unam.mx", "site": "unam.mx", "site_section": "http://foro.fciencias.unam.mx/foro2/syndication.php", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "ForoCiencias - Todos los Foros", "title": "Generic Mentax Level, Shop Mentax 15mg Vs, Is Generic Meridam As Good As Brand Name", "title_full": "Generic Mentax Level, Shop Mentax 15mg Vs, Is Generic Meridam As Good As Brand Name", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "MX", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1629, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f27f87ea3afcd143a4ec251ebe3af163215d07a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwhKmPvBJ1ssX4fBJyDV0m9Zo6l7gU1q9i.FfddpibIhEaw4l8TRWpbx4L8JCBYW0TsXz8_kFj2vA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "Generic Mentax Level, Shop Mentax 15mg Vs, Is Generic Meridam As Good As Brand Name", "text": "Reputaci\u00f3n: 0 Generic Mentax Level, Shop Mentax 15mg Vs, Is Generic Meridam As Good As Brand Name Every care has been taken to provide accurate details on this web site, however minor discrepancies may appear.

She lives in Mount Pleasant South Carolina, but on a rather large piece of property that is surrounded by trees. She has a lot of wildlife that take advantage of her land, and they usually do not bother her. On a normal day she sees herds of deer, bunnies, birds of all types, and the occasional opossum. She enjoys watching them at times, what she didn\u2019t like was when she discovered that a raccoon was coming in through her kitchen. Pet doors can leave anyone open to this problem.\nMy friend had been noticing that things were missing, and that food was going at an alarming rate. She has a cat, the very reason that she has pet doors, and she has had her for a while. She knows how much that cat eats, and noticed that the food was getting eaten at almost twice the normal rate. Other things were happening that she could not explain. Finally, she saw that a raccoon had come in through her pet doors on her Mount Pleasant SC back porch and backdoor and was eating everything in her kitchen. The mystery was solved.\nShe decided then and there that she had to close up her pet doors. Having a raccoon coming in each night was not an option she wanted. Most Mount Pleasant South Carolina people would not. The problem was that now she had to worry about her cat getting in and out, and would now have to have a litter box, something that she had avoided up until that point. She quickly called someone to come board up the pet doors. For a few nights she heard the raccoon scratching at the door, but after a few days it moved on to somewhere else, much to her relief.\nIf you have the same problem with your pet doors, you may have to think about where they are, where you live, and how big the opening is. If you can help it, you only want something as big as your pet. That won\u2019t stop all other animals, but it can keep some of the larger ones from coming in for a late night snack.

Looks like he enjoyed it!\n\nSpy Trap \nAuthor \u2013 A.P. Martin\nPublisher \u2013 Createspace\nPages \u2013 318\nReleased \u2013 6th October 2017\nISBN-13 \u2013 978-1977833983\nFormat \u2013 ebook, paperback\nReviewer \u2013 Clive \nI received a free copy of this book\n \n\u2018There\u2019s a fellow who will soon have some rather important documents that we need to get back to Britain safely. How would you fancy the job of making sure he gets there with them?\u2019 Bill Blake is a spy at the end of his tether. He just wants to go home, wherever that is now. \nDespite his genuine reservations, he\u2019s forced to accept one final mission to earn his ticket back to Britain. However, what should have been a straightforward \u2018babysitting\u2019 job becomes much more difficult and dangerous with the rapid Fall of France and the effective surrounding of Switzerland by hostile Axis forces. \nBlake finds himself trapped in the neutral, but threatened Alpine Republic with an ex Naval Gunnery Officer who is in possession of plans and blueprints vital to Britain\u2019s ability to defend herself. An instant mutual antipathy between the two men complicates matters as they grapple with the frequent necessity to alter their escape plans, the ever present risk of betrayal and a relentless pursuit by German Military Intelligence. \nAdapted from little known true events, Spy Trap takes the reader on their epic struggle to deliver to Britain the ability to produce a weapon which would be vital to her survival and ultimate victory. \n\nI used to naively assume that in the war the Axis countries used weapons designed and made by Germany and Italy and that the Allies used weapons made in the UK and the USA. Then, from war novels I learned that both sides used the Oerlikon 20mm cannons but I did not fully understand why. Here AP Martin has not only explained how this situation arose but he has also built a thrilling fictional tale around the mystery of how the designs for that gun came to the UK.\nFollowing his first spy novel Codename Lazarus , the author has found another interesting but different angle on the war, this time setting his story in and around Switzerland which as we all know was neutral and yet, as we hear in this book, was far from uninvolved in the action.\nAP Martin has a gift for descriptive writing and he gives us plenty of detail whilst keeping the text easy to read. His writing style is in some ways old-fashioned with plenty of commas which I find really helps set the mood of the time and the class of characters that would have made up the undercover services in that era.\nI do not usually take much notice of e-book covers but someone has performed well in designing this simple yet striking red and white map of Europe.\nThe two main characters are believable and some of the fringe characters were also in Codename Lazarus which helps with continuity through the series. Like me you will probably sympathise with the character of Bill Blake and I hope that the author finds a new adventure for him shortly.\nIn summary, AP Martin has produced a worthy follow up to his debut novel and I for one will be eagerly awaiting the third in the series. I can give Spy Trap nothing less than five stars.\nReviewed by Clive \nAmazon.co.uk \u2013 Amazon.com \u2013 Amazon.ca \nI was born and spent my entire working life in the North West of England, where I taught at school, college and university levels. I became Head of Department of Social Sciences at a University, specialising in the study of social inequality, social mobility and sport. During my academic career I published many sociological studies on these themes.\nSince taking early retirement, I have really enjoyed immersing myself in reading and writing fiction.

Must have been doing this for 3 years or so. In January I took out a NUBA card from MBNA with a deal for 30 months interest free on purchases and balance transfers. I applied for this using MSE's credit card eligibility checker and all went well. In July I applied for another card - also from MBNA and also offering 30 months interest free. In September I started using it, but noticed a small interest charge on my October statement. My November statement now shows an interest charge of \u00a325. Strange I thought, as I pay off the minimum by direct debit - as I have done with so many other cards in the past. So I contact MBNA and find this... in the small print is a clause which states that whilst the card is interest free on purchases for 30 months - that only counts on purchases made within the first 3 months. I have both MBNA card contract booklets and acceptance letters and they are identical save for this very small detail. This second card with the new style of \"30 months interest free\" headline but actually only meaning on the first 3 months purchases was also made through the eligibility calculator. I've just gone through it again and it does not state anywhere the extra terms. Frankly, I feel stupid for not treble-checking the details - I'm normally financially savvy. However, in this instance the text is not obvious. I am raising a complaint with MBNA and will also contact MSE about their tool and this new type of catch. As I've never seen it mentioned before, just thought I'd share so others can check their card details. Thanks.
