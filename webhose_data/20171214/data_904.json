So, I am now a grumpy gamer refugee waiting for a new MMO to call home :)\nI understand there are millions of players who enjoy current WoW and I am genuinely happy for them.

The side furthest is the opposite. The longest side is the hypotenuse.\nBased on that, sin theta=opposite/hypotenuse and angle size can be calculated by inverse sine of that fraction. Entering inverse sine of a number bigger than 1 or smaller than -1 into the calculator will give a math error. You are almost certainly wrong at that point.\nCosine theta is adjacent over hypotenuse. Same points apply as with sine. Just use the adjacent side length at this point.\nTangent theta can have a theta of any value near enough. Multiples of 90 normally do not work (but 180 does). This is actually by opposite/adjacent. In other words, gradient. Inverse tangent of gradient gives you the value of theta.\nYou need to use some intuition when it seems confused.

The cryptocurrency\u2019s price, which has appreciated by more than 1,000 percent since the start of 2017, crossed the $12,000 mark last night, reaching a high of $12,795 at 11:02 UTC. At 13:53 UTC, the price of a single bitcoin was $12,670.67, an increase of 8.33% in the last 24 hours. (See also: If You Had Purchased $100 Of Bitcoin In 2011 .) Among the top 10 most-traded cryptocurrencies in the world, IOTA and Monero exchanged places but still continued their upward trajectory. IOTA, a cryptocurrency designed for Internet of Things (IoT) transactions, was trading at $4.73. That's up 54.75% in the last 24 hours at 14:04 UTC. Monero is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that was recently endorsed by anti-virus software pioneer John McAfee. It was trading at $307.57, an increase of 29.49% in the last 24 hours. (See also: 3 Obscure Cryptocurrencies To Watch .) The remaining cryptocurrencies in the top 10 most-traded list were on a downward slide, however. Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum, which had both registered increases, slid by 5.54% and 3.70%, respectively. On an overall basis, the market valuation for cryptocurrencies was $377.2 billion. A Tale Of Two Continents Bitcoin seems to be on track for $13,000 based on its rapid price movements and the surfeit of news regarding it. The Tokyo Financial Exchange Inc. is considering offering bitcoin futures trading services to clients. The financial institution counts some of the biggest names in investment banking, such as JPMorgan Inc. ( JPM ) and Barclays PLC, among its clients. The company\u2019s chief executive officer, Shozo Ohta, told journalists recently that it is waiting for passage of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act to \u201clist futures as quickly as possible.\u201d The Tokyo Financial Exchange plans to launch a working group to study bitcoin\u2019s impact on Japanese society in early 2018. Japan is the biggest market for cryptocurrencies and has taken the lead in legitimizing them in mainstream society. Other countries in Asia, such as South Korea and China, have also become important centers for bitcoin trading and mining. In an interview with Bloomberg, Jehan Wu, co-founder of Hong Kong-based Kenetic Capital, said Asia is more \u201cnimble\u201d compared to the West in adopting digital currencies. \u201cWe will see the first state-backed cryptocurrency in 2018, and I bet you that it will come from Asia,\u201d Wu said, while predicting a price target of $50,000 for bitcoin by the end of 2018. Western markets, however, are still debating bitcoin\u2019s utility within the finance ecosystem. Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at Yale University and former chief economist at Morgan Stanley, said the cryptocurrency is a \u201ctoxic concept for investors\u201d because its chart has a vertical pattern. \u201cThis is a dangerous speculative bubble by any shadow or stretch of the imagination,\u201d Roach said in a CNBC interview. But Jeff Sprecher, chief executive officer of Intercontinental Exchange Inc. \u2013 which owns the New York Stock Exchange \u2013 has a different assessment. At a Goldman Sachs conference yesterday, Sprecher said the exchange might be \u201cstupid\u201d for not being the first to offer bitcoin futures to its clients. Two exchanges in Chicago \u2013 the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board Options Exchange \u2013 are set to offer bitcoin futures trading to clients later this month. Sprecher hedged his comments by saying that he did not know what to make of cryptocurrencies and that it \u201cunwise\u201d to base the price of a futures product on bitcoin exchange indexes when so little is known about how they function.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rakesh sharma", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "john mcafee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sprecher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen roach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jehan wu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shozo ohta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff sprecher", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "intercontinental exchange inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago mercantile exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tokyo financial exchange inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jpmorgan inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenetic capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yale university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago board options exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tokyo financial exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morgan stanley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barclays plc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:23:11.041+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4cb26da441cf60bdcf40ca682f4c44031bc6a452", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhq6SKsx4lXFwV2cpxf1UI5jorip1NvAhd0X6J.1p25mkcy4pWindXAuDCKCABfGzoCg--", "site_full": "www.thestudentroom.co.uk", "site": "thestudentroom.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/forumdisplay.php?f=38", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Maths - The Student Room", "title": "Trigonometry Help", "title_full": "Trigonometry Help - The Student Room", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//static.thestudentroom.co.uk/5a252fde38287/forum/images/base/logo-facebook.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7797, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a370d02853993a81bf6d6e7b2aaf35daeeefe174", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhq6SKsx4lXFwV2cpxf1UI5jorip1NvAhd0X6J.1p25mkcy4pWindXAuAgm6wjYyfovLvYaYBGMCSS", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "physconomics", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Re: Trigonometry Help\n Draw out diagrams.

It is increasingly used as a soil agricultural fumigant which has led to the growing demand for chloropicrin agricultural fumigants for better crop production and reduced post-harvest losses. Also, the restricted use of fumigants such as methyl bromide due to the phasing out of this fumigant in several countries has further supported the growth of chloropicrin in the agricultural fumigants market. \nOne of the drivers for the growth of the fruits &vegetables segment is the increasing focus on the protection of fresh fruit from pest infestation during its export and import. Also, fumigation of such perishable produce is of prime importance to meet its increased demand, globally.

It's likely to be to do with 'credit offset'... j \nOne of the many frustrations of multiplex cinemas is the growing issue of lighting. That at a point where seats are getting comfier, sound systems are being upgraded, and screens are bigger than ever, frustrating basics have a habit of letting the side down. And one of those is cinemas choosing when to bring the lights up at the end of a film. \nI\u2019ve experienced this problem a lot at one of my two local multiplexes, with family movies. That even before the film has reached the end credits, the house lights are up, some 10 to 15 seconds before the actual end of the film (not even accounting for any mid- or end-credits shenanigans). \nThis, in theory, is presumably to accommodate those who don\u2019t want to sit through end credits, and with family movies in particular, just want to get their offspring home/to the toilet/in the car/whatever. Ideally without stumbling over things and people, and ideally being able to see and gather their belongings. I can thus understand, although don\u2019t like, that lights go up as soon as the credits start. But in the case of said local picture palace, the ethos occasionally is: why even wait for the end of the film? \nIt\u2019s a problem that many cinemas share. \nNotwithstanding the fact that it\u2019s not unreasonable for us to get at least some of the credits in darkness, we\u2019ve heard of a growing number of people frustrated with just how soon the lights come up. And this has been a point of discussion on the Kermode & Mayo Film Review programme \u2013 Wittertainment, to its mates \u2013 on Radio Five Alive. \nBut on last week\u2019s show (that you can find the link to here , but you need the podcast version), a correspondent had written in and explained more about the problem, and just where it lies. \nThe writer concerned, who went by the name of \u2018Concerned Cinema Lover\u2019, explained that he\u2019s one of a team of cinema managers at a multiplex, and that, unsurprisingly, there\u2019s no individual projectionist overseeing the correct screening of movies. Rather, that projectors are pre-programmed. That much most of us had long worked out. There are usually clues, after all. \nWhat was new, though, was the idea of \u2018credit offset\u2019. I\u2019d not heard this term before. \nThis was explained as \u201cbasically a time stamp that we punch into a computer system, which tells the projector when the lights need to go up\u201d. In a surprise to nobody, multiplexes don\u2019t even have a human being operating the light switch anymore. But let\u2019s move on. \n\u2018Concerned Cinema Lover\u2019 \u2013 let\u2019s call him Bernard \u2013 continued: \u201cIt is usually the job of one cinema in an entire chain to test the film and take note of the exact moment that the credits play. This cinema would then send out the time stamp to the rest of the chain. It\u2019s up to whichever manager who receives it to ensure their projectors are programmed accordingly\u201d. \nBasically: there\u2019s no guarantee that your local cinema has ever checked that the lights are going up at the right time. Some do, some don\u2019t. It\u2019s pot luck. \nThe job of establishing the \u2018credit offset\u2019 isn\u2019t a tricky one, but the explanation continued that not every cinema manager has the same love of film as the majority do, and thus mistakes creep in. Thus, if one manager of one multiplex somewhere in a chain knocks the timings out by ten seconds, that\u2019s likely to reflected across the entire network. A cheery thought, and very much at its worst it\u2019s copy and paste in a professional setting. \nI looked into \u2018credit offset\u2019 more, and landed at a very mechanical-sounding set of instructions from Deluxe Technicolor Digital Cinema, that handles distribution of digital films to picture houses in the US. The instructions seem keen to minimise human interference as much as possible. \nThey read: \n\u201cQ. What is the credit offset and run time? \nA1 - Check the label on the hard drive. \nA2 - This information can be located on the projectionist letter that was sent to you via email or on the Deluxe Technicolor Exhibitor Portal.\u201d \nFurther tips on the same page ask projectionists to check they\u2019ve got room on their server, to load the right version file and to check the file size of their \u2018content\u2019. \nExploring further, the problem of an incorrect credit offset is not a new one, and seems to have arrived as a by-product of films arriving in cinemas in hard drives rather than cans. There\u2019s a forum post at Film-Tech dating back to 2009 \u2013 here \u2013 where presumably a projectionist bemoans \u201cthe increasing number of incorrect studio credit offsets for digital movies\u201d, and instead asks for \u201cthose that have actually VERIFIED the FIRST credit offset, please post them here\u201d. \nThere does seem to be a degree of credit offset pot luck going on, too. The DCP (digital cinema package, aka secure hard drive) that Wind River was delivered in to US cinemas came with the following instructions\u2026 \nAs you can see, there\u2019s actually an allowance built in there for about two minutes of credits before the lights actually come up, still leaving nearly four minutes of end credits to follow. That at least seems to be a decent half-way house. \nThe only solace that Bernard could offer in his letter seems appropriate to pass on. And it\u2019s this: if the lights come up too early at your local multiplex, go and tell the staff. But don\u2019t just tell them: ask for the manager, explain that the lights came up too early, and the they might \u201cwant to check your credit offset\u201d. This, presumably, will convey that you know what you\u2019re talking about, and hopefully, will motivate said manager to go and fix the problem. \nWe can but hope\u2026", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bernard", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kermode & mayo film review", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:23:12.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "75b479600c6ab24058b06463bbb867fc7c09b6af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8d._58T0Ez63kYH0GQdWJmCmVkspYu1v5yCkC9UO3PX291LDMiQtrn1VIB8k2aFbuw7FEzaHgLDF_om6TmBHt4GqaX.kpemF9Xbwm5cpfX4W8plmBzuPeOIb1lVFg0bwVsbKB7Q.0BIzJj2F4w_3ic71ljLSLON.4FG8jG.h9JkQ9Izgi5PF47f2_V_cZS1nA-", "site_full": "www.bournemouthecho.co.uk", "site": "bournemouthecho.co.uk", "site_section": "http://m.bournemouthecho.co.uk/yoursay/letterstotheeditor/rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Bournemouth Echo | Letters to the Editor", "title": "Letter to the Editor: Give free short stops to Bournemouth Airport drop-offs", "title_full": "Letter to the Editor: Give free short stops to Bournemouth Airport drop-offs", "published": "2017-12-07T07:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/resources/images/7151054/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 39451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "75b479600c6ab24058b06463bbb867fc7c09b6af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8d._58T0Ez63kYH0GQdWJmCmVkspYu1v5yCkC9UO3PX291LDMiQtrn1VIB8k2aFbuw7FEzaHgLDF_om6TmBHt4GqaX.kpemF9Xbwm5cpfX4W8plmBzuPeOIb1lVFg0bwVsbKB7Q.0BIzJj2F4w_3ic71ljLSLON.4FG8jG.h9JkQ9Izgi5PF47f2_V_cZS1nA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T07:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "Letter to the Editor: Give free short stops to Bournemouth Airport drop-offs", "text": "11 comments \nSIR Peter Rigby is to take over Bournemouth Airport , saying he's looking to increase passenger numbers.

The congenial gathering of pilots, who had flown in from all around the state, also enjoyed a bountiful breakfast buffet at CJ Cannons. \n\u201cThis is a good central location here in Vero because we can pull in people from everywhere,\u201d said Larry Robinson, who flew up from the Willis Gliderport fly-in community west of Boynton Beach. \u201cAnd also, they treat us really well in the restaurant. It\u2019s a good group; a lot of us have known each other forever. It\u2019s a very tight community.\u201d \nRobinson, who is credited with arranging the groups\u2019 first Toys for Tots fly-in many years ago, added, \u201cWe try to do two of what we call socially redeeming functions.\u201d \n\u201cNext month we\u2019re going to Belle Glade to give rides to children and introduce them to the joys of aviation,\u201d said Vero Beach resident Carl Miller, a founding member of the Florida Cub Flyers. \nTheir two groups will join forces with the U.S. Experimental Aircraft Association for its Young Eagle program that day. Robinson said a fourth group, the OFFC, will also be involved, adding with a smile, \u201cIt stands for the Old Farts Flying Club; it\u2019s all a bunch of gray-haired people who fly.\u201d \nSaturday\u2019s impressive collection of Cubs and biplanes included a 1941 Stearman Open Cockpit, a pre-war plane used to train fighter pilots, and Miller\u2019s bright yellow Piper Cub 1941 J-3, another trainer aircraft. \n\u201cDonna and I have had that airplane almost 10 years,\u201d said Miller, crediting his wife for restoring the plane back to factory new. Their efforts were rewarded with the \u2018Best in Authenticity\u2019 Award at Piper Aircraft\u2019s recent 80th Anniversary Celebration. \nAlthough the two clubs are chapters of the Antique Airplane Association, some of the planes on Saturday were newer versions, including a new state-of-the-art Carbon Cub and a 2013 Legend Cub with Carbon Fiber Amphibious Floats.

It gives them all a means to show off their work, explain their processes and get feedback from artists and patrons. \n\u201cWe were looking for quality but also wanted to offer a lot of different kinds of art,\u201d said event co-chair Phil Reid, a new member of the club. \u201cWe have everything from hand-dyed clothing to woodwork and photography to pottery.\u201d \nA well-known portrait photographer, Reid opened his studio so shutterbugs could get a feel for what goes on behind the camera. \nIn Sebastian, the Working Art Studio presented the work of four artists: Margaret Goembel, assemblages; Elise Geary, abstracts; Andrea Lazar, animals; and Gail Fayerweather, oceanscapes and jewelry. \n\u201cWe\u2019re all very active members of the Vero Beach Art Club and believe in doing whatever we can to help the greater cultural community,\u201d said Goembel. \u201cThis is a woman\u2019s version of a man cave.\u201d \nPaulette Visceglia, a relative newcomer to the area, was thrilled to have an opportunity to share with visitors her studio and the art of painting on silk. \nJust down the road, Mark Kirby commented, \u201cAs an abstract artist it\u2019s good to get validation that what I\u2019m doing is good work. You put all this effort into it and you want to share it.\u201d \nDeborah Gooch, Kirby\u2019s sister and a popular contemporary artist, said she enjoyed the chance to interact with non-artists. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to see their reaction. I was lucky enough to grow up in a family that supported artists and the arts.\u201d \nMags Hobbs said her loose freestyle defies traditional labels, adding, \u201cThe subject matter and how it makes me feel is how I decide what to do. I don\u2019t follow just one.\u201d \nAnne Malsbary, current VBAC president, offered visitors a photographic journey from her own backyard to faraway places such as Tanzania and the Galapagos Islands. \u201cI\u2019ve shown my environmental images on the Art Trail before. This time I just want for people to see my work.\u201d \nMaster craftsman Al Gustave returned to the trail for the third time, displaying some of his finished pieces, including everything from intricately patterned wooden bowls to a rocking chair. \nEileen Farrell\u2019s home and studio are tributes to the vanishing art of stained glass, showcasing her lampshades, suncatchers and even a fireplace she converted into a showpiece by enclosing it with stained glass. \nAlicia Callander, whose garage was filled with hand-built, original pottery designs, served on the board during the time of the inaugural Art Trail and was instrumental in expanding participation to various artistic mediums. \nAs she traveled from studio to studio, Dorothy Chasewood commented, \u201cIt\u2019s not until you get into their studios that you see the variation in what they do. If you see artists in a gallery, you just see a glimpse. The Art Trail is a wonderful way to really see the full spectrum of what we have to offer in Vero Beach.\u201d \nProceeds support VBAC educational outreach programs through scholarships, programs and supplies. Next up is the 30th annual Art by the Sea, Jan. 19 thru 21 at the Vero Beach Museum of Art. \nFor more information, visit verobeachartclub.org.

Church still not quite ready Written by: Ray McNulty December 07 2017 \nThe new St. Paul\u2019s Church, currently nearing completion on Flamevine Lane, will not be ready for Christmas Day services and probably won\u2019t open its doors to worshipers until early 2018. \nSt. Paul\u2019s Rector Jon Robbins was planning to welcome congregants to the new sanctuary on Oct. 8, but delays in the final phases of construction \u2013 some caused by Hurricane Irma \u2013 forced him to push back the scheduled date of the first service to November. \nBut delays continue to plague the project, located just west of Ocean Drive in the Central Beach business district. \n\u201cWe are working hard to get the church open,\u201d Robbins wrote in a text to Vero Beach 32963 on Sunday night. \u201cWe hope to have a Certificate of Occupancy before Jan. 1.\u201d \nRobbins refused to comment on the latest delay, other than to say it had nothing to do with parking \u2013 a now-resolved issue that prevented the church from acquiring the initial permits it needed from the building division of the county\u2019s community development department. \n\u201cWe\u2019re complying in every way with the parking requirements outlined in the [county building] code,\u201d Robbins wrote. \nSo what obstacle is preventing the church from getting a final approval from the county? \nScott McAdam, a county building official, said he found nothing out of the ordinary in the project\u2019s paperwork. \n\u201cI don\u2019t see any red flags,\u201d McAdam said. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything in our records that shows any issues that would cause any delays in getting the CO. There\u2019s nothing here that points to any difficulties. It looks like things are moving along and construction is getting close to the end. \n\u201cI\u2019m not too familiar with the specifics of this particular project, so maybe there are some other issues I don\u2019t know about,\u201d he added. \u201cBut based on what I\u2019m seeing here, it looks like they\u2019re getting there.\u201d \nRobbins said work on the new church came to a halt as Hurricane Irma passed through the area in September, shutting down construction for more than a week. \n\u201cWhenever you have a storm like that, it puts pressure on your supply chain,\u201d Robbins said in September. \u201cIt also affect the subcontractors, who get offers to do work elsewhere at a higher rate. We\u2019re having some infrastructure issues, too.\u201d \nRobbins held a groundbreaking ceremony on the site in May 2016, after the church finally secured a shared-parking agreement with a neighboring business, the Amalgamated Realty Corporation. \nThe church has room for only 20 parking spaces on its property, but the agreement provides enough parking to accommodate its 150-seat sanctuary. The 6,500-square-foot, two-story building also will include administrative offices and classrooms on the second floor. \nSt. Paul\u2019s has \u201cjust over 100 members,\u201d Robbins said, but not all are regular church-goers. He said church leaders and members of the congregation are \u201csensitive\u201d to the concerns of their beach business district neighbors. \nThe St. Paul\u2019s ministry was established five years ago with Robbins as its rector \u2013 the Anglican Church\u2019s title for pastor \u2013 and held services in a conference room at the old Surf Club Hotel until it was torn down. \nThe church then moved its services to the Garden Club of Indian River County, where they are expected to remain until the new building is completed. \nSt. Paul\u2019s had been seeking a permanent home for more than a year when a donor stepped forward during the first half of 2014 and gave the church the $1 million it needed to purchase the then-vacant property at 969-999 Flamevine Lane.

Interspersed were student performers from the upcoming world premiere of Nutcracker on the Indian River, presenting a preview of a few of the creative costumes designed by Ballet Vero Beach\u2019s Travis Halsey. \nEven the delightful centerpieces played to the theme; six different designs by Ashley Dowdell and Marylou Robins featured the types of unique Indian River Lagoon flora and fauna characters which will be showcased in the ballet\u2019s second act. \n\u201cAt Ballet Vero Beach, our mission is to promote the art of dance as a universal language in our community and beyond. And we do that through performances by our residential company, our education and community outreach initiatives and performances by reputable national and international dance artists,\u201d said Adam Schnell, artistic director/CEO, in a short speech before the fashion show. \u201cNow what does that mean? That means we don\u2019t do anything the easy way.\u201d \nHe related that in a recent article, Miami City Ballet, an obviously much larger organization, said it was proud to have 12 students from their outreach program performing in their Nutcracker this year. \u201cWe have 24,\u201d said Schnell. \nThe 24 (12 Boys and Girls Club, eight Indian River Academy and four Youth Guidance) will be among the roughly 50 youngsters who will dance alongside 23 professionals in the production. \n\u201cWhen I was designing the program I wanted to make sure that it was not just for kids that were in dance class. I wanted to give the opportunity to kids that maybe had never been on stage before,\u201d said Schnell. \u201cCamilo (Ballet Master Camilo Rodriguez) and I have been rehearsing them since September and they\u2019ll get to be out there in front of the audience just like everyone else. And the production itself really represents a knitting together of all of our mission areas. We\u2019ve never been able to get the kids from the Ticket Donation Program on stage before and this production takes them from being passive audience members to active participants. I think that that\u2019s the transformation.\u201d \nAfter the show, patient little ones were kept busy with miniature golf and Christmas cookie decorating while waiting their turn for a visit with Santa as the adults indulged in gourmet desserts. \nNutcracker on the Indian River performances will take place 8 p.m. Dec. 29 and 2 p.m. Dec. 30 at the Vero Beach High School Performing Arts Center.

Matthews plays a classic sort of country music about as old-school as you\u2019re going to get, and that sometimes makes him an unconventional fit in Worcester\u2019s more rock-based music scene, and he seems light years from the glossed-up pop that seems to dominate country radio. If any of that concerns him, it doesn\u2019t show in the music. Matthews just does what he does, and on \u201cTruck Driving Man,\u201d it pays off.\nThe album begins with a pair of blue-collar honkytonks, \u201cTruck Driving Man\u201d and \u201cWorking Man Blues,\u201d a pair of songs that resound with a great deal of cheer, even as they never lose sight of the stakes of an honest living. The former song outright pays homage to Matthews\u2019 influences: \u201cGot Hank and Johnny, Willie and Waylon/Got me some good tunes /There\u2019s nothing better/to get me through my day/Than Webb, Lefty and George Jones.\u201d\nMatthews digs into both the joys and dignity of work, but his persona\u2019s purpose is driven by family and having mouths to feed, even as he admits that his willingness to work is sometimes a losing proposition: \u201cOvertime\u2019s the working man\u2019s drug/All we do is make the taxman rich./Don\u2019t need no politicians lies/Says he stands up for me/All awhile I know he\u2019s full of it.\u201d\nThe album hits its lightest note with the marital discord ballad, \u201cSeatbelts,\u201d where Matthews sings, \u201cI don\u2019t wear seatbelts so I can see Jesus /\u2019Cause I can\u2019t stand your complaining anymore.\u201d There\u2019s a certain degree of tongue-in-cheek humor in the song, which balances out against the more serious minded portrait of love evaporating, \u201cI\u2019m As Good.\u201d Throughout the album, Matthews is supported on bass and drums by producer Mike Harmon of the band Grain Thief, whose percussion on this song stands out, as does Bob Moon of Comanchero\u2019s guest guitar work.\nAfter the ode to whiskey and cigars \u201cLight \u2019Em Up,\u201d the album winds down with a triptych of songs that really touch on the soul of both Matthews\u2019 music and the genre itself. With \u201cThe Eagle,\u201d he explores the power of religious faith, and he imbues the song with a gravitas that\u2019s almost jarring, coming as it does on the heels of the lighter preceding song.

Stations covered specific topics including coyote biology, pet safety, coyote hazing and deterrent techniques, and coyote trapping and removal options. \nFWC biologists regularly conduct such outreach and education events specifically related to coyotes. Since January 2017, staff have conducted 30 events reaching over 1,600 residents, said FWC Senior Wildlife Assistance Biologist Catherine Kennedy. \nThe FWC regularly receives reports of coyote observations throughout Florida. Coyotes are found in all of Florida\u2019s 67 counties including several barrier islands. They are well-adapted to a variety of habitat types, whether rural or urbanized. \nSince Jan. 1, the FWC has documented 769 calls statewide related to coyotes. In Brevard, Melbourne has had the most with five reports, followed by Satellite Beach and Indian Harbour Beach with two each. Receiving one report in that period were Cape Canaveral, Indialantic, Palm Bay and Titusville. \nThe main concern of residents is pet safety as evidenced by numerous social media posts on NextDoor.com giving accounts of cats and small dogs attacked by coyotes in Satellite Beach and Indian Harbour Beach. \n\u201cCoyotes have not disappeared. They are still in the area. People are concerned about them but they are not going to go away. We need to learn to live with them,\u2019\u2019 said Indian Harbour Beach City Manager, who was faced with a flare-up of the coyote problem in Gleason Park about a year ago. \nTrapper Leo Cross of Merritt Island with Florida Wildlife Trappers and Rescue Inc. was able to trap a coyote in Gleason Park, which is not an easy feat. \n\u201cThey are difficult to trap because they can smell human scent on the traps. I leave mine out for months before I use them,\u2019\u2019 he said. \nSome of the coyotes seem to be migrating south in search of food \u2013 feral cat colonies \u2013 by traveling along the beaches. They also target sea turtle nests, Cross said. To reduce the risk of human-wildlife conflicts, experts suggest removing attractants such as pet food or unsecured garbage, not feeding wild animals, keeping cats indoors, and walking dogs on a short leash. \nIf a coyote approaches too closely there are ways you can use to deter it and frighten it away. Hazing the animal by making loud noises and acting aggressively or throwing sticks near (not at) it can be effective but must be continued or the coyote may return. \nCoyotes in the wild help maintain balanced ecosystems by controlling the populations of rodents and small predators, such as foxes, opossums and raccoons. previous post", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "george", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leo cross", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catherine kennedy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fwc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida wildlife trappers and rescue inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cross", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wildlife conservation commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "satellite beach civic center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harbour beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merritt island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indialantic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brevard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palm bay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gleason park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "titusville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cape canaveral", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:23:12.095+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "142827cc5d2b2f9aff7df918c4a2a57b6a76b9ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMvJ21ITpf90GVbQrrP_6eO8tWGRdhyN2Rd1Wp.g063EbFt0iamt6.OfFXMLrRjj1V.89ss9obSwAvQfk4D59ByY", "site_full": "veronews.com", "site": "veronews.com", "site_section": "http://veronews.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Vero News", "title": "Sun-sational! \u2018Annie\u2019 awesome as ever at Henegar", "title_full": "Sun-sational! \u2018Annie\u2019 awesome as ever at Henegar", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://veronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/annie-vb2.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "142827cc5d2b2f9aff7df918c4a2a57b6a76b9ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMvJ21ITpf90GVbQrrP_6eO8tWGRdhyN2Rd1Wp.g063EbFt0iamt6.OfFXMLrRjj1V.89ss9obSwAvQfk4D59ByY", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Pam Harbaugh", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Sun-sational! \u2018Annie\u2019 awesome as ever at Henegar", "text": "> Sun-sational! \u2018Annie\u2019 awesome as ever at Henegar Sun-sational! \u2018Annie\u2019 awesome as ever at Henegar Written by: Pam Harbaugh December 07 2017 \nOnce again, Melbourne\u2019s Henegar Center has imported some Vero talent for one of its big musicals. \u201cAnnie,\u201d that opened last weekend at the theater, is directed by Beth Shestak, a former instructor at Riverside Children\u2019s Theatre and cast member of Jon Putze\u2019s Theatre-Go-Round dinner theater troupe. \nThe show gets its musical direction from longtime Vero Beach choral director Ryan Kasten, who also conducts during the performances. \nAnd Vero Beach actor Rob Kenna, a native of Australia who plays guitar and sings around town, plays the billionaire Daddy Warbucks. \nBut it is a Melbourne Beach father and daughter for whom the sun has finally come out \u2013 in a manner of speaking, as Kenneth Hjorstberg and his 11-year-old daughter Katie share the spotlight at the same time, After playing in 13 shows together, the two finally appear on stage in the same scene. \nThe moment comes when Annie, played by Katie, runs away with her dog, Sandy. A policeman, played by Kenneth, finds Annie, confronts her and takes her back to Miss Hannigan. \n\u201cThe best thing is that we finally do a scene together with dialogue,\u201d Katie said. \u201cThat has never happened before.\u201d \nOf course, that is only one tiny moment in a show saturated with enough warmth and optimism to melt the coldest of hearts out there and even turn political adversaries into allies. \nAnd, with enduring songs like \u201cTomorrow,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the Hard Knock Life\u201d and \u201cEasy Street,\u201d it\u2019s pretty hard to believe that this year, \u201cAnnie\u201d turns 40. \nAfter having its pre-Broadway tryout in 1976 at Connecticut\u2019s storied Goodspeed Opera House, \u201cAnnie\u201d the musical opened on Broadway in 1977 and garnered seven Tonys, which was very remarkable at the time. Among the awards, it won Best Musical, Best Book (Thomas Meehan) and Best Original Score (Charles Strouse and Martin Chamin). Interestingly, the Annie in the tryout became the understudy for Andrea McArdle, who was nominated for a Tony. \nBased on Harold Gray\u2019s comic strip \u201cLittle Orphan Annie,\u201d the musical is set in the era of the Great Depression. It begins in 1933 at a girls\u2019 orphanage run by the brassy Miss Hannigan, played at the Henegar by Karen Monks of Cocoa Beach. An army of little girls help Annie \u201cescape\u201d the orphanage so she can find her parents. She eventually falls into the graces of kindly billionaire Oliver Warbucks, played by Vero Beach\u2019s Kenna. \nA plot twist or two later, she\u2019s singing \u201cTomorrow\u201d for Franklin D. Roosevelt, played by Terrence Girard of Palm Bay. We won\u2019t go further for fear that there must be some reader out there has never seen the musical. \nAnyone? \nIndeed, even 11-year-old Katie has seen the movie and the stage musical. Her father has not only seen the show, but was in a production of it about 25 years ago playing the same roles he\u2019s playing at the Henegar. \nThe cast\u2019s 20 orphans have been rehearsing since September. The same number of adults started rehearsing mid-October. \nAs with any musical, the rehearsals included not only learning lines and blocking, but also singing and dancing. Direction there came from music director/conductor Kasten and vocal director Sarah Germain. Leading them in the dancing was choreographer Amanda Cheyenne Manis. \n\u201cThe musicians are flawless,\u201d Katie said. \u201cThe crew is very helpful and is always there when you need them. The cast has been so loving and supportive. I couldn\u2019t be Annie without them.\u201d \nThose feelings are reciprocated, said director Shestak. \n\u201cKatie and her dad have been an absolute joy to work with,\u201d Shestak said. \u201cKatie has an unbelievable talent and it has been amazing to see her grow as a performer and simply shine on stage. She and her dad make a great team both on and off the stage.\u201d \nFor sure, it has taken a lot of time, but it did not disrupt the Hjortsberg household because, as Katie said, \u201ca performance schedule is a normal schedule for us.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s mainly late nights and sleepy mornings,\u201d Kenneth said. \nAnd being in \u201cAnnie\u201d is worth every sleepy morning for Katie. \n\u201cI love it because it is a story of hope filled with real emotion,\u201d she said. \u201cI think people will like this production. Everyone has worked so hard to tell the story. Plus, everyone loves a cute dog.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnnie\u201d runs through Dec. 17 at the Henegar Center, 625 E. New Haven Ave., Melbourne. Tickets are $26 general, $23 adults and military and $16 students. There is a $3 service fee per ticket.

Written by: Kathleen Sloan December 07 2017 \nThe Indian River County School District says it is making some progress in enrolling more minority students in upper level classes, but it has no idea how many are passing. \nThe School District recently released a yearly, state-required \u201cequity report\u201d that lists how many minority students are signing up for advanced classes. \nWhile the report shows a small increase in the number of blacks and a slightly higher jump in the number of Hispanics taking these classes, it provides no information on how they are doing. \nThe idea behind the report is to keep an eye on how \u201cequitable\u201d minority participation in advanced classes is compared to participation by white students as a way of seeing if the School District \u2013 which has labored under a federal desegregation order for decades \u2013 is helping minority students catch up in terms of educational success. \nBut the report does not include statistics for how well minority students are doing in the upper-level classes they sign up for, rendering it meaningless for measuring the progress or success of black and Hispanic students. \nThe School District\u2019s recently-released equity report states 25 percent of the county\u2019s white high school students took Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate classes, while just 7 percent of black students and 12 percent of Hispanic students enrolled in those courses. \nOn its face, the report indicates a degree of progress, showing black enrollment in upper level courses increased locally by 6 students \u2013 bringing the total enrolled to 63 of the 875 black students \u2013 and upped Hispanic enrollment by 40 students, bringing the total to 136 of the 1,128 Hispanic students. \nThat might not sound like a giant leap forward for minority students but it was good enough to help the local district gain recognition as \u201cone of 425 school districts on the Honor Roll for College Board\u2019s 6th Annual AP Honor Districts . . . for expanding access to AP courses, improving student performance and supporting student success.\u201d \nBy way of measuring success, state records show 50 percent of the students in Indian River County taking Advanced Placement Classes passed them, which is close to the statewide average. \nThe pass rate here for the International Baccalaureate exam was 75 percent, slightly lower than the statewide pass rate of 82 percent. \nBut the state statistics don\u2019t break down the success rate by race, and the School District says it doesn\u2019t know how many black or Hispanic students passed the upper level course either. \nWhen Vero Beach 32963 asked School District officials for the pass rate for white and minority students, the district said it does not keep track of those numbers. \nIf, as Superintendent Mark Rendell claims, preparing more minority students for college is an important goal, how can the goal be achieved if the School District is not keeping track of how well minority students are doing in college prep classes?

Omni Financial, one of the larger private employers in Indian River County, is suing a group of its former employees for allegedly stealing trade secrets and setting up a rival firm in violation of non-compete and non-disclosure contracts. \nBoth companies specialize in locating people and businesses with large IRS or state tax liens and helping them settle their debts. \nOmni Financial, which is owned by El Dorado Financial, filed a lawsuit Nov. 17 in the 19th Judicial Circuit alleging the former employees, including Omni\u2019s former president and CEO, took proprietary information and clients when they left the large firm to be part of a startup enterprise, ACS Financial. \nACS Financial and seven former El Dorado staff members are accused of breach of contract, tortious interference, civil conspiracy, breach of fiduciary duty, fraudulent inducement and negligent misrepresentation. \nEl Dorado is asking the court to stop ACS Financial from operating and award damages. \nWest Palm Beach attorney David Gobeo of Ford and Harrison LLP states in the complaint that the former Omni employees are using their training and El Dorado\u2019s institutional knowledge to ACS\u2019 financial advantage. ACS Financial misled customers to get them to switch firms, and improperly solicited clients using confidential information, according to the suit. \nEl Dorado Financial invested heavily in its human resources with one of the defendants earning more than $300,000 a year, Gobeo adds. \u201cThe individual defendants did not have experience in the tax relief industry prior to being trained by, and working for, El Dorado. \n\u201cIn fact, each individual defendant started at El Dorado in an entry level position making approximately $10 an hour.\u201d \nMatthew Mulligan started Omni Financial, located on 5th Avenue in Vero Beach, in 2002 after hiring a high-profile law firm and filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in an attempt to save a previous company that was drowning in tax debt. \nAccording to Omni Financial\u2019s website, the firm failed anyway, despite the high-priced lawyers, and Mulligan was personally saddled with more than $250,000 in IRS tax debt. \n\u201cTo put it simply, I was down and out,\u201d he writes online. \u201cThrough my own painful experience, I learned more about settling tax debts than most lawyers and CPAs will learn in a lifetime. Therefore, slowly but surely, I built a successful tax representation business.\u201d \nMulligan and his attorney declined to comment for this story. But, their legal complaint describes El Dorado\u2019s business model as follows: \nSales representatives contact people in need of assistance, negotiate a fee and then help establish payment plans, penalty abatements and other tax settlement opportunities. \u201cEl Dorado\u2019s employees are not simple telemarketers or salespeople, but instead have a deep understanding of when to contact the right potential customers and what to say,\u201d Gobeo writes. \nACS Financial filed Articles of Organization with the State of Florida in March 2017, according to El Dorado\u2019s lawsuit. The move coincided with a termination and several resignations at El Dorado from April through September. Andrew Russell, the company\u2019s onetime president and CEO, was among those who jumped ship. \nIt was then that remaining executives at El Dorado noticed many of its former employees were all headed to one place \u2013 a new competitor that had set up shop on 19th Street. \nA LinkedIn profile for Russell soon boasted about his top-brass position at ACS Financial, Gobeo writes in the complaint. The lawsuit further alleges the executive sold his shares of El Dorado\u2019s holdings back to the firm in bad faith as he prepared to leave the company. \n\u201cACS Financial and Russell are wrongfully and continuously taking El Dorado employees in order to learn El Dorado\u2019s processes because this is the only way to obtain El Dorado\u2019s knowledge without expending the same resources,\u201d Gobeo argues. \n\u201cDefendants have taken proprietary and confidential information and solicited active customers from El Dorado, and are using this information to unfairly compete.\u201d \nIncluded in the complaint is an affidavit taken from Isabella Caraballo. Caraballo left El Dorado to go to ACS for a larger salary earlier this year, but then returned to her original firm citing disagreements with her new supervisor. \nShe says in her sworn statement that ACS Financial has \u201cemulated El Dorado\u2019s business methods in a number of ways, including forms, letters and procedures.\u201d \nIn October, El Dorado sent notice to the defendants in the lawsuit reminding them of their contractual obligations. It did not work. Employees responded with a form letter asking for more information. Several claimed they had no access to any of El Dorado\u2019s proprietary knowledge. \nACS Financial and its representatives have 20 days from the service of the legal summons to respond to the court, but Chris Marshall, the CFO and a co-owner of ACS Financial, said last week he had yet to receive a summons in the case. \nThe New York native who has teamed up with Russell and others said he would not talk about something he hadn\u2019t read, and that he was busy building the new business. He referred all comments to the firm\u2019s attorney, Louis Vocelle Jr., with Vocelle & Berg in Vero Beach. \nVocelle called the charges against ACS Financial and its staff \u201cbaseless and unfounded.\u201d \n\u201cThey look forward to the opportunity to present the real facts which will disprove these spurious allegations,\u201d he said. previous post", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chris marshall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beth walton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el dorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louis vocelle jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vocelle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mulligan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew mulligan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew russell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david gobeo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gobeo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caraballo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isabella caraballo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "acs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "acs financial", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harrison llp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vocelle & berg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el dorado financial", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "omni", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el dorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "omni financial", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "19th judicial circuit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "indian river county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west palm beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "5th avenue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vero beach", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:23:12.102+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0db60558713e7bb54c811a870a2bdbe6fa4e07d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMvJ21ITpf90GVbQrrP_6eO8NvqSY2bo5UVKGyBcKwc9WPw1LHyXwbRrUPgNQ8z2jFYpFDcQ7nPBXw--", "site_full": "veronews.com", "site": "veronews.com", "site_section": "http://veronews.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Vero News", "title": "New town manager: I\u2019m a good fit here", "title_full": "New town manager: I\u2019m a good fit here", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0db60558713e7bb54c811a870a2bdbe6fa4e07d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMvJ21ITpf90GVbQrrP_6eO8NvqSY2bo5UVKGyBcKwc9WPw1LHyXwbRrUPgNQ8z2jFYpFDcQ7nPBXw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rusty Carter", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "New town manager: I\u2019m a good fit here", "text": "> New town manager: I\u2019m a good fit here New town manager: I\u2019m a good fit here Written by: Rusty Carter December 07 2017 \nBob Daniels doesn\u2019t exactly need his new job. He just likes the challenge. \nThe new town manager of Melbourne Beach settled into his office early last week. At about the same time he and his wife were settling into their new home. \n\u201cI just like the challenge of working in municipal government,\u201d Daniels said in an interview with the Melbourne Beachsider on his third day on the job. \nAlthough Daniels\u2019 career has been primarily rooted in police work, most of it in Florida, he also has the chops to run a local government. Initially hired as police chief in 2010, he spent nine months as interim town manager in North Bay Village, a small island community in Biscayne Bay northwest of Miami Beach. \nMost recently Daniels, 61, served as an investigator for the Insurance Fraud Division of the state\u2019s Department of Financial Services. He handled white-collar crime cases as well as drug cases involving opioid abuse. \nIt was in North Bay Village that Daniels got a taste of conflict. Then-Village Manager Frank Rollason fired Daniels, but made it clear there was no dereliction of duty. The two clashed on managerial styles. \nDaniels revealed that he was offered the option to resign, but allowed the termination to take place to protect his health benefits at group rates under the 1985 Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) law. \nThe irony is that North Bay Village later turned to Daniels to serve as interim manager. It gave him a chance to hone his managerial skills, helping negotiate a new labor contract, overseeing completion of a major sewer line and a beautification project, and improved communication within the government and the village\u2019s commissioners. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a constant learning process,\u201d Daniels said. \n\u201cYou critique yourself. And you learn from it. I don\u2019t have grandiose aspirations for myself.\u201d \nHigh on Daniels\u2019 to-do list in Melbourne Beach is stormwater maintenance. To no surprise, runoff has been identified as a leading contributor to pollution in Indian River Lagoon. Stormwater management, or lack of it, in the town, became a campaign issue in November\u2019s Melbourne Beach Town Commission election. \nIn fact, Daniels, noted, town commissioners were set to hold another workshop on the topic this past Wednesday with an engineer. \nHow Daniels got the job is its own story. Privately he was a clear favorite of a majority of the Melbourne Beach commissioners, and as a marathon late November meeting churned into its sixth hour, they publicly declared it was Daniels they wanted. \n\u201cLet\u2019s make a decision,\u201d Mayor Jim Simmons pushed his colleagues. \u201cWe have a strong town staff. We have a strong building department. Don\u2019t make the best hire for today, make the best hire for the future. I want someone who will find it hard to leave.\u201d \nLater that day, Mayor Jim Simmons had a contract sent to Daniels, and the $86,000 deal was completed within a few days. Daniels agreed to the contract without changes, according to Simmons. Simmons has said he wants to end the turnover experienced in the past so Melbourne Beach can move forward. \nHopefully, Daniels is the right leader at the right time to do that. \u201cI feel I\u2019m a good fit here,\u201d Daniels said. previous post", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rusty cart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim simmons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob daniels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simmons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frank rollason", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "insurance fraud division", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of financial services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne beach town commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "biscayne bay northwest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne beachsider", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north bay village", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indian river lagoon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:23:12.103+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b569697f258aaa01296a4f005c35021bbcc60f4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxqe3V_q9B5B1CcuL.N7KprwL5..zWzp7ArLyrvlM8o0zsRe4x4WiAGKs4MilmWhIOn.9MFwdWbrIs5_dPVSqMkY7Zxqrf4A8pb9WxD27vsoA--", "site_full": "fanpagefunblog.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://fanpagefunblog.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "FANPAGE.it FAN BLOG  a cura di Stefano Donno", "title": "Non ne poteva pi\u00f9 dei bulli che la facevano sentire \"brutta e perdente\"....", "title_full": "Non ne poteva pi\u00f9 dei bulli che la facevano sentire \"brutta e perdente\"....", "published": "2017-12-07T12:23:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IT", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b569697f258aaa01296a4f005c35021bbcc60f4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxqe3V_q9B5B1CcuL.N7KprwL5..zWzp7ArLyrvlM8o0zsRe4x4WiAGKs4MilmWhIOn.9MFwdWbrIs5_dPVSqMkY7Zxqrf4A8pb9WxD27vsoA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Over The Pop (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:23:00.000+02:00", "title": "Non ne poteva pi\u00f9 dei bulli che la facevano sentire \"brutta e perdente\"....", "text": "", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:23:12.104+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b2beda7caafb559612d59df0b56b4cd058f594b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9No5.D4cC34YyYmKWvVJHuf_ZoCrYOoBazpdxwYd3MDHS4hqZ6xxSB4tazoNP7cg1IdwTj9PcwIEzM.Jl7PKI8aRJfV3hxbVDgMwTD_tYNwHf95t9auRdk", "site_full": "www.denofgeek.com", "site": "denofgeek.com", "site_section": "http://www.denofgeek.com/taxonomy/term/6/all/feed", "site_categories": ["movies", "television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "No name", "title": "Dennis Muren interview: Terminator 2's VFX", "title_full": "Dennis Muren interview: Terminator 2's VFX", "published": "2017-12-06T17:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn-static.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeek/files/2017/12/dennis-muren-interview-main.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13926, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b2beda7caafb559612d59df0b56b4cd058f594b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9No5.D4cC34YyYmKWvVJHuf_ZoCrYOoBazpdxwYd3MDHS4hqZ6xxSB4tazoNP7cg1IdwTj9PcwIEzM.Jl7PKI8aRJfV3hxbVDgMwTD_tYNwHf95t9auRdk", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ryanlambie", "published": "2017-12-06T17:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "Dennis Muren interview: Terminator 2's VFX", "text": "Brad Fiedel interview: composing Terminator 2's iconic score \nFor the purpose of this interview, though, we\u2019re focusing on a landmark in CGI: 1991's Terminator 2: Judgment Day.

As Muren himself points out, while T2 also relied on the stunning practical effects work created by Stan Winston, the movie would have fallen apart had ILM not been able to deliver on its promise to create a shape-shifting assassin made from liquid metal. \nAs we now know, ILM pulled it off, earning Muren his eighth Oscar win and paving the way for other, similarly ambitious digital effects still to come. So with the newly restored, 3D edition of T2 out now on disc in the UK, here\u2019s our full interview with the great Dennis Muren. It\u2019s worth sticking around to hear what he thinks about the future of CGI in movies, too... \nThe quality of the film means you can't even tell how tight the schedule was behind the scenes. \nIt was very hard. The most expensive movie ever made at the time, and a very long schedule - I don't know what it was, but over a hundred days. But that's what it took to get Jim's vision on the screen, and just make sure that it happened. \nIt was so cutting-edge in terms of digital effects that you weren't even sure that they would work, I read. \nOh yeah, that's right, that's right. But I was pretty certain, because a lot of work had been done with reflective figures in computer graphics - that's a much simpler problem than having to put skin on something, you know, to make it look like an animal, a dinosaur or something like that. But the flexibility, making a walking character that looks like it's made out of mercury or chrome, and making it look like it has weight and actually in the shot is what was really extremely difficult. That's what was successful. And it took us a long time to do - we spent months and months on that show. I think it was 52 shots or something like that. \nI found a behind-the-scenes picture the other day of Robert Patrick on an LA street, just in box shorts. He has a felt pen grid drawn all over him. I'm guessing that was you capturing reference material for the CGI. \nRobert was good. He came up here - that's actually behind ILM in Orange County. He stripped down, we put a camera on the side of him, so in some shots he had a grid behind him. Steve Williams, the animator, studied that and discovered that he's got a little gait to him - he moves in a certain way that nobody else does. It was then that we started to realise how incredibly difficult it is to do a person. I don't think any of us quite knew that before - how one person is different from another. It's based on their weight and inertia - all sorts of things. But without that gait, it didn't look like Robert Patrick, and Steve really managed to follow it perfectly so that it looks just like it him. \nRobert was great, too. He said, make sure none of these photos get out, because it'll be very embarrassing! \nDo you remember which scene you would have tackled first, perhaps as a proof-of-concept? \nNo, I wish I could. There were so many different things we had to solve. It may have been close to that walking shot, you know - but I'm not really sure. I remember the last one, which is the last shot in the movie, which is looking down on all the [molten steel] and you see the [T-1000] face coming up. That was the last shot we did. \nAnd how close to principal photography was that? I understand you front-loaded quite a lot of the effects. \nNo, no. We didn't do any front-loading. We did tests, but based on story boards. I showed stuff to Jim all the time so that he could understand the concept. We showed him the wire frames. I did that all the way through the shoot so he could understand it and be comfortable with it. \nSo how far into post-production were you rendering these shots down? \nImmediately after we started shooting. They were great, because they put the effects shots right at the beginning of the schedule, so maybe the first shot we did was the storm drain, with the T-1000 walking out of the fire. That may have been close to the beginning of what we were doing. Then for the next two or three weeks we got a lot of work. We got the kitchen scene in the kid's house - we did that right at the beginning. So we had a good bunch of scenes we could go away with and start we working on our shots. \nI read there was talk of using practical effects as a fallback option - in case the CGI didn't hold up. \nOh yeah, they had to. And a lot of that stuff was Stan Winston - he had a whole group of people that did a lot of it. The robotic arm, the heads. Not when the [T-1000] is coming apart, but when it's wiggling around - all that was full-size stuff. But I don't think that they could have gotten much farther with that because it had never been done before with robotics. It probably would've been impossible to do. Everybody's working on the cutting edge. I really wanted to come up with shots that had never been seen before, that could never have been done any other way. That's what sort of knocked people out about it. That's what became more visible to everybody in Jurassic Park - that was the one where they all looked at it and said, \"Oh my god.\" But most of that stuff was going on in T2. \nWith T2 and Jurassic Park, do you think the reason those films hold up so well visually is because of the hybrid of practical and digital? \nWell, I think that's part of it. But I think it's because you've got some great directors, and a great team of effects people with all different skills, all wanting to do something that hadn't been done before, and not all film people. I mean, a lot of my crew hadn't worked on movies before; they were more computer science. They just needed help, a direction of where to go. And I can add the cinematic feel to those shots so they look right, and Jim came up with these phenomenal ideas. Steve in Jurassic Park - he took it to the next level. \nI think what's going on now is that people are copying what we did, so it's like a xerox of a xerox of a xerox. It's not real anymore, it's not the same anymore, and we've seen it before. I wish there was more originality, but it's very hard now to come up with something new. So many things have been done. \nWhat was the most difficult shot to achieve in T2? \nThere were many of them, but maybe that last shot in the film - where he's bubbling up and boiling. Turning inside out in the molten steel. That took weeks and weeks to render, and the resolution on it - we were trying to make it 2,000 lines across to be able to get the reality right there. I had to do a lot of that at less than 1,000, just to get the render done in time to be in the movie. Some of the frames went down to Silicon Graphics, some of them went to universities across the country, you know. We had connections with render farms here, render farms there, and then we could put all those frames together to get that shot. It was a nightmare, that one. \nI spoke to Stephanie Austin, the co-producer, and she said that every mainframe in California was used to render these, basically. \nYeah, for that shot. Most of the others were done well internally, and we bought a lot of equipment and stuff like that. But going back to what you were asking earlier: it's not like there was a backup if the CG failed. There really wasn't for that. If we hadn't made the CG work, or Stan hadn't made his stuff work, then Jim wouldn't have had a movie - and he knew that. Whereas with The Abyss, the film he made before, he could have cut that scene with the pseudopod out and nobody would have known the difference. He was taking a huge chance, we were taking a huge chance. \nSo that last shot, the movements going on in there are quite complex. So was there a special piece of software written to do that? \nThere was some, but the main skill with that stuff is really it being hand animated. We tried writing some special stuff for it, and for some other scenes, and sometimes it worked, but often we'd animate it key-frame by key-frame. The thing that a movie is, it only has to work one time, for one shot. A lot of the effort of writing software that can be used over and over can end up taking forever, so many, many times on the film, we just ended up having something be hand-animated. Steve was really good at that. \nThat might be something that people don't realise - the handmade aspect. When people think of digital effects, they sort of think of pressing buttons, or that it's somehow automatic. \nAbsolutely. Everywhere, every step of that. The original CG look for the chrome guy looked terrible. Jim said he wanted him to look absolutely perfect - clean and everything, and flexible and changing shape. And I just thought, no, you don't want that, because it's not going to look real. You never see that in real life - it's going to look like an effect. So I went in and muddied it up a little bit, so that the surface isn't 100 percent reflective. The light's scattering, it's a little dirty, so even looks reflective and perfectly clean, if you look at it closely, it's really not at all. That's what anchors it into the shot. \nYou see it a lot in movies, where CG doesn't look right, because they didn't understand the importance of all those things that go into making something real. \nIt is the details. One of the parts I love is the T-1000 in the helicopter, and you see as he gets in and says \"get out\", you can see the pilot's reflection in the T-1000. It strikes me that the reflection is something you could have avoided, but it sells the shot, a detail like that. \nYeah, well that was the plan. That was my idea. We were setting the shot up, and I said, Jim look at this - we can get this reflection in here of the pilot. He said, you're right, that's great, let's do it. And it was true all the way through - when the liquid is coming together in the steel mill, and it starts rising up and reforming, you can see all the sparks falling down reflected in it, behind the camera. All that stuff is the same thing - it ties it together, keeps everything looking real and more frightening. It's the detail, and we've been doing that detail stuff since the original Star Wars . The attention to detail is one of the things at ILM. \nAt ILM, from the late 70s to the late 80s, you went from computer-controlled cameras to full digital effects shots in less than a decade. When you look back on it, it's a very fast evolution. Have they evolved at a similarly fast pace since, do you think? \nOh no, not at all. It goes in spurts, where technology and artistry all come together. That was the introduction of computers for controlling motions, but what they're doing in car manufacturing with computers, that's gotten better and better. But the stuff that's going on with computer graphics, that kind of [peaked] sometime in the 90s. From then on, it's more incremental, so now we have computer-controlled motions, and being able to get people to feel more like they're walking without having to animate them. That's happening, but I think we're losing the feeling of it being made by people, you know? I think films always want to look like an efforts gone into everything you're seeing. The work the people are putting it. You can see it in acting and lighting and photography and editing - you can feel the people working to make this. If computer graphics ever get to the point where they look too much like you've pushed a button, then it's going to get very dull. You can sort of see that now in some places. \nThere's a lot of talk lately about all-CGI characters and the uncanny valley. Do you think that's something that CGI will overcome, in time? \nYou know, maybe, to some extent. But again, you can't push a button. The human being is so complicated that it's going to be really hard to get all that emotion and life into a CG character. Getting skin right is so complicated. At some point it will happen, but it won't be through button pushing - and if it is button pushing, it'll look very boring. The thing that people don't think about is, when you go to make a movie, when you do the live-action part of a movie, we're all trying to do something that hasn't been done before. The actors are trying it, the directors are trying it, the camera guy's trying to do it. I don't think you'll find any kind of computer program that's going to try to do something that hasn't been done before, unless you get into AI of some sort, and then who knows what the heck you're going to get? It's always going to be people pushing it, or you're going to get a copy of what you've seen before. \nWell yeah. And when you get into the realm of AI, you're getting into the realm of The Terminator, ironically! \n[Laughs] True! \nIt all goes full circle in the end!

Now, in 1949, we have deeper apprehensions but no more knowledge of the future. Yet if we confine our attention to American investment experience there is some comfort to be gleaned from the last half-century. Through all its vicissitudes and casualties, as earth-shaking as they were unforeseen, it remained true that sound investment principles produced generally sound results. We must act on the assumption that they will continue to do so.'\nBenjamin Graham, writing in the Introduction to 'The Intelligent Investor', first published in 1949. Click to expand... Would have been better to Quote: Fisher regarding the need to study the business and ignore the macro.\nFor instance, Fisher said that stocks are said to be risky due to war. However, if war were to break out where the US homeland are under threat of extinction, the world will go to heck anyway (Fisher put it better).\nBut as Basillio alluded to above, the world of America in the 50s and 60s aren't the world of today. American, hence Western, position in the world aren't the same where they were after total victory and dominance of the world after WW2.\nFor one, the sick man of Asia is fast rising. If current trajectory continues for another couple of decades, Western influence (forget about domination) of Asia, Africa is minimal to non-existence. Asian trades alone accounts for a fairly large chunk of world trade. Losing access and influence in that one region alone and it'll be pretty difficult to service them couple dozen trillions in debt.\nSo while Graham, Fisher, Buffett are right that the investor ought to focus on the business in making investment decisions, knowing the broad macro geopolitical and economic grand strategy does give insight into the overall direction of the world.\nIt help decides whether a sure bet is tinned cans, water, or Versace and JimmyChoo shoes. Also help the investor decide what companies, industry and what type of management can better cope with the coming changes.\nThat and it's a way to read history as we live it.", "highlightText": "",

Overwhelmed by Online Orders, Warns of Delivery Delays By: The Wall Street Journal 12.07.2017 The delays show that delivery networks such as UPS, which are critical components of the e-commerce boom, are still struggling to cope with the busiest shopping periods despite heavy investment to build out and automate their operations and capacity. \nFor the first time this year, UPS tried to manage the flow of packages by adding surcharges to deliveries during peak periods. \nThe week after Thanksgiving is the start of the delivery crunch, as carriers begin to process online orders placed during the holiday weekend and millions more packages pour in, starting the following Monday.

I've known \"Max\" since we worked together at a restaurant when I was in college. He was in his early 20s and had grown up in the town. He said he regretted not getting a bachelor's degree. As we became better friends and he saw the projects I was doing for my classes (I was an art major), he became inspired and started making plans to go to community college and then transfer. A year passed; then two. That never happened. (Not a big deal in itself, but I mention it as part of a pattern.)\nSix years ago, I graduated and got a job in New York. Max and I have stayed in touch, and he visits about once a year. He's still in the same town, working at a different restaurant. I don't say that judgmentally. I don't think there's anything wrong with it. The problem is that Max does. He's been talking about wanting to change his life for years now, but he takes no steps to do so. I've tried every approach I can think of. I did the supportive thing at first \u2014 building up his self-esteem, encouraging him to try therapy, helping him research schools, offering to help get him a restaurant job in New York, etc.\nAfter a couple of years, I realized he wouldn't act on any of this, so I stopped offering solutions and have just shown tough love. For example, when he complains about how none of his friends call to hang out, I tell him that he can't expect people to always be thinking of him. But nothing seems to get through to him.\nMax never asks about what's up in my life, and when I try to tell him, somehow he finds a way of bringing the conversation back to him. I'm starting to feel used and a little resentful, if you couldn't tell. I care about Max and think he's a good guy. But how can you help someone who doesn't really want to help himself? \u2014 Eeyore's Friend\nDear Eeyore's Friend: You can't. At this point, the kindest thing you can do for Max is to refuse to be his dumping ground any longer. Only after he's got nowhere to unload will he be forced to confront the weight of his problem. A therapist could most likely help him a great deal, and you can encourage him to seek counseling one more time \u2014 but disengage and take space after that. Your friendship with Max can only be healthy after he's purged that toxic mindset.\nDear Annie: I enjoy your column, and you have great advice. In the case of the \"bad\" milk, though, not so much. Spoiled milk tastes bad but doesn't make you sick. Sour cream, yogurt, cheese and other dairy products are made from spoiled milk.\nI have never thrown away milk. \"Bad\" milk makes the best pancakes, biscuits, banana bread, coffee cake, muffins and more. If I'm not able to use the spoiled milk right away, I freeze it in small containers for later use. I use it whenever a baking recipe calls for buttermilk. I couldn't bake without it! \u2014 Never Wasteful\nDear Never Wasteful: You make a great point that I failed to bring up. Milk can be used in baked goods after it's no longer good to drink. Waste not, want not.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dear annie", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name":

Game-Changing Deal on the Polish Retail Market - EPP Becomes the Leading Shopping Centre ...", "text": "Newsroom Multimedia Newsroom A Game-Changing Deal on the Polish Retail Market - EPP Becomes the Leading Shopping Centre Landlord with \u20ac692.1 Million Acquisition Print \nWARSAW, Poland -Wednesday, December 6th 2017 [ AETOS Wire ] \n( BUSINESS WIRE )-- JSE listed Echo Polska Properties (EPP) today announced the acquisition of 12 major shopping centres and retail parks (M1 portfolio) in three tranches over the next three years. The acquisition from a consortium (owned 25% by Redefine Properties), totals \u20ac692 million and forms part of a larger 28 property portfolio that has been acquired by the consortium. Upon completion of the transaction in mid-2020, EPP\u2019s portfolio will comprise at least 27 modern shopping centers comprising almost 1 million square metres GLA. \nThe M1 portfolio comprises 12 dominant retail properties with a total of 446,500 m\u00b2 GLA and over 620 stores situated in densely populated catchments which are complementary to EPP\u2019s existing assets: Eight M1 regional shopping centres with GLA ranging from 30,000 m\u00b2 to 55,000 m\u00b2 which attract more than 40 million annual visitors, and Four retail power parks with GLA ranging from 20,000 m\u00b2 to 35,000 m\u00b2. \nAll the properties are single level and fully leased, grocery anchored and are situated on large motorway fronting sites which total over 195 hectares. All of the centres are anchored by Auchan Hypermarkets as well as a variety of international and domestic brands such as MediaMarkt and fashion retailers, TK Maxx, H&M and C&A. The average rental rate across the portfolio is a low \u20ac9.10 per m\u00b2 per month and the average rent to sales ratio is below 9%. The entire portfolio is subject to a master lease from Metro AG which expires in April 2024. \n\u201cThis deal is based on a 'up to 30 minute drive time' measurement, which will treble our portfolio catchment to 34% of Poland's total population, increasing to 39% after M\u0142ociny in Warsaw is opened,\u201d says Dean. The transaction will also boost EPP\u2019s annual portfolio footfall 61% from 76 million to 122 million. \u201cThese stats speak to EPP becoming a derivative of Poland's burgeoning consumer market.\u201d \nDean said that EPP as well as the consortium are happy to enjoy the benefits of the income from Metro AG\u2019s head lease until 2024. Auchan acquired from Metro the \u2018Real\u2019 supermarket business in Poland in 2014 and the 28 properties that will now be owned by the consortium and EPP represent approximately 35% of the number of stores that Auchan have in Poland. The properties being acquired by EPP have significant extension opportunities and also have asset management initiatives as the line shops are on average paying below market rentals. The entire portfolio was secured at a yield of 7,1%. The transaction will be closed in 3 tranches: Tranche 1 (January 2018) \u20ac358.7 million GAV comprising M1 Czelad\u017a, M1 Krak\u00f3w, M1 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and M1 Zabrze totalling collectively 194,400 m\u00b2 GLA and NOI of \u20ac25.1 million. Tranche 2 (June 2019) \u20ac222.5 million GAV comprising M1 Bytom, M1 Czestochowa, M1 Radom, PP Kielce, PP Olsztyn and PP Opole collectively 184,000 m\u00b2 GLA and NOI of \u20ac16.3 million Tranche 3 (June 2020) \u20ac110.9 million GAV comprising M1 Poznan and PP Tychy collectively 68,100 m\u00b2 and NOI of \u20ac7.6 million. \nTranche 1 is being financed by way of 62% debt and the redeployment of some of the capital to be received on the sale of the offices previously announced, as well as the subscription by funds managed by Oaktree and LVS II Luxembourg II S.\u00e0 r.l for \u20ac112.5 million of EPP shares at \u20ac1.27 per share. As a result there will be no need for EPP to raise capital from the market. This direct investment in EPP by LVS II Luxembourg II S.\u00e0 r.l and funds managed by Oaktree reflects their confidence in our platform. Redefine\u2019s holding in EPP will reduce to +/- 35% but Redefine have undertaken to invest a further \u20ac40 million for future acquisitions in order to restore their holding to circa 40%. \nOn completion of the first tranche the return on equity pre-tax and transaction cost will be 13,5%. In the short term the acquisition results in a small increase in EPP\u2019s LTV from 51% to 54% but this is being addressed and the company is committed in the medium term to reducing the LTV to below 50%. \nHadley Dean concludes \u201cthis acquisition fits perfectly with our strategy. The M1 portfolio has substantial expansion opportunities which we will develop over time and which will serve to further grow the NOI and strengthen each property\u2019s competitive position\u201d. \nEPP\u2019s advisor in the deal was Dentons law office. \n(End) \nEPP (Echo Polska Properties) is a Dutch dual listed real estate investment company that follows the REIT formula, investing in retail properties throughout Poland. With a current portfolio that includes 14 retail projects, 6 offices, and two retail development sites in Warsaw, our initial portfolio is highly diversified.
