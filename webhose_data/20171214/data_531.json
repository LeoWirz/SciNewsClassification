Highlight from our show on Johnson Amendment repeal proposal : The proposed repeal of the tax law that prevents religious leaders from making political endorsements from the pulpit could also open up the electioneering floodgates for charities. \u201cThey would all now be permitted under the House tax bill to engage in this kind of political electioneering,\u201d Mark Silk, a religion professor at Trinity College, told host Tom Ashbrook in an On Point interview Wednesday. Full show: Tax Plan Could Mean Politics At The Pulpit Much of the attention surrounding the House proposal to repeal the so-called Johnson Amendment has centered on the effect it could have on churches, synagogues and mosques \u2013 stoking concerns that pulpits would turn into soapboxes and community meeting places would turn into political rallies. Amanda Tyler of the Baptist Joint Committee told Tom that the Johnson Amendment repeal would \u201ctear at the heart\u201d of religious communities and change the very character of houses of worship; Daniel Blomberg of Becket Fund for Religious Liberty said the Johnson Amendment should go away because it\u2019s a downright assault on First Amendment rights. But beyond houses of worship, it could mean major changes for all 501(c)(3) charitable organizations, even secular ones \u2014 the Clinton Foundation and the Trump Foundation (now being wound down) are both 501(c)(3) groups, as is the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army. They don\u2019t pay corporate income taxes, and people who make donations to 501(c)(3) groups can deduct them from their own taxes. The Johnson Amendment right now bars 501(c)(3) organizations \u2013 from the corner church to the Clinton Foundation \u2013 from \u201cdirectly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office.\u201d Under the House tax proposal, however, churches, charities and foundations would be able to keep that tax-exempt status, even if they\u2019re directly supporting and endorsing candidates. The original House proposal, Silk said, was narrowly tailored to just the religious sphere, allowing more political speech in sermons, homilies and religious teachings. But the bill was amended in committee and allows every 501(c)(3) to maintain its tax status as long as the political speech was part of its \"ordinary course of business.\" It has some people in the nonprofit and religious communities, like the Baptist Joint Committee\u2019s Tyler, concerned. \u201cWe're really worried that changing the law in this way would open the floodgates for political contributions to be funneled through all 501(c)(3) organizations, fundamentally changing the nature of houses of worship and indeed our entire nonprofit sector,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAnd that's why the vast majority of religious and denominational organizations secular nonprofits from across the board and across the country have raised their voices to ask Congress to keep the current law and not change it in this very troubling way.\u201d The Senate version of the GOP\u2019s tax plan does not repeal the Johnson Amendment, but President Trump has vowed to get rid of it entirely.

It was only a matter of days before the airports reopened but the negative impact on international visitors to those two destinations has lasted for weeks. The analysis has come from ForwardKeys, the company which helps forecast future travel by analysing around 17 million flight booking transactions a day. \nIn the case of Houston, international arrivals fell 56.9% during the hurricane impact period (25-31 August) and it was six weeks until visitor arrivals returned to pre-hurricane levels. In the case of Miami, international arrivals fell 36.7% during the hurricane impact period (7-17 September) and it was nine weeks until visitor arrivals returned to pre-hurricane levels. \nThe negative impact on their respective states, Texas and Florida was similar but not quite so pronounced, with international arrivals during the hurricane impact period down 23.4% in Texas and down 31.9% in Florida. Looking at the ten-week period following the hurricanes, both Houston and Miami suffered a double-digit decline in international visitors, with Houston down 11.6% and Miami 12.8%. \nIn Texas, Dallas and Austin actually benefited when Houston limited its airport operations. During the hurricane impact period, international arrivals in Dallas jumped 13.3 % and in Austin 23.1%. However, in the aftermath, travel to all three Texas airports has fallen below pre-hurricane levels. \nOlivier Jager, CEO, Forward Keys, said: \u201cOne would not expect the travel disruption caused by even a very bad storm, to a major first-world city, to last more than a few days. So, when you see the impact of these hurricanes on international visitor arrivals, enduring for several weeks, it underlines the severity of the damage they caused.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olivier jager", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:53:40.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1c8e786f51a46ffa2d5a8793825ba9eb89cc3f32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3LkTccX4DqkDigIG_fugw0tp16EzD3L3nxBE6u_DDmmbg--", "site_full": "en.portnews.ru", "site": "portnews.ru", "site_section": "http://en.portnews.ru/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "PortNews IAA", "title": "Coal transshipment facilities to be shifted from the center", "title_full": "Coal transshipment facilities to be shifted from the center", "published": "2017-12-07T06:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "RU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://en.portnews.ru/img/pn_logo_200.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1c8e786f51a46ffa2d5a8793825ba9eb89cc3f32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3LkTccX4DqkDigIG_fugw0tp16EzD3L3nxBE6u_DDmmbg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "en.portnews.ru", "published": "2017-12-07T06:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "Coal transshipment facilities to be shifted from the center", "text": "Coal transshipment facilities to be shifted from the center of Murmansk to the western coast of the Kola Bay In the future, coal transshipment facilities at the port of Murmansk should be shifted to the western coast of the Kola Bay, IAA PortNews correspondent cites Murmansk Region Governor Marina Kovtun , as saying at the 11 th International Forum and Exhibition \u201cTransport Week\u201d held in Moscow.\n\u201cCoal handling being performed practically in the city center gives rise to just criticism from the citizens.

Then the one thing that keeps me thinking, why the cliffhanger ending for Rogue? According to \u201cyour\u201d diary, the Analyst (you) says they\u2019re considering joining the Templars.\nMeanwhile we have another \u201cyou\u201d playing the Helix console/cloud system who\u2019s then asked to help the Assassins in Unity and Syndicate. Difference is you\u2019re never really there so you observe the present day assassins through cameras and drones. Then that\u2019s all we\u2019re left with as we now have Layla, our new \u201cDesmond\u201d for the series. This is where my hopes lie, and hear me out.\nA new Assassin\u2019s Creed title with two stories, you make a character and then decide if that character is the Analyst or the Initiate and play through the game as \u201cyourself\u201d. Or maybe you make two characters and play as the Initiate because it\u2019s the assassins are the protagonists 9 times outta 10 (kinda like Hawke in Dragon Age Inquisition).

We present the first study addressing molecular effects of fractional non-sequential ultrapulsed CO 2 laser treatment using a 3D skin model that allows standardized investigations of time-dependent molecular changes ex vivo. While histological examination was performed to assess morphological changes, we utilized gene expression profiling using microarray and qRT-PCR analyses to identify molecular effects of laser treatment. Irradiated models exhibited dose-dependent morphological changes resulting in an almost complete recovery of the epidermis 5 days after irradiation. On day 5 after laser injury with a laser fluence of 100 mJ/cm 2 , gene array analysis identified an upregulation of genes associated with tissue remodeling and wound healing (e.g., COL12A1 and FGF7), genes that are involved in the immune response (e.g., CXCL12 and CCL8) as well as members of the heat shock protein family (e.g., HSPB3). On the other hand, we detected a downregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g., MMP3), differentiation markers (e.g., LOR and S100A7), and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1\u03b1.\nOverall, our findings substantiate the understanding of time-dependent molecular changes after CO 2 laser treatment. The utilized 3D skin model system proved to be a reliable, accurate, and reproducible tool to explore the effects of various laser settings both on skin morphology and gene expression during wound healing.\n\n\nfrom #MedicinebyAlexandrosSfakianakis via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2AzlrSw\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "co", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:53:40.065+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "45cc71569165bbef0d965632a185aefcde9bc28e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSX66fZOWxt.Y538NTwyHgQ_J7eCIRfTrLefK46JPGSLer74KkDb2WU0UDik89ySGT.MKzKppE3h8zr7q1SjZg4Eo9DAaK3Wna", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Assassin's Creed", "title": "The Analyst and the Initiate", "title_full": "The Analyst and the Initiate : assassinscreed", "published": "2017-12-07T08:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.043, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "96b751c9a5e90f64b523220f347704195cdd0337", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSX66fZOWxt.Y538NTwyHgQ_J7eCIRfTrLefK46JPGSLer74KkDb2WU0UDik89ySGT.MKzKppE3h8zr7q1SjZg4Aw.JJZXvghEOcjhfRgHYqxzRqqWIimOsg--", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "wiggiwoo", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "They need to stick with one character like Layla and actually make a good story", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:53:41.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d085e2771732433cbbb8b42a517020edc97debc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwo4X.YTWHFRLhVApIUoHz4-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5d085e2771732433cbbb8b42a517020edc97debc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwo4X.YTWHFRLhVApIUoHz4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "res = res + proba[2][1] + proba[1][1] -

I can say the same about every band we play on KLUB Classic Rock 106.9. How well do you know your bands? \nKelly Hansen, Foreigner\u2019s front man goes out on the street to see how well people know the band\u2019s iconic songs.

My son is verbal,followed normal education with help from me, his issues : shyness, constipation, concentration problems, problems with maturity, practically no friends because interaction with people is difficult, parasite, yeast on him, acne, kind of dandruff on top of his head. Since the age of 8, we have been trying a lot of natural supplements, hospitals med and i have wasted a lot of money trying to make him became a man and live freely without being intimidated by friends in the neighbor hood also to get him better and more focused for school matters and his general health. Nothing ever seems to pull through not until one day, i decided to share his situation to a very close friend of mine who claims there is an herbal man who cured her 12 years old son called Baba Alika and has also helped a lot of women to cure their children's Autism. quickly i contacted his email: babaalikahealinghome@gmail.com been giving to me by miss Ava, just to give him a test, i spoke to him he asked me to purchase his Autism roots herbs and seed oil which i did, he promised to send it as soon as purchased and thereafter i received it and start to use the Autism herbal med immediately on him for only 7 days instructed by Baba Alika. it was unbelievable after 21 days i was my son totally cured and free from Autism disgrace and embarrassment.

We will attempt to answer these questions\u2026 \n\u2022 Why should we want to please God? \n\u2022 How can I stir up a passion in me to make pleasing God a priority? \n\u2022 How can I influence others to want to please God? \nWe will begin by identifying things that displease God and then spend the rest of the time discussing how we can please Him. \nI. THINGS THAT DISPLEASE GOD - PROVERBS 6:16-19 \nA. These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him: \n1. A proud look, \n2. A lying tongue, and \n3. Hands that shed innocent blood, \n4. An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, \n5. Feet that be swift in running to mischief, \n6. A false witness that speaketh lies, and \n7. He that soweth discord among brethren. \nB. If we know something displeases the Lord then we should be disciplined enough to refrain from it. \nII. HOW DO I PLEASE GOD? \nA. Learn the Bible (Read it, Study it, Have Conversations around it) \n1. The Bible will teach you everything you need to know about what pleases our Heavenly Father. \n2. Allow Holy Spirit to teach you by being sensitive to His leading and revelations concerning the study of the Scriptures \n9. Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word. \n10. With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments. \n11. Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. \n12. Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes. \nB. Obey God\u2019s Commandments - Do what the Bible says! \n1. Proverbs 7:2 - Keep my commandments, and live; and my law (teachings) as the apple of thine eye. \n2. John 14:21 NIV - Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them.\u201d \n3. John 15:10 tells us if we keep God\u2019s commandments that we will abide in His love! (What a promise) \nC. Have a Heart for Missions (at home and abroad) - Especially Israel \n1. This is a great place to talk about the community outreaches the your church is involved in\u2026 (Feeding the Hungry, Human Trafficking Awareness, Raising our Culture through Community Interaction, LLP, etc.) \n2. Foreign Missions - The Caribbean, Supporting Frontline Outreaches \n3. Israel - God\u2019s Word is very adamant about those who Bless Israel \nGenesis 12:1-3 \n1. The LORD had said to Abram, \"Go from your country, your people and your father's household to the land I will show you. \n2. \"I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. \n3. I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.\" \n6.

But people with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome are not occasional pot users, Mostofi said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about people who use it two, three, four times a day \u2014 every day \u2014 over a period of months or years,\u201d he said.\nDr. Mark Neavyn, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester, said his department has seen only five to 10 cases in the last year or two. But if recreational use of marijuana becomes more common, that could change, Neavyn said.\n\u201cIf you expose a population to something, there will be more people at risk of developing a substance use disorder,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we saw a lot more cases, it would burden emergency departments.\u201d\nThe syndrome tends to result in multiple hospital visits, partly because it often goes undiagnosed by doctors who don\u2019t know it exists.\n\u201cThis is a syndrome we\u2019re just now beginning to understand,\u201d said Dr. Aimee Moulin, an ER doc who sees about one person every other shift at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, Calif.\nAnti-nausea medications such as Zofran typically don\u2019t work, Moulin said, so doctors often use an anti-psychotic such as Haldol because it reduces nausea while also addressing the underlying causes of the syndrome.\n\u201cIf you really want this illness to go away, though, what you need to do is stop using marijuana,\u201d Moulin said. \u201cAnd that can be such a loaded conversation because patients sometimes don\u2019t want to talk about their marijuana use. ... People aren\u2019t fully aware of the potential side effects and consequences.\u201d\nBoth medical and recreational marijuana are legal in California. And Moulin expects the number of patients she sees with the syndrome to increase once commercial sales begin there next month.\nJim Borghesani of the pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project, called cases of the illness \u201cquite rare\u201d and questioned if any increased reports of it could be due to better reporting in the era of legalized pot.\n\u201cWe thought it\u2019s something to be concerned about, and we think that safe, tested marijuana would help,\u201d Borghesani said. \u201cAnd further funding for education that will be generated from taxes will be helpful in situations like this.\u201d\nLittle data exists on the syndrome. One study tried to determine if cases of cyclic vomiting, including through cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, increased after Colorado legalized medical marijuana in 2009. But the study wasn\u2019t conclusive, noting that while cases of cyclic vomiting nearly doubled and patients were more likely to acknowledge using marijuana, it wasn\u2019t clear whether that was secondary to increased use, more accurate reporting on weed or both.\nWhat ails smokers...\nCannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS), or what is being called \u201cscromiting,\u201d is caused by heavy pot smoking where the user suddenly screams while vomiting. Here\u2019s what is known:\nSIGNS OF ILLNESS\n Nausea and violent vomiting Abdominal pain Dehydration Relief sought via frequent hot bathing HISTORY\n CHS was first described in 2004 Patients are typically young adults with a long history of pot use Users who became ill smoked pot three to five times per day\nLENGTH OF ILLNESS\n Typically 24\u201348 hours, but the risk for relapse is high\nCURE?\n There is no cure other than to quit smoking pot\nSOURCE: National Center for Biotechnology Information", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marie szaniszlo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "matt stout", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neavyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moulin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew mostofi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark neavyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "borghesani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim borghesani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aimee moulin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicolaus czarnecki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mostofi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "umass memorial medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tufts medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national center for biotechnology information", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicolaus czarnecki the tufts medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uc davis medical center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bay state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sacramento", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "worcester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:53:43.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2ac4c4b0e9104a4aff98ceb28b82c51b1342a0a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhq86ombsALCn92lRjJqr0urvrjpcrWdnRuiJo1PYuDhhij8yVkFG1.0js_4_xRNF08j_YZgNxZRKoky5qt6EwXSKE4ocZMxxEwtMkKY6FMpQO1HtO0snUHR.GnNXRCp6it2DOT6qPV1gE", "site_full": "www.thestockobserver.com", "site": "thestockobserver.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Southport Management L.L.C.
