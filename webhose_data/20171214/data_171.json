He is our peace giver, life changer, joy river, way maker. Live every day with the knowledge of He is always with us. \nIn the story of the three Jews, Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego, God proved Himself through out their affliction. When King Nebuchadnezzar threatened them with the burning furnace, the reply they gave the King trips me everytime. \"If our God Whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace. He will deliver us out of your hand, O King. But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your god's or worship the golden image which you have set up! Daniel 3:17-18. \nDo you see the exclamation mark after they finished speaking? O wow, such confidence and it came from the knowledge of knowing their God. You know the rest of the story, they met death, they still spoke boldly about the Father in heaven, I'm sure they felt fear but they spoke confidence.\nIt made me remember when I fell down when I had the stroke, I knew that nothing will happen to me, every when they told us I had an infection in my heart because something happened to something bla bla I was not still afraid, you know when you feel someone is with you even though you don't see the person like you are unconscious, yes that's was me even when I was unconscious. I was messed up, couldn't think, couldn't talk or move still believing, I knew I was not alone, I knew that God is not even finished with me yet, for Christ's sake I just started my Christian blog, He is still changing my behavior, I will still stand on a podium in the midst of thousands speaking about Him that's why He is changing my behavior and besides His word says He will never leave me nor forsake me. I came out of the treatment for my heart successfully, it took about maybe 3 months but when I went to the cardio after the drugs that made me skinny by the way loool,  there was no sign of it anymore, my heart was free. Like the 3 jews, I said to the devil \"I'm not afraid of you, the God that I serve will deliver me from your filthy hands, He is not done with me, so 'BACK OFF, LET ME SEE FRONT'. \nGod does not fail, I've never heard that in this situation He failed. Even though the 3 jews died in the fire they would gone to heaven to collect their crown and their mansion and even if I had died the same thing would have happened to me, I will see lovely angels directing me to my mansion but do you know why God did not allow death to the jews and I?  Because of the purpose He has written in His for us, the King and the people of Babylon believed in God immediately the 3 jews stepped out of the fire. And people that saw me helpless believe God when they see me now and God is still on me so in no time when you see me later, the belief in God will increase.\nThat saying that God uses our life story to draw people to Him, I've never believed it more. \nLord thank You for using my life story for Your purpose. \nGod loves you no matter what.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abednego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nebuchadnezzar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meshach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "god", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christ", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "babylon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:11.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "afc35dc899ba3549f163c35edfac3c9528e1b53a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTtf2AImuiFgRIjoO5zG31.4NE1UN.hhv35CpvYS8FVwLh0XyAMRY_dmrYrIVhdVeS9HAiIjPq57tEiHhZP.ucZ", "site_full": "www.badgehungry.com", "site": "badgehungry.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/badgehungry", "site_categories": ["gambling", "hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "BadgeHungry!", "title": "Badge Magic: December 2017", "title_full": "Badge Magic: December 2017", "published": "2017-12-07T10:44:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "BG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.badgehungry.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/201712bm02.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "afc35dc899ba3549f163c35edfac3c9528e1b53a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTtf2AImuiFgRIjoO5zG31.4NE1UN.hhv35CpvYS8FVwLh0XyAMRY_dmrYrIVhdVeS9HAiIjPq57tEiHhZP.ucZ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BadgeHungry", "published": "2017-12-07T10:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "Badge Magic: December 2017", "text": "You are here: Home / albums / mix-n-match / Badge Magic: December 2017 Badge Magic: December 2017 25 Comments \nThe Badge Magic badges for December 2017 are now available through December 28.

My current qualifying payment is $0/month", "text": "Public school teacher with 111 qualifying payments left before I\u2019m eligible for the PSFL. The demographics of my school make me ineligible for the 5 year teacher forgiveness loan.\nI currently have 52k in student loans at 7.5% interest.\nBecause of my teacher salary, my current qualifying payment is $0. This does nothing for the interest. In the past, I\u2019ve paid around $300 to pay off the interest each month and keep my loan from growing.\nI like teaching. I can see myself teaching for definitely more than 8 more years. If I paid $0 for as long as possible, and let my loan grow, the amount would be paid off after 120 qualifying payments.\nShould I continue to pay the minimum required payment, even if it\u2019s $0, and watch my loan grow until it is forgiven? Or, do I continue to just pay the interest and keep my loan where it is until it is forgiven?\nMy fear is I wake up in 7 years, no longer qualify for PSFL, and watch my loans grow to an even higher amount. I\u2019m sorry if this is a dumb question and the answer is obvious, it\u2019s an honest one.\nContextual info:\n-single father to a toddler. Really want to send him to private school and currently only have $1k set aside for that. Because of this, I never eat out, our entertainment is free stuff (playgrounds, parks, libraries)\n-My mortgage is 15% of my gross pay each month.\n-His preschool costs me around $800/mo. There\u2019s no way around this, I\u2019m on my own with no family to watch him during the day. I\u2019m sure private daycare could be cheaper, but I really want him around other kids for the social aspect.\n-No car payment\n-Around $500 debt on a $10,000 credit card that I pay off monthly.\n-Max contributions to my 457 and my school matches 2.5% if I contribute 4 to their retirement plan.\n-I receive VA disability compensation at the 90% rate, which funds my EF every month to a separate bank account that I don\u2019t regularly think about, outside of an emergency.\n-10% of my income goes to my Vanguard Roth IRA each month\n-5% of my income goes to crypto each month\n submitted by /u/Speducator808\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:12.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "38ceb799e91e8327fd6eb74851611abb9ae15844", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSRXSUnrQ1BvOGLeR2DGhxf6QDFjpn.0aAHFTd4SES5mv7dfkqEGmqfRzsUEC6rm541hoJsVAxrGo-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bestbuy/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "r/BestBuy: Expert Service.

Bay Area excel programming is done by those that have been trained in this particular field to make sure that the right procedure is put in place for excellent results and secure work for those that opt to use excel to accomplish their office work. The following are some of the tips that guide the programmers. It is crucial to have ideas of pivot tables that help in summarizing a significant amount of data. Note that the first row of the table should contain the heading while others have values. The data collected is usually outlined flexibly even though the table has been designed in a way that it can hold any category presented. Blank rows are not allowed when making columns. It may be through conditional formatting that one can carry out all the activities at hand in the right way. The formatting helps one to change the format of the cells, even though they are many. Summarizing of the information given is made easy and efficient through formatting. It is with the help of the styles available in the Microsoft that one can make use of the font to make proper cell formatting. Make sure that cells you make are realistic. Sorting and filtering make the whole process faster and promising. Making proper use of spreadsheet guides one on the process of sorting the data at hand. Confusion and misunderstanding are eliminated since everything is tackled at a time. Through summarizing information given, it is clear that the results expected are presented in a right way. Any unnecessary data in the system is done away with to save time and ensure effectiveness. Basic math is crucial in Excel world. No one can work on any data using Excel if one has no simple formulas to be applied. It is through the basic ideas that one has in mathematics that helps to operate the system and produce excellent results. Remember that, it is through the manipulation of numbers using the formulas that one can get that which is expected. The charts to be used should be well known to the programmer. In most cases, two maps are used in representation of the data depending on its type. The tables are used to show the difference between the provided information. Only those that know can sort things out as expected. Knowing how rounding off numbers takes place in excel makes your work easier. In most cases a mistake occurs, and then rounded off as error; it happens that the result you end up getting is not valid. Also, it is nice to note that a mistake can occur if there is a change in the display format of digits after the decimal point has been rounded off to be used in another calculation. Once everything has been done, it becomes easy for those that deal with a lot of data to accomplish their task on time. Getting skills on how to deal with such system simplifies work in a significant way. Proper handling of the system should be maintained in the right direction to be used over an extended period without requiring any technical check.

But isn't it the Thai equivalent of Pattaya these days as in over run with low end trash and sex tourists? Independence day - June 23 for Brits.

Dont wear flip flops cus you have to do a good bit of walking downhill to get to the raft and uphill at the end. You stop for a break in the middle where you can buy beer too. Theres waterfalls, ancient rock carvings, amazing views and you go past a big posh hotel.\n7 of us went on one with the guide who was good inculding my 5 year old daughter so its not too scary but you will love it. I did. And thatll be even better with rain.

Termite infestation can lead to major damage to buildings, food crops, and in turn humans. Thus, various control methods such as chemical control, biological control, and physical & mechanical control methods are being used to control termite infestation. Supportive government initiatives is a major factor fueling market growth. For instance, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the U.S. encourages termite prevention through various awareness programs and has implemented stringent standards for registration and use of termite control products.\nRequest Sample Copy of this Report: https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/insight/request-sample/1019 \nThe subterranean termites segment accounted for the largest market share in 2016. This is attributed to high concentration of these termites, with as many as over two million termites in a single colony, making these the most destructive termite species. Chemical control method is most widely used in controlling termite infestation, as it provides fast elimination and highly effective, with pyrethroids being the most preferred pesticide. In addition to this, chemicals such as chlorinated hydrocarbons, phenylpyrazole, chloronicotinyls, borates, trifluoromethyl aminohydrazones, and pyrroles are also used in this method.\nNorth America is the most dominant region in global termite control market and the region was valued at US$ 1,165.79 million in 2016. This is attributed to increasing demand from commercial and industrial sectors such as food service and food processing industries, for termite control services. The Pest Management Regulatory Agency of Health Canada (PMRA), regulates the Pest Control Products Act (PCPA), in various sectors including Food Residue Exposure Assessment Section (FREAS), which evaluates cases, where these services can affect the human health due to their contact with field crops, meat and dairy products and processed food. Furthermore, global organizations including The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) actively focuses on termite research and control programs and also publishes news related to termite control for creating awareness among the general public. It actively funds research on subterranean termites at the Louisiana State University.\nGet More Information: https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/market-insight/termite-control-market-1019 \nAsia Pacific is expected to be the fastest growing region in global termite control market, in terms of revenue, over the forecast period. Increasing awareness related to damage caused by termites and growing tourism sector are some factors expected to positively affect growth of the market. Rising tourism, is fuelling the demand for hygienic stays in hospitality sector and thereby, aiding to the growth of termite control market at high pace, in the region. According to the data provided by the World Travel & Tourism Council in October 2017, Asian cities are at the forefront of growing tourism and the world\u2019s top ten fastest growing tourism cities including Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Manila, Delhi, Shenzhen, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta are all in Asia Pacific.\nHowever, various governments are implementing regulations for use of certain pesticides and limiting the availability of toxic pesticides, either by restricting its use or banning a product completely. For instance, in Japan, heptachlor and chlordane are restricted for use in termite control owing to its harmful effects on human health and environment. This in turn, propelling the demand for biotermiticides, as they are derived from bacteria or fungi and have less environmental impact. In addition to this According to Indian Pest Control Association \u2014 a non-profit trade association of professional pest management companies in India \u2014 the Insecticides Act aids in regulating the import, registration process, manufacturing, and use of insecticides in order to prevent risk to animals and human beings. All the insecticides undergo the registration process with Central Insecticides Board & Registration Committee (CIB & RC) before its use. The constantly changing regulatory scenario and stringent registration process for pesticides inhibit market growth to a certain extent.\nThe termite control market was valued at US$ 3,276.91 million in 2016 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 5.7%, in terms of revenue, over the forecast period (2017\u20132025).\nRequest For Customization: https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/insight/request-customization/1019 \nNorth America accounted for a revenue share of 35.58% in 2016, in global termite control market. Development of novel technologies for controlling termite infestation is a major factor influencing growth of the termite control market. One such technological innovation was the launch of automatic cold fogging machine at the Pest Summit 2016 to control pest and termites. Moreover, operating constraints such as time constraints and scheduling conflicts and stringent regulatory clearance and lengthy approval procedure are some of restraining factors for the market growth.\nMajor Players in the Global Termite Control Market \nKey players are adopting various strategies such as mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, partnerships, and product innovations to ensure their long-term sustenance in this market. In 2017, Arrow Exterminating Company, Inc. acquired Bugmaster Exterminators-U.S.-based company that specializes in commercial and residential termite control-to expand its presence in residential and commercial sectors by offering a full line of service.\nSome of the key players in global termite control market are BASF SE, Bayer AG, The DOW Chemical Company, Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd., FMC Corporation, United Phosphorus Ltd, Nufarm Limited, Nippon Soda Co. Ltd, Rentokil Initial PLC, Adama Agricultural Solutions Ltd., and Ensystex.\nAbout Coherent Market Insights: \nCoherent Market Insights is a prominent market research and consulting firm offering action-ready syndicated research reports, custom market analysis, consulting services, and competitive analysis through various recommendations related to emerging market trends, technologies, and potential absolute dollar opportunity.\nContact Us \nMr. Shah\nCoherent Market Insights\n1001 4th Ave,\n#3200\nSeattle, WA 98154\nTel: +1-206-701-6702\nWebsite: http://www.coherentnews.com ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shah", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dow chemical company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united phosphorus ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of agriculture", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cib & rc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nippon soda co. ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fmc corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "food residue exposure assessment section", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "basf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nufarm limited", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adama agricultural solutions ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisiana state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indian pest control association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sumitomo chemical co., ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pest management regulatory agency of health canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bayer ag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rentokil initial plc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central insecticides board & registration committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world travel & tourism council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "environmental protection agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arrow exterminating company, inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shanghai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manila", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuala lumpur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chengdu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jakarta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chongqing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guangzhou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shenzhen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:13.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "da758989036b1a046d15110a23400560026fa9ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8vUdzJk69cXLbt6Og5ndAlgtfCJTNxg62rYaDUD89A9b0MkFR8J2RIqCFTHbEIDJw-", "site_full": "www.akfiles.com", "site": "akfiles.com", "site_section": "http://www.akfiles.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=5", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Marketplace - The AK Files Forums", "title": "WTS: Atlantic Arms Polish (11) Khyber (lower price & link to more pics added)", "title_full": "WTS: Atlantic Arms Polish (11) Khyber (lower price & link to more pics added) - The AK Files Forums", "published": "2017-11-20T01:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.464, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 73634, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7acc0c0bd1ec44eb3d08d8344e50fafe691bb29b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8vUdzJk69cXLbt6Og5ndAlgtfCJTNxg62rYaDUD89A9b0MkFR8J2RI4NcZz_Ea6eY2IEETWMmTHH8tE7y5rWuC", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "AZ2KC", "published": "2017-12-01T22:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "replied in PM - answers was circa 2012 and under 600 TTBOMK\nQuote: : when was this produced by Atlantic?

IT HAD BEEN A HOTEL THAT WE HAD STAYED AT BEFORE SO I TRUSTED THE HOTEL. BUT WE HAD CHECKED 430PM AND QUICKLY CHANGED TO ATTEND MY CHRISTMAS PARTY AND HAD ARRIVED BACK AT THE ROOM AT 1130PM. SO AS WE WERE GETTING READY FOR BED, THERE WERE SEMAN STAINS ON THE OUTER BLANKET COVERS AND BROWN STAINS ON THE INSIDE SHEETS AND BUGS. AND EITHER DOG HAIR OR HUMAN HAIR THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE ENTIRE BLANKET AND THE HEATER WAS NOT WORKING EITHER. SO I HAD WALKED DOWN TO THE FRONT DESK TO SPEAK WITH THE MANGER, BUT NO MANGER ON DUTY UNTIL THE NOT MORNING. I HAD FOR A REFUND ON THE ROOM AND TO CANCEL MY RESERVATION FOR THE FOLLOWING DA.Y. THE FIRST FRONT DESK CLERK SAID THAT THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO AND COULD NOT REFUND MY MONEY OR DID NOT OFFER TO TRANSFERR TO ANOTHER ROOM.

He was paternal to me. So I needed a moment to process everything, because I thought I knew this guy, and then he\u2019s being accused of rape.\u201d \n\u201cWe all knew he was a dog,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe knew that he was a... tough guy, a brute, a tough guy to negotiate with. I didn\u2019t know that he was a rapist.\u201d \n\u201cBeing able to hear when the woman wore the microphone and Harvey was telling her to watch him shower, I felt sick in my bones for an entire day,\u201d she adds. \u201cI was just sick... He didn\u2019t lay a finger on her, and I felt chilled to my bones. Imagine having a man who is that powerful telling you to do something (and) you\u2019re saying no. (He\u2019s) threatening you, saying, \u2018Don\u2019t embarrass me...\u2019\u201d \nJennifer insists the whole movie industry has been hit hard by Hollywood\u2019s sexual harassment and assault scandal, which reared up after a New York Times expose on Weinstein\u2019s bad behaviour was published in early October. \nBrett Ratner, director James Toback, and actors Kevin Spacey, Jeffrey Tambor, Robert Knepper, and Jeremy Piven have also been hit with misconduct allegations. \n\u201cIt\u2019s so widespread, the abuse, from so many different people,\u201d Jennifer continues. \u201cIt\u2019s directors, it\u2019s producers... I think everybody needed to (process it). Everybody needs to deal with this in their own way; everybody needs to heal.\u201d \nThe Weinstein story and the allegations that followed brought back bad memories for Lawrence, who felt humiliated during the audition process of one unnamed movie, when the female producer asked her to strip for a nude line-up \u201cwith about five women who were much, much thinner than me\u201d. \n\u201cI was abused by a woman on a movie,\u201d she tells Oprah. \u201cThere was a general consensus on (that) movie that I was fat, and so it wasn\u2019t just the woman. Everybody agreed that I was fat. And she had to be the mouthpiece... \n\u201cOn that movie, I called my agent, and I called everybody. It\u2019s like, there\u2019s not really anything anybody can do because the behaviour is so normalised. And then you become more powerful, and people start f**king with you less. People at the beginning of their careers don\u2019t want to rock the boat because if you rock the boat, you\u2019ll be called difficult.\u201d \nLike many leading ladies in Hollywood, Jennifer is hoping the sexual misconduct allegations, sparked by the Weinstein drama, will change the movie industry for the better. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know a woman who hasn\u2019t been touched by some sort of abuse,\u201d she explains. \u201cI\u2019m sad by the women\u2019s stories, but I\u2019m excited by the change that\u2019s going to come from it. The rule book is being rewritten right now. People are terrified... \n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to women. We\u2019ve talked about forming a commission... If every A-list actor decides to join this commission, we know everybody in the industry. I know every studio head in town. If I\u2019m on this commission, and (if) I get an email about somebody being treated badly on a set, I can send an email.

Courtesy of Sheryl Mitchell 17:16 Listen to the final part of UN/DIVIDED, a three-part series by April Van Buren. \nOn the first day of school, more than 100 men lined up outside of Harrington Elementary in Albion, Michigan. \nThey were all dressed to the nines. Most had on dress shirts and ties, some were wearing three-piece suits, and a few veterans were dressed up in their military garb. \nThis story is part three of UN/DIVIDED, a three-part series from Michigan Radio \nBuses pulled up and students, sporting new haircuts and new backpacks, poured out. As kids headed toward the front door, a crowd of people stood cheering them along and giving out high-fives. \nA line of college students, teachers, and other community members snaked around the sidewalk as they welcomed the students to a new year at Harrington. \nFor some families, though, the challenges from last year are still front of mind. And so, for many of them, this is also a make or break year. It\u2019s the school\u2019s last chance to convince them to keep their kids here in Albion, at their neighborhood school. \nThe past few years have brought change after change for students living in Albion. And many families were hoping annexation would bring some stability. \nAnd that\u2019s what the Marshall district is promising at Harrington this year. \nThe school has a new leader, a new approach to discipline, and more supports for students and families. \nBut will that be enough to convince parents the school can turn it around? \nA cautious optimism \nIt\u2019s a little after five in the afternoon, and Wanda Kemp is in her kitchen prepping dinner. She heats up oil to fry her shrimp and fish and sticks a few baked potatoes in the oven. \n\u201cGetting ready to throw on some shrimp, fish, baked potatoes. Something quick,\u201d she tells me. \nShe wraps the potatoes in tin foil and sticks them in the oven. Then she dips the fish filets in egg, tosses them with flour and seasoning, and gently drops them into a pot of hot oil. Pretty soon, the smell of fried fish fills the entire house. Harrington third grader, Zy'Airh (right) with 4-year-old nephew, Zachariah. Credit April Van Buren / Michigan Radio \nWanda has two kids in Marshall Public Schools. Za'Riah, her daughter, is a freshman at Marshall High School. Her son Zy'Airh is in third grade at Harrington Elementary. \nThis week he\u2019s been learning about homophones. \n\u201cYou had a list of them. So what was something on that list?,\u201d Wanda asks Zy-Airh. \n\u201cOh! Pair and pear...P-A-I-R. P-A-R-E,\u201d he responds. \n(Well, almost. In Zy'Airh's defense, pare is a word. It just wasn\u2019t the one on his spelling list.) \nWanda likes what the district is promising at Harrington this year. \nBut after what happened last year, she says there's a lot riding on those promises. \n\u201cAnd again, we going into another principal this year. So you\u2019re right back there again, it\u2019s new. So we can\u2019t keep just saying \u2018It\u2019s new. It\u2019s new.\u2019 But yet our children are just being moved along in the newness while they are trying to get the bugs ironed out,\u201d says Wanda. \nLast year was tough for Zy'Airh -- and for a lot of kids at Harrington. \nThe school had problems with behavior and teacher turnover. Teachers were frustrated by a lack of organization and support. And parents were frustrated with a lack of communication. \nBut the biggest issue for Zy'Airh, and a lot of his peers, was discipline. There were around 160 out-of-school suspensions last year. That\u2019s at an elementary school with around 260 students. \nWanda says she isn\u2019t a parent who is going to excuse her kid\u2019s bad behavior. \n\u201cAnd I tell him all the time if you don't change, I'm worried about two places you will be if you continue to go through life like you are now -- angry for whatever reason I can't put my finger on. Jail. Death. Those are two options.\u201d \nAll of the suspensions Zy'Airh racked up, though, didn\u2019t seem to actually help him. She is praying that things are different this year. \nA new year and a new leader \nRobert Giles is starting his first year as a principal. \nHe moved to Albion in August. Before that, he was an athletic administrator for the Education Achievement Authority. \nThe state-run district in Detroit was shuttered earlier this year after failing to turn around the city\u2019s poorest performing schools. \nGiles has a long list of things he wants to get done at Harrington, but he knows first, he has some convincing to do. \n\u201cJust like these kids, these parents in this community have heard a whole lot of talk about a whole lot of things and have not seen anything that would give them a vision of anything to make them think it would be any better,\u201d Giles says. \nSo what exactly would better look like? \nWhat would it take to make sure kids across the Marshall district got an equitable education? \nPedro Noguera has some ideas. \nHe\u2019s an education professor at UCLA and has spent decades studying high-poverty schools. \nHe says, to be clear, creating a more integrated district is a good thing. \n\u201cThe research shows that both the affluent white children and the low-income children of color should benefit. However, making sure that occurs is going to take work,\u201d says Noguera. \nIt\u2019s not just about throwing kids together and hoping for the best. \nMarshall has to be intentional about putting relationship building at the center of its plans for the newly integrated district. That means relationships between parents and staff, between students and teachers, and between peers. \n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for the school to not see this as somehow beyond their mission,\u201d says Noguera. \u201cIt is a central part of their mission to build to this kind of connection amongst kids.\u201d \nThe Marshall district has tried to build those connections. \nHigh schoolers from the two cities have spent weekends together at Albion College. \nThis year, incoming sixth graders from all four of Marshall\u2019s elementary schools spent a week at camp together. \nStill, it is mostly kids from Albion getting bussed to Marshall, not the other way around, which means Harrington is still serving a mostly black, almost entirely low-income population. \nNoguera says that can\u2019t be an excuse for the turmoil at the school last year. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not as though it\u2019s something endemic to those kids or to that community.\u201d \nTo turn things around, Noguera says, Harrington has to start by building a positive school climate. \nPrincipal Robert Giles says that is his first priority. \nAnd he has a lot of ideas about how to do that, but at the top of the list is changing the school\u2019s approach to discipline. \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to have to be something close to burning a building down for me to put a baby out of this building,\u201d says Giles. \nRobert Giles says his first goal is to keep kids in class whenever possible. If a kid is fighting or running out of the classroom, you figure out why. You work with them to resolve that conflict and get them back into the classroom. \nThe next step is what most schools call in-school suspension. Harrington Principal Robert Giles and Albion City Manager Sheryl Mitchell. Credit Courtesy of Sheryl Mitchell \n\u201cIn-school suspension is an archaic concept to me. I believe that just with everything else it changes. I believe that everything we need to do needs to be handled in house,\u201d says Giles. \nHe says that Harrington\u2019s program is going to be different. \nIt isn\u2019t going to be kids sitting in a time out or doing homework on their own. \nInstead, a teacher trained in special education will work one on one with students so they don\u2019t lose instruction time. \nThe school\u2019s approach to discipline this year is based on what\u2019s known as \u201crestorative justice.\u201d It\u2019s a concept that\u2019s been gaining traction in schools around the country. Restorative justice programs use a kind of in-school mediation as an alternative to suspensions and expulsions. \nSo far, Giles has followed through on his promise about keeping kids in the classroom. \nThere has been just one out-of-school suspension at Harrington this year; it was for a mental health emergency. \nBut Giles says changing the school climate is going to require more than building connections with students. He says he also needs his staff to build relationships with those children\u2019s families. \n\u201cAin't no kids throwing mama\u2019s chairs. Nobody is at home saying, \u2018No mom, I\u2019m not taking out the trash, you do it.\u2019 So getting folks to understand that the behavior you see here isn\u2019t necessarily the behavior you see at home,\u201d says Giles. \n\u201cThings are changing.\u201d \nLots of people have told me: Albion Public Schools always felt like a family. \nYour parents would run into teachers in the grocery store or at church. Your principal might live down the street. \nWanda Kemp says that feeling of community just wasn\u2019t there when Marshall took over. \nShe kept reaching out to the school to ask how she could help Zy'Airh. \n\u201cNot even do it for me,\u201d Wanda explains. \u201cI'm asking for direction, guidance. Is there something I need to be doing as a parent to help my child with his education?\u201d \nWanda says it felt like she was all on her own. Wanda Kemp (right) with friend Gwenetta Artis. Credit April Van Buren / Michigan Radio \nSeveral weeks in, she started to worry that this year might not be any different. \nZy'Airh got in trouble for fighting on the bus. He had to talk to the principal. \nBut Wanda says she never got a call from the school. \n\u201cI reached out to the principal. I have left two messages. And I haven't received a return phone call yet. And I actually told him why I was calling and I haven't received a ... return call.\u201d \nWanda\u2019s weekdays start at 5:30 in the morning. In the afternoon, she shuttles Za'Airh and his sister Za'Riah to activities and school events. Late at night, she\u2019s up helping her kids with homework. \nAnd Wanda, like a lot of other parents in Albion, does all of it on her own. \n\u201cA lot of us are single parents, and some people.\u2026 I'm fortunate enough to have a support system, but some people don't even have that.\u201d \nThat\u2019s where Carolyn Amos comes in. \nShe\u2019s an interventionist at Harrington Elementary, and her job is to be that support system for students and families. \n\u201cI wear like 15 different hats, and they all fit,\u201d she laughs. \nOn fall count day, Amos is wearing her student wrangler hat. Teachers have been coming in and out of the office with attendance sheets. Once the staff has a list of absent kids, Amos takes over. \n\u201cI make phone calls to home to kids who did not show up after we got attendance, find out why they\u2019re not here, and then find out if I can come and get them,\u201d \nAmos acts as an advocate for students and their parents. \nShe connects families to community resources -- like help making doctor\u2019s appointments or finding housing. And she picks up kids and drops them off at home when they can\u2019t get a ride. \nAmos has been doing this job since before annexation, so she was there for the challenges that plagued the school\u2019s first year with Marshall. \nBut Amos says things are different now. \n\u201cMorale is great, came in with a full staff, everybody\u2019s doing well, we\u2019re happy about everything, and things are changing.\u201d \nAmos is one of two full-time interventionists at Harrington. \nThe school also has extra classroom aides, a social worker two days a week, a full-time school counselor, and a dedicated special education consultant. \nAnd this year, the Marshall district is piloting something new. It\u2019s called the \u201cresilient schools\u201d program, and it\u2019s focused on the ways trauma can affect learning. Coaches are working with parents and teachers to support kids when things outside of school make it harder to learn. \nChange is one of the things that can make it tougher for kids to learn, and it\u2019s something students in Albion have seen a lot of over the past few years. \nThere have been budget and program cuts. Friends and neighbors have left for other districts. The school district their parents and sometimes even their grandparents attended, is gone. \"Morale is great, came in with a full staff, everybody's doing well, we're happy about everything, and things are changing.\" \nBut Carolyn Amos says Harrington is moving forward. She says parents should, too. \n\u201cWhat I want people to understand is annexation is not an issue at all,\u201d Amos says. \nIf parents want to their kids in Albion, they have to focus on making this school the best it can be. \n\u201cWork with where you are, work with what you have, and do the work. Do the work you need to do,\u201d she adds. \nWhen Marshall Public Schools annexed the Albion district last year, superintendent Randy Davis made a promise. \n\u201cI told the community when we did the annexation, we will have a community school in your town for the next three to five years, and then we\u2019ll have to make a decision on how enrollment is going. My preference is that I\u2019m going to be talking about how do I add another school?\u201d \nBut if Marshall wants to add another school, or even just keep Harrington open, they have to have enough kids, which means the district has to reverse a decades-long exodus of students from Albion. \nThat is a heavy lift. \nOther districts are still sending buses into the city, There is still tension over annexation in the community, and there are people who believe annexation isn\u2019t working -- and that it never will. \nSo, what happens next? \nThe answer to that will depend on parents like Carrie Menold. \nChoosing the neighborhood school \n\u201cWe live here and we\u2019re pretty committed to the idea of living and working and being a part of the community we\u2019re in. And so it was really important for us to support the school that is here,\u201d Menold tells me. Carrie Menold and her son, Milo. Credit April Van Buren / Michigan Radio \nMenold and her husband are both professors at Albion College, where they teach in the geology department. \nAnd this year, her smiley, blonde five-year-old Milo is starting kindergarten at Harrington this year. I met Carrie and Milo at a picnic a couple of weeks before school started. \nMenold says sending Milo to Harrington wasn\u2019t a hard choice. She knows there were challenges at the school last year. \n\u201cBut I think we also are educators ourselves and know that it takes investment, you know, and it takes work to make these kind of things work, and it takes the whole town to come together around them,\u201d she says. \nIf Marshall wants other families to make the same choice as Carrie Menold, they have to show parents that things really are different this year. \nBecause, as Wanda Kemp told me, promises can only get you so far. \n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t gonna keep sitting around waiting when their child\u2019s education is dependent on whether they are successful or not far as trying to wait for them to get the system together.\u201d \nI checked back in with Wanda a few weeks ago. She told me Principal Giles had called her back not long after we talked. \nShe went to the school and sat down with him and Zy'Airh's teacher. She talked about her concerns and frustrations. \nAnd Wanda says she left that meeting feeling like maybe this year was going to be different after all.

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull) Gregory Bull Save \nSAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 Christine Wade found a haven in the tent she shared with six children, pitched in an asphalt parking lot. \nIt was, at least, far better than their previous home in the city, a shelter where rats ate through the family's bags of clothes and chewed on 2-year-old Jaymason's stroller. Roughly 50 of the encampment's 200 residents were children, so Wade's kids had plenty of playmates. \n\"It's peaceful here,\" Wade, 31, who is eight months pregnant, said in an October interview. \"There's coffee first thing in the morning. We can hang out here in the daytime. I mean what more could you ask for?\" \nA tent, of course, is not a home. But for these San Diegans, it is a blessing. \nLike other major cities all along the West Coast, San Diego is struggling with a homeless crisis. In a place that bills itself as \"America's Finest City,\" renowned for its sunny weather, surfing and fish tacos, spiraling real estate values have contributed to spiraling homelessness, leaving more than 3,200 people living on the streets or in their cars. \nMost alarmingly, the explosive growth in the number of people living outdoors has contributed to a hepatitis A epidemic that has killed 20 people in the past year \u2014 the worst U.S. outbreak of its kind in 20 years. Deplorable sanitary conditions help spread the liver-damaging virus that lives in feces. \n\"Some of the most vulnerable are dying in the streets in one of the most desirable and livable regions in America,\" a San Diego County grand jury wrote in its report in June \u2014 reiterating warnings it gave the city repeatedly over the past decade to better address homelessness. \nSan Diego has struggled to do that. Two years ago, Mayor Kevin Faulconer, a moderate Republican, closed a downtown tent shelter that operated for 29 years during winter months. He promised a \"game changer\" \u2014 a new, permanent facility with services to funnel people to housing. \nBut it wasn't enough. \nThe result? Legions of Californians without shelter. A spreading contagion. Endless political disputes over what can and should be done \u2014 and mounting bills for taxpayers. Struggling schools and other institutions. And an extraordinary challenge to the city's sunny identity that threatens its key tourism industry. \nFor now, San Diego again is turning to tents. The campground where the Wades lived was only temporary; this month, officials are opening three industrial-sized tents that will house a total of 700 people. \nThere are plans afoot to build less-makeshift housing. But to deal with the immediate emergency and operate the giant tents, the city had to take $6.5 million that had been budgeted for permanent homes. \nDemocrat Councilman David Alvarez cast the only vote against the plan. \"Had we actually invested in a homeless strategy, we would not be here today being asked to warehouse 700 people in giant tents,\" he said. \nRepublican Councilwoman Lorie Zapf's mother was mentally ill and died homeless in Los Angeles. She agreed with Alvarez that the tents were not a perfect solution to San Diego's crisis, but she could not in good conscience pass up a chance to get people off the streets. \n\"We need to do anything we can to stop this tsunami of people who are ending up on our sidewalks,\" she said. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\"The people of San Diego need to decide what they want the city to look like,\" said Gordon Walker, who took the helm this summer of the San Diego Regional Task Force on the Homeless amid praise for his efforts in combatting chronic homelessness in Utah. \n\"San Francisco has essentially given up its streets to the homeless,\" added Walker, who served as deputy undersecretary for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Reagan administration. \"It could go either way here. The real issue is we don't have enough housing.\" \nLast year, the number of people living outdoors in San Diego jumped 18 percent over the previous year, according to an annual count taken in January. More than 400 makeshift shelters sprung up downtown, covering sidewalks across from new high-rise apartment buildings that have climbed in lockstep with the booming biotech-heavy economy and soaring rents, among the nation's highest. A studio apartment goes for around $1,500 a month, on average. \nMost of the homeless, like the Wade family, did not migrate to San Diego to live on the streets but are local residents who became homeless in a city where rents increased nearly 8 percent in a year. High-rise buildings have replaced discount residential buildings that offered single rooms for rent, housing people living paycheck-to-paycheck. Nearly half of the 9,000 rooms have disappeared since 2003. \nIn October, as the hepatitis death toll climbed and the city declared a homeless emergency, Faulconer and the nonprofit Alpha Project opened the Balboa Park campground where the Wades found shelter. The city installed public washing stations, opened 24-hour restrooms and scrubbed streets with a bleach solution. \nPolice also cracked down, issuing hundreds of citations, largely for illegal lodging. Within weeks, the nearly 400 tents and tarps downtown were gone. Those who work with the homeless say they simply scattered. \n\"It could be like a campfire when all the embers are spread out. It either dies out or it catches other areas and makes a bigger fire than we originally had,\" said Dr. Jeffrey Norris, the medical director of Father Joe's Villages, which runs a clinic that treats 2,800 homeless annually. \nThe number of encampments hidden in the brush and bamboo along the banks of the San Diego River doubled. \n\"It's being used as a toilet,\" said Zapf, whose council district includes the river, bays and beaches. \nThe San Diego River Park Foundation's mission is to preserve the river, a green ribbon that starts from snowmelt in the mountains east of San Diego and builds as it snakes through a valley of cottonwood groves and continues under freeway overpasses by shopping centers. \nThe foundation spent $115,000 removing 250,000 pounds of trash left by the homeless camps this year. Litter is carried by the river, which feeds into the Pacific at a popular dog beach. \nDirector Rob Hutsel said he gets asked by potential donors about the foundation's plans to create a 52-mile-long river park and trail system: \"What about the homeless? Don't build a park. It'll just bring in more.\" \n\"Gosh, parks are good,\" he said. \"There shouldn't be any thought about building a park. That's so unfortunate.\" \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \nLaurie Britton operates an organic coffee roasting business and coffee shop, Cafe Virtuoso, in the Barrio Logan neighborhood. The winter shelter was nearby, and Britton was among those who supported its closure two years ago because it drew throngs of homeless people to the area. \nBut when it closed, the problem exploded. Tents, tarps, shopping carts, needles and trash spilled into the street, making it difficult to drive to her cafe. \nHer customers' cars would get bashed by bottles or sprayed with urine. People locked themselves in the bathroom to do drugs. One Saturday, Britton dressed up to give a tour but had to scrape piles of human feces off the sidewalk first. Another morning, a man flashed a knife and glared when she asked him not to put a tarp next to her cafe's parking fence. \nShe issued pepper spray to her 14 employees. \n\"If it gets out of hand, the girls know to grab the pepper spray and do what you have to do,\" she said. \"The reality is I am here to protect my customers and employees. It's not my job to give you a bathroom and free water. And clean up when you just peed on my door. Really? This is hard enough. I don't need to be doing that.\" \nSince the city started cleaning up the streets, business has increased by 20 percent. She now welcomes the giant tents \u2014 two of which are within a block of her business \u2014 if people eventually end up in permanent housing. \nShe's also trying to help. Her coffee roasting lab offers job training and works with a school exclusively for homeless students. \n\"But if it gets as bad as it was again, I'd probably move,\" she said. \nJohn Long did relocate his Halcyon coffee bar and lounge in October to San Marcos, a town north of San Diego. Three years ago, the hip Austin-based chain opened to much fanfare as a sign of downtown's gentrification, with floor-to-ceiling windows and a patio that looked onto a new park. \nBut espresso-drinking customers ended up with a view of people sleeping on the grass. \n\"One had to hope that with that much investments going into the area downtown, the city would keep the sidewalk clean \u2014 especially the park \u2014 but that didn't happen,\" Long said. \nLong kept his lease and may someday reopen a business there. First, though, \"There needs to be a dramatic change and action.\" \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \nFather Joe's Villages is working on a $531 million plan to take about 2,700 people off the streets through new construction or by refurbishing motels over the next five years. Federal, state and local funds will cover most of the cost, but the charity still must raise $120 million. \n\"That's truly what we need just to make a dent,\" said Deacon Jim Vargas, the group's president. \nThe mayor has earmarked more than $80 million to reduce homelessness over the next three years. The plan includes incentives for landlords and $30 million for developers to create 300 affordable units. The goal is for 65 percent of tent occupants to be moved into housing. \n\"Ultimately the goal is to put everyone in a home who wants to be,\" Faulconer told The Associated Press. \"We need to get people off the streets now and then move forward on constructing units.\" \nBut the temporary solution is expensive. At a cost of $1,700 per person per month, $6.5 million will cover seven months, but the tents may need to remain open for up to two years, depending on the housing market, according to the San Diego Housing Commission's head, Rick Gentry. \nMeanwhile, San Diego County has spent more than $4 million to cope with the hepatitis outbreak. Public health nurses carting coolers of the vaccine have administered more than 100,000 shots, including outside restrooms and libraries and under freeway overpasses. \nIt didn't have to come to this, said Michael McConnell, a retired businessman-turned-activist who prods the city to stop arresting the homeless. \n\"The slogan 'America's Finest City' is being tarnished day by day because the city has been turning a blind eye to its most vulnerable,\" McConnell said, as crews sprayed a bleach solution along 17th Street in September after people moved bags, bicycles and overflowing grocery carts. \nIn 2005 and in 2015, the grand jury recommended the city provide more public restrooms to its homeless population. But city officials feared they would attract drug dealers. They also balked at the $250,000 estimated installation cost and the hundreds of thousands of dollars believed needed to operate them. \nThen hepatitis A made it everyone's problem. \nWith more than 560 cases and more than 360 people hospitalized, doctors recommended vaccinations to anyone who regularly goes downtown. Members of one fire crew were inoculated after stomping through human feces. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \nAt Perkins Elementary School, staffers have found excrement and urine outside classrooms before the school opened for the day, and some worry the hepatitis virus may be brought into the school on shoes. Perkins has a playground with a panoramic view of sleek high-rises and the shiny dome of the city's new central library; it also has a student body that is more than a quarter homeless, up from 4 percent three years ago. \nHomelessness takes a particular toll on the young. Fernando Hernandez, Perkins' principal, said many of the homeless students are far below grade levels. Some have not attended school in years. \n\"We have first graders who get out of bed and get to school on their own,\" Hernandez said. \"Some come to school after sleeping on a floor and don't sleep well. That may be why they are not learning. So we have to recalibrate our expectations.\" \nShawnni Wade was a straight-A student as a third grader before her family's troubles escalated. In all the upheaval, she left the school; now, she's returned as a seventh grader. \n\"It's weird to be back,\" said the girl with bright green eyes and a sly smile. \nBut then, little about this 12-year-old girl's life has been normal. \nChristine Wade's ex-husband's drug addiction got them booted from apartments and then a shelter. After they divorced, he let Wade care for his two daughters, whom she had raised for eight years. She moved the six children to a residential hotel, where she paid $1,200 a month for a kitchenette with two queen beds. \nBut Wade, who is in poor health, often called in sick. She lost her job cleaning hospital rooms. \nA month later, she discovered she was pregnant, despite birth control. A doctor talked to her about abortion. \"I didn't have the heart to do that,\" she said. \nWithout her income, she lost the kitchenette last spring. \n\"There's so little help for a big family,\" Wade said. \nShe could find space only in a rat-infested shelter, where the family lived before landing in the Balboa Park campground. As the sun set on their second night there, Shawnni \u2014 oblivious to nearby freeway traffic \u2014 looked to the sky and said she liked camping. Wade smiled. \nThen, a few weeks ago, Wade fell ill again and was hospitalized. She could not return to the campground in her condition, so the family moved into yet another shelter. \nA caseworker is now helping her find a home. She hopes to have one before next month, when she expects to give birth to a son. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \nFollow AP's complete coverage of the West Coast homeless crisis here: https://apnews.com/tag/HomelessCrisis \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Overclocking isn't going to win you any speed contests, or make Crysis run beautifully on your netbook (sorry). However, I've noticed that my machine definitely feels a bit snappier. Apps don't launch quite as slowly, files don't take quite as long to load, and it took emulated Nintendo 64 games from \"unenjoyable\" to \"smooth as butter\". Of course, all of this depends on your particular machine and graphics chipset, but the point is that it can yield some nice benefits for a machine that's currently feeling a bit too laggy.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, some downsides to overclocking. Not only can it make your computer less stable if done improperly, but it can also damage your processor if you push it too hard. In addition, it will undoubtedly decrease the battery of your netbook. So, in addition to showing you how to safely overclock your machine, we're also going to show you how to easily switch back and forth between the stock speed and your overclocked speed, so when you don't have an outlet nearby, you don't have to needlessly waste your battery.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [],

Alexi Lalas Credit Fox Sports \nThe Motor City bid is led by Dan Gilbert, Tom Gores, and Martha Firestone Ford, who know a thing or two about owning pro sports teams with the Cavaliers, Pistons, and Lions, respectively. And they're proposing Ford Field as the site for the new MLS team. \nHow strong is Detroit's bid? \nAlexi Lalas , Fox Sports analyst and National Soccer Hall of Fame member, joined Stateside to share his thoughts on Detroit\u2019s chances. Lalas grew up in Birmingham and he has had a long career playing soccer for the U.S. in the World Cup, and a long stretch in Major League Soccer as a player and a coach. \nListen above for the full conversation, or catch highlights below. \nDetroit\u2019s chances \n\u201cWhen you have locally-invested and certainly deep-pocketed ownership that has a history when it comes to professional sports, that also has the soccer component as part of a bigger development type of play... I think all of those things, at least initially, had me putting Detroit at number one in terms of the twelve teams that were vying for these two spots that are going to be announced this year, and more spots further on.\" \n\"But right now we\u2019re down to this final four\u2026 The news that came out over the last month regarding the change of heart when it comes to a soccer specific stadium, a road that Detroit has been down over the last year, trying to get that downtown and now moving to an NFL stadium at Ford Field, I think that that threw a lot of people for a loop. I think it had a lot of people scratching their heads. So, while before I would have put Detroit at number one of the four finalists right now for the two spots, now I think they\u2019re probably at four, which doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t get in eventually, but \u2026 it doesn\u2019t look good for Detroit in terms of the two, but I tell you what, that ownership group, that is something powerful, and other owners like to be involved with other deep-pocketed owners, and this is a billionaire\u2019s league at this point.\u201d \n\u201cIn my gut, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen for this round, but I think they get the next round.\u201d \nHow Detroit might still snag a spot \n\u201cWe are recording this on a day when the final presentations are happening in New York City by all four teams, and if there ever was the moment for someone to get up and give a powerful PowerPoint presentation, it is today when it comes to Detroit. Because if they can talk about how they came to this decision, why it\u2019s good not just for what they feel is going to happen in Detroit but also good for the league, and they\u2019re able to justify that in front of the ownership groups that are going to decide this, then certainly they can be right back into it. But sometimes it\u2019s about hearts and minds, and sometimes it\u2019s literally being in a room with people, being able to look them in the eye, convince them that this is the right thing and why they pivoted from the soccer-specific stadium.\u201d \nAn appetite for soccer \n\u201cI think the landscape across the country when it comes to professional soccer and the appetite for professional soccer has just gotten incrementally bigger and bigger. Obviously the World Cup in \u201994 which we all remember in the Pontiac Silverdome .\" \n\"There is a soccer audience. There always has been a soccer audience\u2026 There is a vibrant soccer community in Detroit, but giving them the opportunity week in and week out to support a team, to go to a team on a much bigger scale than they have right now or have had in the past, that\u2019s important.\u201d \n(Subscribe to the Stateside podcast on iTunes , Google Play , or with this RSS link ) Tags:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexi lalas", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "martha firestone ford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lalas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan gilbert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom gores", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mls", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fox sports", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pistons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national soccer hall of fame", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "detroit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cavaliers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "major league soccer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ford field", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "detroit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "motor city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "birmingham", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:16.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "971e8723f33217cf954bc46af301c1cf9f34166f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8_DRNYNHvKGwBXjWTOM6I0SfekuFBwLC9YvqEtgOzQGY8yFopZeJ8_", "site_full": "www.55188.com", "site": "55188.com", "site_section": "http://www.55188.com/forum-8-2.html", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "\u0104\u017e\u0161\u00c9\u0118\u0110\u0118\u013e\u0150\u02dd\u0110\u0139\u010e\u02d8\u02dd\u0165\u00c1\u00f7\u00c7\u0159\u0104\u017c -

It's an MMO-esque game. This is basically how they work. You keep up with the expansions and whatnot to keep playing the game. These game's get whittled away and changed and such all the time and with zero regard for people who don't upgraded to the newest version.\nI guess my main thing is I can totally understand getting annoyed at it, I just don't get why you would be annoyed at it now rather then always. This should not be a surprise. This is always the kind of game Destiny has always been, just like WoW or the like. This is how they work. This is what you signed up for, eyes open.\n\"I don't wanna have to pay $20 every 3 months to keep playing the game\" is perfectly valid imo. I get looking at the Destiny expansions, both 1 and 2, and considering them overpriced. I'd certainly agree in many ways.\nI just don't get what people thought Destiny 2 was gonna be other then that though.\nThis is a bad argument because MMOs don't remove content, they just stop supporting them. \"Removal\" of content only happens over time, as players upgrade and level out of it. Every MMO has a small community of people at the turn of an expansion who are still doing the old content, just because they're not in a place where they can afford to upgrade at the time. Sure, matchmaking might take longer because it's a smaller pool of players, but the content remains. There's a huge difference between \"no longer the focus\" and \"no longer available\".\nMMOs absolutely remove content. They will update older content to max level. And they will do it without a second thought for the people who never moved on to the newest expansion. WoW has done it multiple times. It's not a bad argument, it's a thing that actually happens.\nEven if it's a thing that happens, that doesn't make it a good thing that should keep happening. Destiny certainly didn't need less things to do, and if you are like me and want to just tread water until some real changes happen, taking things away leaves a bad taste in players mouths.\nI think Destiny is far away from an MMO and much closer to \"Halo game with collecting metagame\" especially as Bungie moves away from customizable skill trees, makes players level matter less, and shies away from LL enabled PvP.

There was a clear threat, there weren't a million little roadblocks of getting machinery working to do a thing. There was a logical progression.\nBut in a deeper way, this story was real bad because it shows Bungie's priorities around long term storytelling. It's pretty clear to me now that Destiny's more interesting lore will always stay on the margins, and will never actually take center stage.\nWith Osiris, Bungie had pretty much there first chance to deal with some of the deeper concepts in Destiny lore and they basically said 'uh no shoot the robits?'\nWhy was osiris exiled?\nWhat is the goal of vex simulation?\nWhat is the difference between precursor and descendant vex ?\nHow the hell can you kill something that controls a simulation?\nTo which the answers were:\nhe's too cool\nlol idk kill teh sun?\ngold trim\ndunk on him\nSeriously blot out the sun? That's so lame- I was imagining all these trippy ways the vex future hell would look and then it's just naah. Aren't they supposed to be trying to control reality! Do something fun with it! Especially after you got my hopes up by showing me Past Mercury. That was very cool by the way.\nBasically what this expansion says to me is that Bungie has no real interest in exploring the concepts that are usually out on the edge of destiny on the main stage. It's all going to be tease followed by no follow up. Honestly I wouldn't be surprised at this point if they resolved the Rasputin attacking the Traveler stuff by giving Rasputin a monologue about how 'the guardian' taught him the power of friendship and he's sorry he was mean to the traveler. That's if they even feel like addressing it. The main stage will always take the simplest possible resolution to any concept or threat. That makes it hard to get excited about the Nine or the Ahamkara or the Darkness when they will just have the exact some plot as any other threat.
