Share this article: By Amy Laskowski Photos by Jackie Ricciardi \nA quote from Hamlet long adorned the stage arch of the old BU Theatre: \u201cTo hold, as \u2019twere, the mirror up to nature\u2026\u201d \nWhen the design process of the new Joan & Edgar Booth Theatre was under way, Jim Petosa, director of the College of Fine Arts School of Theatre, asked that the quote be incorporated. \nThe quote \u201cmeant something to our community,\u201d Petosa says. \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to our philosophy of what the theater is. And it reflects the aesthetic of the building itself, with its tilted facade, which reflects the life of the people in the plaza and on the sidewalk.\u201d So the quote is now inscribed above the door leading into the new theater. \nThe Joan & Edgar Booth Theatre , which adjoins the College of Fine Arts Production Center , officially opened on December 7. The 75,000-square-foot theater complex, designed by Elkus Manfredi Architects , has a 250-seat theater, production and costume shops, design labs, classrooms, faculty offices, and a landscaped plaza. It is the first time in decades that CFA performance and production students have been housed in the same location. \nThe building at 820 Commonwealth Ave.\u2014just across from CFA\u2014was funded in part by the University\u2019s 2016 sale of the BU Theatre , the longtime home of the Huntington Theatre Company. It was also where BU theater design and production students and faculty worked with Huntington staff to create scenery, props, and costumes, and acting students would occasionally perform. The new building also benefited enormously from a $10 million gift from BU trustee Steve Zide (LAW\u201986), who gave it in honor of his wife\u2019s parents, Joan and Edgar Booth. The Joan & Edgar Booth Theatre was designed for various configurations, with seating risers, a trap door, and motorized trusses for lighting and scenic elements. \n\u201cIt is exciting to have this new state-of-the-art theater as the centerpiece for the role that the students and faculty of the School of Theatre play in infusing the arts into our campus,\u201d says BU President Robert A. Brown. \u201cWe are honored that the theater bears the names of Joan and Edgar Booth, honoring the parents of Janet Zide. The gift from Janet and Steve made the theater a reality.\u201d \nPetosa, who is also a CFA professor of directing and dramatic criticism, says that in many cases, a new building stimulates the growth of a program, but in this case, CFA grew the program and then built a building to house it. He applauds Elkus Manfredi for delving into how School of Theatre students work, and then shaping the building to accommodate their needs. \u201cThey designed a building that utterly supported the excellence of the program,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like moving into a home that you have kind of lived in, hypothetically, but are now supported by the reality of a suitable home that reflects the values and the programs that inhabit it.\u201d \nThe Booth Theatre was designed for various configurations, with seating risers, a trap door, and motorized trusses for lighting and scenic elements. \u201cFrom an architect\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s like going from 2-D to 3-D,\u201d says architect Ross Cameron, an Elkus Manfredi senior associate. \u201cInstead of looking through the proscenium at something, it can be all around you. You can have a theater in the round, a runway, an end stage. It\u2019s really a highly technical, flexible space.\u201d These argon gas-filled windows come from Spain, says architect Ross Cameron, an Elkus Manfredi senior associate. \nAudiences will appreciate the theater\u2019s capabilities in February, when its first production, Eugene Ionesco\u2019s Rhinoceros , will be directed by Clay Hopper (CFA\u201905), a CFA lecturer in directing and theater arts and a Boston Center for American Performance artistic associate. Hopper says he can\u2019t think of a better play for the space. \u201cThe design team and I have been working to do justice to the play and to show what this theater can do,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an innovative space, and what we\u2019re excited about is how to utilize all its different capabilities. I\u2019m really excited to do this play there.\u201d \nIn April, Yo-EL Cassell , a CFA assistant professor of movement and a Commonwealth Shakespeare Company former resident choreographer, will direct the new School of Theatre initiative InMotion Theatre, which highlights storytelling through the lens of movement. The Booth Theatre \u201cplaying space is literally a director\u2019s dream,\u201d Cassell says. \u201cIt can transform its configuration to inform and inspire the intent of the production.\u201d \nCFA faculty members say they are particularly indebted to Steven Friedlander (CFA\u201980), president of performing arts planning and design firm Auerbach Pollock Friedlander, who has been the project\u2019s official theater consultant. His professional knowledge helped the faculty teaching-artists and the architecture team collaborate, Petosa says. \nSchool of Theatre assistant director McCaela Donovan says the new Joan & Edgar Booth Theatre and CFA Production Center is a huge asset in recruiting students to come to BU and helps the college stay among the top-ranked drama schools in the country. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen a bump in applications, and that will just continue as applicants tour the building and see productions in the space,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s stunning, state-of-the-art. We\u2019re excited that the administration sees how integral the arts can be.\u201d Boston University Joan & Edgar Booth Theatre \nWATCH: Jim Petosa, Director of the Boston University CFA School of Theatre, talks about the purpose-built design of the Joan & Edgar Booth Theatre and the College of Fine Arts Production Center. \uf44f This bold, modern complex encourages innovation, sparks cross-disciplinary collaboration, unifies the School of Theatre's Performance and Design & Production programs, and invites the BU community and beyond to interact with theatre performance. #myCFA #BUtheatre #BoothReflections Join us for our housewarming event on Thursday, 12/7 from 4-7pm at 820 Comm Ave!

Unlike the other so-called strategic investment fund, the notorious 1MDB, which has already lost the country almost all the long-term money it borrowed with US$7 billion (some RM28 billion) unaccounted for, Khazanah has been transformed since 2004 into a solid entity which has strong controls, procedures, a chain of accountability, and a team of competent professionals managing over RM145 billion in investments. It is not only extremely ironic but the height of ridiculousness that among the names being considered as Azman\u2019s replacement is Arul Kanda Kandasamy, the chief executive of 1MDB since January 2015, who has done nothing to clarify the sad state of affairs at 1MDB or even to ensure the release of its long overdue annual report. His appointment would make a mockery of Khazanah\u2019s much stronger governance, good board representation, greater accountability, more transparency and much better performance than 1MDB which may be too much to make even for Prime Minister Najib Razak, who if he survives the elections, will make the final decision. The major salvo against Khazanah, as with one or two other puzzling stories (see for instance, \u201c Spinning 1MDB\u2019s lopsided settlement \u201d), came from across the Causeway from the  Singapore Straits Times  which made an unfair and ultimately wrong assessment of Khazanah\u2019s performance over the years since 2004. In a report titled \u201cKhazanah feels the heat amid push to change its investment strategy\u201d, the newspaper said: \u201cMalaysia's sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional is under pressure to show higher returns to boost government coffers, with senior state officials lobbying for changes to its management and investment strategy.\u201d Then it went on to add: \u201cThe bulk of the government's direct business investments is managed by Khazanah, which has returned an average of just RM825 million (S$270 million) in dividends annually over the past four years, from its RM145 billion worth of assets. This amounts to a less than 1 percent return a year between 2013 and last year. \u201cThe  Straits Times  understands that there is a push by some within the Prime Minister Najib Razak's vast circle of advisers to change Khazanah's investment strategy, especially since the fund's managing director, Tan Sri Azman Mokhtar, is due to leave in mid-2019, after a 15-year run at the helm.\u201d Now, anyone who has the slightest knowledge of fund management should know that dividends alone is not the way to measure a fund\u2019s return. You have to take into account the increase in the value of investments that it owns and gains from investments sold. And why choose just the period from 2013 to 2016? A fund is best assessed over a longer period. Misleading analysis The best way to report a fund\u2019s performance is its total return - this is accepted as the  de facto  measure of fund performance in investment analysis. This includes realised as well as unrealised gains on investments plus dividends. Khazanah calls this the net worth adjusted (NWA) value. The other performance measure it uses is the realisable asset value (RAV), which is essentially the market value of all its investments. When you subtract the liabilities, mainly borrowings, from RAV, and make adjustments to account for dividends as well as realised investment gains through sales of investments, you obtain the NWA value. The  Singapore Straits Times  report pointed out that the NWA value actually declined eight percent over the last two years, but failed to point out that such fluctuations are normal and happen because of market and currency fluctuations amongst others. Unlike many other sovereign wealth funds, Khazanah has many large core holdings such as Tenaga Nasional, Telekom Malaysia, Axiata, CIMB, IHH Healthcare, etc, which it holds through good and bad times and when the market rises or falls. Market volatility plays havoc with NWA. In 2008 for instance, in the aftermath of the world financial crisis, its NWA value tanked nearly 50% as markets collapsed but recovered by 68% and 39% respectively in the following two years, 2009 and 2010, as markets recovered. It would be wrong to think that Khazanah did badly in 2008 and well in 2009 and 2010 - the events that led to the fall and rise were beyond its control. To prevent that kind of misleading analysis, it is common to compare fund performance over a period of time and against a set benchmark - for Khazanah that benchmark, because most of its holdings are Malaysian, would be the Kuala Lumpur stock market which is measured by the FBM KLCI index. As Khazanah pointed out in  its retort  to the Singapore  Straits Times  report, its NWA value increased annually by 9.3% on a compounded basis between 2004 and 2016 which is very much in line with the FBM KLCI index growth of 9.4% over the same period. During the period the NWA value of its investments rose over two times to RM102.1 billion from RM33.3 billion, creating value of RM68.9 billion. In contrast, 1MDB destroyed nearly half of the value Khazanah created over 12 years in less than a handful of years. That 9.3% annual compounded growth of NWA over 2004-2016 - the best measure of Khazanah\u2019s performance - was mentioned towards the end of the  Singapore Straits Times  article. And even then, the article mentioned it was lower than the performance of the broad market without actually giving the 9.4% figure. This figure is pretty alright considering that many of Khazanah\u2019s investments have long gestation periods such as the Iskandar corridor development and others may be historically making losses, for example, Proton, Malaysia Airlines and Silterra. Erroneous comparison Further, the article makes an erroneous comparison between Khazanah and the Employees Provident Fund. It said: \u201cThe fund performs poorly when compared with the country's Employees Provident Fund (EPF), which all private workers and employers must contribute to. Since Mr Azman took over Khazanah in 2004, it has returned a total of RM9 billion in dividends, which works out to an average annual return of below 1 percent of the fund size. Meanwhile, the EPF has added more than 5 percent annually to its members' retirement savings.\u201d The EPF has a major part of its investments invested in government bonds, much of which give fixed returns over 4% per year. It supplements this by booking in realised profits from its equity trading and other businesses - it has no strategic holdings. Thus it can return close to 5% in dividends but the value of its funds don\u2019t increase as much, if you take out increased contributions from members. The correct comparison should be between the 9.3% annual return and the EPF dividend rate of 5% plus any unrealised gains. Also, the article makes a comparison, again erroneous, comparing pre-tax profit as a percentage of total asset size with other funds. It said: \u201cKhazanah's profit before tax - not including unrealised capital gains - also lags behind those of its peers, such as Singapore's Temasek Holdings, China Investment Corporation (CIC), Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation (APFC) and the world's largest sovereign fund, Norway's Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG).\u201d But the key phrase there is \u201cnot including unrealised capital gains\u201d - as a strategic investment fund, it holds stakes in sizeable companies that it does not sell off. The others play no such role and are free to take profits from their investments as and when they see fit. Overall, the  Singapore Straits Times  article is rather unbalanced and lopsided, and looks very much like it was planted there via the provision of selective information by those who want to smear Khazanah\u2019s name and have their own agendas in terms of lobbying for some people to take over when Azman\u2019s term ends. That article has been picked up and quoted widely among the press in Malaysia, both online and print, and has had its intended effect by those who may have planted it there. It is however lamentable that a respected publication in terms of reporting regional affairs has been so used. Meantime, one hopes the powers-that-be don\u2019t try to fix what isn\u2019t broken and continue to give support for Khazanah to operate conservatively and competently with proper checks, balances and accountability, unlike what has happened at 1MDB. To do anything otherwise is to rain down more suspicion and lack of confidence on a country already beleaguered by a plethora of governance ills and all that comes with it such as market and currency weakness. We simply can\u2019t afford another fund debacle. \nP GUNASEGARAM was head of equity research at foreign and local brokerages and holds the Chartered Financial Analyst designation issued by the CFA Institute of the US.

If you will be late, the earlier you let us know, the better! Be reliable - long-term attendance is a must. We are not looking for players that will not be around in a few months due to school or work schedules changing. Be willing to cooperate and coordinate. We are more concerned with your ability to work well with us than your ability to be a badass. Be more concerned with steady progress rather than hardcore rushing and pushing. Be mature. We are an adult guild and make adult jokes and use non-PG language. If that is not ok with you, you will not be happy here. Know your class. You don't need to be an expert, but you should always be willing to improve! Discord voice chat is required during raid times. We would prefer an ilvl of 905+\nWhat We Offer :\nA friendly and helpful home for mature players looking for a great atmosphere and a new home. Our Discord server is active all throughout the day with everything from strategizing to friendly banter. Most of our members are US-based professionals and as such are not necessarily in-game at all hours. We achieve Ahead of the Curve reliably, but are not pushing Mythic progression.\nFeel free to contact me ( via Discord at Fiyera#1875 or on BattleNet at Fiyera#1122 ) or my fellow recruitment officer Icy ( via BattleNet at MisfitHeros#1239 ) if you have any questions or just want to find out more about Divination!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:09.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bc80eeb3330b4fe373aad9ea6ff00cc04ed7b520", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gfBslnDni2K3Bc6RcZEe0wA-", "site_full": "us.battle.net", "site": "battle.net", "site_section": "https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/1011639/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Guild Recruitment - World of Warcraft Forums", "title": "Holy Priest and Lock LF Guild", "title_full": "Holy Priest and Lock LF Guild - World of Warcraft Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T13:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.153, "main_image": "/forums/static/images/social-thumbs/wow.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 462, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b812583b5f1dd263dddbc7293614b075e332dbb9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gfBslnDni2K31X_RI2zyUN38XiSvKOzGgg--", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Dieslowly", "published": "2017-12-07T16:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "(H) veracity is 11/11N in Antorus and looking for more to fill out our roster.\nveracity is lead by mythic raiders from previous raid tiers and expansions.

We'd like a group who knows this is just a game, but is also able to manage their time in raid wisely.\nPerson 1 - Holy Priest - 937 ilvl\nPerson 2 - Ele Shaman - 943 ilvl\nWe can raid any day, starting around 9:30pm EST at the earliest please, ending around 1am EST\nPlease add me to btag so we can chat more!\nRoman#12204", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:09.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f8c6d65844e67a4ac58c363a572113744056826", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p.OPtisgNi8g.a5RNyw_HmsO7q6bAV8.8", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/qst/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/qst/ - Quests - 4chan", "title": "Boruto Quest 71", "title_full": "/qst/ - Boruto Quest 71 - Quests - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-05T06:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 202, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.017, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "847f6fed5c099013c28c69928a6337a9e491be7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p.OPtisgNi8g.a5RNyw_Hmpr91HR7Bt6FuCx1ftGxmIY-", "ord_in_thread": 201, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>2127924\nFor the brief few minutes he remains alive.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:09.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bebce33f7241c5db383aaffc9adbe520948c8358", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21QfeDtp3iMIdhZp7t508uHK.mImRvjmFxACZzYe0XbuKoD_dOVT8mh9Jfqvr6HdD2gRtcruoOnDzQ--", "site_full": "art-is-jokken.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://art-is-jokken.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "art is jok(k)e(n)", "title": "Evolution I", "title_full": "Evolution I", "published": "2017-06-18T09:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2fbb7fc4dda1e2403cc244a64537699443c39c2f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21QfeDtp3iMIdhZp7t508uHK.mImRvjmFxACZzYe0XbuKoD_dOVT8mh9Jfqvr6HdD2gzJUmBdXSfBRG1rKf1A3I9", "ord_in_thread": 11, "author": "Karthik Reddy", "published": "2017-12-07T10:23:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "This lines are fabulous and interesting meaning. we are offering MCX TIPS FREE , 100% accurate tips and ACCURATE MCX TIPS .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:09.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0a0101f7afe8b69e4efedfe289ae57ac941d0573", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT.JzkJu_t78zmWOpzDvXSK2uWOeDggAq_2V0cJC.sLcFNxHcW8J4.mFT5DJZr2i0ZLsNloz0Jsjj.SHy7J45_a", "site_full": "play.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://play.google.com/store", "site_categories": ["media", "hobbies_and_interests", "comic_books"], "section_title": "Android Apps on Google Play", "title": "Snapchat", "title_full": "Snapchat - Android Apps on Google Play", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 39, "participants_count": 35, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "298d01d5d1b1535cb4f15ed480ebf9fbd5b31dad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT.JzkJu_t78zmWOpzDvXSK2uWOeDggAq_2V0cJC.sLcFNxHcW8J4.mFT5DJZr2i0ZLsNloz0Jsjr2BLSj69FgiqlcUa5jpJi.qOpXHDTGlMQHliGYa26q0g4DRvysFNtkK1m1Ujo3DHZsvjMOT9o5YZMU5KVCv6i4.xEDuXxnvPPKdsROAAc5PNl_GmlNOTopamD0Fs8ZDx9elzoIYcwJDZwP9vM0Mx_lonWkrtb8hJ8ikNi5fESLgRNGBRsfpdKbf8OJT3w4Kvw--", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Noel Appleton", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Just another social media thing that draws in children to it dark under world and make millennials look like retards because they take stupid pictures and send them out to strangers!

China is about the only other country in the world that does everything as big as the US. \n\nHe also told me he couldn\u2019t get over how much stuff there is to buy in the US\u2026 and how easy it is. \n\nHe\u2019s absolutely right. The US is an amazing place for a number of reasons; it\u2019s modern, generally safe, and boasts a high standard of living. \n\nAnd, yes, as a consumer, it\u2019s one of the best places in the world. \n\n(Though I would suggest that there are parts of Asia that are even better; Hong Kong, for example, has a similar selection of goods and services from all over the world, yet ZERO tax.) \n\nYou can buy just about anything you want in the US, and with so many retailers competing for your business, the service, ease, and efficiency of buying anything is nearly unparalleled. \n\nThe US economy is almost DESIGNED for consumption. And, while convenient, this is a pretty bad thing over the long term. \n\nReal wealth is created, and sustained, through production. Not consumption. \n\nThis isn\u2019t exactly rocket science-- our ancient ancestors figured this out 10,000+ years ago during the agricultural revolution. \n\nThey learned that, in order to survive and prosper, they had to produce more food than they could consume. \n\nI call this the Universal Law of Prosperity. And if our ancestors hadn\u2019t followed this principle, none of our modern civilization would exist today. We\u2019d still be cave men, hunting and gathering for survival. \n\nBut the Universal Law of Prosperity is no longer the law of the land in the US. \n\nAny high school economics student knows that 70% of US GDP is comprised of consumer spending. The common refrain that \u2018the US consumer drives the economy\u2019 is absolutely true. \n\nEarly in its history, the United States was a producer economy. Americans made stuff. Exported it. Saved their money. And reinvested. \n\nMost of the country\u2019s wealth and economic dominance was established in those early years. \n\nThings started to change after World War II. \n\nThe US dollar had just become the global reserve currency under the new Bretton Woods system, and the US economy had become the world\u2019s most dominant and powerful. \n\nAmericans began spending their newfound wealth, and soon the rest of the world grew to depend on the insatiable appetite of the US consumer. \n\nEntire nations began basing their economic models on exporting to the US. \n\nUS consumption kept growing\u2026 at all levels. Individuals started spending far more than they earned. \n\nThe US savings rate plummeted, and even reached NEGATIVE territory for a number of years. Household debt ballooned as Americans borrowed money at record levels to buy more stuff. \n\nThe government did the same. The national debt exploded as bureaucrats squandered the public\u2019s savings in almost legendary exploits, from that infamous $2 billion Obamacare website to the 6+ trillion in fake accounting at the Defense Department. \n\nUltimately it\u2019s all consumption; the entire economic system is effectively milking the wealth and prosperity that was created in the past, like a trust fund baby that blows through his family\u2019s fortune. \n\nAnd while it\u2019s really great to be a consumer in the US, it\u2019s becoming more difficult to be a producer. \n\nCase in point-- according to a recent study by the Institute for Justice, about 1 in 4 workers in the US now requires some special government license. That\u2019s up from 1 in 20 workers back in the 1950s. \n\nMany of these are in low income, blue collar professions. And much of the time the requirements are totally irrational. \n\nThe average time required to qualify for a barber\u2019s license, for example, is 415 days. For an interior designer, it\u2019s an unbelievable 2,190 days. \n\nThese licenses don\u2019t exactly make the world a better place; they\u2019re mostly just bureaucratic obstacles that make it more difficult for lower-income workers to be productive. \n\nWe\u2019re also seeing worrying trends with consumer debt, which is now at an all-time high. \n\nThis essentially means that Americans are borrowing from the future in order to buy stuff today, and doing so at record levels. \n\nCredit card debt is at an all-time high. Auto loans are at an all-time high. Delinquencies (i.e. people who aren\u2019t paying their loan balances) are RISING. \n\nAnd the savings rate is once again plummeting, down to its lowest level in more than a decade. \n\nOn top of that, the US trade deficit continues to grow, all while the federal government massively outspends its income. \n\nThe national debt is now $20.5 trillion, and overall debt growth far exceeds GDP growth. \n\nOh, and the government is staring at yet another debt ceiling / government shutdown debacle in just 48-hours. \n\nThis time is not different. History is full of examples of formerly wealthy, prosperous nations which fell into terminal crisis because they favored a system built on debt and consumption, rather than savings and production. \n\nI don\u2019t want to suggest that this is an imminent crisis. It\u2019s not. \n\nBut it is a troubling, high-impact, long-term trend. And it\u2019s worth ensuring that you have a backup plan. \n\nIf all of your assets and all of your income depend exclusively on a heavily indebted nation with a bankrupt government continuing to persist forever without any consequences, you\u2019re probably taking some unnecessary risks. \n\nA good plan B involves simple, rational, legal, cost-effective (or often FREE) steps to ensure that you\u2019ll always have a good option, no matter what happens (or doesn\u2019t happen) next. \n\nTo your freedom, Simon Black Founder, SovereignMan.com ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "simon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simon black", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simon black founder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "first impressions of america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defense department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institute for justice", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "santiago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:10.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4da28f9b29bb8ec2aea3374d133b048ed19d70d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1py5OhbMjOFme3qxZtuKnGYpSXDSK9Rq32", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/out/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/out/ - Outdoors - 4chan", "title": "Tarps ridge lines", "title_full": "/out/ - Tarps ridge lines - Outdoors - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T07:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.177, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d4fe0a43734a003a4a3a0b192a0b749085a664a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1py5OhbMjOFme3qxZtuKnGYh6WNuq7rMLDR1UNFI7gxtM-", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T13:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "2mm or 3mm static line.

ABB achieves breakthrough with world\u2019s most powerful HVDC transformer ABB writes next chapter in electrical history as transformers and key equipment for world\u2019s first 1,100 kilovolt (kV) project in China pass stringent tests \nABB has set another pioneering innovation record with the successful testing of the low and high voltage units of the world\u2019s most powerful ultrahigh-voltage direct current (UHVDC) transformer. The +/-1,100 kV (1.1 million volts) UHVDC transformer, developed and manufactured in close collaboration with State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), has successfully passed a series of type tests, paving the way for the implementation of the Changji-Guquan UHVDC link, which will transmit power from the Xinjiang region in the Northwest, to Anhui province in eastern China. \nChangji-Guquan, the world\u2019s first +/-1,100 kV UHVDC link will set a new world record in terms of voltage level, transmission capacity and distance. It will be capable of transporting 12,000 megawatts of electricity - the equivalent of 12 large power plants and 50 percent more than the +/- 800 kV UHVDC links currently in operation. Transmission distance will be extended from around 2,000 kilometers (km) to over 3,000 km, enabling the integration and transmission of remote renewables on a much larger scale. \nWhen fully operational this UHVDC link will be able to feed eight 500 kV and two 1,000 kV AC lines \u2013 delivering power equivalent to twice the average annual power consumption of Switzerland. ABB\u2019s latest breakthrough also makes it possible to connect +/-1,100 kV DC with 750 kV UHVAC links for the first time. In addition to the transformer, ABB has also developed and successfully tested a range of other key +/-1,100 kV components, including converter valves, bushings and DC circuit breakers. \n\u201cIn addition to transporting more power across longer distances with lower losses, this breakthrough will enable the interconnection of AC and DC grids and support the future linking of regions and countries.\u201d said Claudio Facchin, president of ABB\u2019s Power Grids division. \u201cIt reinforces our pioneering technology leadership in HVDC transmission and reaffirms our close collaboration with SGCC, as we enable a stronger, smarter and greener grid\u201d. \n\u201cThe Changji-Guquan +/-1,100kV project is a major technical step-up making it the world\u2019s highest DC voltage. The transformer is a key element of this link and we are pleased that the first of these landmark transformers have passed critical tests and exceeded expectations. I would like to congratulate the teams from ABB and SGCC on this successful achievement\u201d said Mr. Liu ZeHong, Executive Vice President, SGCC. \nChina has major consumption centers in the east, while a significant amount of its energy resources are in the west and northwest. The expansive geography and increasing demand have prompted the build-up of ultrahigh voltage links to increase transmission capacity while minimizing losses. \nABB pioneered HVDC technology more than 60 years ago and is the global market leader with over 110 HVDC projects, representing a total installed capacity of more than 120,000 megawatts - around half of the world\u2019s installed base. UHVDC transmission is an advancement of HVDC and represents the biggest capacity and efficiency leap in over two decades. In 2010 ABB supported SGCC with the Xiangjiaba-Shanghai project, the world\u2019s first +/- 800 kV UHVDC link to go into commercial operation. \nABB (ABBN: SIX Swiss Ex) is a pioneering technology leader in electrification products, robotics and motion, industrial automation and power grids, serving customers in utilities, industry and transport & infrastructure globally. Continuing more than a 125-year history of innovation, ABB today is writing the future of industrial digitalization and driving the Energy and Fourth Industrial Revolutions. ABB operates in more than 100 countries with about 136,000 employees. www.abb.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "liu zehong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "changji-guquan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "claudio facchin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "abb ltd abb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state grid corporation of china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "energy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "power grids", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "zurich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northwest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xiangjiaba-shanghai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anhui", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xinjiang", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:11.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5b1633f2438b32bbc4703171e1c692422d7d6ec5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMr7LUzpl3YeSmJfuTnyn13GsO9QfmP_LxYkIXGTcjltzczo.L22LmP7Oqoo1vcHye_Ipgkgp835L2HTxSrj67o5", "site_full": "texasfishingforum.com", "site": "texasfishingforum.com", "site_section": "http://texasfishingforum.com/forums/ubbthreads.php/forums/27/1/", "site_categories": ["saltwater_fishing", "freshwater_fishing", "fly_fishing", "sports"], "section_title": "Kayak Fishing | Texas Fishing Forum", "title": "Old pictures", "title_full": "Old pictures | Kayak Fishing | Texas Fishing Forum", "published": "2017-11-23T13:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.57, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e9266a741b2402862bdf4e3446eaad23e4d1cd9e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMr7LUzpl3YeSmJfuTnyn13GsO9QfmP_LxYkIXGTcjltzczo.L22LmP7Oqoo1vcHye_Ipgkgp835LycsYRUSxxOBhKUkiILhysM-", "ord_in_thread": 10, "author": "lconn4", "published": "2017-12-06T09:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "More from Flamingo\nNegative tide day.

It might be the largest accumulation of oyster bars in all the Everglades, over 300 acres in the one spot with very short paddle from ramp. It was a maze of bars with very few ways out and no forgiveness to fiberglass boats. Great top water fishing for snook, trout, and redfish. Would fish all the way to the furthest shore in last picture (looking south) then catch the main channel out 2 miles through the mangroves to the outside islands on the Gulf of Mexico where the tarpon would usually hang out. Later on you would ride the incoming tide back to the oyster bars and fish it again. What a place!\nAccidental catch\nTook this picture looking back over Chokolosske Bay after losing a monster snook in that mangrove root.\nEdited by lconn4 ( 11/30/17 07:11 PM )", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:11.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5b1633f2438b32bbc4703171e1c692422d7d6ec5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMr7LUzpl3YeSmJfuTnyn13GsO9QfmP_LxYkIXGTcjltzczo.L22LmP7Oqoo1vcHye_Ipgkgp835L2HTxSrj67o5", "site_full": "texasfishingforum.com", "site": "texasfishingforum.com", "site_section": "http://texasfishingforum.com/forums/ubbthreads.php/forums/27/1/", "site_categories": ["saltwater_fishing", "freshwater_fishing", "fly_fishing", "sports"], "section_title": "Kayak Fishing | Texas Fishing Forum", "title": "Old pictures", "title_full": "Old pictures | Kayak Fishing | Texas Fishing Forum", "published": "2017-11-23T13:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.57, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5405bab8ac4204d819f0e823843b38f98ece544f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMr7LUzpl3YeSmJfuTnyn13GsO9QfmP_LxYkIXGTcjltzczo.L22LmP7Oqoo1vcHye_Ipgkgp835LycsYRUSxxOB12ECFyuRjx8-", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "lconn4", "published": "2017-12-05T23:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I think these were taken at least 12 years ago. The southern entrance into the Everglades, at Flamingo. My favorite place to ever fish. Always enjoyed being there with approaching rains as it seemed I always had the place to myself, especially in the summer when the mosquitoes were so bad that hardly anyone every went and the few that did were all off the water well before dark.\nThe channel marker into Snake Bight, one of the most famous fishing areas in the Everglades. You never knew until you got there if the grass would be stacked up from the wind and tides. Never knew what you would catch.. snook, trout, tarpon, triple tail, bonefish, mangrove snapper, sawfish, grouper, permit. Before I ever fished there had always read and heard from guides about how hard the fish fought there, as if the fish were meaner. It's absolutely true. Even the manatees were meaner there. Everything is on edge.. with sharks, crocodiles, and burmese python all sharing the same waters, it gives the place an surreal feeling. If I had a wish it would be that anyone taking a trip so south Florida would check Flamingo out. I love the Keys but for getting away from civilization and getting your adrenaline pumping, there is no place like it.\nThe video below references the fight of the Everglades tarpon. For someone with some time and a kayak, I can't think of a more exciting place to fish.\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/w4yFrD2L8jq\nEdited by lconn4 ( 12/05/17 03:25 PM )", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://goo.gl/maps/w4yFrD2L8jq", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgVOYY1oPJI"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:11.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0a0101f7afe8b69e4efedfe289ae57ac941d0573", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT.JzkJu_t78zmWOpzDvXSK2uWOeDggAq_2V0cJC.sLcFNxHcW8J4.mFT5DJZr2i0ZLsNloz0Jsjj.SHy7J45_a", "site_full": "play.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://play.google.com/store", "site_categories": ["media", "hobbies_and_interests", "comic_books"], "section_title": "Android Apps on Google Play", "title": "Snapchat", "title_full": "Snapchat - Android Apps on Google Play", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 39, "participants_count": 35, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9fbafeb8c5595d6bae3500b0646433ce8593bce4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT.JzkJu_t78zmWOpzDvXSK2uWOeDggAq_2V0cJC.sLcFNxHcW8J4.mFT5DJZr2i0ZLsNloz0Jsjr2BLSj69FgiqlcUa5jpJi.qOpXHDTGlMQHliGYa26q05ftK5dlXwALSldbqHuWHEZNWv4rQbrsOZhFS4A6K4eoqjO2VFo0fe43FurAJHwgHHmf2V1Tm4YW2HE6.coQsEqlesUlO.J6JMhmHUFdR73QEpPFw48AttUoF5HAqIj266ktYWSuRC3YL9HLgUuTAuw--", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "Tam Truong", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "It seems that the app can't properly support my Note 8.

Dec. 6, 2017 3:06 pm By Thom Hartmann A... \nCan the President be convicted of high crimes and misdemeanors while sitting in office? If Mueller finds something, will Republicans call for impeachment?The President has a certain level of what's referred to as sovereign immunity but does that extend to the President actually committing crimes, particularly before he was in office? Because some of these allegations are coming from late December of last year.For example, the Logan Act violations.The Logan Act is a law that was passed in 1799. It's a real old law and what they were concerned about back then was, first of all you had about a third of America who'd been opposed to the American Revolution to begin with and still wanted us to be part of England. And the founders and framers and the early legislators were very conscious of that.So probably by the time the Logan Act was passed there was a broad consensus that this is America, but they were worried about anybody trying to go out and do foreign policy on behalf of the United States when foreign policy is the province of the President of the Executive Branch, the State Department.And so the law says that if you're engaging in foreign policy with a foreign government, you have broken the law. Now, only two people have ever been prosecuted under the Logan Act in the 200 years it's been on the law books and nobody's ever been convicted.But it looks like that's the big one, that Kushner and Flynn may have breached by talking to the Russian ambassador and saying don't overreact to the sanctions that President Obama's putting in. Keep in mind, Barack Obama was President of the United States at the time that Mike Flynn was reaching out to the Russians and saying don't freak out about the sanctions.That's a fairly clear Logan Act violation for Flynn.If Trump ordered it, it's also a clear Logan Act violation for Trump.I'm very skeptical that they would prosecute him for this, particularly given the fact that nobody has ever been successfully prosecuted under this law. That's the biggest problem although the Supreme Court reaffirmed in 1991 in a case before the court that the Logan Act is still a viable thing.But the principal way that you hold the President accountable for pretty much anything is through the process of impeachment and there is a conviction that happens in the United States Senate. Bill Clinton was not convicted - his conviction was short one vote. Same with President Andrew Johnson in 1868, who'd been Abraham Lincoln's Vice President.So it seems to me that the principal vehicle that we have to focus on would probably be impeachment.Now there's a third option, too, that is not a criminal one, it's not a legal one, it's not using the courts - and that's the 25th Amendment . And that's if the Vice President and the Cabinet or a majority of the Cabinet agree that the President is \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\" then they submit that to the House of Representatives. The House representatives vote on it and boom, the President is gone and the Vice President becomes becomes the President.So we'll just have to wait and see.We're in one of those points in time right now where we really don't know what Mueller has on these guys or what he might still get. So there's still a way to go and let's just hang on.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thom hartmann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kushner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike flynn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abraham lincoln", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flynn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cabinet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "executive branch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "logan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:12.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "40d3303f6e7a87eaabc1cfa742fdbc21aa48338b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Oca8bGAWd_R_LOcAxBQDSlvHujODIFDxeSqr1pQXjGWn6dLzNDq1dxw7O7fjegko6cJhoQG12tA--", "site_full": "www.allischalmers.com", "site": "allischalmers.com", "site_section": "http://www.allischalmers.com/forum/forum_topics.asp?FID=2", "site_categories": ["vehicles", "auto_parts"], "section_title": "Farm Equipment - AllisChalmers Forum - Page 1", "title": "steering wheel shaft", "title_full": "steering wheel shaft - AllisChalmers Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T02:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cc4f796bbd251cb82a62906ce218e33f3a4ee087", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Oca8bGAWd_R_LOcAxBQDSlvHujODIFDxeSqr1pQXjGWn6dLzNDq1dxw7O7fjegkqcm71mnUjnnhbqbIdggthh", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "OK, I have an offer for someone to buy the entire steering sector minus the steering wheel, So, Ted if you want this shaft you have 24 hours to let me know.

The MatchUp project seeks to facilitate this urban transformation process by leveraging innovative solutions in the field of energy, mobility and ICT areas, with the involvement of citizens. \nCovenant of Mayors signatories of Valencia (Spain), Dresden (Germany) and Antalya (Turkey) are leading the project as \"Lighthouse cities\" and will cooperate with a wide variety of stakeholders to implement their transformation strategies: universities, local utilities, innovation centers, businesses... Moreover, the Covenant cities of Oostende (Belgium) and Skopje (FYR Macedonia), as well as the cities of Kerava (Finland) and Herzliya (Israel), will learn from the experiences of the \"Lighthouse cities\" and adapt their strategies to fit to their own local circumstances. \nThe MatchUp project will establish a close link with   framework , by developing a methodology that will enable the cities involved in the project to upgrade their existing 2020 Covenant action plans (SEAPs) to 2030 SECAPs, improve existing SECAPs or even develop a new SECAP. Thanks to MatchUp, Oostende and Skopje will be supported in shifting their SEAPs to SECAPs. Kerava and Herzliya will commit to the 2030 objectives of the Covenant during the project lifetime and be accompanied in the creation of their SECAPs. \nAs regards the project's Lighthouse cities Valencia, Dresden and Antalya, these Covenant signatories want to use MatchUp to implement projects to boost the livability, environment and economic opportunities of their territories. Valencia will improve several of its neighbourhoods with strong energy conservation, clean energy production and climate adaptation measures. For its mayor Juan Rib\u00f3, the goal is to place Valencia \"at the European forefront of comprehensive urban regeneration\" . \nDresden , the first European city with more than 250 000 inhabitants to have submitted a SECAP , will leverage through inclusive policymaking the CO2-emission reduction potential of its municipal stakeholders, as these can influence directly 70% of Dresden's emissions. Furthermore, the MatchUp project will enable the city to \"implement a Smart City infrastructure that reduces our impact on the environment and address citizen's needs to create a high quality of life\" , according to Mayor Dirk Hilbert. \nThrough its involvement in MatchUp, Antalya wants to become \"a Smart Cities role model for Southern Europe and the Middle East\" , as Mayor Menderes T\u00fcrel says. This Turkish coastal city will use the project to harness notably its incredible solar rooftop potential, estimated at around 1,5 billion MWh. Furthermore, Antalya will implement widespread improvements for its Kepez Smart City district, one of the largest urban regeneration projects in Turkey. Kepez's economic potential is valued a EUR 1,7 billion, and will offer a home to 80,000 residents by 2019.

Charity Commission \nNAO report \nThe National Audit Office has published its report on the progress made by the Charity Commission since 2015. The Commission press release welcoming the report flags a number of key findings including that the Commission is: becoming a more risk-based regulator \u2013 referencing the launch of its Risk Assessment Unit and its refreshed risk framework securing new powers and using them effectively \u2013 evidenced by the reduced challenges it faces in the First Tier Tribunal (Charity) and the reduction in the average length of its investigations offering improved services \u2013 including the launch of a new registration system that has reduced waiting times despite significant increases in registration applications working more effectively with others \u2013 including improved external engagement with charities on key projects and an increased number of memoranda of understanding with key partner organisations and agencies \nSpeech by Helen Stephenson to the Charity Law Association Conference \nSee here for the text of the Charity Commission's Chief Executive\u2019s speech at the Charity Law Association\u2019s Annual Conference last week. \nGrenfell Tower \nThe Commission has published this information about the funds that have been raised, and how they have been distributed.

It includes for example that the trustee benefit and dissolution clauses in the new CIO constitution must mirror what is in the Articles of the converting company. Governance \nFollowing the recommendation in \u201c Taken on Trust\u201d report (2017) that \u2018all key stakeholders in the charity sector should review and enhance their advice, support and communications to reflect and draw upon developments in digital technology', Tesse Akpeki of BWB\u2019s On Board has published \u201c Ten things that trustees can do relating to digital \u201d. \nAlso see under Northern Ireland below. Audit and accounting \nHM Treasury has issued a response to its consultation published in August 2017 seeking views on draft regulations to increase the thresholds at or below which a co-operative and community benefit society may disapply the requirement to undertake an audit in respect of a financial year. The government received 12 responses to the consultation, the majority of which were supportive of the proposals. Accordingly, the government has decided to proceed with the proposals to increase the thresholds at which co-operatives and community benefit societies are required to appoint an auditor from \u00a35.6 million turnover and \u00a32.8 million assets to \u00a310.2 million turnover and \u00a35.1 million in assets.

Brexit \nHealth and social care \nOver 50 third sector organisations have backed an SNP amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill calling for a review of the impact of Brexit on health and care systems across the UK. The amendment is due to be heard as MPs debate the laws repatriated from the European Union after Britain leaves. The sector is concerned about the impact on staff from the EU, a decline in funding for medical research and levels of funding for services. Fundraising \nFundraising Regulator \nThe Fundraising Regulator has published two anonymous case studies about complaints it has investigated: Case Study 9 \u2013 A complaint that a charity was unable to verify that an individual fundraising on its behalf was genuine (Upheld) Case Study 10 - A complaint that the content of a mailing sent by a charity was potentially disturbing and that the charity continued to send the individual mailings despite being asked to remove him from the mailing list (Partly upheld) \nConsultation on Code \nJust a reminder that the current Code consultation closes on Friday 8th December. \nLegacies and GDPR \nBates Wells Braithwaite and the Institute of Legacy Management (ILM) have collaborated to produce a new factsheet focusing on the implications of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for legacy management professionals.

Social finance \nPioneer\u2019s Post shares Peter Holbrook\u2019s (CEO of Social Enterprise UK) response to the government\u2019s Industrial Strategy published last week. Holbrook considers it time to move responsibility for social enterprise to BEIS so that \u201cour voice can be heard and our ideas considered\u201d. He believes the Office for Civil Society is unable to exert any influence over BEIS for the benefit of the sector and the wider society. \nMelanie Mills (Social Sector Engagement Director, Big Society Capital) shares her views on helping social enterprises and charities understand more about social investment and when it might be the right type of funding. Social impact \nThis is an interesting blog about NPC\u2019s Data Labs project, the aim of which is to enable charities and other organisations working in areas like criminal justice, health, education, employment, to understand the effectiveness of their interventions. The design makes use of government administrative data. The outcomes for the people a charity works with (such as whether or not they go on to re-offend) are compared with the outcomes of a group of individuals who share similar characteristics but who haven\u2019t accessed the charity\u2019s services. \nSee under Culture and creative below.

The inquiry will also investigate the ease at which individuals from socially disadvantaged backgrounds can access good quality training and apprenticeship opportunities. The Committee will be accepting written submissions until 5 January 2018. Health \nSee item under Brexit above. \nThe Access to Innovation Fund is a new grant fund focussed on supporting people with early stage innovative ideas with the aim of enhancing patient care and supporting the NHS. Although applications regarding the management of long term conditions are encouraged, other areas will also be considered. The fund is a grant from Boehringer Ingelheim Ltd but will be independently administered and distributed by the Apperta Foundation. Successful applications must be through social enterprises \u2013 for more details see here . Housing and homelessness \nCommunities Secretary Sajid Javid has set out details of a new Rough Sleeping Advisory Panel that will help develop a national strategy as part of the government\u2019s commitment to halve rough sleeping by 2022 and eliminate it altogether by 2027.

The response was provided by the Minister for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, Mike Hancock MP. See here for a recording. Procurement \nBEIS has published a report \u201c Leveraging Public Procurement to Grow the Innovation Economy: An Independent Review of the Small Business Research Initiative by David Connell; Final Report and Recommendations \u201d. This follows a review and consultation on how the government can maximise the impact of the Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI), particularly in relation to improving procurement outcomes for government, supporting innovation by SMEs and the development of new technology-based products and services.

many things you can learn about this great tasting drink. Getting the facts right is only half the fun and learning about how to serve, taste or enjoy wine can make your night complete. The following article will focus on some great tips that will help you enjoy your next bottle of wine!\nRead up as much as you can on wine through books and magazines.

This will help you to decide what wines you want to buy if you have yet to try them.\nMake sure you attend several wine tastings. They\u2019re fun and can help you discover new tastes. You can also use the opportunity to socialize. Find friends who enjoy wine too and have them come with you. You may develop a better relationship with those you love while also enjoying something that you love.\n\nTrust yourself when you experiment with wine. For instance, should you have a friend who swears by a particular wine, you may not enjoy that type of wine. Don\u2019t head out to buy it based only on their suggestion. This only ends up in wasted money on bottles you won\u2019t enjoy.\nIf you buy boxed wine, you can filter this into a nice glass decanter to improve the way that it looks. This is a great trick that you can use if you have to serve friends at a party or dinner. This will allow you to save money while giving off an elegant image.\nAll wines do not taste good while at the same temperature. White wines are better when they are cold, while red wines should be a little below room temperature. Drinking them at the wrong temperature can change the way they are supposed to take, which may change your overall opinion.\nIf you find a wine, you enjoy a lot, consider buying a case or two of it. A case of wine is almost always less expensive per bottle than buying each bottle individually. You can keep the wine for yourself and enjoy it on a regular basis, or you can have it on hand to give as gifts.\nIf you are interested in visiting a winery, make plans ahead of time. Set your budget ahead of time and be prepared with a designated driver before you arrive. Also, be prepared to describe the wines that you prefer and have questions on hand for the guide.\nWhy not travel to the vineyard? To appreciate the various grape flavors, you must see how and where they\u2019re harvested. You\u2019ll gain an idea of the origins of the wines and what creates their flavor. Places they make wine are pretty; you will enjoy yourself.\nServe your wine at the right temperature to get the most flavor from each glassful. Red wine is best and more flavorful at about 60 degrees. Start at 58 degrees so warming can occur. The ideal temperature for white wine is 47 degrees. Serving a white wine too warm can result in a dull taste.\nCarry a map or some sort of direction for your given area. Some of the best wine venues are incredibly organized and easy to navigate, while others are chaotic and will lose you in the twits-and-turns. Print off a map of your designated area, and you\u2019ll never miss that perfect shop just around the bend.\nSweet wines are referred to as dessert wine. They often have alcoholic additives in them to make the flavor even bolder. This creates a syrup-like wine which is great in small doses. Pairing source web page with a savory dessert creates the best course of the meal, so try it at your next dinner party.\nServe your wine in beautiful, elegant stemware that fits the type of wine and the occasion. You have to have clean glasses which look great. If your glassware has chips or looks cheap, it\u2019s time to replace it.\nAs you know, how you chill your wine can affect the taste as well as the aroma. However, wine is best served cold before a special occasion. Store the bottle of wine in a bucket filled with ice. This will chill the bottle in thirty minutes and it will be ready for serving.\nWine tasting events are not only for the grown ups, so do some research to find family friendly tastings. At family-friendly wineries, beverages and activities geared toward children are provided.\nThe Internet has once again come through to make the job easier and buying wine will never be the same again. You can now turn on your computers and shop the local and distant venues without leaving the home. This is perfect for when you have a selection in mind or don\u2019t want to make the trip.\n\nIf you are looking for a good wine choice in a restaurant, ask the wait-staff if they employ a wine-waiter. Restaurants pride themselves on their wine lists, so they will be happy to offer suggestions. Tell them what you are having for dinner, and give a price range. The result will usually be a great wine to complement your dinner!\nIf possible, buy your wine from small vineyards run by the same family from generation to generation. Larger vineyards usually care about earning high profits and selling to a large public while smaller vineyards will put the authenticity and the unique flavor of their wine first. You will often get better prices too.\nTry the wine before buying it if you can. Trust your personal taste since that is what matters in the end. You might end up buying a wine that others like, but you don\u2019t. There are several wine stores that have tasting bars where you can sample wines. If your store doesn\u2019t have that, try buying a single bottle before buying anymore to make sure you like it.\nLove wine even more with this knowledge in your mind?
