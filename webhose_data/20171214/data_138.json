A friend of mine got this vaccum a while ago for her car and I borrowed it from her for a few days, I loved it then so I decided to get my own because it has good suction power, it comes with little tools like brushes and a hose to get into deeper places; it\u2019s super easy to clean just a snap to open the suction cup and a snap back to close it. The cord that connects to the car is long enough to reach all the way to the back of the car. This vacuum is super easy to use. And you can fold it for storage inside it\u2019s own storage bag! How cool is that?! I love it.

Or am I wrong? If WAR gets attacked by a 100k player, do you guys get involved?\nOr more to the point, when WAR attacks a 100k player, do you guys feel compelled to join in?\nYou guys joined in for fun. I think your military pact is just saying \"Hi, I'm friends with WAR. I want to cuddle them while fighting you.\"\nDon't take me too seriously, by the way. Glad you guys could make it. But if you're joining for fun, then I suggest you change your conditions. Right now, you're in a war to cripple another alliance. Your version of fun? Maaaybe. I draw no conclusions yet.

Just admit that you are helping QED and their allies because they can't handle it. If QED wants to be #1 they should be able to do it by themselves or they dont deserve to be #1. If they earn it than I would be fine with QED being #1 in gamma. But truth is they aren't and will never be because they need help to fight anyone of decent size. Quote: Go to Page Top faythwalkerhsl Guest\n19 Nov 13th 2010, 5:43am\nkevin you are instigating again. Are LAW's allies helping because LAW can't handle it? No you would say of course not...then why does it follow that QED's allies are helping because QED needs help? You simply make no sense and everything you post is hypocritical. This is an easy one - EG and WAR are basically the same alliance, always have been. When one fights the other fights - everyone in Gamma knows that.\nAs to the point differences between the allies all i can say is you should have picked better allies. Now go back to fighting instead of talking. Remember you were the one that quit IMC during the war because you were leaving the game and had no time for it (not at all because you were getting whooped) and I foolishly believed you. Now here you are as one of the most active and non-stop posters in gamma. Quote: Go to Page Top kevin jan2 Wanderer\nPosts 1,676 20 Nov 13th 2010, 6:09am\nReally because i think if QED were strong enough to challenge LAW for the #1 they could have done it by themselves. If this were true I'd be willing to bet anything that the L alliances wouldn't have declared. Thats not to say member might not hop over but if that happend players would hop over to QED as well its just how things work. And yes we all know that EG and WAR hold hands through everything. And I never left quit IMC because I didnt have time for it. I had a weekend were I didnt have tim for it. I left IMC for reasons that are now fixed. So you'd be a fool to believe that I was getting whooped getting attacked once a month if even. And fayth you should be the last one saying stop talking and start fighting you have 25k offensive points and you were fighting over a week more than I have been and I already up 20k offensive in 2 battles. Let me know when you want a fight other than hitting farms and thinking your the best.

The 8.8 success rate is 4 percentage points lower than the next worst team, the Buffalo Sabres.\nWhile it is difficult to solve a power play issue with one quick change , the Columbus Blue Jackets abundance of offensive defensemen could have a good effect in this scenario. If they were to unite Seth Jones and Zach Werenski on the top power play unit https://www.clbbluejacketsfans.com/alexander-wennberg-jersey-c-11.html , it is possible that success could follow; as it has in even strength play the entire season.\nThe difficulty with a switch like this however, would certainly be the second pairing which would take a hit offensively on the blue line. The second pairing would likely consist of Jack Johnson and potentially Markus Nutivaara, as David Savard has had a lackluster season himself.\nThe next big issue would be sustainability Jordan Schroeder Jersey , with the uncertainty of the NHL; even if these changes work temporarily they may not last for the rest of the season. Ryan Murray could potentially play his way into a spot on a power play unit https://www.clbbluejacketsfans.com/sam-vigneault-jersey-c-12.html , however his change in style of play has been significant compared to previous years in terms of offensive production.\nFixing a league worst power play will take much more than a single change, and the Columbus Blue Jackets coaching staff is certainly trying to address this issue as soon as possible.

Beware: \"Sentiment\" is Not an Exact Market-Timing Tool By Scutify Dec 06, 2017 5:25 pm Stay Connected \nThis article is published in collaboration with Scutify , where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App , the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. \nFor the past several months, we have heard many top hedge fund and other analysts voicing their concern about the markets, with some forecasting a crash or at least a sharp plunge because of overvaluations. \nFormer hedge fund manager Jim Rogers, now residing in Asia, told Business Insider that the greatest crash of our lifetime will happen \"later this year or next.\" He says, \"Be worried.\" Another well-known analyst, Marc Faber, told CNBC that he sees a plummet of 40% or more, and \"it will end very badly, extremely badly.\" He didn't say when. \nAnalyst David Stockman, former budget director for President Reagan, said on CNBC, \"a gigantic, horrendous storm\" is not far away. \nThe power of proper market timing cannot be underestimated. Even Jim Rodgers, with his extremely bearish views, explained \"I may fall apart first though because my timing is so bad.\" \nAll these people have decades of experience in the markets. They are well known and we like to read their analysis of the markets. But there are times when our view diverges. \nSince early September, our view at Dohmen Capital Research has been that, although over the longer-term the very bearish view has a high probability of being right, there is a difference in timing. And as we say, \"timing is everything.\" \nAs you can see in the chart below, the large trading firms (i.e. large speculators) have been reducing exposure to growth stocks throughout the year (blue line), even while the Nasdaq 100 (green line) has continued to climb to new record highs.

People joined in Bitcoin out of many reasons. The most persuasive one is rather to be a futurist in the new era of technological currencies. They believe the current up rising trend is not going to stop at any heights. They ruled out against any bubble threat and theory. As they see this cryptocurrency is ushering in a new era of business dealing for all human being globally. Recently a few credible Future markets are also lending legitimacy to Bitcoin uprising by planning to list Bitcoin Futures on the board for traders. And therefore Bitcoin price rises even more meteorologically, breaking through more and more astonishing height on daily basis. All these moves have strengthened Bitcoin fans getting even more involved with more conviction.\nVanity of Fast Money Game \nOn the other hand, however, when we think of it deeper. All these happiness and celebrations are vanities. Those so called newly created millionaires out of Bitcoin rising is also paper millionaires if they have not cashed out their money. Would you think who among them would be foolish or contented enough to exit Bitcoin to realize the million cash where they can potentially become billionaires sometime sooner? If they have not cashed out, would they not still dreaming in illusion and vanity?\nPeople loves illusion from childhood to adulthood. The subject on illusion just changes from Cinderella lullabies to wealth and riches. People in their senses realize these are all fantasies, but nevertheless would like to dwell in it, because they would just give us a sense of happiness and blissful sensation.\nWealth and riches give people a sense of comfort and security. Therefore fast money is more attractive to all people from all generation in human existence. It makes gambling businesses never run out of existence in any society throughout human history. From money games to stock speculations, people would just lost their senses and fall into it. It has nothing to do with education or social status. It is the condition of the heart where dreams and cravings lie.\nSome Bitcoin fans do admit that Bitcoin is really a bubble, it will soon burst. But they hope to catch it early before it burst. They are planning to take the ride instead of sitting by the sideline and watching the opportunity train bypassing. They would feel awful if they don\u2019t get something out of it. Maybe not necessarily becoming a millionaire like those who went in early. They are just taking the risk to get some benefit and pull themselves out before the bubble burst.\nFalsified Self Confidence \nHowever, the intriguing question now is, how does anyone know when the bubble is going to burst? Is it a 20% one day drop or 30% drop? Those who freaked out in recent 20% drop would have experienced losses. Well, I would consider them fortunate enough to experience loss at this point. Because they will be frightened out of this fast money game. Worst of all are those who topped up during the drop. Because by now, they would have been celebrating their \u201ccorrect\u201d move in bottom fishing.\nThe more successful bottom fishing they can do, the more confidence they will become, if Bitcoin continues to rise after the drop just like what it has happened now. This is what I normally called falsified self confidence in stock trading. Confidence that built out of incorrect grounding, sooner or later, it will crumble. This falsified self-confidence has its other side of the coin as self-induced addiction.\nIn this addictive adrenal, Bitcoin fans would fall in love with Bitcoin more and more. Until it becomes impossible to exit Bitcoin anytime in the future even if they experience some losses during the big crash. Because they are so conditioned by illusion and vanity, they would not see what is coming against them, just like the moths flying to the candle flames at night.\nKing Solomon, the richest man ever lived on earth, said, \u201cVanity of vanities! All is vanity \u2026\u2026 there is nothing new under the sun. \u201d (Ecc 1:2-9) But Bitcoin fans convinced themselves there is nothing wrong with Bitcoin astronomical rise because this is a unique creation in human history. Bitcoin is ushering us into a new world economic, technological system. To them, this is new and real, not illusion.\nHowever, I believed blessed are those who are still sober standing by the sideway. But it is becoming more and more difficult not to get involved though, especially when your close friends are getting richer and richer every day. They are becoming more and more innovative and advanced. We are becoming weird creatures and more and more obsolete. But who knows? Maybe they are right, only time can tell.\n \nPress Here to go to Front Page \n \nPlease press \u201clike\u201d button below this article (if you have not done so) for email alert whenever new releases are out for public viewing.

I picked up an 02' bugeye. It has a few things that need fixed that didn't seem to hard for my first hands on project so I jumped on it for the price. 200k miles for only 3 grand. It was a friend's car and I know she didn't drive it hard so there's got to be some life left in this.\nFirst I dropped in a new stereo and fixed the rearview mirror. Easy.\nNow on to the more important stuff.\nNew battery and valve covers. This engine bay needed a heavy cleaning.\nSo I've had no issues getting the valve covers off and the driver side replaced. I'm 90% done as I'm holding off on finishing the passenger side till I know the answer to my question. It's probably an easy one but I could use someone's knowledge.\nOn the passenger side as I removed the valve cover I realized there was a black eletrical wire with a metal piece that looks like it should be attached somewhere hanging below/along side the engine. I did remove the air cleaner box, elbow and snorkus but I don't believe this goes to that assembly. You can see in my picture there is an electrical line attached to it and it goes directly into the wiring harness at the top in picture one. It's sitting right next to the screw hole for the air box but the hook doesn't align with that screw hole (I just propped it up so that it was easy to see) there isn't alot of slack in the line I'm rather confused on where this should be attached to.\nDoes anyone know what this harness is and where this hook is suppose to be attached?\nThanks again! * Registered users of the site do not see these ads.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20171207/97c76edb23625289f8740133f803921a.jpg", "https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20171207/fe748364e20469f417e01b3dbc16d022.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:35.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c97a7022739112fc0e623137242666d7c5b660e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_W3M6WPigWTUggUBgPssqiP.rZTIJSccqJ4pcIH_0Qfbrhc1kJwEZQ.4sXJtdjMugxfYY5agHXnML2lhspUyZ_iVRx9UGDKvvPb3SHM4Yo3XcXtwoyCUwj45QbcGw544A9dQUZVz.hfjTQcJGP.56SQ5qaF9c27959.hFQjOI2uw--", "site_full": "www.minyanville.com", "site": "minyanville.com", "site_section": "http://www.minyanville.com/rss/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Minyanville.com - All Articles", "title": "Live QandA Chat Live Stream Conference Call at 2:30pm ET today", "title_full": "Live QandA Chat Live Stream Conference Call at 2:30pm ET today", "published": "2017-12-06T20:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://images.minyanville.com/images/mv_social_icon_256.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2c97a7022739112fc0e623137242666d7c5b660e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_W3M6WPigWTUggUBgPssqiP.rZTIJSccqJ4pcIH_0Qfbrhc1kJwEZQ.4sXJtdjMugxfYY5agHXnML2lhspUyZ_iVRx9UGDKvvPb3SHM4Yo3XcXtwoyCUwj45QbcGw544A9dQUZVz.hfjTQcJGP.56SQ5qaF9c27959.hFQjOI2uw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scutify", "published": "2017-12-06T20:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "Live QandA Chat Live Stream Conference Call at 2:30pm ET today", "text": "you're only a step away from downloading your reports.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA \u201cdanger to life\u201d warning has been issued as the UK braces itself for Storm Caroline. \nThe North East is set to escape the worst of the weather but high winds of up to 50mph have been forecast for Thursday, along with the chance of snow showers heading in to the evening. \nOn Thursday, the region will start to see the affects of Storm Caroline as an Arctic blast makes its way towards us. \nNo weather warnings are in place but winds of 44mph are expected to hit Newcastle at around 1pm and by 6pm temperatures could feel as cold as -2C due to the windchill factor. \nBy Friday we could be looking at just 2C. \nGrahame Madge, spokesman for The Met Office, said: \u201cFor the rest of Friday we will see isolated showers but this will be heavier in Scotland, Northern Ireland and the western side of the country. \n\u201cAs we go into Friday evening, showers will come to the North East and these showers will be hail or snow as it will be too cold for rain. \n\u201cThis will continue into Saturday. Read More See the path Storm Caroline is expected to take as the North braces itself for winter weather \n\u201cWe will be looking at gusts of around 40-50mph in the region on Thursday. They are not expected to go above 50mph. \n\u201cThis goes for Friday and the weekend also. Once Storm Caroline has exited into the North Sea, the wind speeds will calm down across North East England.\u201d Read More Storm Caroline: Why are storms named and how are the names chosen? \nThere is also a chance for snow in the region on Sunday with a possibility of 2-5cm on higher ground. \nThe north of Scotland is preparing to bear the brunt of the storm with the Met Office issuing an Amber Warning which warns of a potential danger to life. \nA spokesperson for the Met Office said: \u201cGusts of 70 to 80 mph are expected widely with gusts to 90 mph possible in exposed areas. Flying debris is likely and could lead to injuries or danger to life. Some damage to buildings is possible, such as tiles blowing off roofs.\u201d \nElsewhere in the UK, Northern Ireland and the western side of the country have been issued with a less serious Yellow Warning on Friday for strong winds and for snow and ice on Saturday.

\nLESS than half the number of courses offered at Winsford\u2019s college campus last year have been kept on since September \u2013 although Hartford's offering has increased. \nFigures released following a Freedom of Information request submitted by the Guardian show that only 26 courses are now being offered at Warrington and Vale Royal College\u2019s site in Winsford, compared to 63 in 2016-17. \nBut the college is reassuring prospective students that it has big plans for the site\u2019s future \u2013 including the launch of A-Level courses on the campus, plus new courses earmarked for 2018-19 following fresh support for the Winsford site from stakeholders. \nMeanwhile, the number of courses on the Hartford site has risen by 33 \u2013 from 391 in 2016-17 to 424 in 2017-18 \u2013 meaning the number of courses offered by the former Mid Cheshire College sites has fallen by four following the merger with Warrington Collegiate. \nNichola Newton, principal and chief executive, told the Guardian that the figures must be looked at alongside the college\u2019s new apprenticeship standards and technical qualifications, which she claims meet the skills needs for science and engineering in particular. \nShe said: \u201cThe diversification of the college\u2019s curriculum offer will ensure a more holistic range of academic and technical pathways, offering students a unique opportunity to bridge between the two at an appropriate point in their studies. \n\u201cThe college will utilise its employer links, high quality resources and specialist staff to enable students to participate in technical electives, high quality internships and work-based action research projects to complement their studies. \n\u201cThe college aims to be a vanguard for the reform of further education, becoming a centre of excellence in the delivery of academic and technical programmes of study.\u201d \nThe FOI request also revealed that the number of courses offered in Warrington has dropped by 166 \u2013 from 1,756 to 1,590. \nCllr Brian Clarke, Cheshire West and Chester Council member for Winsford Wharton, is the council\u2019s cabinet member for economic development and infrastructure. \nHe is fully behind the college\u2019s plans for Winsford \u2013 which include collaboration with the town\u2019s employers and Winsford Academy. \n\u201cHaving looked at all the plans coming from the college I\u2019m very confident,\u201d he told the Guardian. \n\u201cThey have been in contact with different business on the industrial estate to make sure they are offering the courses that meet their needs. \n\u201cThe college is offering buses to the other campuses, and by working in partnership with Warrington it can share tutors and resources for our students.\u201d",

Betterment Investing is Still the Best Option For Most People By Scutify Dec 06, 2017 10:55 am Stay Connected \nThis article is published in collaboration with Scutify , where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App , the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. \nProfessional and amateur investors sometimes like to think that investing is the end-all-be-all and that anyone who does not do it is some kind mental invalid. Investment does offer a great deal to people as they go through life, especially if their investments are well chosen. But this doesn't mean that everyone has the natural inclination, time, or resources to invest meaningfully. \nInvestment has always been somewhat exclusive. Only those with some spare time, some spare money, and the ability to learn the techniques were able to take part on any level. Before the internet, investing was also expensive. Large commissions went to human brokers, who had to be called on the phone or notified by mail before buy-ins could even happen. Today, those actions can be performed instantly online, sometimes for free. \nThis is where Betterment comes in. A review of Betterment will show that it's an easy way to put money into hyper-diversified ETFs and mutual funds, which tend to yield steady growth over decades. Users can choose how much of their portfolio to allocate to bonds and/or stocks (also known as risk tolerance). They can also talk to Betterment representatives about their financial goals and how to achieve them. Other than that, the service really is on auto-pilot, and has demonstrated strong yields for users for almost a decade now. \nSo what are common criticisms of Betterment? Isn't this a little too good to be true? Critics of Betterment like to point out that the Betterment portfolio is just made up of a bunch of Vanguard ETFs and funds. They like to point out that if the user were to just make an account with Vanguard, they could build an identical portfolio, without paying Betterment to do it for them. \nThis is all true. However, it tends to reveal the ongoing feeling among successful investors that because they have been successful according to a certain model, everyone else can and should do the same. The reality is that many people can't, which is why we continue to think that Betterment is a solid investment option for a majority of new investors . Here are several reasons why. \nTax Loss Harvesting : Tax burdens can be lessened when an investor sells losing positions then buys new assets in the same class without duplicating the original position. It's easy enough to do once you understand it, but Betterment does it automatically. What's more, because this is performed by algorithm, Betterment never misses an opportunity to save, something that even the best human investor will always do. For this reason, Betterment is a great option for people who want to invest in a taxable account. The service almost always more than pays for itself this way. \nImmediacy . A new Betterment user can create a new Betterment account in a shorter time than it takes to make a Facebook account. So many people don't invest simply because of the learning curve and time commitment it would require. Betterment does everything for you. If this is the difference between someone investing for retirement and someone not investing at all, Betterment is an amazing value here. \nLow-Risk Results. For people who may not have the time to learn the ins and outs of investing in great detail, Betterment's risk-adjusted portfolios give users peace of mind that their money will probably steadily grow, without them having to manage it whatsoever. This is something that many, many people want, and Betterment is the company which does it best. \nMore people should invest for retirement. And while there are bare-bones ways for the learned investor to do so at the cheapest price, the average person with no experience in investment can do well by using Betterment's automatic investing service to build a better future and grow their money.

That hurts my back,\u201d I groaned, not knowing where I was, who was moving me or why. Aware of bright lights, sirens and men\u2019s voices, I heard someone say, while enclosing my neck in a brace, \u201cBroken neck, possible broken leg.\u201d I thought,\u201cAre they talking about me? I don\u2019t want a broken leg, much less a broken neck.\u201d I had no way of knowing what had happened, but suddenly the thought ran through my mind that I had been in some kind of accident. \nAcross the inside of my head stretched a blackboard which appeared to be blank. Slowly, printed in white, as if someone were writing with chalk, there flashed a phone number. Call my son,\u201d I mumbled, repeating the numbers before me. Then, as surely as I knew Keith\u2019s phone number, I repeated both Ken\u2019s and my HMO medical numbers. \u201cI have a pacemaker and my husband has severe Alzheimer\u2019s. Don\u2019t let him wander away,\u201d I added, somehow knowing he would need all of the important information. \u201cCan you tell me your name and birth date?\u201d another voice asked. I answered his question and gave him Ken\u2019s name and birth date as well, then faded into an unconscious place. \nObviously, the driver of the maverick car did not correct as I had assumed. Instead, his vehicle must have remained in the diagonal line aimed in my direction. I was like a sitting duck in a shooting gallery, the trajectory of his set course was fixed on me. He couldn\u2019t miss. In retrospect, who could have known he had spent the afternoon drinking and was drunk out of his mind? Authorities could only calculate the speed of his car as it broadsided my SUV just behind the driver\u2019s seat. Out of control, the maverick bounced off before slamming once again into the rear of my vehicle, spinning it wildly before coming to a stop \u2014 facing in a southerly direction. \nInside, I had been unaware of impact, the first blow no doubt knowking me out cold. I can only speculate on what followed. The seat belt, which I had buckled, failed. I believe it retracted on impact, and in so doing snapped the metal-locking end into my lip, cutting it just left of my nose at the same time knocking out one bottom tooth. The air bag deployed, but without the seat belt holding me in place it was ineffective. Lacking any restraint, I became air born and was somehow hurled through the driver\u2019s side window onto the street where I lay until paramedics arrived. (By comparison, Ken\u2019s injuries were minor, but still required several days of observation in the hospital. Restrained, confused, combative and unhappy, our concerned children insisted he be released for better care at home). \nWhile my family waited and worried outside the trauma unit, I was finally stablized by a group of dedicated and extraordinarily skilled doctors following an hour and a half of intense effort. Medically, I was a mess. The team of professionals battled shut-down kidneys, stabilization worries; there were cuts, contusions, blood loss, massive bruising, broken ribs, a broken neck, head fracture with concussion and I had inhaled glass shards while exiting through the closed window They worried I could suffer a stroke or be paralyzed as the neck fracture was a top vertebrae protecting vital areas and nerves which commanded life itself. \nDuring a moment of consciousness I requested a blessing of healing from the clergy of my church. Their anointing words of comfort, hope and promise fell upon me like a warm blanket on a cold night. Finding peace among the turmoil I also found rest, allowingy myself to let go and let God further work His miracles. When awareness allowed me to ponder, I reviewed my broken and bruised body and while I will never dismiss the seriousness of my many and varied injuries, I am still amazed that I only suffered a broken neck, head fracture and broken ribs. In actuality, I should be dead. I can only believe there must be some part of my life\u2019s mission which has not been completed. Why else would Heavenly guided unseen hands cushion my descent to the pavement?  05-09 00:35:36.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "keith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ken", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:36.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "00ca2ae4b090f6c33aa1fd0063d2a2bcb9720eb1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6jsyG1oTKZY0r0LUdMqyr2QEUHzlrgZRRXZ2r5xZY83EOf0te2xyqDYlflpUbJHPks.O_9nZXpQ--", "site_full": "www.johnlewis.com", "site": "johnlewis.com", "site_section": "https://www.johnlewis.com/browse/women/womens-coats-jackets/oasis/warehouse/whistles/_/N-flvZ1z13ucoZ1z13rxeZ1z13tcg", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Oasis | Warehouse | Women's Coats &amp; Jackets | John Lewis", "title": "Oasis Elin Padded Parka", "title_full": "Buy Oasis Elin Padded Parka | John Lewis", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.26, "main_image": "https://johnlewis.scene7.com/is/image/JohnLewis/003301504?$preview$", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2411, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d8456d3e2c885623f7fb8da6cc16815401780a22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6jsyG1oTKZY0r0LUdMqyr2QEUHzlrgZRRXZ2r5xZY83EOf0te2xyqDYlflpUbJHPLi_ZZLo_sVq6TGk7Q6zUv", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Agatha36", "published": "2017-11-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I love this coat.

The beer itself is one that is available in Aldi stores in the UK on occasion and is a beer that I was given as part of a birthday present recently so hopefully it\u2019s a good one. Despite thinking it was another pale lager or helles offering from the brewery, this one is actually M\u00e4rzen (or Oktoberfest) beer so it\u2019s probably only available part of the year so it\u2019s a good one to check off at least.\n\nAppearance (3/5): A very clear but bright golden colour that is topped with a two or three centimetre tall head that was white and foamy but looked quite active and slowly receded to settle about a quarter-inch tall after a minute or so. \nAroma (5/10): Quite a light beer on the nose with a sticky sweetness and some basic malts coming through in the early going alongside the usual hay and grassy notes. There\u2019s not a great deal going on but I got some basic lager malts and touches of cereal and grain further on, thankfully no skunk was showing at least.\nTaste (4/10): Like the nose, this one was again quite a light beer with some grassy hops and basic malts alongside some skunk that was absent with the nose. It\u2019s loaded with cereal and cheap adjuncts with some hay and the faintest of citrus touches towards the end.; poor stuff really.\nPalate (2/5): Light to light-medium bodied and quite strongly carbonated with some gasses showing and a slight tang. It\u2019s a grainy offering that is a little rough on the way down and it\u2019s quite basic and bland too sadly; there\u2019s not much going on at all.\nOverall (9/20): Quite a disappointing beer and much like the first from the brewery that I tried early this year, this is another from Dinkelacker-Schwabe that I\u2019ll definitely be avoiding in future. There was some basic malts and grassy flavours in the early going with the odd lager malt and some citrus but it wasn\u2019t overly strong or varied with the taste getting quite boring towards the end; one to avoid I\u2019m afraid.\nBrewed In: Stuttgart, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany\nBrewery: Dinkelacker-Schwaben Br\u00e4u\nFirst Brewed: circa. 2006 \nType: M\u00e4rzen/Oktoberfest\nAbv: 5.5%\nServing: Bottle (500ml)\nPurchased: Aldi (Scotland)\nPrice: Gift", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "baden-w\u00fcrttemberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dinkelacker-schwaben br\u00e4u", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wulle biere vollbier hell", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "aldi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "dinkelacker-schwaben", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stuttgart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "m\u00e4rzen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:37.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a6ddf50dee4a609d9050b3aec7ce9c3062f1ba96", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYf9pA8cmVYgIfn4UyoGA5PHKjt6ozNNrUwoYzas1OjrjFsnOplhefOUcB3zH15nIWMnVGgHTlIbeXZnmJsRFWubpWMUsNofLkF6D8paNyuehRpLORNF4gTSec.3.31bb4rillehaJHCAd8PgfLwLENQ--", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com.my", "site": "tripadvisor.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com.my/ShowForum-g293921-i8432-o80-Vietnam.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Vietnam Forum, Travel Discussion for Vietnam - TripAdvisor", "title": "ho thuy tien abandoned water park - Hue", "title_full": "ho thuy tien abandoned water park - Hue Message Board - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-10-29T11:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13431, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "20748ae3b09d68c6c8c22b4b4173ce4830c3289b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYf9pA8cmVYgIfn4UyoGA5PHKjt6ozNNrUwoYzas1OjrjFsnOplhefOUcB3zH15nIWMnVGgHTlIbeXZnmJsRFWubpWMUsNofLkF6D8paNyuehRpLORNF4gTSec.3.31bb4rillehaJHCDhviL3P8h0wEhVTQL0RShs", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "JoJo1", "published": "2017-12-05T22:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "-:- Message from TripAdvisor staff -:-\nThis post was determined to be inappropriate by the TripAdvisor community and has been removed.\nTo review the TripAdvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\nOur staff may also remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.

Is France Turning the Corner? December 7, 2017 News \nMore adventurous palates, added to greater demand for premium foods, suggest the sluggish performance of the French frozen foods industry could be ending, reports Jonathan Thomas \nIn recent years, the French frozen foods market has grown at a rather modest rate, of less than 2% per annum. The category is large and mature, with per capita consumption currently amounting to 37 kg and facing ongoing competition from chilled foods. However, the frozen market appears well-positioned to capitalize in the changing taste trends currently taking place amongst the French population, which help to revitalize it. One of the most notable to have occurred of late has been falling demand for baguettes. Although an estimated 10 billion baguettes are consumed every year in France, sales have dropped in recent years. Part of this can be attributed to the declining popularity of bread, with per capita consumption having shrunk from almost 55 kg in the early years of the new millennium to 44 kg in 2015. Although baguettes still account for 70% of overall bread consumption in France, average prices have increased and the sector has suffered from the declining number of traditional French bakeries. \nCompetition for baguettes has also increased from sectors of the frozen and chilled foods industries. French consumers ate an estimated 819 million pizzas in 2015, a figure which includes products sold via both supermarkets and pizzerias. This figure was up by 1.5% from the previous year, with the frozen sector alone valued at approximately EUR300m. Pizzas appeal to younger time-pressed consumers, and the fact that healthier lines such as gluten-free have appeared suggests that scope for future innovation remains considerable. However, French consumers are still loyal to traditional toppings, i.e. margherita and Reine (tomato sauce, cheese, ham and mushrooms). \nFrench consumers are also displaying a greater appetite for ready meals and dishes made to foreign recipes. Ethnic-inspired products continue to capture an increasing share of the French ready meals market \u2013 for example, the Nom Noms brand of healthy Indian dishes from the UK has rapidly gained a following amongst French consumers. Furthermore, a recent survey from Madame Figaro magazine found that 87% of French adults regularly cooked Italian food at home, a figure which compares with 40% for Chinese cuisine. The popularity of European dishes such as lasagne and paella can be further illustrated by the fact that French imports of ready meals are worth EUR500m per year, most of which come from countries such as Italy, Germany and the Benelux nations. \nAnother cuisine which has grown in popularity in France is Japanese, a sector worth an estimated EUR47m at present. Part of this growth has been due to the arrival in the frozen ready meals market of the Japanese firm Ajinomoto, which acquired Labeyrie Traiteur Surgeles (LTS) in the summer of 2017 for EUR27m. Following the deal, Ajinomoto intends to utilize LTS\u2019s distribution channels to expand consumer exposure to its range of Japanese foods. Elsewhere, French consumers are also displaying a preference for sushi, mainly due to greater appreciation of its health and nutritional benefits. \nPlease feel free to read the entire article here", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jonathan thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reine", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ajinomoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labeyrie traiteur surgeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nom noms", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madame figaro", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:37.041+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0ee32cb3a463205722a5b0bfbb0e7219f2fb828c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mTsEZbl1CA6Q1p3Vq9OJr9O.ZQbmch3Eys.kYVYixh_hbPZfqfRhcZD", "site_full": "141hongkong.com", "site": "141hongkong.com", "site_section": "http://141hongkong.com/forum-17-2.html", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "\u6703\u54e1\u4ea4\u6d41\u7121\u8ced\u4e0d\u6b61 141\u9999\u6e2f\u8ad6\u58c7 - ", "title": "\u82f1\u683c\u862d\u8d85\u7d1a\u806f\u8cfd\uff0c\u6bcf\u9031\u7259\u9ab9\u6230 (\u5341\u4e8c)\u7121\u8ced\u4e0d\u6b61\u7b2c4\u9801 -", "title_full": "\u82f1\u683c\u862d\u8d85\u7d1a\u806f\u8cfd\uff0c\u6bcf\u9031\u7259\u9ab9\u6230 (\u5341\u4e8c)\u7121\u8ced\u4e0d\u6b61\u7b2c4\u9801 -", "published": "2017-11-17T20:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 29613, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6c6d3a920942189f56a2f8af3c96abd09092b760", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mTsEZbl1CA6Q1p3Vq9OJr9O.ZQbmch3Eys.kYVYixh_hZu8i3w6a28Lots0MlWIeGw-", "ord_in_thread": 13, "author": "fly2006", "published": "2017-11-18T07:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "\uff082\uff09\u548c", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:37.043+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0ee32cb3a463205722a5b0bfbb0e7219f2fb828c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mTsEZbl1CA6Q1p3Vq9OJr9O.ZQbmch3Eys.kYVYixh_hbPZfqfRhcZD", "site_full": "141hongkong.com", "site": "141hongkong.com", "site_section": "http://141hongkong.com/forum-17-2.html", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "\u6703\u54e1\u4ea4\u6d41\u7121\u8ced\u4e0d\u6b61 141\u9999\u6e2f\u8ad6\u58c7 - ", "title": "\u82f1\u683c\u862d\u8d85\u7d1a\u806f\u8cfd\uff0c\u6bcf\u9031\u7259\u9ab9\u6230 (\u5341\u4e8c)\u7121\u8ced\u4e0d\u6b61\u7b2c4\u9801 -", "title_full": "\u82f1\u683c\u862d\u8d85\u7d1a\u806f\u8cfd\uff0c\u6bcf\u9031\u7259\u9ab9\u6230 (\u5341\u4e8c)\u7121\u8ced\u4e0d\u6b61\u7b2c4\u9801 -", "published": "2017-11-17T20:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 29613, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8d7254115fb331d71f718aebc1228ed865be4fad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mTsEZbl1CA6Q1p3Vq9OJr9O.ZQbmch3Eys.kYVYixh_hZu8i3w6a28Llt9cX39.riM-", "ord_in_thread": 15, "author": "mattheww", "published": "2017-11-18T08:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "\uff081\uff09\u4e3b\u52dd", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:37.067+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a5a7ae501f4458264ec637376026de36dabbf177", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSu2pBmyvyP_UVfznq.FEr9cs4nAoXw5G5qEMBLyMSKViiLnBAWSjhf_EYAggea_eKYC7v4LLR4L7FkTqWJyNIv", "site_full": "hypixel.net", "site": "hypixel.net", "site_section": "https://hypixel.net/forums/skywars.91/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "SkyWars | Hypixel - Minecraft Server and Maps", "title": "Can someone make this mod?

In fact, an important part of shoppers and foodservice clients would rather pay more for a premium convenience product, with clear health benefits. \nBy Dan Orehov \nThe major attributes that consumers look for in convenience foods are ease of use, packaging, nutritional value, safety, variety and product appeal. According to new market research, the rapid growth of the foodservice industry in a large number of developing markets is expected to fuel the demand of packaged ready-to-eat snacks such as potato fries, bakery products and meat products. Researchers from Future Market Insights (FMI) say that one of the major drivers for convenience foods industry growth is widened distribution channels and tendency of consumers to buy off-the-shelf especially in emerging markets of BRICS and MENA. \nMarket Overview \nThe global convenience foods market is expected to grow at a healthy CAGR by 2020. Some of the emerging markets may even experience a double-digit growth rate through the forecast period in significant categories, according to FMI. The U.S. is the largest market for convenience foods in the world and the emerging markets of Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Latin America would fuel future growth. \u201cThe U.S. will remain a strategic market for convenience food processors in the forecast period due to declining trend towards away-from-home dining and at-home cooking.

While increasingly hectic lifestyles of Europeans, improving economies and growing number of single person households will be important drivers of purchasing convenient food solutions, there are some more actions to be considered in adding more value to consumers. For example, it can be done by responding to the increasing overlap between snacking occasions and meals in eating habits. Manufacturers should seek to adapt more of their offers with ready meals suitable for on-the-go consumption at the same time being more nutritious and healthies snacks. Another important step is tapping into foodservice demand, particularly for pizza, and competing against take-away foodservice. This also feeds demand for more \u201cauthentic\u201d and regional recipes, and for greater ingredient traceability. Speaking about the competition with takeaways, there is an opportunity for the retailers for further development and improvement of their online offers. Finally, ready meals should embrace all the opportunities in the vegetarian segment by strengthening their positioning in the niche through dedicated premium ranges. The rapid increase in the number of flexitarians across Europe, who actively reduce meet consumption, gives a lot of opportunities also for the meat substitute companies with strong vegetarian credentials to boost their presence in ready meals. \nResults from the Global Consumer Trends surveys conducted by Euromonitor International confirm that a growing number of people around the world choose not to prepare a meal from scratch but rather go for pre-prepared options. In 2013, 20% of consumers globally ate ready meals at home at least 1-2 times per week. In 2017 this number increased to 27%. Looking at European countries, 29% of consumers in United Kingdom, around 24% in Germany, Poland and Russia and 20% of consumers in France, declared eating ready meal at the same frequency. Even more interesting might be to learn that for example about 24% of respondents in Russia, 18% in Poland and 14% Germany chose to eat ready meals at home almost every day. Unsurprisingly, lack of time to cook, convenience over preparing a meal from scratch, willingness to spend time doing other things than cooking and affordability were indicated as the main reasons to eat ready meals by the survey respondents. Let us have a closer look at European ready meals market to see its main heavy weights and trends as well as opportunities for the future. \nPlease feel free to read the entire article here", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sokolnik", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "foodservice ready meals are tapping", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foodservice home news ready meals are tapping", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cagr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "euromonitor international", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "euromonitor international  according to euromonitor international", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:38.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0ee32cb3a463205722a5b0bfbb0e7219f2fb828c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mTsEZbl1CA6Q1p3Vq9OJr9O.ZQbmch3Eys.kYVYixh_hbPZfqfRhcZD", "site_full": "141hongkong.com", "site": "141hongkong.com", "site_section": "http://141hongkong.com/forum-17-2.html", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "\u6703\u54e1\u4ea4\u6d41\u7121\u8ced\u4e0d\u6b61 141\u9999\u6e2f\u8ad6\u58c7 - ", "title": "\u82f1\u683c\u862d\u8d85\u7d1a\u806f\u8cfd\uff0c\u6bcf\u9031\u7259\u9ab9\u6230 (\u5341\u4e8c)\u7121\u8ced\u4e0d\u6b61\u7b2c4\u9801 -", "title_full": "\u82f1\u683c\u862d\u8d85\u7d1a\u806f\u8cfd\uff0c\u6bcf\u9031\u7259\u9ab9\u6230 (\u5341\u4e8c)\u7121\u8ced\u4e0d\u6b61\u7b2c4\u9801 -", "published": "2017-11-17T20:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 29613, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5259ce5eff03e600701c60e17a05ac164856b8ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mTsEZbl1CA6Q1p3Vq9OJr9O.ZQbmch3Eys.kYVYixh_hZu8i3w6a28Ld7Vy5xZopnA-", "ord_in_thread": 14, "author": "chinatohk", "published": "2017-11-18T07:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "1\uff09\u4e3b", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:38.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a5a7ae501f4458264ec637376026de36dabbf177", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSu2pBmyvyP_UVfznq.FEr9cs4nAoXw5G5qEMBLyMSKViiLnBAWSjhf_EYAggea_eKYC7v4LLR4L7FkTqWJyNIv", "site_full": "hypixel.net", "site": "hypixel.net", "site_section": "https://hypixel.net/forums/skywars.91/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "SkyWars | Hypixel - Minecraft Server and Maps", "title": "Can someone make this mod? | Page 3", "title_full": "Can someone make this mod? | Page 3 | Hypixel - Minecraft Server and Maps", "published": "2017-12-06T16:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.008, "main_image": "https://hypixel.net/data/avatars/m/904/904973.jpg?1487870614", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 11753, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f1f6db09730339048112953090a34683fa0e06d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSu2pBmyvyP_UVfznq.FEr9cs4nAoXw5G5qEMBLyMSKViiLnBAWSjhf_EYAggea_eKYC7v4LLR4L5T87aUBHyAWEGKDf7rSvNU-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Shermey", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "EagleBuster said: \u2191 If it is on hypixel, why cant i do it?

The USTR is tasked with advising the president on how to handle the controversial trade remedies recommended by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) in October.\nUnited States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a Trump appointee who heads the USTR, did not attend the hearing, however.\nSolar executives, lawmakers and foreign diplomats presented their arguments instead to an eight-person panel comprised of representatives from several federal agencies, including the Energy, Commerce and Labor departments. The vast majority of witnesses urged the panel not to recommend solar tariffs or quotas, saying they would put American jobs at risk.\n\u201cIt makes no sense to effectively tax tens of thousands of good-paying U.S. jobs out of existence, solely to benefit the commercially unskilled Chinese and German owners of Suniva and SolarWorld, who will cut and run,\u201d said Michael O'Sullivan , senior vice president of development at NextEra Energy. \nU.S.-based manufacturers Suniva and SolarWorld brought the case earlier this year, citing serious financial harm due to cheap solar imports. The companies chose to invoke Section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act, which is an obscure part of U.S. trade law that could allow the president to implement tariffs, minimum prices or quotas on solar products from anywhere in the world.\n\u201cOver the last five years almost 30 U.S. solar manufacturers have closed,\u201d testified Matt Card, executive vice president of commercial operations at Suniva. \u201cThat\u2019s not conjecture. That\u2019s not theory about what may happen.\u201d\nSuniva filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, while SolarWorld raised $6 million to keep its doors open and its factory operational while fighting the trade case.\nMembers of the panel showed particular interest in a proposal by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) to implement an import license fee system for crystalline silicon PV (CSPV) panels instead of tariffs. The fees would be collected from foreign solar manufacturers and redistributed to U.S. manufacturers.\nSEIA pitched the licensing fee previously to the ITC, where the idea gained momentum with one of the four commissioners. In her recommendations to President Trump, Commissioner Meredith Broadbent proposed selling import licenses at a minimum price of 1 cent per watt.\n\u201cAre any of the remedies recommended by the ITC commissioners likely to result in a positive net-revenue stream for domestic producers?\u201d asked Ian Steff, who serves as deputy assistant secretary for manufacturing at the Department of Commerce.\n\u201cWe think that only Commissioner Broadbent\u2019s would result in that outcome,\u201d replied Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA's president and CEO. \u201cThe only way to get money directly to petitioners is through the ILF (import license fee).\u201d\n\u201cCould you walk through the cash-flow here \u2026 what\u2019s the timeline look like?\u201d asked Charlie Gay, director of the Department of Energy\u2019s Solar Energy Technologies Office.\n\u201cWe forecasted that at least $833 million would be collected in ILF revenues over the next four years,\u201d said Sunrun co-founder Ed Fenster. He contended that license fee revenues would reach solar manufacturers within three months, while it could take more than a year for companies to see a financial benefit from tariffs.\n\u201cOur opponent\u2019s proposal relies on China and their proxies to supply the U.S. market with solar,\u201d said Card, who denounced the plan.\nMore than 200 solar workers and industry advocates marched from the USTR building to the White House on Wednesday afternoon, waving signs that read, \u201cdon\u2019t bail out losers\u201d and \u201csolar feeds my family.\u201d The trade agency has received more than 1,500 public comments from industry groups, businesses and solar workers, the vast majority of which called on the government to reject the tariffs.\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about everybody\u2019s job, realistically,\u201d said Matt Kata, 32, who works as an electrical designer for Cypress Creek Renewables in Durham, North Carolina. Kata was among dozens of Cypress Creek employees who traveled to Washington to demonstrate against the tariffs.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want that tariff to go through. It\u2019s going to hurt not only the solar industry, but American jobs as well,\u201d said Kata. \u201cIf they really want to help American solar panel companies, they should create subsidies like they do for the oil industry.\u201d\nThe proposed remedies offered by trade commissioners in October were less severe than the tariff rates requested by Suniva and SolarWorld, but SEIA says they could still wipe out tens of thousands of solar jobs.\nTwo out of four commissioners were in favor of placing a 30 percent ad valorem tariff on imported crystalline silicon PV (CSPV) modules, to decline by 5 percentage points per year over four years. For imported solar cells, they agreed on a four-year \u201ctariff-rate quota\u201d that would allow for up to 1 gigawatt of tariff-free cell imports. Any imports over 1 gigawatt would be subject to a 30 percent tariff. Each subsequent year, the tariff rate would decrease by 5 percentage points and the in-quota amount would increase by 0.2 gigawatts.\nNumerous industry executives testified that the threat of tariffs and quotas has already impacted their businesses.\nRobert Rynar, a chief engineer with DEPCOM power, said his company started working on two 100-megwatt projects between 24 and 36 months ago. \u201cDue to the uncertainty of this case and its effect on the cost of modules \u2026 both of those projects are teetering on collapse,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a chilling effect on the market that started a few months ago, and it has rippled across the whole country. Solar demand destruction is already happening, and most of 2018 is getting damaged,\u201d said O'Sullivan. \u201c2019 and 2020 is what\u2019s at stake here.\u201d\nFenster said the recent tax bills passed in the House and Senate \u201ccarve about 10 cents a watt of value out [of solar]\u2026 and would obviously make the effects of trade restraint more substantial.\u201d\nA representative from the Embassy of Canada said Canadian modules should be exempt from tariffs, even if they are assembled using cells from Asia, citing the rules of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  Two state lawmakers from Minnesota, Senator Justin Eichorn and Representative Jason Metsa, threw their support behind Canada. \n\u201cRestrictive trade measures against Canada \u2026 would injure Minnesota workers and families,\u201d said Eichorn. Ontario-based solar manufacturer Heliene \u201chas saved American manufacturing jobs that otherwise would have been lost.\u201d\nSuniva\u2019s lawyer, Matthew McConkey, said no such exception should be made for Canada.\n\u201cIf you take a Korean cell and send it to Canada and put it into a module in Canada, that product has to be covered by this order,\u201d he said. \nRepresentatives from South Korea, China, Taiwan and the European Union also testified against the trade remedies.\nIt is not known how the Trump administration will rule on this case. The president has made it a priority to support American jobs, the question is whether or not he believes protectionist policies are they best way to do that in this case. \nSpeaking at an event in September , Lighthizer said he agrees with President Trump on trade policy and believes the U.S. \u201cmust use all instruments \u2026 to make it expensive to engage in non-economic behavior.\u201d\n\u201cI know that many sincerely believe that the prevailing world trade policy has been great for America and that those who complain are often people who are victims of economic progress,\u201d said Lighthizer. \u201cMost of you know that I am not in that group.\u201d\nLast week Lighthizer asked the ITC to prepare a supplemental report to help the President determine an appropriate way to help the domestic industry adjust to import competition \u201cand provide greater economic and social benefits than costs.\u201d He also asked the commission to detail any \u201cunforeseen developments\u201d that caused domestic solar manufactures to be injured by cheap foreign imports.\nThe request for extra information pushes the deadline for Trump's final decision on import duties from January 12 to January 26, 2018. He has the authority to adopt one of the ITC's recommendations, devise an alternative, or do nothing. \n\nfrom GTM Solar

You must extract the cuesheet\nmetaflac --export-cuesheet-to=myfile.cue myfile.flac \nand then you can do\nnyxmms2 addpls myfile.cue \nflactag also has support for creating the cuesheets and embedded tags in batch mode)\n\nSolution:2\nYou may want to try DeaDBeef . It's open source and has been ported to Android. It's the closest thing to foobar2000, even in terms of GUI style.\n\nSolution:3\nIt is perhaps not the answer you would to ear. \nThere is a Windows player that supports that, and it works well under Wine.

The previous editions \u2013 2011, 2013, 2015 \u2013 all were very good and very successful. But in 2017 we were able to assemble a new record number of exhibitors \u2013 over 7,400 \u2013 and an increased number of trade visitors. Above that the quality of the business contacts and the deals that were done were extraordinary. We concentrated on business, on quality and on innovations at Anuga \u2013 and the worldwide participants responded to these notions absolutely positively. \nWhat are your thoughts on the trends reflected at this year\u2019s event? \nThe innovations, which as always were a key focus of Anuga, contributed towards providing the industry with new impulses and ideas. These trend themes included food and beverages that are rich in protein, new products on the theme \u201csuperfoods\u201d and numerous new ready-to-go/ready-to-eat ideas. Sustainable concepts as well as organic products were still high in demand, vegetarian and vegan themes were also a major focus. Alternative sources of protein like insects were a theme of intense discussion among the media. \nHow was the frozen food segment represented? \nThe frozen food segment added to the innovations subject essentially. The major trends were mirrored by different products. Many products were enriched by protein of instance, among them a frozen breakfast bowl that also contained superfoods as quinoa or acai. Sustainability, clean label and traceability are important characteristics in frozen food products. Nearly all frozen food producers refrain from artificial ingredients for example. Above all: the convenience factor is elaborated at a high level: Frozen food products, especially prepared meals, safe time for preparation and cooking. They are basically modern and suit the life of the modern societies. \nPlease feel free to read the entire article here", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

to fitness, Jose Mourinho has a big decision to make. Should he persist with Romelu Lukaku up front? Or is it time to unleash last season's top scorer?\nLukaku made a blistering start to his Manchester United career, scoring 11 goals in his first 10 appearances, but he finds himself in the spotlight having only found the net twice in his last 12.\nThe pressure is heightened by Ibrahimovic's return to the fold, with Mourinho confirming the Swede has a \"big chance\" of being available for Sunday's Manchester derby, live on Sky Sports. So who should he pick?\nThe case for Lukaku\nLukaku has struggled in front of goal recently but his strike against CSKA Moscow could be exactly the boost he needed. \"Make no mistake, that goal was as important as any goal that he has scored in his career,\" said Jamie Redknapp on The Debate on Tuesday. \"It will give so much confidence ahead of the Manchester derby at the weekend.\"\nHaving only found the net once in his previous 11 appearances, Mourinho will be hoping Lukaku's first goal in a month is the first step towards regaining his self-belief and rediscovering the ruthless streak that defined his first few weeks at the club. Indeed, United are already well-aware of just how clinical he can be.\nFinishing aside, it is also worth remembering the important contribution Lukaku has made to United's general attacking play in recent weeks. There was an assist in the 4-2 win over Watford, and he played a key role in United's first and third goals against Arsenal. He even won the header which allowed Juan Mata to set up Marcus Rashford's winner against CSKA.\nLukaku has been criticised for his work-rate in the past but recent evidence suggests he is more than capable of providing the off-the-ball intensity Mourinho demands from his attacking players. Against Arsenal, when United employed the kind of high-pressing tactics they may look to use again against City, Premier League tracking data showed that only Lingard made more sprints than Lukaku.\nThe Belgian was similarly energetic against CSKA Moscow on Tuesday, and United will need more of the same at Old Trafford on Sunday. That level of intensity is something Ibrahimovic, 36 years old and only recently back from a serious knee injury, might not be able to provide.\nTime for Zlatan?\nHe might not have youth on his side, but Ibrahimovic remains one of the most reliable goalscorers in the game. The Swede hit 28 of them last season, including a stunning volley the last time Manchester City visited Old Trafford. It was an example of his ability to conjure something out of nothing and also highlighted his tendency to rise to the big occasion.\nIndeed, Ibrahimovic's record in big games is considerably more impressive than Lukaku's. The Belgian has failed to find the net against Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham and Liverpool this season, and the issue stretches back to his Everton days. In fact, since 2014/15, he has only hit five goals in 39 meetings against the Premier League's big six.\nbrahimovic is also at an advanced stage of his recovery from injury. His omissions against Arsenal and CSKA allowed him to conserve his energy for Sunday's game, and his previous substitute appearances against Newcastle, Basel, Brighton and Watford have already helped him build up his match fitness.\nIbrahimovic would give United a talisman and a leader in the absence of the suspended Paul Pogba, and he might also be even more motivated than usual against Guardiola. The pair's fractious relationship at Barcelona is well-documented. Ibrahimovic would surely like nothing more than to get one over on his old manager.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:40.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "680be63cb1f94707b3e103bde6e497af4f1ea105", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQmvmo2jLDTH31uITM2Op2mCrTYUetuZQx3v3Yn8wsm26EdESd5apn8YGhI_bX0KWVkc2yIsVE28cr_d1l2N4wsU8OL8zESmdMGL2W8DHyr2A--", "site_full": "wichita.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://wichita.craigslist.org/search/ppp?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist wichita | personals search", "title": "I want to be dry pounded anyone down - m4m (Haysville Wichita)", "title_full": "I want to be dry pounded anyone down - m4m (Haysville Wichita)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.craigslist.org/01515_fjrwITBhzty_600x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "680be63cb1f94707b3e103bde6e497af4f1ea105", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQmvmo2jLDTH31uITM2Op2mCrTYUetuZQx3v3Yn8wsm26EdESd5apn8YGhI_bX0KWVkc2yIsVE28cr_d1l2N4wsU8OL8zESmdMGL2W8DHyr2A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "I want to be dry pounded anyone down - m4m (Haysville Wichita)", "text": "age: 25   Hey white guy here hiv+ sadly if that ok I want to get fucked nice dry pounding with no remorse I want to try I want it to hurt me and make me cry by pounding me r u big and man enough do do so text me and put in first message I want to make u cry form my dick lol u must host 316 two five one 3592 pic and stats a must thanks do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers post id: 6415787488", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "haysville wichita", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:40.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "93114a3bd11dd5f1304d869f4da572b4f3bd8f61", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UcSKjjIjFY1.pRu6MDrSg.7CEJiSQT59KDXA9qMpcX37xu_AXmqpbe.r_j5OwDhi98M1rMUHloJQw--", "site_full": "diamond-cat.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://diamond-cat.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Diamond's blog: by Sasha", "title": "What's that, Bear?", "title_full": "What's that, Bear?", "published": "2017-12-07T02:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "213c930c37f31f332768010b13429d532d97b4eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UcSKjjIjFY1.pRu6MDrSg.7CEJiSQT59KDXA9qMpcX37xu_AXmqpbe.r_j5OwDhi98DTTP9R0gNX9TQ49VD3Uzu", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Sasha", "published": "2017-12-07T11:17:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I carry Bear around in my mouthie sometimes.
