There\u2019s a lot of cool stuff in that genre to be admired, but I feel like sometimes those posts (especially when made by people who don\u2019t live in the south- and hey, neither do I) come across as \u201caren\u2019t poor people spooooky?\u201d \nAs a born-and-raised southerner, I was surprised to discover this literary convention because a lot of modern southern gothic fantasy written by southerners focuses on old-money families who turn out to be [witches/werewolves/vampires/etc]. I didn\u2019t encounter the \u201cscary redneck mountain people\u201d variant in non-fantastical media until later, and it baffles me because the modern southern elite are TERRIFYING. \nEndlessly smiling hypocritical senators in tacky palatial houses with wives who espouse \u201ctraditional values\u201d while being poisonously sweet and cutthroat? Those make much more frightening antagonists for gothic heroes/heroines to fight. If you live in the south you will probably never meet backwoods demon sibling-spouses but you\u2019ve definitely seen the void staring out of a \u201cLive, Laugh, Love\u201d picture frame. \nACCURATE \nTumblr inherently misunderstands the function of Southern Gothic literature and has appropriated it for its pervasive almost supernatural poetic style. They don\u2019t understand its themes, why it was written, or how to properly write it. Actual Southern Gothic literature is not as melodramatic as one might think and it isn\u2019t about aesthetic style points. It\u2019s style is actually scathingly sarcastic in a nearly caustic way, and it\u2019s meant to amplify structural violence by turning upstanding members of society into villains. It does make the poor grotesque at time, but in the same novel also redeems them by showing how societal ills have painted an unfair picture. \nSouthern Gothic is a genre for the poor, the colored, the queer; it\u2019s not about signs that say \u201cHell is here\u201d or forcing tired stereotypes that fundamentally misunderstand poverty , racism, and homo-/transphobia onto the South in a sweeping sensationalist way. Appropriated Gothic Americana aesthetic takes the voice from Southern authors who want to talk about real systemic wrongs and evils in a way that provides accurate social commentary. \nThat\u2019s not to say that the neo-gothic Americana style that Tumblr has no merit; it\u2019s just difficult as a southern writer to watch people play around with serious topics for the sake of dramatic aesthetics and not realize that they\u2019re being harmful and sort of mocking a tradition that they haven\u2019t bothered to really study. \n30k comments in and somebody finally understood what I was getting at.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tumblr", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "south", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:08:15.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bc37bd1e20bee1ff3f88eac44b22ea62a8ed468c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapScvZ9NUDALlJM8eu_EQUQ.ySZBAjIufuv4xjSnjxsAjG_B4vyEUPZeOVRKZoPjFN7r6xQs.a0xtzLe5G0jMvuQ3_WlWb1iZ7ebJCNyj9iv35P.ujdqhtO7w--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lightnovels/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/r/LightNovels - Translated Light Novels &amp; Japanese Web Novels", "title": "Do you think there will be public library for offical Light Novel English titles?", "title_full": "Do you think there will be public library for offical Light Novel English titles? : LightNovels", "published": "2017-12-07T07:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "30450c662cd8c30b1f090db2e8fef038eb2f799a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapScvZ9NUDALlJM8eu_EQUQ.ySZBAjIufuv4xjSnjxsAjG_B4vyEUPZeOVRKZoPjFN7r6xQs.a0xtzLe5G0jMvuQ3_WlWb1iZ7ebJCNyj9iv36f08YMXvJFs7x3ZKtWiMJtb3Y6NJuuLiI-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Legendary_Swordsman", "published": "2017-12-07T10:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Yeah my town library has a big section with manga and LNs.

presidency, and the White House makes it publicly known you\u2019re living on borrowed time? If you\u2019re Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, you brush it off, pack a suitcase and hop a flight to Europe, as if nothing had happened.\nTillerson tours Europe this week under circumstances unparalleled in recent U.S. diplomatic memory. After months of public tensions with President Donald Trump and rumors about Tillerson\u2019s future, the White House signaled last week he could be fired \u2014 and possibly soon. White House officials told multiple news organizations a plan was afoot to oust Tillerson and replace him with CIA Director Mike Pompeo, a close Trump confidant.\n\u201cIt\u2019s laughable,\u201d Tillerson quipped the next day, as aides insisted he was staying in his job.\n\u201cFAKE NEWS,\u201d tweeted the president, saying Tillerson was \u201cnot leaving.\u201d\nYet such damage to Tillerson\u2019s standing is not so easily erased \u2014 certainly not by a single tweet.\nIn Belgium, Austria and France this week, Tillerson will contend with European officials who now have more reason than ever to question whether he truly speaks for the president, how much credence to give his policies, and if he\u2019ll remain long enough to see them through. For foreign governments, it has created even more uncertainty over dealing with a mercurial administration in which the only voice that seems to matter is that of Trump himself.\nOpening his first day in Brussels on Tuesday, Tillerson alluded to the growing doubt about his leadership of the State Department as he greeted diplomats at the U.S. embassy. He acknowledged that \u201cwe don\u2019t have any wins yet\u201d and said he\u2019s getting \u201ca little criticism\u201d over the high number of vacancies in key roles \u2014 including, in Brussels, no U.S. ambassadors to either Belgium or the European Union.\nStill, Tillerson insisted he was making progress on his top priority: a top-to-bottom overhaul of the State Department. He said there would be some \u201cquick wins\u201d coming shortly that he would discuss at town hall meetings about the overhaul he said he\u2019d hold before year\u2019s end.\n\u201cThe State Department is not missing a beat,\u201d Tillerson said.\nIn the Belgian capital, Tillerson planned to meet with the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief and other regional diplomats before a conference of NATO foreign ministers. He\u2019ll then fly late Wednesday to Vienna for a conference of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, whose talks with Tillerson are always closely watched.\nThe former Exxon Mobil CEO will lastly go to Paris for a final round of meetings before returning to Washington. In each stop, key security issues related to Syria, North Korea, Lebanon and Iran are expected to be high on the agenda.\nThough Trump insisted on Twitter that he and Tillerson \u201cwork well together,\u201d he allowed news stories about Tillerson\u2019s impending demise to percolate for more than 24 hours before pushing back. Trump\u2019s spokeswoman didn\u2019t explicitly dispute that a plan had been hatched to replace Tillerson. Nor did she declare outright Trump\u2019s confidence in the Texas oil man.\nIn Trump\u2019s Washington, such is often the way. \u201cTrial balloons\u201d are floated in the press, and competing factions swipe and snipe from behind a cloak of anonymity. It\u2019s left to Americans at home to try to discern whether it\u2019s happening against the president\u2019s wishes or at his direct behest.\nEarlier this year, Tillerson clashed bitterly with former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and his allies. But Tillerson ultimately remained while Bannon and his associates were pushed out. More recently, Tillerson and his team have bumped heads with Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, and others in Kushner\u2019s camp, said several administration officials who weren\u2019t authorized to discuss internal disputes and requested anonymity.\nRepublican Sen. Bob Corker, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman and Tillerson ally, said it\u2019s clear someone has sought to undermine Tillerson.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who that is,\u201d Corker said after word emerged of the White House plan. \u201cI know he\u2019s taken on some tough issues like the reform of the State Department. I know it hasn\u2019t gone in a spectacular way.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white h", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob corker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike pompeo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kushner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rex tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sergey lavrov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared kushner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "organization for security and cooperation in europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "exxon mobil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate foreign relations committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lebanon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vienna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:08:15.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9b77b06f0cc08c23730628f6f1ab7f4c13dc569a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS3e.lBPb7U3_XReHzsOED4c-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9b77b06f0cc08c23730628f6f1ab7f4c13dc569a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS3e.lBPb7U3_XReHzsOED4c-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "\r\n2017-12-07 09:57:51,331 -

They\u2019re sadly no longer in business, for a couple of reasons: The owner/designer had to shift her focus to caring for her mother, who was very seriously ill. While people may not know this, all of the clothing they opened the store with were original designs by the owner.

They don\u2019t have as high of volume as we do. They don\u2019t experience as many breakdowns,\u201d said Jason Nisanov, a station agent who\u2019s visited the London transit system. \u201cEverybody\u2019s friendlier, everybody\u2019s a bit more patient.\n\u201cNew York is New York,\u201d he added.\nThe empty spots in the first round were for weekend morning and night shifts at the Mets-Willets Point No. 7 station in Queens, the 42nd St.-Eighth Ave. station on the A, C and E lines in Manhattan and the 149th St.-Grand Concourse station on the Nos. 2 and 5 lines in the Bronx.\nThere is a second round for workers to bid on 60 ambassador positions.\nMTA officials attribute the low interest to the fact that it\u2019s a new program that there was a question about pay raises for station agents that needed to be cleared up.\n\u201cWe are extremely focused on delivering better service and a better experience for our riders \u2014 and customer service ambassadors are an essential part of that,\u201d MTA spokesman Jon Weinstein said. \u201cAs new technology fundamentally changes the subway system, this is an incredible opportunity to work directly with the union to best deploy our talented workforce.\u201d\nDerick Echevarria, TWU's vice president of stations, blamed the vacancies on the bid being opened during the Thanksgiving holiday week.\nMeanwhile, the MTA hired a London-based company called Interact to train transit workers about helping wayward New Yorkers and tourists trying to navigate the subway, with the use of two professional actors.\nJohn Ferretti, a conductor and union shop steward who sat in on two eight-hour Interact sessions in October, said transit workers felt the ambassador program was a \u201cBand-Aid\u201d to the transit crisis.\n\u201cMembers are trying to explain to these people what some of the real-world consequences of what their suggestions could be,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be the go-to person to get grief from customers.\u201d\nTags: mta ",

I have no idea how to speak as to the usefulness of a simulated guitar amp used for sound design, but as a guitar player writing, playing, and recording my own stuff my opinion is that Brainworx' amps are the best available at any price. I've tried just about every amp sim on the market and there are strengths and weaknesses to all of them, but none achieve the same level of realism as the Brainworx plugs do.

Pukhet is a rainforested, lush green mountainous Provincial Island in the Andaman Sea dotted by most popular beaches along the clear waters of its western shore and umpteen hidden lagoons. Phuket is one of the southern provinces of Thailand. It consists of the island of Phuket, the country's largest island, and another 32 smaller islands off its coast. The region now derives much of its income from tourism and tourists flock the island province round the year because of the moderate climate. In Focus This tourist destination is home to a lot of high-end seaside resorts, spas and restaurants. Phuket City, as capital of the province, has old shops, modern malls and busy markets, including both regular as well as flea markets. In the island province, Patong is the main resort town which has many nightclubs, bars and discos to entertain tourists.\nNot far from the crowded beaches of Phuket, you can still find deserted lagoons and islands by kayaking to them. Kayaking is the use of a kayak boat for moving across water. In a kayak, that is more like a low-to-the-water canoe-like boat, the paddler sits facing forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle to pull front-to-back on one side and then the other in rotation. \nIn Phuket, sit-on-top and inflatable kayaks have gained popularity for eco-tourism these days which are suitable as two-man boats to navigate through the sea caves and a narrow tunnels while visiting sea lagoons, told my niece who visited Phuket recently. \nThere are only two ways into the lagoons, either by boat or by helicopter, she told. According to her, there can be no better way to explore the emerald bay on the western Andaman coast of Thailand than by kayak. \nAround two hundred small limestone islands characterised by sheer cliffs rising straight from the sea with hongs or hidden lagoons at their centres at times to be explored by kayaking around. One can find huge shoals of anchovies, bunch of cigar fish, sea urchins, brain coral, giant clams and parrot fish while negotiating a thick maze of mangroves to a huge, enchanting cavern full of dripping stalactites or bats on cave ceilings.

It's Time to Focus On Governance and Stop Blaming Jonathan - Amaechi. by 09:32:00 in NEWS Prompting you the best The Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, has admonished his colleagues in the Muhammadu Buhari administration to stop blaming former President Goodluck Jonathan. Mr. Amaechi said it is time for administration officials to concentrate on delivering good policies to the citizens rather than dragging the former president for Nigeria's woes. \"I agree with those who said we should stop criticising the last government and that we should do our own,\" The Nation newspaper quoted Mr. Amaechi as saying during a meeting at his office Tuesday. The minister decried Nigeria's infrastructure deficit, drawing a comparison with other relatively new countries like Singapore. \"We need to leverage on what we know. People are shouting intermodal transport; I went to the new airport in Singapore and I didn't find one person at the airport. \"As you walk in, technology takes over,\" Mr. Amaechi said. He called for an urgent renaissance in Nigeria's infrastructure, especially in the area of information and communications technology. \"They also said in the next few years, they would introduce driverless cars. We should also think outside the box about how to improve our transport sector and think less about how sun and moon affect the sector or building more bus stops. \"We should see how much investment we can put in the area of ICT. Intelligence transportation should not be ignored,\" he added. If heeded, Mr. Amaechi's call would mark a shift in Buhari administration's approach to public engagement. Since assuming office in 2015, President Buhari has led his appointees and party members to blame Mr. Jonathan for failing to properly direct the country's affairs during his tenure. Allegations such as senseless looting of public funds, nepotism, economic mismanagement and gross abuse of power are regularly directed at Mr. Jonathan. In June, Mr. Amaechi slammed Mr. Jonathan for allegedly failing the Igbo during his years, saying the former president left the region in a state of disrepair. \"President Jonathan went to Onitsha and danced and promised to construct Onitsha bridge. Right? After that nothing happened,\" Mr. Amaechi said at a social media forum in Lagos on June 13. Bolaji Abdullahi, spokesperson for the APC, told PREMIUM TIMES the call was appropriate. \"Enough of blaming the previous administration, Nigerians want us to focus,\" the spokesperson said. Mr. Abdullahi said the wrongdoings of Mr. Jonathan's government would remain in the memories of Nigerians, but that the current administration was not voted to amplify them. \"Yes, there were problems created by the previous administration, but Nigerians didn't vote for us because they want us to be telling them who's responsible. They want us to be solving problems,\" he said.
