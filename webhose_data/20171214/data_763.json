So, we feel these should not be made issues,\u201d he said. \nAmong the complaints were that the ballot papers did not have serial numbers and that the delegates list was not updated.\u2013Bernama Related posts", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anthony loke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "loke", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central executive committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernama related", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "putrajaya", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:40.064+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fb3bb914e07558092a9bdbf80f8cb416ef078180", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR0ZrJXIh..SnsxLLLDLesrFmYmGnbIR9902QrRO12SFfDQ.lVCrdSx5eTJFReLH7.2.iRYkeM7gxUbIOExgYAM2KwvHxPWWGKGklHgyamT1Q--", "site_full": "nashville.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://nashville.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist nashville | for sale search", "title": "Ford A/C Compressor Base Mount (Nashville, TN) $25", "title_full": "Ford A/C Compressor Base Mount (Nashville, TN) $25", "published": "2017-12-07T10:23:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fb3bb914e07558092a9bdbf80f8cb416ef078180", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR0ZrJXIh..SnsxLLLDLesrFmYmGnbIR9902QrRO12SFfDQ.lVCrdSx5eTJFReLH7.2.iRYkeM7gxUbIOExgYAM2KwvHxPWWGKGklHgyamT1Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:23:00.000+02:00", "title": "Ford A/C Compressor Base Mount (Nashville, TN) $25", "text": "make / manufacturer: Ford QR Code Link to This Post I have a Ford A/C Compressor iron base mount in excellent condition. $25 I also have other Ford & Mercury A/C parts.

Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now \n\u201cI\u2019m feeling really good. I came back in to train a couple of weeks early and trained with the young lads because I don\u2019t like training by myself and I was missing the boys,\u201d explained Turner. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of maintenance at the moment, but I\u2019m one of the older lads now so I\u2019m just getting looked after a bit. \n\u201cIn the couple of weeks that I did with the young lads they got ripped pretty hard because they try to test you pretty hard to see what your mental toughness is like \u2013 it took me back to when I was 18!

Those DUI lawyers are often asked various questions about the DUI & DWI process and what happens if you\u2019re charged with drunk driving. DUI Lawyers Tell Their Friends \nBelow are some of the most common conversations that DUI lawyers tell their friends. While this is not a post on how to get out of a DUI or DWI, these are legal suggestions that you can use if facing a DUI arrest and prosecution. Don\u2019t Drink and Drive \nDrinking and driving could be one of the most dangerous actions, as it puts the drunk driver and innocent drivers and pedestrians at risk. DUI lawyers often advise their friends that it\u2019s not worth taking the chance getting behind the wheel after having too many drinks. That being said, while it\u2019s not a crime to drink and drive, it is a crime to drink too much or two level of impairment and drive a motor vehicle. If you are planning on drinking and have to get somewhere, use a ride sharing app or taxi to get home safely. You Don\u2019t Have to Take the Tests \nAs the law stands now, in Maryland, there is no requirement that a driver who has been stopped for drunk driving submit to field sobriety test or breath / blood alcohol test. Field sobriety tests are typically conducted on the roadside by the police officer if he or she suspects the driver has consumed alcohol prior to driving. \nDrivers do not have to take these tests and are often advised by defense lawyers to refrain from providing additional evidence to the police if they\u2019re suspected of drunk driving. DUI lawyers will tell their friends that they don\u2019t have to take the test on the roadside but there may be administrative penalties if you refuse a breath or blood test. \nThe breath test is typically administered at the police station on a machine called an intoximeter . The police officer will transport the driver back to the police station, read the driver their rights as it pertains to administrative penalties, and ask them to submit to a test. If the driver refuses to take the test, there will be administrative sanctions against their license and privilege to drive. It may also result in the requirement to enroll in the ignition interlock program . Call your DUI lawyer \nDUI lawyers will tell their friends that if they get pulled over and charged with a DUI that they should contact their DUI lawyer soon as possible. By contacting the Law Offices of Randolph Rice you can speak with a DUI lawyer and schedule a consultation to discuss your drunk driving charges. \nStarting to prepare for a DUI defense is important and he sensual that a successful outcome. Drunk driving charges not only can affect your job, but it may also adversely affect your privilege to drive and your ability to conduct everyday tasks that require a motor vehicle. You Don\u2019t Have to Answer Any Questions \nThere is no requirement under the law that you answer the police officer\u2019s questions. You are required to provide your driver\u2019s license, registration and in some cases proof of insurance. However, you have the right to remain silent. Any words or statements that you made to the police can and will be used against you when you appear before the court. \nAdmissions such as how much you had to drink or the cadence of your speech can prove detrimental in your defense. The prosecutor who will be handling your case will look for clues and additional evidence from your behavior at the scene as well as throughout the arrest process to prove your case in court. So, keeping your mouth shut may prove beneficial to you in the long run. Maryland DUI Lawyers Here to Help \nWhile DUI lawyers may tell their friends these tips, they\u2019re not an excuse to avoid a DUI or DWI charge, but merely advisement of their rights. Drunk driving charges can cause great stress and concern for the accused. Hiring a skilled DUI lawyer can prove beneficial and helpful in securing your freedom.

Voters in Tuesday's runoff for Atlanta mayor are deciding between Norwood and Keisha Lance Bottoms. If Norwood wins, Atlanta would have its first-ever white female mayor. If Bottoms wins, it would continue what has been called the city's black political machine, which has dominated the mayor's office since the mid-1970s.

(AP Photo/John Bazemore) prev next comments Atlanta voters woke up to deja vu Wednesday in the racially polarized contest to choose the city's next mayor, with one candidate laying claim to City Hall while the other vowed to seek a recount over a margin of just 759 votes.\nThe Tuesday runoff between Keisha Lance Bottoms, who is black, and Mary Norwood, who is white, split Atlanta practically in half after a vitriolic campaign punctuated by political grudges and allegations of corruption. Unofficial results showed Bottoms leading with 46,464 votes, or 50.41 percent, to Norwood's 45,705 votes, or 49.59 percent.\nElection officials say a recount could happen next week if Norwood formally requests one. Results could be certified as soon as Saturday. Norwood would then have 48 hours to request the recount, which could take about three hours to complete.\nFor Norwood, the outcome virtually mirrored her 2009 loss to current Mayor Kasim Reed by a mere 714 votes. Norwood requested a recount, which ultimately produced only one additional vote. On Wednesday, Norwood wasn't seen at any public events and her campaign declined an Associated Press request for comment on the race.\nBottoms told WSB-TV in an interview Wednesday that she has not spoken with Norwood but is confident a recount would not change the results.\n\"I'm not surprised that she's asking for a recount, but I do think that our vote tally will hold, and I think if anything, our vote tally will go up,\" Bottoms said.\nA win for Norwood, 65, would give Atlanta its first-ever white female mayor, and end the Democratic Party's hold on an office it has held without interruption since 1879.\nIf Bottoms wins, she would become Atlanta's sixth consecutive African-American mayor, a trend that began with Maynard Jackson in 1973 and cultivated the balance between black political clout and white business interests that have come to define the city.\n\"This was a story of turnout,\" Emory University political scientist Andra Gillespie said. \"(Bottoms) is going to have to figure out how to bridge the divide across communities who say they want the same thing, but had different strategies for achieving these goals.\"\nThat dynamic is now threatened by an influx of newcomers, said Andrew Young, who served as mayor from 1982 to 1990 and endorsed Bottoms in the runoff. Now 85, Young said the elders who worked hard to make Atlanta the \"City Too Busy to Hate\" are moving off the scene, and \"the new people coming in don't realize how hard we worked.\"\n\"It's not black mayors \u2014 it's the best mayor,\" Young said. \"Until a more qualified white person decides to run, this will be the case.\"\nThe runoff was seen as a test of the staying power of the city's long-dominant black political machine and how it would respond to demographic and economic changes. Atlanta's last white mayor, Sam Massell, left office in 1974 and was succeeded over the next four decades by Jackson, Young, Bill Campbell, Shirley Franklin and Reed.\nAlthough Atlanta's population is less black than it was in 2009 \u2014 53 percent, compared with 56 percent then \u2014 black Atlantans still constitute a majority of registered voters and overall turnout. Tuesday's race saw 92,169 votes cast, less than 20 percent of the city's roughly 500,000 residents.\nVotes tracked along racial lines in north-side and south-side neighborhoods; both candidates won votes in the political battleground of east Atlanta.\nBottoms' strategists clearly borrowed tactics from Reed's 2009 playbook, capturing national attention with last-minute appearances by Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California.\nThough the race has yet to be officially called, Bottoms claimed victory early Wednesday at an Atlanta hotel flanked by her family and Reed, telling supporters: \"For all the little girls out there who need somebody to believe that you are better than your circumstances, I want you all to remember that black girl magic is real.\"\nObservers say black women were likely key in giving Bottoms' her unofficial lead. Bottoms was the only black woman on the ballot and the top vote-getter in the Nov. 7 general election. In the runoff, she was boosted by Harris, who has been touted as a potential 2020 presidential candidate.\n\"Everybody in our culture looked at what was going on in Atlanta,\" said Reed, who is leaving office after two terms.\nReed loomed large over the race in his dual roles as a chief strategist for Bottoms and a polarizing figure whose battles with his political enemies threatened to overshadow her campaign. He said whether Bottoms is the last black mayor will be up to voters.\n\"I totally believe that right now, a white person could be mayor of Atlanta,\" Reed said. \"But it's about talent, merit, and who you put up.\"\n___\nAssociated Press writers Jeff Martin and Kate Brumback in Atlanta contributed to this report.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "curtis compton/atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kasim reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam massell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john howe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andra gillespie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keisha lance bottoms", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kamala harris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kate brumback", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary norwood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keb wyant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norwood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill campbell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alyssa pointer/atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cory booker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shirley franklin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maynard jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew young", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "park tavern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap photo/john bazemore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emory university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press mary norwood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wsb-tv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fickett elementary school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press retired atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norwood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "city hall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new jersey", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:43.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "08ea9675c831ad22b1432361759832909aeec0bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9l.zvBgyzoX05czBxkrB8Gqzau6Eoaf0BxJmQwbKUxQpp9asFOvaWpfqarbABGmzhrZ_Zb2EueEw--", "site_full": "www.prisontalk.com", "site": "prisontalk.com", "site_section": "http://www.prisontalk.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=32", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "U.S. REGIONAL FORUMS - Prison Talk", "title": "A problem with mail in Stateville Prison -", "title_full": "A problem with mail in Stateville Prison - Prison Talk", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "08ea9675c831ad22b1432361759832909aeec0bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9l.zvBgyzoX05czBxkrB8Gqzau6Eoaf0BxJmQwbKUxQpp9asFOvaWpfqarbABGmzhrZ_Zb2EueEw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Barbeegirl88", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "A problem with mail in Stateville Prison -", "text": "I sent my fianc\u00e9 a letter the day after Thanksgiving and he just received it Thursday.

Beachgoers hardly noticed the test, which sounded like a distant siren. \n\u201cThat\u2019s a concern,\u201d said Vern Miyagi, agency administrator, adding that officials are looking at moving or repositioning sirens to make them more audible. \u201cWhen you rely on an outdoor siren sound, it can be masked by ambient sound and all kinds of other sound.\u201d \nOne lesson learned was that officials need to better communicate the test to tourists in various languages, Miyagi said. \nThere were other parts of the state that reported difficulty hearing the siren. Specifics about sirens that malfunctioned or were hard to hear will be available when the agency completes its report, which Miyagi expects around mid-month. \n\u201cMy wife in Kalama Valley couldn\u2019t hear it,\u201d he said referring to his east Honolulu neighborhood. \u201cThat complaint was not uncommon.\u201d \nMiyagi stressed that the siren is only one part of the emergency notification system. In an emergency that would require sounding the siren, there would also be alerts on smartphones and messages broadcast on TV and radio, he said. \nThe wailing siren, which Hawaii hasn\u2019t heard since the end of the Cold War, sounded for about a minute last week, after a routine test of a siren used to alert people about natural disasters such as a tsunami. \nThe agency is gathering reports from Hawaii\u2019s counties, along with information from volunteers who listened, Miyagi said. \nThis month\u2019s test generated more complaints than the usual test of the natural disaster siren, partly because of all the media attention leading up it. \n\u201cEverybody was listening for it this time,\u201d Miyagi said. \u201cPrior to this I would be lying to you if I said everybody stood at their homes \u2026 and listened acutely for the monthly tones.\u201d \nThe North Korea threat comes as Hawaii is upgrading its siren system, by repairing some and adding more. When done, the 384 sirens statewide will increase to 495, Miyagi said. \nA major goal of the test was successful, Miyagi said: Ensuring the siren can be activated statewide from a single button in an emergency operations center in Honolulu.

Basically, I played poker fairly seriously for around 4 years but stopped around 2 years ago. I didnt go broke or anything like that, just lost time for the game and slowly just stopped playing at any volume. I am Australian so online poker has become a bit of a hassle for me as I dont really want to use criptocurrency for sites as I have no idea what I am doing in that area. I enjoy live poker more than online anyways, I find it more entertaining and engaging. I am really just wondering what a minimum bankroll would be to play the 1/3 at Crown comfortably. I know proper bankroll management but feel 20 BIs will take me a long long time to save up and I would prefer to keep poker roll completely separate from life. Just want to hear some advice/stories of how people have gone on smaller rolls and how to manage smaller rolls to not let variance crush us early if we run bad.

If you play long enough you will eventually go on a downswing. BRM is about minimizing the chances of losing all the money that you have available to play poker, which is extremely important if poker is part of your livelihood. But almost everyone spends some money on entertainment. Taking some money out of your entertainment budget to play poker is a fine thing to do. Don't worry about bankroll until you have a bankroll to worry about. Just play the lowest stakes games you can find. Do worry about losing more than you can afford. I started playing live before online poker existed. I didn't have a proper bankroll. Eventually I got better at the game and built a bankroll. I practice proper BRM now, but I didn't have that option at the beginning. I had about $400 a month to spare. I lost it all a few times, and then tried again the next month. I don't really know much about bitcoin, but I've been using it for a few years on ACR and Ignition , and if you are smart enough to win at poker you are smart enough to use bitcoin for deposits and withdrawals. I'm not sure if it's any different for Australians or what sites are available to you, but here's more info on using it for ACR: re: Poker & Live bankroll advice Thanks for the reply, I tried to download Ignition but software just freezes upon opening? Wont load past the loading screen so not really sure whats going on with that. Bitcoin problem isnt so much I dont know how to use it, it just seemed like a lot of loop holes to put money on and by the time I purchase bitcoin and they take a % and than loading money onto poker site takes a % I already have lost almost 10% of the bankroll I was trying to put on the site. Anyone know of any sites that accept aussies that isnt ignition? Poker at: Ignition The processing fees for bitcoins are annoyingly unpredictable. In my experience, the larger your transaction, the smaller the fee is as a percentage of the transaction. I took $800 out of Ignition at the beginning of last month and the fees were less than $10. Unfortunately the fee might be just as high to deposit $50. Ignition and ACR, the sites I use, do not take a cut from bitcoin deposits or withdrawals. But CoinBase, the wallet I use, and I think all of the other wallets, do. Edit: I just tried a few numbers on Coinbase for how much it would cost to buy bitcoin with my debit card. US currency: Amount Fee The fees to then send that bitcoin to the poker site would be similar. #6 Yesterday, 10:24 AM JackleOfCrackle [9] Yeah the fees shown to me were similar but also take into account AUD to US which is around .70 at the moment so end up loosing a fair bit once conversion rates are added. #7 AlexTheOwl [742] Poker at: Ignition Do you mean that you are charged a fee to convert from AUD to USD and then to bitcoin? In a big market like Australia there must be a site that just sells bitcoin for AUD without converting to USD first? Then once you have the bitcoin, the poker site will exchange it for USD at the prevailing rates. As noted above, ACR and Ignition do not charge a fee for this. Or do you just mean that AUD is worth less than USD at the moment? That fact by itself doesn't cost you anything. In fact, if AUD weakens relative to USD between the time you deposit and the time you withdraw, you will gain. Right now 1 USD buys 1.33 AUD, but maybe by the time you withdraw one USD will buy more AUD. Or less, of course, I have no way of predicting it . . . but the fact that it fluctuates does not necessarily cost you money, as it can fluctuate in either direction. #8 JackleOfCrackle [9] re: Poker & Live bankroll advice I am charged conversion fees from AUD to US and again to bitcoin in a lot of cases. Though I admit I have not stalked the internet for a long period of time trying to find many other options. #9 Yesterday, 9:58 PM fonyas [20] The main thing is not to rush, even if there is a map to serve to play to the end and wait for a good map.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "acr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:44.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1a7468e9da05236ac523373eaae2443b7c4abd6f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqAY0p_pThMNXYjTfiRMt4Wa_4D_DSKPLTEWDJDtQ68JrQYGiR3d.iZzrnYt97vBnhJ471FDIqrrneRPbbI_6cFOM7atpZQN0AdjjFoqxZBkTHgJk5djl8", "site_full": "www.avforums.com", "site": "avforums.com", "site_section": "https://www.avforums.com/forums/blu-ray-dvd-discs.168/", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Blu-ray &amp; DVD discs | AVForums", "title": "What I Watched Last Night In HD (Review). | Page 165", "title_full": "What I Watched Last Night In HD (Review). | Page 165 | AVForums", "published": "2017-12-04T20:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.011, "main_image": "https://static.avforums.com/data/avatars/m/7/7561.jpg?1464159038", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10709, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "71cf1d12406da4c0e8e4999b620aa6cceac6b34c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqAY0p_pThMNXYjTfiRMt4Wa_4D_DSKPLTEWDJDtQ68JrQYGiR3d.iZzrnYt97vBnhJ471FDIqrrneRPbbI_6cFOM7atpZQN0AdjjFoqxZBpqXsq7tnIM1", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Coz22998", "published": "2017-12-06T12:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Lost Horizon (Sony, region free - UK disc, part of the HMV Premium Collection)\nWho'd have thought that a now 80 year old morality/ethical play would be just as, if not more relevant in these heady days of the 21st century?\nA planeload of escaping westerners narrowly avoid a revolution in China, yet en route home, their plane is hijacked and they mysteriously crash in the Himalayas. They're found by a mysterious group of travellers and escorted to the long lost city of Shangri-La, hidden away for all time by the mountains and the weather. Here, the story unfolds as the group ultimately tears itself apart over the dilemma of should they stay or should they return home?\nIts not a perfect film, not at all - the middle section drags as we see scene after scene of the group discovering the simple joys of living in Shangri-La: their code is 'be kind' (like a proto Bill and Ted's 'be excellent to each other!') and for what feels like an eternity we see how idyllic this place is. Ultimately, 2 hours 22 mins means this feels a little bit like a slog at times.\nBut what works is fantastic - the opening escape and crash is excellently staged (it feels a lot like the opening of Temple of Doom without the singing!) and the finale saves itself from the expected sentimental ending one might have expected by being staged in a really interesting way (rather than see the final act, we're told it all by a brand new character introduced solely for this purpose - if that makes it sound clunky its anything but, giving the ending a fresh and interesting viewpoint). But for all that, its that ethical dilemma that's the most interesting part, because of the five travellers at its centre.\nYou get a jaded politician, tired of seeing all his efforts at trying to fix the work, be wasted due to petty squabbling and local politics; we get the criminal capitalist, who finds money and the betterment of his fellow man can't always be disentangled; we get an academic who values an old bone over everything and everyone else, in his eyes bettering mankind's knowledge; we get a showgirl/actress who as been made sick by the hedonistic lifestyle she lives; and finally, the Dudley-do-right of the outfit, the brother who just wants to return home at all costs, although why we're not quite sure. These five form a none-more-relevant cross section of society and seeing how each in their own begin to come around to Shangri-La is fascinating - all want to somehow change it, all for the better, yet change means it destroys the simple essence of what makes people happy its a hugely interesting metaphor and one that is never rammed down the viewers throat, yet is blindingly obvious to even the causal viewer that the film isn't about offering answers, its about prompting discussion over what makes us happy. Well worthy of its reputation.\nThe transfer is interesting. Up front we're told that there is 6 mins of film that has been lost, but the audio remains - therefore for these minutes, still photographs of similar scenes play under the audio. Its not as jarring as it sounds. About 75% of the rest of the film looks pretty good - its been restored at 4K but its not been transformed into a uber detailed, shiny picture: its quite thick at times grain is left intact, as has some low level print damage. Contrast looks pretty nice and while having a softness appropriate to its age, it looks pretty nice projected. The remaining 25% is quite rough and consists mostly of scene transitions, although there are the odd whole scene where things soften up immeasurably and the picture looked almost SD at times. Ultimately, its a mixed bag, but when its good its not bad at all and frankly the film doesn't need a perfect restoration to still play incredibly well. The lossless mono track is far better - its clean for almost its entire run time and everything sounds clear and as it should. I watched the 30 min documentary on the film, which wasn't bad, focussing on the minutiae of shooting certain scenes as well as wider issues such as its disasterous test screenings. There are a few other odds and sods on here (a couple of very short pieces on the restoration or nothing but comparison shots), but none really worth your time.\nSummary - a hugely enjoyable and still relevant ethical discussion about happiness (with touches of socieatal issues as well, such as do you do something for the benefit of man even if its to the detriment of you?). An odd transfer not helped by the films history but one that is probably the best it will ever get and honestly, it doesn't detract from the film one bit.

Pretty darn well imo, i.wont talk about the film as I'm sure all of us lot on here have watched this several times on every conceivable format lol.\nPQ, there's no hiding the fact that this film has had DNR applied, but thankfully it doesn't look like a wax work show, it's certainly smoothed the image out, but 95% of my 3D films have that \"smoothed over look\" there are a few soft scenes, such as when Sarah is talking to doctor/psychiatrist, the image of the docs face looked a little smoothed/blurred, but this is the only scene that I can think of. The depth and separation looks excellent through most of the film, Arnie looks as cool as ever donning his leathers and cruising around on the Harley, black levels are pretty decent throughout the entire film, for me the 3D makes this film more engaging, drawing you in. Some decent 3D moments when the T1000 morphs his arms into the sleek looking weapons, a few nice pop out bits, but not ott, the scene at the cyberdyne building along with the shootout looks great, you have the cool blue and shimmering of the interior, the haylon gas system blasting out, then we get the iconic line from Arnie looking great in 3D lol.\nFor me, this was worth the purchase, and happy to keep this in my 3D collection, Mrs N was over the moon with it so it can't be that bad lol..not perfect, but not far off, yes the image is smoother but not an issue if you plan to watch it in 3D.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:44.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fd911830486ba89a5cd9a919c322f6ce3ba174d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p5IYyUcv2ZgVDQVuin2LgmZBsG9rIf2Yg", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/hc/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/hc/ - Hardcore - 4chan", "title": "Dp creampie fetish", "title_full": "/hc/ - Dp creampie fetish - Hardcore - 4chan", "published": "2017-11-04T08:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 95, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.264, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fb3fb0b944916969e28a9ba92d63759cf6da4af1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p5IYyUcv2ZgVDQVuin2LgmSWE6.PX9QHwWieyUt7nOhM-", "ord_in_thread": 93, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-06T06:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Houstonian checking in, anyone else here from texas? looking to experience threesome (even though it is a major long shot)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:44.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1a7468e9da05236ac523373eaae2443b7c4abd6f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqAY0p_pThMNXYjTfiRMt4Wa_4D_DSKPLTEWDJDtQ68JrQYGiR3d.iZzrnYt97vBnhJ471FDIqrrneRPbbI_6cFOM7atpZQN0AdjjFoqxZBkTHgJk5djl8", "site_full": "www.avforums.com", "site": "avforums.com", "site_section": "https://www.avforums.com/forums/blu-ray-dvd-discs.168/", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Blu-ray &amp; DVD discs | AVForums", "title": "What I Watched Last Night In HD (Review). | Page 165", "title_full": "What I Watched Last Night In HD (Review). | Page 165 | AVForums", "published": "2017-12-04T20:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.011, "main_image": "https://static.avforums.com/data/avatars/m/7/7561.jpg?1464159038", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10709, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f01f4fc24ff017919f0a9a90506e98918fd5c459", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqAY0p_pThMNXYjTfiRMt4Wa_4D_DSKPLTEWDJDtQ68JrQYGiR3d.iZzrnYt97vBnhJ471FDIqrrneRPbbI_6cFOM7atpZQN0AdjjFoqxZBpPQQ15r9gAQ", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "dinoprada2003", "published": "2017-12-06T12:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Ripley18711 said: \u2191\nCult of Chucky - (Blu-ray UK - Part of the Complete 7-Movie Collection)\n\u200b Got to be honest, I didn\u2019t mind this. Not great and not my favourite, but way better than Seed and although I can\u2019t remember a lot, I preferred it to Curse\u2026I think.\nI loved the Chucky films as a kid. The first 3 will always be my favourites and I\u2019ve lost count of how many times I\u2019ve seen them. I did enjoy Bride but that\u2019s when they just started getting a bit too silly. As for Seed, less said about that the better.\nSo on to Cult of Chucky. First of all it\u2019s nice to have the return of Andy Barclay, now all grown up. Once again played by the original Andy, Alex Vincent. I could barely recognise him but as the film goes on I could see bits of a resemblance from him as a child. His screen time is a bit limited but it shows how messed up Chucky has made him.\nThe story continues a few years after the last film where Nica (Fiona Dourif) was blamed for the murders in Curse and sentenced to a mental institution. Due to good behaviour and coming to believe (or being made to believe) she did commit the crimes she gets transferred to a minimum security institute. Soon after her arrival her clever dick of a therapist brings a Chucky doll to the group sessions to try and \u2018help\u2019 Nica! Haven\u2019t these people learned by now! Naturally trouble starts and murders to boot. She believes (and we obviously know) that it\u2019s the pint sized serial killer, but others don\u2019t believe her, including her therapist. In the usual horror way, people start getting picked off one by one.\nTbh these films have lost their way and they seem to be running out of steam. Personally I wish they\u2019d stopped after 3, but there are some good bits of grue in this (worthy of its 18 cert) and despite her looking like a female version of her dad, Fiona Dourif is pretty damn hot! As for Brad, he\u2019s as offensive as ever and gets his usual good one liners.\nJennifer Tilly reprises her role as Tiffany and stay until the end of the credits for another old characters return, in albeit a rather pointless scene, but obviously there for setting up the next film.\nI always liked how Chucky was brought back at the start of each film, but this one was pretty weak as there wasn\u2019t really one and the whole \u2018cult\u2019 thing is never really explained properly.\nCan\u2019t really recommend it unless you\u2019re a Chucky fan. Recommended more so if you like the ones from Bride onwards. There is potential for the next one based on the end of Cult. Just hope it goes in a better direction with something more fresh.

Only here you find music that relaxes and refreshes you and invites you to live special moments. On October 14, 2014 Estereotempo change frequencies from 99.9 FM to 96.5 FM, while Fresh 99.9 FM begins broadcasting on October 15 with better coverage in the metropolitan area. Fresh offers a wide variety of American CHR Music. Fresh is transmitting on 99.9 FM Metro & 105.1 FM Islandwide. Originally this radio station was owned and operated by Alfredo Ram\u00edrez De Arellano y B\u00e1rtoli and it was the FM complement to WQBS AM 630, now WUNO. The station was playing soft easy listening music with the branding La Gran Cadena FM, founded in March 1961. In 1985, after a total revision of the format, it starting playing a well-organized Beautiful Music programming, and their call letters changed to WIOB, ESTEREOTEMPO 99, LA M\u00daSICA M\u00c1S BELLA DEL MUNDO PARA PUERTO RICO. By that time the three radio stations that forms the network were WQBS 630 & 99.9 San Juan, WORA 760 & 97.5 Mayag\u00fcez, and WPRP 910 & 105.1 Ponce. They suppose to change to WIOA San Juan, WIOB Mayag\u00fcez and WIOC Ponce; but a possible conflict and confusion with WHOA 870 AM prevented this from happening. However, with the sale of WHOA to Pedro Rom\u00e1n Collazo and the change of call letters from WHOA to what is now WQBS, WIOA and WIOB interchanged call letters to what the original plan was. The station dropped the beautiful music format in the late 80\u2019s in favor of Spanish ballads and then evolved in what it is now. After 29 years on 99.9 FM, Cadena Estereotempo moves its frequency to WRXD 96.5 FM with better coverage in the Metropolitan area & Estereotempo continues on WIOB 97.5 FM in the western region. \n\nFresh 99.9 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pedro rom\u00e1n collazo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alfredo ram\u00edrez de arellano", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "estereotempo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la gran cadena fm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "m\u00e1s bella", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wioa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wiob", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "estereotempo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cadena estereotempo", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san juan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ponce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wioc ponce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la m\u00fasica", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:44.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "91118221d98a98c1d33c4479563c06e4284fc843", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg81ZVJAxmjazDJAvOJ6jGzYiDvfdUrRJBJiergGa8RtuMYq9WKi6PV5mdG369_z7A3CVJ4BD6f5Gg--", "site_full": "www.lhllaw.com", "site": "lhllaw.com", "site_section": "http://blawgsearch.justia.com/blogs/categories/criminal-law/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Recent Criminal Law posts - Justia BlawgSearch.com", "title": "How do Truck Tires Cause Accidents?", "title_full": "How do Truck Tires Cause Accidents?", "published": "2017-12-07T00:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.lhllaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/truck-tire-cause-accidents.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "91118221d98a98c1d33c4479563c06e4284fc843", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg81ZVJAxmjazDJAvOJ6jGzYiDvfdUrRJBJiergGa8RtuMYq9WKi6PV5mdG369_z7A3CVJ4BD6f5Gg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mandy Jackson", "published": "2017-12-07T00:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "How do Truck Tires Cause Accidents?", "text": "How do Truck Tires Cause Accidents? Published on December 6, 2017 \nAnyone could inadvertently purchase a defective tire and experience a blowout. However, when the blowout is a semi-truck tire, the results are more catastrophic than in smaller vehicles. It is estimated that about six percent of the collisions involving large trucks result from tire problems. If you or someone you care about has been seriously injured in an incident with a semi-truck, tire issues could be a potentially serious culprit. \nWe know you need help figuring out who was responsible , and the experienced truck accident lawyers at Laird Hammons Laird are eager to fight for your interests. Did a tire fall off a truck or was there a blowout? Call us and we\u2019ll discover who is at fault and responsible for your injuries; we\u2019re here to assist in getting your life back on track. Why Does Tire Failure Happen? \nWith 18 wheels, trucks have more than four times as many tires as a regular passenger vehicle. Meaning semi-trucks simply have more chances of tire failure. The most common reasons for tire failure fall into five main categories. Improper Tire Usage \nThe most common issue with improper usage happens when tires aren\u2019t properly inflated. Tires are made to function at a specific internal pressure, and if they aren\u2019t inflated to that pressure, the structural integrity of the tire is compromised. Often tires are under-inflated or trucks are over-loaded with weight the tires aren\u2019t equipped to handle. These are common causes of truck tire blow-outs. Road Hazards \nWhen something as large as a semi-truck gets moving, changing the direction of that much weight is dangerous. Tires are often damaged by potholes and poor road conditions. In addition, tires are sometimes damaged by debris in the roadway dropped from other vehicles or left by storms. Even if the tires are in good condition, road hazards can cause severe damage to a tire and cause truck drivers to lose control of the vehicle. Maintenance Issues \nAnytime there is maintenance done on or with tires, there is the possibility of damage or improper repair. Improper repairs that occur when retreading tires can cause problems, as well as damage done when the tires are mounted or removed from the vehicle. Drivers and companies who let tires get worn out or busted without proper repair could be liable for the accident. Tires that fly off of a truck when improperly maintained can become high-speed destructive objects on the highway, endangering the lives of many. Manufacturing Defects \nIt is possible for a tire to come straight from the factory or processing with a flaw built into it. Any damage to the tire before it gets to the truck can be considered damage done during manufacturing or processing. Excessive Heat \nTires are known to fail during seasons of excessive heat. The friction, high-speeds, corners, and frequent braking when the surface temperature of the road is high can cause more frequent tire failure. Avoiding driving during the hottest periods will help reduce this risk. Who is Responsible for Tire Damage? \nTo know who is responsible, you must be able to determine what happened to cause the accident. Without experienced help and an investigation, you may be unable to find the answers. Don\u2019t hesitate to call our lawyers\u2013we\u2019re experts and we know how to discover the truth. Some commonly responsible parties are: Tire manufacturer If the tire failed due to a defect stemming from the manufacturer, they are at least partially responsible for the accident. Taking on a large corporation may seem daunting, but our lawyers are up to the task. Driver \u2013Did you know that every driver is responsible for doing an inspection of his truck and equipment before hauling a load? If the driver didn\u2019t do his inspection or failed to fix an issue, the accident could be considered their fault. In addition, what actions did the driver take when faced with a problem? This could also affect their level of responsibility for the accident. Scheduling company \u2013Does the driver work for a company? Is someone else loading the truck? The company who hires the driver could be responsible for the accident.

I'd watched a documentary on the bombings earlier this year (the excellent Marathon: the Patriots Day Bombing) and while this film was more focussed on the investigation and hunt for the terrorists rather than the stories of the survivors, it still managed to bring that lump to the throat. Peter Berg gets a lot of crap, but frankly, manipulative they may be, his films do tend to gut punch me - Lone Survivor had me crying my eyes out come the final credits, and while this and Deepwater Horizon were not quite at the same tear squeezing level, their tales of everyday heroes did their job on me good and proper. Ok, so maybe not Battleship\nAs a film, it works really well for the most part - following the several hours before the bombing, through to the blast itself and the 4 days of the intense manhunt that followed, the film is put together technically superbly: intercutting the myriad of real life footage (news footage, mobile phone footage, surveillance footage, etc) with the technically excellent dramatization, the film grabs you and never lets up. Unusually, we follow several key individuals both before, during and after the bombing and see how they intersect one another, all of which is weaved round the main narrative throughline of Mark Wahlbergs cop and the ongoing investigation, which is showed with just the right level of detail.\nIts tense (the set pieces are incredibly well staged - the bombing itself and the street shootout are nail biting), its very well acted (Wahlberg himself puts in a really good show here, but everyone brings their A-games) and very well dramatized (it cuts from real life footage to dramatized footage instantly in some cases, showing the attention to detail that the filmmakers gave). All the usual criticisms of these kind of real life dramatizations apply here - too many characters (the victims themselves are all but sidelined), not enough time given to the antagonists (although here, they do give quite a bit of screentime to the two brothers), but on the whole, I found the film engaging, tense and moving come the end.\nBut I do have one really big issue with the whole thing. For a film that strives for attention to detail, to have Wahlberg's fictitious cop be at the centre of all the films major plot beats is a really odd choice. I get that he was an amalgam of multiple individuals who all played their part, and that traditionally, we tend to follow a single character through these kinds of sprawling investigations as an aid to the audience, but here it felt very odd. We already have key plot beats relayed from characters points of view we've spent very little time with, would it really have mattered if Wahlberg had been replaced by the multiple real life counterparts? Having watched the documentary and become familiar with the investigation, it felt a very odd move on behalf of the filmmakers to have this fictitious character be front and centre - by all means have this sort of character in the background to give voice to the emotions and feelings of the city and its people, but having him be the one making all the key discoveries in the investigation feels a very odd decision and really does rob the film of some validity in my eyes.\nIts a stunning transfer though, no doubt about it - even in its lowly 1080p format, picture quality is fantastically good, as is the DTS:X soundtrack. Almost reference on both elements. I didn't bother with any of the extras as I'd seen that documentary, but there looked to be some decent stuff on the disc, so they might be worth checking out.\nSummary - its very accomplished and as a testament to the real life events, it portrays them in excellent detail, while managing to make a tense, emotional and fanstastically well put together thriller. But that Wahlberg issue bugs the hell out of me - don't treat audiences as stupid, we can deal with lots of characters weaving in and out of stories, we don't need to be spoonfed like this!!! Rant over.

Under the Justice Reinvestment Act that was signed into law by Governor Larry Hogan on May 19, 2016, certain provisions of the Transportation Article 16-303 have changed. \nPrior to October 1, 2017, if a driver was stopped for driving with a suspended license under certain provisions of the law or driving with a suspended license from another state, jail time was a possibility. \nHowever, under the new law, driving with a suspended license 16-303(h) or 16-303(i) is a fine only offense . But, the driver must appear in court and may not pre pay the fine. \nThe new Maryland suspended license law also applies to driving with a suspended license from another state (other than Maryland) for failing to appear or pay a fine under Transportation Aticle 16-303(i). \nPreviously a driver could face up to two months in jail and a $500 fine, but now the maximum penalty is a $500 fine. The driver still must appear in court and may not prepay the fine. Most police are charging additional violations like 16-303(c), which can still result in jail time, and driving without a license . Which sections have changed under the new suspended license law? \nThe two sections of the Transportation Article 16-303 that have changed are 16-303(h) and 16-303(i). \nTA 16-303(h) prohibits a person from driving a motor vehicle while that person\u2019s license or privilege to drive is suspended under the following four scenarios: Pursuant to Maryland Transportation Article 17-106 , if a person fails to surrender their registration after a security lapse, the motor vehicle administration May suspend that driver\u2019s license to drive. Pursuant to Maryland Transportation Article 26-204 if an individual fails to appear for court, the court may notify the MVA and the person\u2019s driving privileges shall be suspended or if a person fails to pay a fine or post a bond for a traffic ticket the administration will suspend the driver\u2019s license for that person. Pursuant to Maryland Transportation article 26-206 , if a person fails to appear in the US District Court the Motor Vehicle Administration may suspend the driving privilege of that person. Pursuant to Maryland Transportation Article 27-103 , if a person fails to pay a fine under the Maryland Vehicle Laws or federal traffic laws then the motor vehicle administration may suspend the driving privilege or license for the person who has not paid the fine. Driving on a Suspended Out-Of-State License in Maryland \nPrior to October 1, 2017, a person could be put in jail for up to 2 months and pay a $500 fine if they failed to appear for court in another state or fail to pay a fine in another state and were caught and convicted of driving with a suspended license in Maryland. \nThe law has changed and now sets the maximum penalty for failing to pay a fine or appear in another state at $500. However, if issued a ticket under transportation article 16-303(h) or 16-303(i), a driver still must appear in court and may not pre-pay the fine. Maryland Suspended License \nWhile the laws have changed for two sections of the Maryland Transportation Article 16-303, police and law enforcement are still charging \u201cmust appear\u201d incarcerable offenses if a driver is found to be suspended. Suspended license charges are serious in Maryland as they do carry the potential for jail time and the assessment of points to a driver\u2019s record. \nIf a driver is convicted of driving on a suspended license they could face 3 to 12 points assessed to their driving record, depending on the subsection for the transportation article. Get help from a Maryland suspended license lawyer \nIf you\u2019re facing driving on a suspended license charges in Maryland it is wise to seek the assistance from an experienced Maryland suspended license lawyer . As there are various defenses to driving with a suspended license, such as notice and lack of license, a lawyer may be helpful in avoiding jail, fines, probation or other consequences and penalties.

However, Transport Minister Humza Yousaf explains that an expert panel in 2016 \u201cwas incredibly impressed with the high level of design\u201d. It had not been designed in detail in 2016.\nAt a recent public consultation it was necessary for cyclists to point out to officers that provision shown for a right turn off Victoria Road in Glasgow was quite inadequate.\nOnly subsequently has the council announced it is proposing to use an innovative Dutch-style junction, subject to government approval.\nGlasgow City Council\u2019s good design is skin deep. Last week at a consultation about plans for Battlefield junction, the council displayed four options, none of which considered the needs of cyclists, and with only a couple of token pedestrian crossings shown. We\u2019ll consider them later, was the explanation offered. Proposed road layouts with alignments skewed to permit junctions at right angles were drawn to suit cars, yet statistics presented showed significant pedestrian, cycle and bus usage, at times more people are using them than cars.\nWhy aren\u2019t pedestrian and cycle facilities being considered routinely across the city when a project starts, and given priority?\nThe design mentality is still to consider them as something added on when vehicle needs have been designed for.\nThe council is providing high quality segregated cycle facilities on relatively wide uncongested roads, the South City Way; not so on recently upgraded Union Street. It has no facilities for cyclists because, the road being narrow, they would hinder vehicular traffic.\nTo provide safe space on inner city roads it is often necessary to give cyclists dedicated road space, something the council doesn\u2019t yet do routinely on highways if it hinders vehicle flows. Look for the cycle box on the recently upgraded St. George\u2019s Road; it is missing.\nSustrans\u2019s Daisy Narayan wants to see \u201cimproving conditions for people who choose to walk or cycle\u201d. Why then did Sustrans fund the tarmacing of a 50 metre length of footpath on Kelvin Walkway that is less than 1.5 metres wide for cyclists to use instead of the designated national cycle route across the river through the Botanic Gardens arboretum?\nPedestrian facilities have been downgraded. Sustrans is credited on a council sign that invites cyclists to bypass the proper cycle route that closes at dusk.\nThe sign was erected just before the arboretum was closed for three weeks for the commercial Jurassic event. Coincidence? Now Land Services at the council wants cyclists to use the footpath permanently, instead of arranging to keep the national route open all of the time.\nAnd what about the steep cyclepath link off Garrioch Drive, funded by Sustrans, that has been permanently closed at a loss of \u00a36,353? The council ignored a warning that it was hazardous.\nWhen a cyclist fell off Sustrans acknowledged it wasn\u2019t fit for all users, so the council had to close it; not exactly the best design or funding decision.\nMr Yousaf trumpets the virtues of the South City Way, a segregated cycle facility.\nIs anyone telling him that across Glasgow are poorly designed and maintained cycle facilities? When are they going to be put right?\nPat Toms,\nFlat 1/2,\n68 Shakespeare Street,\nGlasgow.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "daisy narayan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelvin walkway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "humza yousaf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sustrans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pat toms", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yousaf", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "glasgow city council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "land services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shakespeare street", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "st. george\u2019s road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victoria road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south city way", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glasgow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "union street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "botanic gardens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garrioch drive", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:45.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ecbc25190e4564c508522417bd657b43b85d03da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rDNjs.ZgPA_kKdgqijxGtu1PFu6mBMA5Aic06ZvT8EEv6Q8xoD9fhrs_AhKhzrdimcv9sljdM.KvHHI0t4imoO8kd3gZR6LaVEYn8_5ZAnZ27S.1pUatEA--", "site_full": "quartiersaintemarguerite.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://quartiersaintemarguerite.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Quartier Sainte-Marguerite \u00e0 Li\u00e8ge", "title": "No\u00ebl dans notre quartier", "title_full": "No\u00ebl dans notre quartier", "published": "2017-12-07T12:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ecbc25190e4564c508522417bd657b43b85d03da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rDNjs.ZgPA_kKdgqijxGtu1PFu6mBMA5Aic06ZvT8EEv6Q8xoD9fhrs_AhKhzrdimcv9sljdM.KvHHI0t4imoO8kd3gZR6LaVEYn8_5ZAnZ27S.1pUatEA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Catinus (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "No\u00ebl dans notre quartier", "text": "", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:45.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9a799d85698e8d83fe0187bc82c57bbc05fe019e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Gmz3g4LVGXS66Tqiun6rcnJOfHLU2q9ZuY56rcHQMJk_ulN8XJp7PoVhThR.KOxQX3FBopnH3gEwXue0mjf8CxY3F.gkN8uFJpLRlEXo5dNvnm.coNlK34Lv1_oBA778pu_2QzBWKyOXhpvyTchwy", "site_full": "www.goal.com", "site": "goal.com", "site_section": "http://www.goal.com/en/feeds/news?fmt=rss", "site_categories": ["world_soccer", "sports"], "section_title": "Goal.com News - International", "title": "Ronaldo, Son or Mane?
