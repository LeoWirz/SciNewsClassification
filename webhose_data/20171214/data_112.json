Theprotesters which LEADERSHIP learnt comprised of senior staff union from Grade Level 8 and upward also indicted the ministry for their failure to pay for repatriation and 1st 28 days since 2012. Part of their grievances was also the inability of the ministry to train members of staff and provide working materials since 2012. Anon the spot assessment by LEADERSHIP revealed that the offices were under lock and key as staff were not allowed to gain entrance into their offices exceptwith the permission of the Union chairman who was identified as Mr Lekan. It was also discovered that the protesters stormed the ministry as early as 8.30ameven as no management staff was on ground to addressthe protesters as at 12pm. Someof their grievances as pasted on the notice board are \u201cNo payment of repatriation since 2012\u201d; \u201cno payment of 1st 28 days since2012\u201d; \u201cbuy your chin-chin and buns at the reception\u201d; \u201cnoworking materials since 2012\u201d ; \u201cno training since 2012\u201d and\u201dDFA go chop, monkey go chop\u201d. The other inscription read, \u201cWe demand equal rights and justice; strengthenour institutions, don\u2019t kill our motivation; give us our dues as at when due;we are in Nigeria and not in Libya; stop the economic blockades; we have families to care for; we have bills to pay and humans must survive, is this sustainable development.\u201d Further investigations revealed that the staffs requested for Christmas bonus, which they felt that the ministry rebuffed their demand. Attempt to speak with the union chairman identified as Mr Lekan proved abortive as he declined to grant interview to LEADERSHIP.

This crystal gives the liquid Latex of their body it`s shape and bodystructure. The Latexians know that they are a \u201cmade\u201d race. Long ago they found ruins on their planet, with a strange machine. Inside the records of said machine were files about the creation of Vitacrystal. It is not known if the Latexians are a real artificial race, or if their makers transfered their essence into the Vitacrystals.\nThe Latexians are a very curious and helpful species. They constantly search for new knowledge so they may expand their archive.\nIt is tradition in their culture that a Latexian must travel for several years when they come of age out into distant galaxies, so they may bring back new knowledge and data once they return. Perhaps the true intention of this tradition is to find their source of creation. To other species, Latexians are scholars in the fields of science and technology.

A city worker is praised and we can see the bay is producing a bumper crop of oysters. Even the local car thief is a really nice boy who helps his landlady with the chores. \nOur Chasing Shadows question this week: Did Mrs. Mathews ever get her car back? You get bonus points if you can remember what kind of a car it was. The make and model seem to have been left out of the story. \nIf you know, please contact the Times at 653-8868 or Lois Swoboda at lswoboda@starfl.com. \n\nMan borrows car, never returns \nMrs. Dorothy Sawyer Mathews reported to police last Thursday that a man renting an apartment from her borrowed her car and did not return. \nMrs. Mathews said Clint Canterbury, an employee at the Coca Cola Plant, had been living in an upstairs apartment at her house at 219 Avenue E. She said he borrowed her car Thursday morning to go to the laundry. \nA warrant has been issued for Canterbury\u2019s arrest. \n\u201cThree days after he moved in,\u201d said Mrs. Mathews, \u201che began cleaning up the yard, raking and trimming. It was just marvelous. Then last Wednesday he overheard me telling some ladies that I would pick them up for a luncheon.\u201d \n\u201cAnd he said, \u2018Mrs. Mathews, you bring me a towel and some soap and let me wash this car for you.\u2019 Well he cleaned up the car real well and drove me to St. Joe to get it inspected. \n\u201cThe next morning,\u201d she continues, \u201che came and asked me if he could borrow the car to go to the laundry and go to borrow a chain saw to cut down a cedar tree in the yard. I gave him my keys and he left around 8:30\u201d \n\u201cBy 10, I was getting worried. By 11, I thought he had a terrible wreck and the poor man was lying in the hospital. By 12, I was so nervous I could scream.\u201d \nMrs. Mathews called the police about 2 p.m. and they set up roadblocks going out of the city, but Canterbury had apparently already left. \nMrs. Mathews said all her keys were on the chain that she lent Canterbury. \n\nMember of old family is thirty-year city worker \nTraditionally, news organizations have catered to the unusual, bizarre, illicit and outlandish. Rapes and murders, frauds, armed robberies, corruption of public officials and other such incivilities have always dominated the media. \nThe people who really make things go, who live quietly and unobtrusively, raise families and pay taxes are almost ignored. But we feel that those are the really important ones, the ones who are newsworthy because their presence is so important to the community. \nSo, from time to time, we will bring these essential citizens to the fore and acknowledge their worth. At the same time we will all get to know each other a little better. \nLast Monday morning, Joe Zingarelli was seen driving a white pick-up truck at breakneck speed in the direction of the Apalachicola waterworks. His mission, no doubt, was concerned with a problem with the municipal water system that so effectively serves the area. \nThere was nothing unusual in his haste or in his activity for Joe has been attending to city problems for over 30 years. His responsibilities have, during that time, included, in addition to the water supply, the sewage treatment plant, maintenance of equipment, street and cemeteries, supervision of garbage collection and the volunteer fire fighting facilities. All of these functions, concentrated in one position, have challenged Joe and made him a person in the community to which the citizens are beholden. \nThroughout his years of city employment he has been burdened with hundreds and thousands of problems, projects and malfunctions, to each of which he has brought vigor, enthusiasm and good humor. \nHe seems to have always been highly energized, Quitting school early, Joe spent several years as a planer in a local lumber mill and with the Port St. Joe paper company. During those years he had been a member of the local National Guard but his enlistment expired in 1940 when the local men of Company E were mobilized. He hurriedly reenlisted and left with them when they departed. \nAbout a year after being discharged (in 1947) he was recruited to take over field operations of the city, responsibilities he still has. \nJoe\u2019s roots in Apalachicola go back a long way. \nHis grandfather, Genero Joseph Zingarelli, was born in Lapulia province, Italy in 1834 and came to the gulf coast of Florida at an early age where he worked in the sponge industry. At that time sponges were found in abundance from Key West to Apalachicola and were fished heavily throughout their range. \nAfter an earlier marriage and several years\u2019 residence in Wakulla County, Genero came to Apalachicola sometime after 1873 where he remarried, this time to Antonia Sangregorio. She is still remembered as the widow of the Sangregorio brother killed by lightning while fishing. Several children were produced by this union, one of whom was Angelo Joseph who married Elizabeth Shine, a native of Borbahue, County Cork, Ireland. Elizabeth had lived in Boston after arriving in this country and was brought to Apalachicola by the well-to-do and socially prominent Ruge family. \nElizabeth bore two sons, Genero (Jiggs) and Joe (the principal subject of this article) and two daughters, Helen and Theresa. \nJoe married Marie Rentz of Sweetwater, Alabama in 1948. They met earlier while he was on leave from his wartime assignment in Alaska and she was employed in George Lewis\u2019 local restaurant. They have four children one of whom, Jack, is a county commissioner. \nJoe expects to retire in 1979 and involve himself more deeply in his hobby of beekeeping. \nHis shoes will be extremely difficult to fill and the city will need to let some ambitious worker follow him around for several months of indoctrination. There is only one person who knows where everything is, how it works and how to fix it. That person is Joe Zingarelli. \n\nOyster gulping time in Sarasota; just 30, 40 dozen more to go \nRobert M. Ingle \nTimes Editor \nOyster eating is not yet an Olympic event, but it is gaining in popularity. For instance, the fourth annual raw oyster eating contest sponsored by Walt\u2019s Fish Market in Sarasota is scheduled for Sunday, Dec.11 at 2 in the afternoon. \nWalt\u2019s is located on US 301 six blocks north of the Sarasota County Courthouse. Spectators are welcome to the battle of the eaters which features a $500 first prize, $250 second prize and $100 third prize. \nThe world champion, Vernon Bass, will be on hand, although he will not be a contestant. His record, 634 oysters in 20 minutes and 30 seconds, is in the \u201cGuinness Book of Records.\u201d \nContestants will be given one hour to try and beat Bass\u2019s feat, which will not be easy. \nWinners in this area have been less impressive. For instance, Robbie Roberts of Marietta, Georgia won the Apalachicola crown in 1976 by consuming 33 dozen in 15 minutes and again in 1977 with a total of 21 dozen in the same time. \nWe know the fate of the critters that will be consumed in Sarasota (digestion), but it is just as certain that they originate in Apalachicola.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

and 2 prelims IV.\nAccording to ecfgm-nrmp 2016 data people with one contiguous rank have around 40% matching rate and only 11 out of 44 (25% ) matched on that year (2016).\nI'm disappointed I always wanted to be a radiologist, but numbers are not in my favor.\nSo chances are I match to both prelims and advance, partially matched (only prelim) and not matching.\nIm also applying to radiology in Spain through MIR, but its not even close as good as going to an American residency.\nSo right now I'm seriously considering taking a prelim and re-apply (maybe to other specialty) or go through Spaniard residency and see if I can get the alternate pathway of the ABR or just using my Spaniard degree to move to UK, AU or NZ. Click to expand... I would say think carefully what your actual goals are. Do you want to practice in US no matter what? Or do you want to do radiology no matter what?\nDepending on this, it will shape your pathway as to what to do and save you the most amount of time and money.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle":

After he asked her why he heard a woman\u2019s voice on the phone refer to Rosa as \u201cbabe,\u201d she tried to throw him off the scent before finally sharing that she is dating a woman and that she is indeed bisexual. She also quickly brushed him off when he tried to be enthusiastic and supportive, only to later apologize, explaining she didn\u2019t think it was anybody\u2019s business and that she didn\u2019t want anything to change. And while it felt therapeutic for the woman who has only let slip little shards of insight into her life \u2014 she owns an ax, she studied ballet before being kicked out of school for \u201cbeating the crap out of ballerinas,\u201d her idea of a perfect date is \u201ccheap dinner, watch basketball, bone down\u201d \u2014 to share this part of herself, she wanted them to return to not talking about this ever again. (Request denied by Charles.) \nThe 100th episode, which airs next Tuesday, will explore Rosa\u2019s story in greater depth, emotion, and humor as she sets out to share the news with those closest to her. Right now, though, Beatriz takes us inside the show\u2019s decision to have Rosa declare her sexuality, how Jake (Andy Samberg) will get entangled in her plans, and, sure, what Pimento (Jason Mantzoukas) might think of this revelation. \nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Where should we rank this one on the Rosa revelation scale?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stephanie beatriz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emily goldfinch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe lo truglio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beatriz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn nine-nine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosa diaz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason mantzoukas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy samberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "brooklyn nine-nine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:03.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "994e377e013cf83fd85aa99aa454baafefa9e158", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9G45dRyGddsnZ5HRCu8b1ag.l7y2d_He5R_2Huts7OaVf9QOP0qnoyWTdhGYnPDlNBiSHOi0hWYdvlPkIdrL_gSrg8jiFDSUWSMWs9V7CGIzdTucQzpQYK0H8ViuY4gI0OHKfGse.urOobmZjowYAe", "site_full": "www.journaltribune.com", "site": "journaltribune.com", "site_section": "http://www.journaltribune.com/atom.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "@ The Journal Tribune", "title": "Maine public advocate supports '207' area code", "title_full": "Maine public advocate supports '207' area code", "published": "2017-12-06T11:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.journaltribune.com/sites/all/modules/custom/ohtnav/images/article.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "994e377e013cf83fd85aa99aa454baafefa9e158", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9G45dRyGddsnZ5HRCu8b1ag.l7y2d_He5R_2Huts7OaVf9QOP0qnoyWTdhGYnPDlNBiSHOi0hWYdvlPkIdrL_gSrg8jiFDSUWSMWs9V7CGIzdTucQzpQYK0H8ViuY4gI0OHKfGse.urOobmZjowYAe", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T11:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "Maine public advocate supports '207' area code", "text": "Maine public advocate supports '207' area code ASSOCIATED PRESS PORTLAND (AP) \u2014 Maine\u2019s public advocate says he\u2019s going to work to preserve Maine\u2019s 207 area code on a panel that makes recommendations on telephone numbers and area codes.

EpicAn epic is like a super-story. When a story is too big to fit comfortably in a sprint and/or contains a lot of unknowns then it is usually better suited to be an epic. Epics are fine on the product backlog, but as they approach the top of the backlog they are typically decomposed down in to several stories. We don't bring epics in to sprints.StoryA story is a functional requirement that provides some business value. It also has to be small enough to comfortably fit within a sprint.Stories are written in a language that is easily understood by the Product Owner and business users.

This follows earlier action in October when the board voted to expel Harvey Weinstein from the academy after multiple allegations of sexual misconduct were made against the film mogul.\n\u201cThere is no place in the Academy for people who abuse their status, power or influence in a manner that violates recognized standards of decency,\u201d the two-paragraph statement reads in part. \u201cThe Academy is categorically opposed to any form of abuse, harassment or discrimination on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, disability, age, religion, or nationality.\u201d\nAccording to the academy, it will be up to the board of governors \u2014 which includes such industry luminaries as Steven Spielberg , Kathleen Kennedy, Tom Hanks and Whoopi Goldberg \u2014 to enforce these standards.\nAl Seib / Los Angeles Times Academy CEO Dawn Hudson, right, with actresses Laura Dern and Nicole Kidman at the Academy Awards nominees luncheon for the 89th Oscars at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. Academy CEO Dawn Hudson, right, with actresses Laura Dern and Nicole Kidman at the Academy Awards nominees luncheon for the 89th Oscars at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) Much remains to be done. \u2014 Dawn Hudson, Academy CEO \u201cIf any member is found by the Board of Governors to have violated these standards or to have compromised the integrity of the Academy by their actions, the Board of Governors may take any disciplinary action permitted by the Academy\u2019s bylaws, including suspension or expulsion,\u201d the statement reads.\nIn the run-up to Weinstein\u2019s expulsion, some within the organization wrestled with the implications of setting a precedent that would require the academy to police its members\u2019 behavior going forward. Other Hollywood figures at the centers of sexual misconduct controversies \u2014 including Bill Cosby, Roman Polanski and Brett Ratner \u2014 remain members of the academy.\nIn introducing the new standards of conduct, academy Chief Executive Dawn Hudson noted that they represent a first step in a broader effort to ensure that the academy\u2019s members live up to the group\u2019s values.\n\u201cMuch remains to be done,\u201d Hudson wrote. \u201cThe task force will finalize procedures for handling allegations of misconduct, assuring that we can address them fairly and expeditiously. This process will ultimately guide the Board of Governors in assessing if certain allegations warrant action regarding membership. Those procedures will be sent to you in the new year.\n\u201cWe are articulating these standards with the simple goal of fostering the kind of environment that enables and supports creativity, and furthers the Academy\u2019s mission.\u201d\nCAPTION Justin Chang and Glenn Whipp talk about the top contenders of the awards season, including \"Call Me by Your Name\" and \"The Florida Project.\"\nJustin Chang and Glenn Whipp talk about the top contenders of the awards season, including \"Call Me by Your Name\" and \"The Florida Project.\"\nCAPTION Justin Chang and Glenn Whipp talk about the top contenders of the awards season, including \"Call Me by Your Name\" and \"The Florida Project.\"\nJustin Chang and Glenn Whipp talk about the top contenders of the awards season, including \"Call Me by Your Name\" and \"The Florida Project.\"\nCAPTION Justin Chang and Glenn Whipp on what critics awards mean for the Oscars, factoring in the academy's expanding membership.\nJustin Chang and Glenn Whipp on what critics awards mean for the Oscars, factoring in the academy's expanding membership.\nCAPTION Two men return home from World War II to work on a farm, where they struggle to deal with racism and adjusting to life after war in \"Mudbound.\" Video by Jason H.

Scott Barbour / Getty Images Members of Parliament celebrate at Parliament House on Thursday in Canberra, Australia, after the approval of same-sex marriage. Michael Masters / Getty Images \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of registered voters and ensured that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\" Copyright 2017 NPR.

Doctors told him that more would continue to break off if he didn\u2019t get it fixed. \n\u201cIt definitely took me by surprise,\u201d Green said. \u201cI don\u2019t really know the word for it. I was just shocked. I was very upset. I didn\u2019t think I was going to have my high school season, to be honest. But we found a doctor who said I could swim and have my high school season.\u201d \nGreen finished his freshman swim season before having his surgery in March. Doctors had to drill on the sides of his knee and insert screws to establish blood flow for his bone to grow. \nThe doctors took bone from his hip and partially filled the hole with bone plugs in hopes of having the rest of his bone grow back. Green received good news when a doctor told him at his most recent checkup that the bone was growing back. \nGreen\u2019s next check up is on Thursday, where doctors will check the progress and see if any screws in his knee have migrated. \nGreen, who has been swimming competitively since he was 6 years old, wasn\u2019t sure if the surgery would work, which put his entire swimming career in jeopardy. Fortunately for Green, he spent eight weeks on crutches, but was allowed back in the water just two weeks after the surgery. \nGreen eventually transitioned to a custom-fit unloader knee brace to help shift the weight from the healing portion of his leg. He participated in physical therapy once a week at the Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital for about four months. \nAlthough he could get back in the water, Green wasn\u2019t allowed to kick for six months. He put a pull buoy between his legs to prevent himself from kicking, which put a lot of strain on his upper body muscles. \nGreen had to push off with one leg for his flip-turns and did only upper body lifts in the weight room. He couldn\u2019t even carry weights around because he couldn\u2019t have any more than the weight of his back pack weighing down on him. Green spent almost an entire year not kicking his legs in the water. \n\u201cIt\u2019s just a long process, and it\u2019s still not over,\u201d Green said. \u201cThey said it\u2019s going to take up to two years to completely heal all the way because I guess bone grows back really slowly.\u201d \nGreen still is dealing with a lot of pain, but said he is happy he still gets to compete this year. He swims the 200- and 500-yard freestyle events for the Bull Frogs and is also hoping to get on relay teams this year. \nGreen is not yet able to do any impact activity like running, but his doctor informed him that moving his leg around in the pool can actually be good for his recovery. \nGreen is back to regular swimming workouts and competitions for his sophomore season. He isn\u2019t all the way back to where he was, but is slowly working on getting there. North coach Logan Schaefer said they both have been working on focusing on the things Green is able to do and do the best they can. \n\u201cI think once we start to move and progress overall to getting back to full swimming, I think those things that we could do are going to be some strengths as we build back into more of the kicking and those types of things that we couldn\u2019t do a whole lot of recently,\u201d Schaefer said. \nGreen already is getting close to the times he swam last season, which is a good sign of how his recovery is going. He has aspirations of gaining a college scholarship for swimming and said he is glad osteochondritis dissecans hasn\u2019t taken those opportunities away from him. The goal is to be back at 100 percent by next season.
