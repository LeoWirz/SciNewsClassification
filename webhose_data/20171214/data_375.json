Where we have ended up with issues is that I wanted to have clarity from the informatics perspective about whether people felt that a system through a national lens could make a difference or not and whether it could add any value, and that's where we had an agreement in principle. \nWhat was clear to me, however, from the case that was being put forward\u2014and this is in respect of the limited budget and funds that are available for us to choose all of these variety of systems\u2014it was never going to be able to pull its way up the list beyond us implementing the national radiology system or implementing GP systems. So, my concern is that although I had the agreement in principle secured\u2014it took me a couple of goes around the business case\u2014I've obviously said in here that I don't think that the case was strong enough, good enough, to get above all of those other national systems at this stage. \nHowever, the second point that was a worry is a real risk to the business case because there has been genuine progress over the last six years on the catering area and some of the original issues that were outlined back in 2011. For example, in areas like wastage, we've materially improved those wastage figures, so, the opportunity to make a revenue saving for the future has minimised. \nIf I give you a direct example: Velindre NHS Trust, which I know is one of our smaller organisations, but if they were looking to sign up to a national system, they've only got \u00a35,000 worth of wastage, anyway, because of the nature of their service. Their system would be much more expensive than any potential savings, even if they were perfect. So, I try to be realistic, recognising there had been a shift over the years. \nThe third worry I had was as I explored whether we could use one of the existing systems and, in particular, that of Cwm Taf, as an organisation that had clearly addressed some of these areas: could we just lift it up and use it for the whole of Wales? Unfortunately, the advice was that by going to a national system, we would have to comply with all the usual procurement criteria to go out, recognising the material spend that would happen on this. This is a system that's going to cost somewhere between \u00a32 million and \u00a33 million pounds. And what I didn't want to do was destabilise the organisations that actually had made progress in terms of it and insist that they were going to have to comply with a national system. \nTherefore, through shared services that have a responsibility for some of our operational services oversight in Wales, there will be a national framework contract in place, there will be a national specification, and organisations can therefore draw down from that and comply. They can prove their own local case to make sure the system can be used, and we can wrap all of that up in one procurement process on their behalf.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) JOHANNESBURG - The recent roller-coaster of Bitcoin has seen the digital currency breach the $13000 (R175390) mark for the first time yesterday - with its market capitalisation now exceeding that of Boeing and that of New Zealand\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). \nWith yesterday\u2019s spike, the cryptocurrency now has a total market value of about $217billion, following a more than 1000percent surge since the beginning of this year. \nAccording to a World Bank report, New Zealand was worth $185bn in 2016. The GDP value of New Zealand represents 0.3percentof the world economy. \nNeil Wilson, a senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said there would be a regulatory crunch for Bitcoin at some point and the development of regulated derivatives only accelerated by bringing it into the mainstream. \n\u201dMore broadly, the US government, in particular, exerts huge control over not just global financial markets but wields power in wider diplomatic, economic and military terms by controlling the supply of US dollars and the financial networks. It is not about to relinquish this to a handful of unidentified crypto enthusiasts unless it\u2019s got a sizeable stake in Bitcoin itself,\u201d Wilson said. You can use bitcoin in South Africa. Photo: File \nA new study from Juniper Research has found the value of cryptocurrency transactions were expected to surpass $1trillion in 2017, more than 15 times the level in 2016. \nBitcoin began the year at less than $1000 per token, but it has been on an absolute tear in recent months. It crossed $5000 in October and touched above $11000 for the first time less than two months later. \nBitcoin\u2019s ascent, however, has not been without speed humps. Countries such as Morocco, Bolivia, Kyrgyzstan, Ecuador, Bangladesh and Nepal have banned bitcoin. \nChina earlier this year announced the closure of domestic cryptocurrency exchanges. While the powerhouse hasn\u2019t outlawed bitcoin, it has made trading or owning bitcoin a real challenge for its citizens - and bitcoin is banned for banking institutions. \nFrancois Groepe, the deputy governor of the South African Reserve Bank, recently said it would be too risky for the central bank to start issuing virtual currencies or cryptocurrencies at the moment. Co-Pierre Georg, a senior lecturer at the African Institute for Financial Markets and Risk Management at UCT, said there was a huge risk that bitcoin was already overvalued. \n\u201cDespite the claim that bitcoin is a 'global currency', the reality is that 58percent of all bitcoin mining happens in China,\" Georg said. \n- BUSINESS REPORT", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kabelo khuma", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "co-pierre georg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "francois groepe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georg", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cme group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reserve bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boeing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juniper research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "african institute for financial markets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uct", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "etx capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecuador", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bolivia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bangladesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morocco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyrgyzstan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nepal", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:00.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9f5cbf5e86e06f555242ef2dcf8f6b554d7e39bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pOIu0PjaMHWQtMpZxuzlxK3rPDVgvYHZW", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/his/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/his/ - History &amp; Humanities - 4chan", "title": "By modern day standards, is he left wing or right", "title_full": "/his/ - By modern day standards, is he left wing or right - History & Humanities - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-06T19:44:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 62, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e03f285c6795cc75183a24d4be5bd31920f07a8f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pOIu0PjaMHWQtMpZxuzlxK9qs933q_DPA33ytwSsIYvk-", "ord_in_thread": 42, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T06:31:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Judging by the responses here he was some sort of mixture of imperial nationalist and conscientious socialist\nWonder what that would make him\nSocial nationalist?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:00.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9f5cbf5e86e06f555242ef2dcf8f6b554d7e39bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pOIu0PjaMHWQtMpZxuzlxK3rPDVgvYHZW", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/his/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/his/ - History &amp; Humanities - 4chan", "title": "By modern day standards, is he left wing or right", "title_full": "/his/ - By modern day standards, is he left wing or right - History & Humanities - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-06T19:44:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 62, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1eaa5e16010c915744c80718daaf5fd22698fd6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pOIu0PjaMHWQtMpZxuzlxK2yZ6S56CO2sc2uUItre9NE-", "ord_in_thread": 46, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T09:23:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>3794507\nHe was authoritarian and militaristic.

I'm not a big draft horse fan, but I still enjoyed both shows. This was the first time I'd ever seen an American Cream... love those eyes!...  \nor a Suffolk Punch. \nThis mare was as broad as she was tall. \nShe was ridden bareback with a driving bridle. I'm sure this was because there are no saddles that fit her unique physique! The Clydesdale was also exhibited bareback. I don't usually think draft horses are cute, but this one was. Look at that face. So cheeky! \nThe Belgian was exhibited in hand. He was a really tall boy and new to the Parade of Breeds. He did great.  \nI'm always on the lookout for new performance ideas and tack reference pictures, so I sat up and took notice when this Percheron trotted into the ring.   He wore the kind of  medieval costume that is not authentic but popular at exhibitions and festivals. \nI have a galloping draft that I like to show in performance .  \nI've always wanted to make him a costume like this, but his big mane is a significant obstacle. The Shire also wore a fun costume... \n but again, it included a full neck piece. \nThere's no way to fit that over a big, flowing mane. But then...
