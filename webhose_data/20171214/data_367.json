Hollett backstops Tigers to shootout win in P.A. By   7, 2017 Medicine Hat Tigers goalie Jordan Hollett (31) readies himself for a shot from   forward Curtis Miske (18) during the second period of their Dec. 6, 2017 WHL game from Prince Albert. Evan Radford/Daily Herald \nNo matter the frequency or amount of their offensive firepower,   couldn\u2019t quite solve Jordan Hollett. \nThe Medicine Hat Tigers goalie backstopped his side to a 49-save, 5-4 shootout win in P.A. Wednesday night in   action from the city\u2019s Art Hauser Centre. \nThrough three periods and overtime, the Raiders fired 53 shots on the 18-year-old goalie, who had a career night with the win: That shot count is the highest he\u2019s faced through his four-year WHL career. \n\u201cThey\u2019re a very hard-working team,\u201d Hollett said of the Raiders. \u201cWe know that they\u2019re going to come out hard \u2013 they have a hard forechck; so you need to make sure that you\u2019re making the right plays, or they\u2019re going to burn you.\u201d \nMuch like their game the night prior in Swift Current, the Raiders upped their tempo, forechecking pressure and offensive chances as the game wore on, culminating in a 22-shot third period against Medicine Hat. \n\u201cTonight they threw a lot of pucks at the net. They were very good at getting traffic to the net. They also have a couple guys who can rip the puck pretty good.\u201d   Brayden Pachal (8) fights with Medicine Hat Tigers forward Ryan Jevne (14) during the second period of their Dec. 6, 2017 WHL game from Prince Albert. Evan Radford/Daily Herald \nTwo of those players were centreman Jordy Stallard and defenceman Vojtech Budik, each of whom found second-period success against Hollett to keep the Raiders in the game. \nStallard\u2019s wrist shot at 9:23 was one of his two goals in the game that beat Hollett, while Budik\u2019s 19:37 wrist shot from the point whizzed through traffic and bounced off the goalpost into the Tigers\u2019 net. \nAt that point it was 3-2 for the Raiders, who had twice erased one-goal deficits in the period, taking the lead for the first time in the game on Budik\u2019s score. \n\u201cFor the most part of the second and the third period, I thought we dominated the game,\u201d Stallard said. \nThe Tigers again forced the home team into   after third period goals from David Quenneville and Mark Rassell, with Rassell\u2019s 8:28 score putting his team up 4-3. \nSoon after, the Raiders got some help from their depth players: Fourth line centreman Eric Pearce tipped in an Austin Crossley point shot at 13:02 to tie the game 4-4. Brett Leason was also credited with the assist. \n\u201cWe got a great group of guys. We know that if we have a poor period or a poor ten minutes, we always bounce back, and I think that\u2019s a good identity to have,\u201d Stallard said of his team\u2019s resiliency. \nThe two teams finished regulation play drawn even at 4-4. \nThe overtime portion was no less tense, with the shot count 5-4 in the Tigers\u2019 favour. Each team created odd-man rushes only to be foiled by the opposition\u2019s netminder. \nThe Raiders\u2019 Ian Scott turned aside 33 of 37 Tigers shots in the losing effort (shootout notwithstanding).   goalie Ian Scott (33) turns aside a shot from Medicine Hat Tigers forward Hayden Ostir (7) during the second period of their Dec. 6, 2017 WHL game from Prince Albert. Evan Radford/Daily Herald \nHollett turned aside Stallard and Raiders captain Curtis Miske in the shootout, while Rassell and Max Gerlach each scored in the shootout to win it 2-0, and thus the game 5-4, for the Tigers. \nTalking about his team\u2019s comfort-level in tight, high-pressure scenarios like Wednesday\u2019s contest, Stallard said, \u201cWe rise to the occasion. I think we\u2019ve gotta focus more on playing consistent on a night-in, night-out kind of thing. But definitely against the top teams in the league, we do bring our A-game.\u201d \nFor his part, Hollett said breaking the game down play-by-play is the best way to stay focused, especially in tense, fast-paced contests. \n\u201cJust everything that happens previously in the game, you just forget about, and you honestly just work on \u2018what do I need to do to make the next save?'\u201d he said. That mean\u2019s \u201cyou just stay present and focus on what\u2019s going on in the moment.\u201d \nNOTES: The Raiders (11-11-5-2) remain in fifth place in the WHL\u2019s East division, three points back of the fourth-place Regina Pats \u2026 Among all 22 WHL teams, the Raiders have gained the most points from overtime or shootout losses (7) \u2026 The Raiders next play at home on Friday night against the Kamloops Blazers (13-15-0-0) at 7 p.m. \u2026 The game will be the team\u2019s annual teddy bear toss game.

People on Medicaid are prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But a new survey says that\u2019... \nBy RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVARAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - People on Medicaid are more prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But that's not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge. \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" \nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n- Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n- Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n- Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C. \nFor the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point. For Medicaid recipients, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points.

Mark Cooper weighed in with a hat-trick and there was also a single goal for Michael Sides. \nAFC Bentley\u2019s U18s, for whom Ronan Fluin netted, also bowed out of the competition after going down 3-1 at home to high-flying Division Two side Upton Wrangbrook, whose goals were scored by Lucas Stubbs (2) and Todd Williamson. \nJosh Bowkett and Joe Taylor both notched hat tricks as Division One leaders Durban Rhinos charged past Championship side Armthorpe Village (8-1) in impressive style. Josh Dodd and Jordan Ringrose completed the scoring. \nThird-placed Division One side Bentley West End S&S never looked like upsetting the odds when going down 6-0 away to a Rum Rooms side holding down second spot in the Premier Division. \nFour-goal Phil Walmsley proved too hot to handle and he received good support from Tom Speight and Darren Bird. \nPremier Division leaders The Railway were made to work harder than expected to beat bottom club Tut \u2018n\u2019 Shive by the odd goal in seven. \nLewis Hall bagged a brace for the winners with Shaun Mundy and Gabriel Radulescu also chipping in. Shaun McConville, Martyn Wood and Sean Kenny shared the consolation goals for the battling visitors. \nBottom-of-the-table Championship side Finningley Athletic beat Division Two hosts Eden Arms 4-2 after extra-time. \nUnbeaten Championship side Balby Athletic beat mid-table Division One side Woodfield 6-0 with Ryan Soar, Kieran Ferguson, Tim Miles, Kyle Burton and Mateusz Pawlowki all hitting the target. \nPremier Division Dunscroft United\u2019s 13-1 win over Division Two strugglers FC Wheatley Hills proved the most one-sided tie of the round. \nStainforth New Inn climbed out of the bottom three when beating Athletico Rec 4-1 in the only Premier Division game of the day. \nRikki Crompton hit a double for the winners with Andrew Bembridge and Ry Davies also getting in on the act. Carl Robinson replied for Athletico. \nAFC Schoolboy climbed into second spot in the Championship on the back of a surprisingly emphatic 9-2 win over top four rivals Rossington Styrrup. \nWheatley Club capitalised on the result to edge their way into the top four after sharing four goals with Bessacarr. \nTeam 23 remain four points clear at the top despite their game at Rosehill Press being called off due to the lack of a referee. \nStag Inn Rovers (Zak Boiston 2, Phil Potts) climbed off bottom spot in Division One after exchanging places with White Hart (Askern) following their 3-1 win. \nThere was also a rare victory for Real Bridge A who beat mid-table AFC Balby 5-2 to claim only their second league win of the campaign. \nThe Salutation (Jack Waldron 2, Tom Connor) missed out on the chance to climb into the top four when being held to a 3-3 draw by visiting Dunscroft Social. \nThe top versus bottom Division Two clash resulted in a crushing 13-2 win for unbeaten leaders FC Ivanhoe over Carcroft Village Social Club. \nCraig Dallas claimed four of the goals with Joe Murray and Paul Bradley both hitting a treble. Scott Sykes, David Taylor and Ash Ward completed the rout. \nRomarnsley retained second spot but now find themselves four points adrift of the leaders after going down 5-3 at Windmill Wanderers. \nCommon Road WMC rose to third with a 4-0 win at Pit Club Miners.

Three layers of buttery vanilla sugar cookies are decorated with green-colored buttercream and sprinkles to resemble Christmas trees! Great to make with the kids! \nChristmastime is my favorite time. I think it\u2019s because I am always known for getting epic presents for my family and friends. Not to brag or anything, but I consider myself an awesome gift-giver, and during the holidays, I go all out. I am known for getting obscure presents you didn\u2019t know you needed or wanted, like custom pet portraits of my mom\u2019s beloved furry friend, or a wacky-facts book for my trivia-loving dad. Plus, \u2018tis the season for giving to my favorite animal rescue charities and the local children\u2019s hospital. So yeah, you could say I love the holiday season! \nBut I also love it because of the cooler weather, Christmas music (yeah, I enjoy it year-round!), sparkly decorations, glimmering Christmas lights, and of course, the FOOD! Every year, I make Christmas dinner and while I do know how to make savory food, I\u2019m obviously known for my desserts. I always try to include a multitude of options so everyone can sample their favorites: pumpkin pie, pecan pie, something minty, and always Christmas cookies. \nMy mom LOVES frosted sugar cookies, but I never make them. Why? Because I\u2019m admittedly not the *best* decorator. Royal icing and I are frenemies, so I generally tend to avoid using it. But when I was brainstorming decorated cookie ideas for Christmas, I instantly got the idea to make these Sugar Cookie Christmas Trees! 3-D sugar cookie stacks made with Krusteaz Butter Vanilla Sugar Cookie Mix for a buttery, homemade flavor without all the hassle of chilling dough, rolling and cutting into shapes, or dealing with dreaded royal icing \ud83d\ude42 \nSimple bake your cookies in a few different sizes and stack them with green buttercream frosting in between layers with some sprinkles to look like lights. Then pipe your frosting into a pointed top and serve! These would be great to make with kids and get them involved, and imagine how darling it\u2019d look if you placed these on everyone\u2019s plate before Christmas dinner? \nClick here for the recipe for these Sugar Cookie Christmas Trees on the Krusteaz website! \nAlso, be sure to check out Krusteaz\u2019s ADORABLE interactive Cookie Swap !

It\u2019s full of all the usual grisly murders and criminal intentions, but in this case rather cleverly placed in the context of a country at war.\nYes it adheres to the manners of the period (not a lot of skin or sex) and the \u2018hero\u2019 is a mature man, not some sexy young buck, but if you let that put you off then you\u2019re missing out on great acting and fine writing!\nMy particular love for it comes from the way they weave the war into the crimes. Refugees, internment camps, ration fraud, black marketeers and even the occasional spy all make appearances over the various seasons of the series. All in well crafted and well told mysteries.\nOf course it\u2019s not going to be everyone\u2019s cup of tea \u2013 what crime drama is? \u2013 but please don\u2019t wait til you have bladder problems or a need for denture cream before you check it out.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "foyle", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:10.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "37bfa16371b717fbe59a2a58bc32511f3989980b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.dqnZ4uL173Qrg6PLZFtBUwmDb83T8c12yWkzSPq70zmYeSNo7dwUckOhg6dBW1IFv8EWxWr07Fw6cLnQEY2gfuwHVxzaWbEAuMYZA2wN47KO.JOxCCqBZuhPKeVEOw1K3TBSBr5arlKrvk1wmEcBPE4j2yiErkag-", "site_full": "www.palo.rs", "site": "palo.rs", "site_section": "http://www.palo.rs/category/rss/?cid=4", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Palo.rs - Novost o kategoriji Svet", "title": "Tramp pokrenuo lavinuo: Posle SAD, i ova EU zemlja je PRIZNALA JERUSALIM kao prestonicu Izraela - [www.blic.rs]", "title_full": "Tramp pokrenuo lavinuo: Posle SAD, i ova EU zemlja je PRIZNALA JERUSALIM kao prestonicu Izraela - [www.blic.rs]", "published": "2017-12-07T13:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "RS", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.palo.rs/Themes/1/Default/media/logo-large.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "37bfa16371b717fbe59a2a58bc32511f3989980b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.dqnZ4uL173Qrg6PLZFtBUwmDb83T8c12yWkzSPq70zmYeSNo7dwUckOhg6dBW1IFv8EWxWr07Fw6cLnQEY2gfuwHVxzaWbEAuMYZA2wN47KO.JOxCCqBZuhPKeVEOw1K3TBSBr5arlKrvk1wmEcBPE4j2yiErkag-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T13:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "Tramp pokrenuo lavinuo: Posle SAD, i ova EU zemlja je PRIZNALA JERUSALIM kao prestonicu Izraela - [www.blic.rs]", "text": "\u0160VE\u0110ANI OSULI PALJBU PO HRVATIMA Vre\u0111aju nas na sva usta, ali redovno UZIMAJU NOVAC od nas pre 28 minuta", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:10.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0bc34094b119c664b502c0b31f8827f567b0258b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRu_5f5nYIAteU0cEdmWVMBUQWAZrS_9h4LFMPGgt5ctg.GnHFRhDpVS0IrM5xEq0LcGVrmyrMz9gkgW54ejLcbLfN31dijUXmiWbL5F2b5Aw--", "site_full": "forums.evga.com", "site": "evga.com", "site_section": "https://forums.evga.com:443/EVGA-GeForce-10-Series-f103.aspx", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "EVGA GeForce 10 Series - EVGA Forums ", "title": "Weird driver crash issue with 1080ti FTW3", "title_full": "Weird driver crash issue with 1080ti FTW3 - EVGA Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T23:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 16819, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0bc34094b119c664b502c0b31f8827f567b0258b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRu_5f5nYIAteU0cEdmWVMBUQWAZrS_9h4LFMPGgt5ctg.GnHFRhDpVS0IrM5xEq0LcGVrmyrMz9gkgW54ejLcbLfN31dijUXmiWbL5F2b5Aw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T23:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "Weird driver crash issue with 1080ti FTW3", "text": " SethH Superclocked 188 2013/03/12 18:12:47 Status: offline Ribbons : 2 2017/12/06 15:55:42 ( permalink ) Hey all,\nThis doesn't seem to be a major issue, just kinda confusing. Let's start with the basics:\n1.) I can play AC Origins for hours (have it open/running for 6-10) with no issues (1440p, ultra settings, etc.).\n2.) I can play Overwatch for hours \" \" (1440p - render scale of 122% though (it defaulted that way), ultra, etc. in-game FPS cap @ 162fps (165hz monitor)).\n3.) NVidia driver 388.43 & 388.31 (used DDU for original install of 388.43 last week, and uninstalled regularly to install 388.31)\n4.) Card is at 127% power target, max temp target (92C), voltage +40%, Core + 70 (2025-2060 in-game), Mem +200 (lowered from 250 with no change), custom fan curves (100% at around 62C)\nNVidia control panel: G-sync ON, V-sync ON, Power set to Maximum Performance.\nThis is the issue: I play Overwatch for a bit of time (30-60 minutes, GPU/Power/Mem temps are anywhere between 60-67C) then exit the game after a match or three. Within 2-3 minutes of exiting, I'll open AC Origins while GPU is still warm/hot (mid 40's) from previous game (regular temps are between 58-62C, Power/Mem a little bit higher) (this is the only game I've tested it with so far). Game opens and I select my save game. It gets to the loading screen where you can run around, read tips, etc. while the game loads. However, once the game is \"loaded\" and it tries to transfer you from the loading screen TO the actual in-game (starts the animation of loading objects - if you play it you'll know what I mean), the game crashes and the NVidia driver \"has stopped working\" message displays. I then restart the PC at that point.\nGoing from AC Origins to Overwatch doesn't cause this to happen.\nI have been able to recreate this multiple times .\nCould this be due to different types of loads placed on the GPU within such a small timeframe? (One a cartoony type game w/ high FPS (120-160 always), and one with lots of objects/textures (60-100fps depending on location, 140-165 in menus)) or is there a recommended \"cooldown\" period before launching another intensive process? I'd think it should be able to handle it.\nI've verified game files, tried a previous driver, updated PXOC to the most current version, Windows is up-to-date. I'm currently running an Extended Test on my WD Black drive the game is installed on (quick test passed).\n***I'm also going to try debug mode to see if that makes a difference.\nI'm hoping it's just something with the game itself. I'll be able to verify with more games.\nHas anyone ever heard of this happening before?\nSeptember 2016 Build Specs:\nOS: Win7 Pro 64-bit\nCPU: i7-6950X @ 4.4Ghz - 1.32V\nMobo: EVGA X99 FTW K\nRAM: G.Skill TridentZ 3200Mhz C14 Memory (F4-3200C14Q-32GTZ)\nGraphics: EVGA GTX 1080TI FTW3\nCPU Cooler: EKWB Custom Loop (updating soon)\nPSU: EVGA SuperNOVA 1200P2\nCase: EVGA DG-87\nFans: 3x Corsair ML120 Pro Blue, 5x Corsair ML140 Pro Blue\nSSD/HDD: Samsung 850 Evo 500GB, Sandisk 240GB, 1TB 7200RPM 3.5\" HDD (generic Seagate), WD Black 5TB\nMonitor: ASUS PG279Q - 1440p, 165Hz, G-sync\nKeyboard: G.Skill RIPJAWS KM780 RGB (Cherry MX blues)\nMouse: EVGA TORQ X10 Carbon\n#1 List Solutions Only 9 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.modsrigs.com/detail.aspx?buildid=35940"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:10.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "111b5050927e15b772c47a35870951c8b0e626d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQc3b0Lli5K5PKfcpxSlGYrP43Z6kSJ7kKFqd9BpmBnaxedvLGQLR5wPPKZEFUnfenEjw1EUzL69Rrk9qtLYzaqfDS45LY2dB8-", "site_full": "pigtailsandbraidsinmovies.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://pigtailsandbraidsinmovies.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "I Can Jump Puddles \u2013 Pigtails and braids in movies", "title": "I Can Jump Puddles", "title_full": "I Can Jump Puddles", "published": "2017-12-07T11:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "111b5050927e15b772c47a35870951c8b0e626d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQc3b0Lli5K5PKfcpxSlGYrP43Z6kSJ7kKFqd9BpmBnaxedvLGQLR5wPPKZEFUnfenEjw1EUzL69Rrk9qtLYzaqfDS45LY2dB8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Admin", "published": "2017-12-07T11:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "I Can Jump Puddles", "text": "\nDrama series. 9 ep \n\u2013 Year : 1981\n\u2013 Year in film : 1900s\n\u2013 Country : Australia\n\u2013 Who in pigtails : girl ~ 11 ?\n\u2013 Who in pigtails 2 : others?\n\u2013 Available on DVD : yes\n\u2013 I own : no\n\u2013 Pigtail occurence : low+ ?\n\u2013 Rating : 4/10\n\u2013 Rating: **** \n\u2013 Comment : At least one girl, probably some more at school in long pigtails.

U.S. health of... \nBy LAURAN NEERGAARDAP Medical Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades.

(AFP) With his announcement on Wednesday, Trump shattered decades of unwavering US neutrality on Jerusalem. Palestinians shuttered schools and shops and called for protests in West Bank towns on Thursday, in show of anger over President Donald Trump's recognition of bitterly contested occupied Jerusalem as Israel's capital . Trump's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of US policy on occupied Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. The Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. Saudi Arabia's Royal Court, led by Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia and his powerful son, condemned the Trump administration's decision in a rare public rebuke by the US ally. Saudi Arabia, a regional powerhouse that could help the White House push through a Middle East settlement, said on Thursday the Kingdom had already warned against this step and \"continues to express its deep regret at the US administration's decision,\" describing it \" unjustified and irresponsible .\" The Kingdom, particularly its powerful Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who leads Trump's efforts to restart Mideast peace talks. US Embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa warned American citizens of possible protests following Trump's move. In recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Trump was seen as siding with Israel's hard-line government which says it will not give up any part of the city. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has suggested that the United States disqualified itself as mediator between Israelis and Palestinians, a role it has played exclusively in more than two decades of stop-and-go negotiations on setting up a Palestinian state alongside Israel. The talks, stalled in recent years, have failed to bring the Palestinians closer to the state the seek in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. In parallel, Israel has steadily expanded Jewish settlements on war-won lands, even as it said it wants to negotiate a deal.Trump's claim on Wednesday that he still wants to pursue what he has called the \"ultimate\" Mideast deal was met by mounting skepticism. \"With its decision, the US has isolated itself and Israel, and has pushed the area into a dangerous situation and stopped the peace process,\" said Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a senior Abbas aid. \"Without a doubt, this decision will not help at all in solving the problems in the area, but rather strengthen the extremists.\" Abbas has not said what steps he would take, if any. Later on Thursday, he is to meet with his closest Arab ally, His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan, to coordinate positions. Jordan plays a central role in the mounting controversy and, alongside other US allies in the region, has slammed Trump's decision on Jerusalem. The King is seen as one of Washington's most dependable partners in the battle against extremism in the region. At the same time, the legitimacy of his Hashemite dynasty is closely linked to its special role in Jerusalem, as religious guardian of a key Muslim shrine in east Jerusalem. Jordan, which has a large population with Palestinian roots, cannot afford to be seen as soft on Muslim claims to the holy city. The consultations between the monarch and Abbas will kick off a series of meetings in the Arab and Muslim world on how to respond to Trump. The Arab League, a group representing most states in the Middle East and North Africa, will meet on Saturday. Next week, Turkey will host a gathering of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, which has 57 Arab and Muslim member states.The region has been bracing for fallout from Trump's seismic policy shift.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday accused Trump of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" and said his motives were difficult to fathom. \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it, Erdogan said, referring to Trump in a speech to a group of workers at Ankara's airport. \"Political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace,\" Erdogan said. \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right,' he is mistaken.\" With his announcement on Wednesday, Trump shattered decades of unwavering US neutrality on Jerusalem.Defying dire, worldwide warnings, Trump insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, starting with what he said was his decision merely based on reality to recognise occupied Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. He also said the US would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable. \"We cannot solve our problems by making the same failed assumptions and repeating the same failed strategies of the past,\" Trump said, brushing aside the appeals for caution from around the world.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abdullah ii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salman bin abdulaziz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "custodian of the two holy mosques", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahmoud abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammad bin salman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nabil abu rdeneh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared kushner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "organisation of islamic cooperation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arab league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crown prince", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:11.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0bc34094b119c664b502c0b31f8827f567b0258b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRu_5f5nYIAteU0cEdmWVMBUQWAZrS_9h4LFMPGgt5ctg.GnHFRhDpVS0IrM5xEq0LcGVrmyrMz9gkgW54ejLcbLfN31dijUXmiWbL5F2b5Aw--", "site_full": "forums.evga.com", "site": "evga.com", "site_section": "https://forums.evga.com:443/EVGA-GeForce-10-Series-f103.aspx", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "EVGA GeForce 10 Series - EVGA Forums ", "title": "Weird driver crash issue with 1080ti FTW3", "title_full": "Weird driver crash issue with 1080ti FTW3 - EVGA Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T23:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 16819, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8caa49a78c13f57cec62517920aa41e9e65fbc58", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRu_5f5nYIAteU0cEdmWVMBUQWAZrS_9h4LFMPGgt5ctg.GnHFRhDpVS0IrM5xEq0LcGVrmyrMz9gkgW54ejLcbLfN31dijUXmjuR7pNG4Z1YJgvpQQdwD2", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Zaruchen SSC Member Total Posts : 620 2009/07/03 18:42:24 Location: Orange County, California Status: online Ribbons : 0 Re: Weird driver crash issue with 1080ti FTW3 2017/12/06 18:58:04 ( permalink ) SethH\nJust played OW and got my GPU nice and hot with this extra voltage (like 67C), and loaded up AC Origins.

(AP) - Southern California has felt yellow wind, orange wind, and red wind. But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

Instead, the yellow metal ended the day with a whimper, closing near its lows at 1263.70 and appearing to be preparing itself for a severe test of critical long-term support. Gold traders will face a nervous end to the week as gold fails to rally even as the U.S. yield curve continues to flatten and ahead of crucial payroll data tomorrow evening. \nWith Asian shares solidly in the red and a general risk-off mood permeating the markets, it is significant that gold cannot find any support. The safe-haven bid that would typically appear in times such as these has disappeared from the market\u2019s thoughts. It is yet another black market against the yellow metal. \nGold has now closed two days in a row under its 200-day moving average at 1267.30 and now intra-day resistance. This is followed by 1270.00 and then 1273.30. \nThe downside looks far more ominous, with gold breaking the critical long-term support at 1260.00 in early Europe, trading to a low of 1256.00 as stop losses set in. We have had a small rebound to 1259.00 but have been unable to recapture 1260.00. A daily close below this level could set of structural unwinding of long positioning, and the technical picture shows no meaningful support for gold until the 1200.00 regions. \nWhile it is still too soon to suggest a significant sell-off is on the cards, the charts do imply that gold may well be about to break out of its three-month trading range. Gold Daily \nSilver \nSilver has led gold lower over the last week. The break of its five-month trendline support at 17.0000 also took out it\u2019s 100 and 200-day moving averages. Silver has since plunged over the past week to the 15.8900 lows we have seen today. Resistance is at 16.2360 and 16.5380, but the charts have no meaningful support until 14.9200, still another dollar away. \nTemporary salvation may be at hand though. The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) is now at very oversold levels. This is an excellent short-term indicator when used with precious metals and commodities. It suggests that Silver may have done enough for now and that a bounce could be on the cards in the short-term at least. Silver Daily \nGold/Silver (Mint) Ratio \nThe mint ratio has hit six-month highs overnight, moving to the 79.00 regions. Traders should note that the ratio\u2019s daily RSI is at extreme overbought levels. This implies that either silver is hugely oversold (see above), or that gold is not yet at fair values, ie overbought versus silver. (see gold above) \nWhichever way you chose to cut it, the mint ratio and its RSI are telling us that that gold could go lower and or that silver should remain unchanged or move higher. \nThe mint ratio also has interim resistance just above at 79.35 will strong resistance at 81.80. Support is at 75.75 and then 74.00 which is a massive level, being multiple daily lows over the last six months. \nThe fact that support is so far away as compared to resistances again reinforces the case that the mint ratio could be signalling more downside for gold.

Ulyukayev who is on trial for allegedly taking a $2 million bribe is expected to deliver... \nBy NATALIYA VASILYEVAAssociated Press \nMOSCOW (AP) - Wrapping up one of Russia's most high-profile trials of the year, a former economic development minister charged with bribery on Thursday accused an oil executive of setting him up and apologized for \"turning back on other people's misfortunes.\" \nAlexei Ulyukayev, the highest-ranking Russian official to be arrested since 1993, was detained last year at the headquarters of Russia's largest oil producer, the state-owned Rosneft, after a sting operation by Russia's main intelligence agency. Prosecutors say he accepted a $2 million bribe from Rosneft's influential CEO, Igor Sechin, for giving the company the green light for privatizing another oil firm. \nThe circumstances of the case have ignited speculation that Ulyukayev was caught in a Kremlin power play against Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin. \nIn his final argument on Thursday, Ulyukayev pleaded not guilty and accused Sechin of setting him up. \n\"A horrific and cruel provocation has been perpetrated against me,\" he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies. \nSechin, whose testimony was the cornerstone of the case against the former minister, was summoned to testify in court four times but he did not show up, citing urgent matters of business. \nReferring to a common perception of Sechin as a dark force in Russian politics, Ulyakayev said in court on Thursday that the key witness \"disappeared - what was left was a whiff of sulfur in the air.\" \nUlyukaev went to Sechin's office in November last year to discuss Rosneft's affairs, and was arrested as he was leaving the building with a bag full of cash that Sechin had given him. Ulyukayev told the court that he thought the bag contained a bottle of wine and a basket filled with sausages. \nIn wire tapes played out to the court earlier in the trial, Sechin was heard telling Ulyukayev to take the bag with the sausage. Russian media has reported that Sechin has a tradition of gifting people baskets of sausages from his own butcher's shop. \nUlyukayev could face a lengthy prison term if found guilty. Prosecutors have asked the court to send him to a high-security prison for ten years, arguing that Ulyukayev's actions \"are undermining the authority of the government.\" \nUlyukayev told the court on Thursday that he is not guilty of \"those absurd accusations but guilty of a different thing: I often compromised.

But the book isn't full of praise. Rather, it offers critique after critique of the way colleges have ignored or responded inadequately to the needs of many students and professors. \nThe author is Jay Timothy Dolmage, associate professor of English at the University of Waterloo, in Canada, who takes disability issues seriously. Below the signature line on his emails is this phrase: \"If you have an accommodation need for a planned meeting, please email me directly and I will do my best to make appropriate arrangements. Should you require any materials sent via this email address in an alternate/accessible format, please let me know.\" \nVia email, he responded to questions about his new book. \nQ: What drew you to disability studies? \nA: I grew up in the disability rights movement in Canada -- and my entire family is still involved in this movement. But when I was a kid, it began with a fight for my brother\u2019s right to go to an inclusive school, in our neighborhood, with his friends and my sister and I. We took that fight all the way to the Ontario Supreme Court of Appeal \u2026 and we lost! So we moved to a school [district] where he could be included in a regular classroom, and we supported the subsequent legal challenges that eventually established the right to inclusive education. My mother and my sister, in particular, still work directly to help families protect and achieve this right to education. I see myself as carrying this fight into higher education. \nQ: Much of the early discussion about disability in higher education focused on legal requirements about buildings -- stairs, bathroom facilities, etc. How did those discussions shape the way academe perceives these issues? \nA: In the book I say that this history has, in part, established disability in mainly legal and medical terms. This means that disability isn\u2019t seen as an identity as much as it is seen as a diagnosis, and this diagnosis is seen to have -- not cultural or social values -- but legal requirements attached to it; minimum legal requirements. So disability gets framed as something you can get wrong if you don\u2019t have the right infrastructure, as at best something that is a cost: you have to get that infrastructure up to the minimum. That\u2019s a pretty problematic way to view 10 to 15 percent of students -- as legal risks, as costs. That said, the metaphors that come from physical accessibility -- ramps, elevators, etc. -- we can do some useful things with these metaphors, urging people to see accessibility much more broadly. What are the ways you build ramps and elevators in your own classroom, to invite everyone in? \nQ: More recently, much of the discussion has been about technology, and how various technology tools can be (or many times are not) accessible. How has that changed the narrative? \nA: Well, I don\u2019t think it has changed it much at all. Still, the requirement for access is constructed as a cost. It is a really frustrating, unfair calculus. To make content accessible in a general sense, that\u2019s seen as a duty -- it is seen as just good teaching. But when something like digital content needs to be made accessible for people with disabilities, that\u2019s not seen as an investment, it is seen as a cost, one to be avoided if possible. And so people really do avoid it. At the very best, we get digital \u201cramps\u201d that actually cost people with disabilities, or that make learning much more difficult for them -- these are ramps in the back door of higher education, not in the front door. \nQ: In the United States, there is constant discussion of what is \"reasonable\" in terms of providing assistance. Does that \"reasonable\" test bother you? \nA: Oh, goodness yes. Who is constructed as having the \u201creason\u201d in this situation? It\u2019s not the disabled student. And because it is not coming from the learners themselves, but instead through bureaucracies designed to deliver the very minimum, we don\u2019t get very logical or reasonable accommodations at all. Around 90 percent of accommodations in North America are the same, rubber-stamped thing: more time on tests and exams. That\u2019s good -- lots of people need that and use that accommodation to keep up with their peers and to provide evidence of how much they have learned. But it shows how little imagination there is -- we teach in myriad innovative ways, but we give the same little minimal accommodations over and over again, and force students to ask, over and over again, and prove their disability, over and over again? It is almost absurdist. The lack of innovation, the repetition, the lack of generosity and curiosity, the lack of communication between teachers and learners, I could go on and on. So, yes, it bothers me! \nQ: Do you think academe devalues those people who have a disability of some type? \nA: Unfortunately my answer here is a confident one: definitely. I think it is hardwired into academic culture. Around 90 percent of students with learning disabilities get accommodations for those disabilities in high school. Only around 10 percent of those same students, when they go to college or university, seek accommodations. That is even though those same disabilities could be experienced more deeply in higher ed. So why is that? Well, it is a culture that is all about independence, competition, achievement, measurement, comparison, perfection. Admitting that you need help seems out of the question. \nSo most students who do get accommodations wait until at least their third year to get them; they would rather struggle and try to get through than ask for help. And we see the same trends on the postgraduate level and definitely among faculty -- have a look at the recent collection Negotiating Disability: Disclosure and Higher Education for more on this. The question, for educators, then, needs to be: How am I part of this culture, even unconsciously? What toll is this taking on me? On my students? What makes me afraid to admit this, or to admit my complicity in it? How can I work to change this culture? \nQ: Higher education constantly considers issues of diversity, but many times the focus is on race and gender. Where should disability fit in? \nA: It should fit in intersectionality. Disability is never \u201calone with itself\u201d -- that is, there are always ways that it is inflected, influenced, shaped by gender, race, sexuality and other identity markers. It\u2019s something that is awesome about disability identity: there are cultures of inclusion across all of these vectors of difference. But, historically, those combinations and intersections were used much more negatively. Disability was used as a marker of biological deviance and inferiority, flexibly applied onto a range of bodies to construct them as less than human. \nAs to the history of that, and its politics, isn\u2019t easy to get away from. But disability is a really important form of diversity, just never \u201calone\u201d -- disability is one of the important ways that real diversity takes shape. I hope that the book begins to show this value -- that we need to move on from legal and medical definitions of disability. We need to move on from minimal \u201creasonable\u201d accommodations. We need to take a hard look at a culture that wants to deny disability despite the real cost of doing so. If disability can be seen as part of the fabric of higher education, as something that comes in the front door, not around back, as something that drives change and innovation and builds community, then my feeling is we will all become better teachers.

Some say that historically black colleges and universities have notoriously been slow to respond to sexual misconduct. \nThe lawsuit coincides with a national debate over the federal gender discrimination law Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Critics of the Obama administration have said his Education Department\u2019s interpretation of Title IX was overzealous and resulted in accused students being treated unfairly on campus. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has since pulled the Obama rules on Title IX, dating back to 2011, and is in the process of revising them. \nIn May, five women, current or former students at the Washington university, filed the lawsuit under the pseudonyms Jane Doe 1 through 5, all asserting they had been sexually assaulted and that administrators generally ignored them or lagged in their responses. Their cases dragged on for many months, when Howard\u2019s policy (and previous federal rules) required a 60-day timeline, according to the complaint. \nRight after Thanksgiving, a sixth Jane Doe joined the lawsuit, with details about how her case has not been resolved eight months after she reported her rape, and her suit said that she still sees around campus her alleged attacker, who has multiple reports of sexual assault against him. \n\u201cThe university\u2019s actions have exacerbated and extended, rather than corrected, the resulting interference with the educational opportunities of each woman,\u201d the lawsuit states. \nNo court case has definitively concluded that an institution needs to bar a student from campus once he or she is reported for sexual assault, said S. Daniel Carter, president of Safety Advisors for Educational Campuses, which consults with colleges on matters of sexual misconduct. \nThe Title IX standard colleges must meet is eliminating a hostile environment, Carter said. \n\u201cBut when you get accused of multiple offenses or criminally convicted, it becomes harder and harder to make the argument that anything short of removal is sufficient,\u201d he said. \nBut with the Howard case, the punishment seemingly wasn\u2019t even a question -- administrators allegedly did so little that they weren\u2019t even considering suspension until apparently more than seven months or so after one report had been filed, Carter said. \nSpokeswoman Crystal Brown said in a statement that Howard does not comment on Title IX cases or pending litigation. \n\u201cHoward University takes very seriously all allegations of sexual assault, sexual harassment, domestic violence and gender-based discrimination occurring on the university's campus or involving the university's students. Our commitment is evidenced by our rigorous enforcement of the university's Title IX Policy on Prohibited Sexual Harassment and Gender-Based Discrimination in Education Program and Activities. The university has been, and remains, committed to diligently investigating any such allegations to ensure a safe and healthy community for our faculty, staff and students.\u201d \nAccording to the lawsuit, Jane Doe 2 reported her rape to administrators in October 2015, expressing concerns that her alleged assailant was a resident assistant in her dormitory and thus had access to her room key. He had stalked Doe 2 since the beginning of that semester, the suit states, but Howard\u2019s Title IX coordinator, Candi N. Smiley, told Doe 2 he could not be moved until an investigation had finished. \nDoe 2 provided Smiley that October with text and email messages that allegedly proved that she was being harassed and that the rape occurred, but she did not hear any response until December, when Smiley asked Doe 2 to resend them. \nShe tried to drop out at the end of fall 2015 semester after hearing no response for the rest of that year -- the lawsuit states Doe 2 was on \u201cthe brink of losing her scholarship\u201d and depressed and fearful she would encounter her rapist. Doe 2 had moved out of the dormitory where he was a resident assistant, but found later she had been charged for doing so when administrators had assured her she would not be. The university also removed her Pell Grant and need-based scholarship from her transcript, charged her for that amount of money, and sent her multiple notices threatening to send her to collections, the complaint states. \nDoe 2 didn\u2019t hear anything from Howard until March 2016, right after she had reached out to Doe 1, who had gone on a \u201cstorm\u201d on Twitter how the university had similarly botched her report of rape -- against the same man who allegedly assaulted Doe 2. He had transferred from University of California, Los Angeles, after being accused of sexual misconduct there, the suit states. \nFor a third time, Smiley asked to see the text messages Doe 2 had sent twice, the complaint states. In April 2016, Smiley informed Doe 2 that the university had suspended her alleged attacker for two years. \nBut no one notified Doe 1 of the outcome. She reported her rape in February 2016, but after she met with Smiley, Doe 1 didn\u2019t hear anything from her from March 1 through March 21, except for Smiley contacting Doe 1 to ask if she had been discussing the rape in text messages with her friends -- she had not, the lawsuit states. Doe 1 called Smiley four times during that period with no response. \nFrustrated, Doe 1 posted to Twitter in late March 2016, identifying her and Doe 2\u2019s attacker -- that\u2019s how she connected with Doe 2. \nThis prompted Howard to release a statement: \u201cThere has been an allegation of sexual assault committed by a Howard University student against another Howard student. The university administration is aware of the allegation and took immediate action as soon as we learned of this matter.\u201d \nBy that point, Doe 1, who was also a resident assistant, had been fired from her position based on a report her alleged assailant gave to residence life. \nNo one ever told Doe 1 that her rapist was kicked off campus. \nIn a similar set of circumstances, Doe 6 reported her sexual assault in April 2016, but largely did not hear from administration until a full year later, when a dean told her the attacker had raped someone else and that the university was \u201creopening her case.\u201d Doe 6 also discovered before she reported her alleged assailant he had multiple cases of sexual violence already open against him -- but he still is permitted on campus to this day, according to the complaint. BuzzFeed first reported details of the amended complaint. \nThough institutions can't weigh character evidence when adjudicating a Title IX complaint, they can factor in multiple reports with a pattern, said Laura Dunn, founder of SurvJustice, which advocates for sexual assault victims. \nThe job of Title IX coordinators is not only to respond to reports, but also track these patterns of discrimination on campus, Dunn said. In theory, a college or university can flag an individual even without a complaint to work from, she said -- or, in the event of a dead end to an investigation, a person can be removed from a position of power. In the Howard case, the alleged rapist could have been fired as a resident assistant during the investigation. \n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear Howard University was not proactively engaging,\u201d she said. \nThe prevalence of repeat offenders has been challenged in recent years. One 2015 study, led by then Georgia State University assistant professor of psychology Kevin Swartout, now an associate professor, purported that only 25 percent of the men who reported committing acts of rape did so multiple times. \nThis went against oft-cited research in 2002 by David Lisak, then a professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts that cited the number as high as 63 percent. \nIn light of the newer study, colleges should act more carefully, said Brett Sokolow, president of the Association of Title IX Administrators and the NCHERM Group, a consulting firm for institutions. \n\u201cIn a situation in which serial offenses are alleged -- but a pattern may not yet be proven -- I think colleges would be well advised to bring their behavioral intervention or threat assessment teams into play,\u201d Sokolow wrote in an email. \u201cColleges don\u2019t want to suspend anyone without reasonable cause, but often they\u2019re really only speculating as to pattern and the potential to reoffend when all they have are allegations.\u201d \nNot all the plaintiffs in the Howard case allege that their attackers raped multiple people. \nAfter Jane Doe 3 began a relationship with a campus police officer, he sexually and physically abused her: according to the lawsuit, he \u201chit her, pushed her, strangled her and threw things at her.\u201d She told Howard officials she was suicidal and requested solo counseling, not group therapy, as had been suggested, but they ignored her calls. Because her grades slipped, Doe 3 was worried she would lose her Reserve Officers' Training Corps scholarship, and she found that administrators were either indifferent or unhelpful in helping her make up course work or register for new classes. \nAfter Jane Doe 4 was raped, administrators and professors did not assist her in rescheduling her exams, and, she said, her alleged assaulter essentially ignored the no-contact order against him. She often encountered him on campus, and administrators did not help her set up a schedule to avoid him in common areas such as the gym or dining halls as she had requested. \nDoe 4 then learned she might share a dormitory with her alleged rapist, which administrators had promised her would not happen. Administrators acknowledged this was an error but did not confirm with Doe 4 that he would not live on campus until days before campus move-in, the lawsuit states. \nHer alleged assailant was then suspended for a semester, but Doe 4 spotted him at a homecoming pep rally in October 2016. She told campus police he was blocked from campus, but the cops were unaware of this -- the complaint states that the Title IX office never told the police the man was restricted from campus and did not remove him until Doe 4 showed an officer proof of the ban on her phone. \nJane Doe 5 reported her rape to campus officials in April 2015, a month shy of her graduation. She did not feel safe enough at Howard to finish her credits, and requested to do so on another campus. After she took summer classes, the university waited seven months to let her know if the credits would actually count. The alleged assailant in that case was suspended for two years, and the lawsuit states he was later criminally convicted in the District of Columbia for a separate sexual assault. \nHoward in July filed to dismiss the complaint, citing the fact that an institution only violates Title IX when an official is aware of, but willfully ignores, ongoing harassment. The university said once it learned of the alleged assaults, it took action: even if the women \u201cdisagree with the particulars of Howard\u2019s response, Howard did not subject plaintiffs to intentional gender discrimination,\u201d it wrote in the motion to dismiss. \nBlack Colleges and Sex Assaults \nHoward is a prominent historically black college, but some say the issues there reflect broader problems for HBCUs. One challenge at these institutions is that most lack sufficient resources for all kinds of needs, including investigating sex assault accusations. Such scant resources can result in little investment into combating sexual violence, said Venkayla Haynes, a survivor and a representative of advocacy group Know Your IX. She said HBCUs are also very focused on their images, fearful that reports about sex assaults could hurt them. \nAlready, too, black men and women are often disproportionally criminalized, so some survivors are hesitant to report and reinforce that image, she said. \nHaynes, also a regional adviser for the It\u2019s on Us campaign launched by the Obama White House, said she has dealt with many HBCUs that simply disregard issues of sexual violence. She said she\u2019s sat with victims while they tell their stories to administrators but that they\u2019re never officially recorded. \nBut just blaming the historically black institutions for deficiencies in sexual assault reports is unfair, said Felecia Commodore, assistant professor of higher education at Old Dominion University, who studies HBCU leadership and governance. Many other institutions have permitted serial offenders to remain on campus, she said. \nWhat tends to happen is when a predominately white institution is found to have dealt with a report of sexual assault poorly, it's treated as an institutional issue only. When an HBCU does, it's characterized inevitably as an issue among all of them, and thus a racial problem, Commodore said. \nBlack students, particularly black women, face unique challenges in reporting. HBCUs promote a \"family atmosphere\" and sometimes victims will struggle to tell someone when they know their attacker well, Commodore said. Black women often fear, because of stereotypes, being cast as hypersexualized, and some believe they won't be taken seriously, she said. \n\"I think it\u2019s really important that we take seriously when any student comes forward saying they\u2019ve been sexually assaulted,\" Commodore said. \"In the case of HBCUs, I think there is a tendency to underreport, and we need to take seriously supporting [survivors] and making an environment where they don\u2019t feel like they have betrayed people.\" \nHBCUs have not always accomplished this, though. \nRecently, signs appeared on the campuses of both Spelman College and Morehouse College, both members of the Atlanta University Center Consortium, along with Clark Atlanta University. They accused the colleges of \u201cprotecting\u201d rapists. The Martin Luther King Jr. Chapel at Morehouse was spray-painted with \u201cPractice what you preach Morehouse [and] end rape culture.\u201d \nAlongside this, a Twitter account, @WeKnowWhatYouDid , was opened, using the hashtag #weknowwhatyoudid and posting the names of alleged perpetrators, identifying some as serial rapists. \nWhile some HBCUs claim to support programs to curtail sexual violence, they are not always realized, though they are advertised publicly, said Haynes of Know Your IX -- Howard promotes such resources on its website . \n\u201cBut the real change comes when a survivor reports and is actually being taken care of in the way they should,\u201d Haynes said.

Edmund G. \u201cJerry\u201d Brown and First Lady Anne Gust Brown, in partnership with the California Museum, recently announced inductees of the 11 th Class of the California Hall of Fame. Among the new members is Mario Molina, a University of California San Diego distinguished professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemisty and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. \nMolina won the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, along with Scripps Emeritus Professor Paul Crutzen, for research on the formation and decomposition of ozone. He and eight others will be inducted into the state\u2019s hall of fame during an official ceremony in Sacramento at the California Museum on Dec. 5. \n\u201cIt is extremely rewarding for me to be named to the California Hall of Fame among famous and notable individuals,\u201d Molina said. \u201cI will always remain very proud of receiving such an honor.\u201d \nAlong with Molina, other inductees include: Steven Spielberg, filmmaker; Mabel McKay, artist-activist; Jim Plunkett, NFL quarterback; the late Lucille Ball, entertainer; Susan Desmond-Hellman, bioscientist; Gary Snyder, poet; Michael Tilson Thomas, musician and vintner Warren Winiarski. An exhibition featuring the lives and legacies of each new member will open Dec. 6 at the museum. \n\u201cThese Californians represent the dynamic spirit and imagination that is the hallmark of the Golden State,\u201d said Gov. Brown in a prepared statement. \u201cTheir exceptional skill and craft enrich our culture and inspire us all.\u201d \nRecipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013 under Barack Obama, Molina is regarded as a visionary chemist and environmental scientist. He came to the U.S. from Mexico to pursue his graduate degree, and he was a professor at MIT before joining UC San Diego in 2004. In 2014, Chancellor Pradeep K. Khosla presented Molina with the UC San Diego Medal, the highest honor the university bestows. \nMolina\u2019s research topics include gas phase chemical kinetics and photochemistry, chemistry of atmospheric aerosols and air pollution in megacities of the developing world. He considers his signature work to be the development of the science that predicted the threat to the ozone layer by human activities. He currently is on the research team at the Center for Aerosol Impacts on Climate and the Environment (CAICE), a National Science Foundation-supported center on campus. \nAccording to Kim Prather, CAICE director and distinguished chair in atmospheric chemistry at UC San Diego, Molina is an inspiration who has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to finding fundamental solutions to fix environmental problems. \n\u201cAfter addressing issues related to the stratospheric ozone hole in the first part of his career, he is now working hard to tackle issues related to air pollution and climate change,\u201d said Prather. \u201cMother Earth could not have a stronger supporter. We are all lucky to have someone like him to interact with and learn from at UC San Diego.\u201d \nAs an educator, Molina has advised many Hispanic undergraduate and graduate students regarding their academic goals, as well as their options for future studies and employment. He is a member in the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science, and he has presented lectures to groups consisting mainly of underrepresented students. He has also participated in various events involving academic honors and recognitions specifically awarded to members of minority groups. \nMolina also serves as honorary co-chair of the American Chemical Society (ACS) Scholar Program, which awards scholarships and identifies mentors for thousands of highly motivated students in chemistry from underrepresented groups. \nIn line with the university\u2019s goals , Molina said, \u201cI hope I will be remembered as a scientist whose discoveries helped improve the quality of life of human beings.\" \n\nCynthia Dillon, 858-822-0142, \nNote to broadcast and cable producers: University of California San Diego provides an on-campus satellite uplink facility for live or pre-recorded television interviews.

Thank you all for your patience! \nI've completely re-made this mod from scratch and there are a few changes. Firstly I've taken away the actual junk pile as I didn't feel like it fit the art style of TS4 properly. Instead the interactions have been added to most of the outdoor bins you find all around the existing open worlds and on community lots. So you will be able to search for junk as soon as you install the mod without having to set anything up (assuming there is trash in the bin, if the bin is empty you obviously won\u2019t find anything in there because\u2026 logic).\n\n\nYou can now specify what kind of trash you are searching for: furniture, electronics, or random junk. This is useful in different scenarios, for example a runaway teen might be looking for a tent and a shower (junk), a handy sim might be looking to repair some electronics to sell in their store (electronics), or a student might just need some cheap and cheerful furniture for their dorm room.\n\n\nOf course, it would be too easy if you could simply find a load of awesome stuff in the trash! So to balance this out a little, I reduced the value of all the items to around 10% of the normal price. So you can\u2019t earn a huge profit from simply selling the items as-is. To make it a bit more realistic I tried to also make the objects dirty or broken where possible, so they will need fixing and cleaning when you pull them out of the trash. Other objects are given descriptive text like \u2018wobbly table\u2019 and I created dirty looking swatches for most objects.\n\n\n\nHowever (I\u2019m really excited about this part!!!) I really love the idea of up-cycling salvaged objects. So I spent a lot of time adding custom swatches for many of the items! I particularly chose a festival/beachy style which I think fits the art style of the game. I also found that the beach recolours work really well in Brindleton Bay, especially on the Outdoor Retreat items which have a new lease of life! So once you\u2019ve pulled your salvaged items from the trash and cleaned/repaired them, you can drag the objects onto a lot (community lots work just fine as long as it\u2019s not in the open world) where you can use the design tool to change the look of your items as though the Sim has given them a makeover with some new fabrics! The mod works great for festivals on a budget and I plan to have my design student up-cycle furniture and sell it in a store to pay her way through uni!\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve thoroughly tested the mod and everything seems to be up and running perfectly on my end, but do let me know if you find any issues. I hope to continue to update this mod by adding more items.\nThe items that you can find require: \n* The Base Game\n* Get Together\n* City Living\n* Outdoor Retreat \nSo all the above are REQUIRED for the mod to function properly. You can still try to use it if you are missing any of those packs but the missing objects will not drop and the game will throw an error at you when it tries to drop those items. Also note that I removed the yoga mat for now as I wanted to use the minimal amount of expansions for this version, but I plan to re-add it again in an alternative version.\nDownload Here! (Dropbox)\nCreated with Sims4Studio .\nUpdated! 7th December 2017. Since the code for salvaging items was based on EA\u2019s \u2018rummage\u2019 code, the interaction was disabled on home lots. Sadly, this also meant that Sims couldn\u2019t rummage for trash in the open world areas around their lots (apparently Sims own the whole neighbourhood\u2026 go figure!). I changed the code to allow Sims to salvage items on their home lots and surrounding areas as I felt like this was more beneficial for players who like to avoid loading screens.

Pruitt, happens to be a member of the Athletics Hall of Fame. \nMontevallo made the announcement on Nov. 9 that Baxter had signed during the early signing period.

Playing is easy and fun! Just register at the start of the tournament before March 14, 2017 and we\u2019ll re\u2026 \n\u201cI think really anytime one of my players gets the opportunity to further their academic and athletic career at any school, I\u2019m extremely happy for those guys,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cFor it to be my alma mater, it does have a special meaning to me because I still do have a great relationship with the current staff up there, so anytime we can from our school we can send a player their way, it\u2019s a big deal because I want those guys to be successful.\u201d \nPruitt starred on the diamond at Montevallo from 2006-07 and owns the baseball program\u2019s record for most runs scored in a season. He was elected to the Hall of Fame earlier this fall and will be formally inducted on Feb. 3. \nBaxter said his connection to Montevallo came during a baseball showcase at the start of the school year held at Lawson State Community College in Birmingham. His work there got him noticed by some colleges, and Montevallo was among those that expressed interest in him. \nBut it was a visit to Montevallo that swayed Baxter, when he took a liking to the school. \n\u201cAll in all, that\u2019s just where I felt like was home and just fell in love with it when I first saw it,\u201d Baxter said. \nPruitt said he and Baxter talked about Montevallo and told him what the experience there is like. However, the coach said he was not trying to persuade Baxter to go there. \n\u201cI tell all of my guys, you\u2019ve got to live your life, you\u2019ve got make your own decisions, so whatever you feel like is the best fit for you that\u2019s where you need to go,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cAnd in the long run, he felt like that was the best fit for him, so I couldn\u2019t be more happy for him.\u201d \nLast season, Baxter had a 2-0 record with 17 strikeouts in 22 \u2153 innings and a 3.13 earned-run average. At the plate, he had a .348 batting average with a .467 on-base percentage, 17 runs batted in and five doubles. \nPruitt praised Baxter\u2019s athleticism and versatility \u2014 Baxter plays both first base and third base in addition to pitching \u2014 as well as his work ethic. \n\u201cJust a guy that\u2019s truly passionate about becoming the best player that he can be,\u201d Pruitt said. \nBaxter\u2019s drive to improve and excel extends from disappointment he experienced as a younger player. \nBaxter said that while growing up, he always wanted to get onto the local All-Star team, but never got the call from the coach while his friends did. Then, when he was 9, Baxter made the team for the first time and was \u201csuper-excited,\u201d he said. \nHowever, he did not get the call the next year at All-Star time. But Baxter turned that adversity into fire. \n\u201cThat was kind of the year where I just really worked hard and kind of tried to be working to be the best I could be, even though I didn\u2019t really get what I was striving for and kind of didn\u2019t let that set me back and keep me from doing what I really wanted to do,\u201d he said. \nBaxter said he made the All-Star teams the next few years, and made the junior-high team in the eighth grade. \nBaxter\u2019s work ethic has not waned any. This summer, he attended a pitcher\u2019s camp in Texas to further work on his mechanics. His fastball has reached 87 mph, he said, but backs that up with his curveball, which he calls his best pitch. His focus on pitching is based on his belief that that area is where he can take him the furthest in college baseball. \nFor a major at Montevallo, Baxter said he is considering areas such as strength and conditioning, psychology and criminology.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "elliot baxter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j.d. pruitt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fathead", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pruitt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baxter", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ehs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of montevallo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hall of fame", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lawson state community college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bracket challenge facebook  compete", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enterprise high school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athletics hall of fame", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montevallo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "birmingham", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:13.065+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "551964db3cdfa977514dfbd4f47a7bc21c155f5f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWHWxXJT3jLbXmlCNTFSs2qJnnd8sTO4m4mSW17HCsLlmRr5XgH4hqQ5YoRIBVflgDsucOJHxAPAETeMjMie5UYSbGW5oLc8Qvi20HgahgJ8On_gmMVF3nqA--", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/petpet/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "PetPet Diapers With Best Price At Lazada In Malaysia", "title": "Petpet Mega L 64s (3 packs)", "title_full": "Petpet Mega Pack L 64s (3 packs) | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-02-07T06:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 241, "participants_count": 186, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.012, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2b458036d740b970c0c9f3b95f4a8a30387c1ed7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWHWxXJT3jLbXmlCNTFSs2qJnnd8sTO4m4mSW17HCsLlmRr5XgH4hqQ5YoRIBVflgDsucOJHxAPAETeMjMie5UYSbGW5oLc8Qvi20HgahgJ8Pe1qaRuBmuL26ObFZQxjTf", "ord_in_thread": 235, "author": "Mohammad S.", "published": "2017-11-28T05:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "Five Stars", "text": "arrived in good condition", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:13.072+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0585cbf697e1572c40a7a19123188aeda240e721", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQG6oTC7e8bgwhqzWIuUrE2nrzct5BZmTT2d1mc5WcOYP0Y1poG0.beFmitLxeBlg.Gl.hwRl.5rks14T9vBL6iuUmsUaUgLUA-", "site_full": "cramswansea.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://cramswansea.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "New book by CRAM\u2019s Simon John\u2026", "title": "New book by CRAM\u2019s Simon John\u2026", "title_full": "New book by CRAM\u2019s Simon John\u2026", "published": "2017-12-07T11:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0585cbf697e1572c40a7a19123188aeda240e721", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQG6oTC7e8bgwhqzWIuUrE2nrzct5BZmTT2d1mc5WcOYP0Y1poG0.beFmitLxeBlg.Gl.hwRl.5rks14T9vBL6iuUmsUaUgLUA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cramswansea", "published": "2017-12-07T11:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "New book by CRAM\u2019s Simon John\u2026", "text": "I recently completed a monograph on the Godfrey of Bouillon (c.1060-1100), a leading participant in the First Crusade (1096-99) and the first ruler of Latin Jerusalem, the principal new state founded by the victorious crusaders. Part of my research explores how Godfrey\u2019s memory has been preserved and transmitted in the centuries after his death. In the course of completing the book, I learned that there exists a monumental equestrian statue of Godfrey in Brussels. The statue, inaugurated on 15 August 1848, stands in the Place Royale, a major thoroughfare of the Belgian capital. It is the work of Louis-Eug\u00e8ne Simonis, a prominent sculptor in nineteenth-century Belgium. The monument was subsequently modified by the addition of a pair of inscriptions (in 1880) and a pair of bas-reliefs (1897). \n\nMy next research project will examine the origin, commission, design, installation and reception of this statue. My aspiration is that exercise in medievalism will permit me to illuminate the ways in which this medieval figure and the First Crusade were remembered in nineteenth-century Belgium, as well as explore how medieval texts and artefacts may have been used in the creation of the statue. The project will also speak to questions relating to the formation of the Belgian state after the Belgian Revolution of 1830-1, touching on issues including the coalescence of Belgian national identity, debates on the role of languages in public discourse, the input of Belgium\u2019s political elite in forging new traditions for the fledgling state, and the tension between Catholic and Liberal political values. I aim to visit Brussels in 2018 to carry out archival work, chiefly in the Biblioth\u00e8que royale de Belgique/Koninklijke Bibliotheek van Belgi\u00eb, in order to complete the project.
