The funding reprieve comes as the White House and congressional leaders are negotiating a longer-term agreement, building off a Thursday meeting involving Trump and congressional leaders. \nThe White House and lawmakers said the bill will give them more time to negotiate several end-of-the-year agenda items, including the budget, a children's health program and hurricane aid. Administration and congressional aides were continuing the talks on Friday. \n\"We hope that we're going to make some great progress for our country. I think that will happen,\" Trump said Thursday in the Oval Office. Added Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York: \"Funding the government is extremely important, helping our soldiers is very important and helping average citizens is very important. So we're here in the spirit of: Let's get it done.\" \nThe two-week measure funds government agencies from the Defense Department to the IRS. It also makes money available to several states running out of funds for the Children's Health Insurance Program. The popular health care program provides medical care to more than 8 million children. \nThe White House and lawmakers have been discussing relief from a budget freeze on the Pentagon and domestic agencies, extending the children's health program and providing more disaster aid to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida. \nNegotiators are also seeking ways of addressing protections for immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children. \nRepublican leaders have said they agree with the need to address immigration, including the almost 1 million immigrants given protections by former President Barack Obama. Trump has sought stronger border security and immigration enforcement as part of the talks and the White House said Thursday that \"negotiations on immigration should be held separately on a different track\" to avoid slowing down funding increases for the Pentagon. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Yes, security software has gotten better, but that's a time commitment the Mac doesn't have. Much of this is that Berkeley Unix (on which the Mac is based) is inherently relatively secure. The most recent Mac vulnerability (yes, it's embarrasing that Apple left the root account OPEN!) requires physical access to the computer. Many of us aren't that worried about someone sitting down at our computer and getting in - we are concerned at being network-hacked.\nThat's not a stability issue. I spend zero seconds a day worrying about security or doing anything about it. Windows comes with built in protections, including utilising processor level options, and then I simply don't click on random nonsense or open unexpected email, thus reducing the threat vectors to practically zero in the first place. I literally have as much chance of a security issue as a Mac user because my threat vectors are effectively the same. And then I have transparent software that's there just in case (unlikely some Mac users). The perception is that it's a minefield out there. It's not. You really do have to be careless to even have a chance of being hit (and, yes, a lot of people are careless).\nThere really is no time commitment.\nQuote: from: Dan Wells on December 06, 2017, 03:17:37 PM Windows Update: Takes over the system randomly (generally on restart, but I've had Windows machines insist on restarting for updates in the middle of a work session). Some update cycles are up to an hour long. Some required updates are not user-beneficial (the classic example is what at least used to be called Windows Genuine Advantage - a piracy detector that initiates long system updates and occasionally mistakes non-pirated software for pirated). There was no benefit to the USER in Windows Genuine Advantage, although it certainly benefits developers. Macs have long update cycles, too - but you can always schedule them.\nYou can easily set the machine to not do this. It won't restart in the middle of anything unless you've told it that you can. Even by default, if you are actively on the machine it will prompt you before it can proceed and give you an option to choose when to do it. Also, it's not really random. Microsoft release non-critical updates on a consistent schedule. The Genuine Advantage process, no longer a part of the OS, was a one-time update and it caused me zero issues over multiple computers. It did cause problems for people with pirated versions who failed to take advantage of the super cheap upgrade path offered at the time (which would have then lead them to a free Win 10 upgrade if they'd wanted it).\nHonestly, this hasn't been a thing for 10 years!\nSo, again, there's no issue here.\nQuote: from: Dan Wells on December 06, 2017, 03:17:37 PM I have many more hangs in Adobe software and Capture One on Windows than Mac - I know this isn't everybody's experience.\nI can't speak to Capture One as I don't use it, but I use the entire Adobe suite without issue, again for years. I probably don't use it as much as you (no, I'll say definitely that I don't), but I have used it for a very long time over many environments, including test environments. Of course if there's a significant bug then yes I can and have encountered those, but not Windows related as such. As you say, it's hardly a broad experience.\nQuote: from: Dan Wells on December 06, 2017, 03:17:37 PM The Blue Screen of Death still exists - it's relatively rare, but I haven't had a Mac do that to me in many years.\nRare? It's beyond rare unless you have a hardware fault. If you have seen this, other than for a hardware fault, then you have some dodgy software installed.\nI haven't seen a BSOD over any of my, or my wife's, or any of my family or friends, for so long I couldn't tell you how long it's been. Not even anyone at work, on their business or home machines have mentioned it for that long.\nThis is another non-issue, and it's really feeling like you've taken some historical issues rather than experienced things yourself. That's probably just my reading of it, but that's how it appears.\nQuote: from: Dan Wells on December 06, 2017, 03:17:37 PM No systemwide color management - the critical applications (anything Adobe, Capture One, etc.) ARE color managed, but there are times when it's nice to have correct color in a browser, or Word, or some other non-obvious piece of software.\nThis is not a stability issue. You can have correct colour in a browser, but it's true it's not system wide and that IS an advantage to OS X. For the number of times I needed to colour manage Word in terms of visually proofing on the screen I can count on zero fingers, but I accept others may need it. Word does have colour management, you can print a colour managed workflow from Word in Windows in you want, but you can't see it. Ever so small advantage to Mac here.\nQuote: from: Dan Wells on December 06, 2017, 03:17:37 PM Outlook is far more complex than Mac Mail, and far more trouble prone - if you need the power of Outlook, I'm sure Windows Outlook is better than Mac Outlook - but it can be nice to have a simple e-mail client.\nLike the free Mail that's built into Windows? This is really a strange things to compare. Outlook is easy to use if all you want is to send mail, but of course it's overkill for most home users - hence, free, built-in mail software that's really simple to use. You are in no way limited to Outlook.

I would have happily brought it to FedEx myself if they had said it was going to miss the truck. They reassured me \"it's Thursday, you'll have it back by Tuesday, Wednesday at the latest (these were the two days BEFORE Thanksgiving, so I was confident it would miss the holiday).\nCalled on Friday, when the online status showed it was still sitting at the store. They said \"the repair facility works on weekends - you'll still have it Wednesday\". Status didn't change at all until Monday, when the repair facility finally admitted to having received it.\nStatus didn't change Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday - a couple of calls and visits to the Apple Store - one has a reassuring answer that it passed its diagnostics Tuesday night, and should come home Wednesday (which turned out to be a lie). On Friday, with the same status, I go back in to the Apple Store, and they say \"oh, the repair facility isn't open on ANY weekend, and takes a four day break for Thanksgiving\".\nStatus doesn't change on the Monday after Thanksgiving - fast approaching two weeks since it left - I last checked the status Monday at about 8 PM. I check the status Tuesday morning at about 10, and there's a \"sorry we missed you\" notice from FedEx. They tried to deliver it while I was in the shower Tuesday morning (this wasn't Apple's fault, except that I would have waited for it if they'd properly updated the status the night before).\nIt finally comes home Wednesday morning - ONE DAY short of two weeks.\nApple claims it was only five business days (they didn't count the day I brought it in, they didn't count the travel day on Friday, didn't count the weekend, counted Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, didn't count the four day break, counted Monday, tried to return it on Tuesday). They claim it was just unlucky, but I would expect a repair facility for professional equipment (if they insist on depot repair only) to work Saturdays and certainly the day after Thanksgiving- I fully accept that Sundays and Thanksgiving Day don't count. It was also unreasonable to have it miss the truck on that first Thursday without notice (my Genius appointment was at 3 PM, and FedEx picks up until 7 or so around here) - I'd have happily driven it to a FedEx facility (it might have gotten ahead of Thanksgiving if it had had the extra day).\nI'm aware of Joint Venture, but the price is totally unreasonable for one machine. If I had several employees and 5 machines, it would be expensive, but not unreasonable. EVERY other $3000 business laptop (not necessarily gaming machines - I'm thinking ThinkPads, ZBooks, Precision Workstations, etc. rather than expensive toys) comes with onsite service. I've dealt with HP relatively recently and IBM a long time ago (before they sold the ThinkPad line to Lenovo) - both had a technician there in 24 hours, and had the machine fixed that day (I seem to recall that one was on a Saturday, but I'm not sure).\nThe 15\" MBP, the 27\" iMac and the Mac Pro are certainly expensive enough that that is the standard of service (the only Mac that is so cheap that it falls in the \"slow depot service is all you pay for\" category is the Mini).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:40.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2d6ad98555efcbd0596ccfa8dfb7dd277c9fbeb4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpL5xoRekfdWE6mrGBV6KXWCDcgZDh4Pv1gzD31gaTLx9wN3lapFy4JIjDnYciCsODQkoehZhEj15jTLJZojY.YMtNBDSz7.4-", "site_full": "www.laliberte.ch", "site": "laliberte.ch", "site_section": "http://laliberte.ch//rss/news/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "La Libert\u00e9", "title": "Jim The Barber: monumental", "title_full": "Jim The Barber: monumental", "published": "2017-12-07T01:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CH", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.laliberte.ch/media/laliberte/image/0/thumb-default.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2d6ad98555efcbd0596ccfa8dfb7dd277c9fbeb4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpL5xoRekfdWE6mrGBV6KXWCDcgZDh4Pv1gzD31gaTLx9wN3lapFy4JIjDnYciCsODQkoehZhEj15jTLJZojY.YMtNBDSz7.4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T01:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "Jim The Barber: monumental", "text": "Jim The Barber: monumental 07.12.2017 \nFri-Son \u00bb Les Fribourgeois de Jim The Barber&His Shiny Blades vernissent samedi leur album The Silence of Monuments. \nIl fallait bien la grande sc\u00e8ne de Fri-Son pour accueillir les onze musiciens qui d\u00e9fendront le nouvel opus du groupe fribourgeois le plus folk du moment.

I guess it shows that you can get lucky or unlucky with similar repairs. In my case, the original issue wasn't even Apple's fault - it's just the length of time it took to get it back, and that they didn't offer any alternative way to get work done while it was gone (other than Joint Venture, which is cost-prohibitive except in a multi-person shop - since it covers 5 machines, it might be a great option for a studio that had 3 employees and 4 Macs, for example).\nFor those who can get Windows to work well for them, great! I never have, despite a lot of computer experience (admittedly mostly Mac), and I've gotten even complex things to run beautifully on Macs.\nOn the few occasions I've tried to use Windows for imaging stuff, I've never run anything dodgier than Capture One.\nMy original point was more about Apple needing to offer pro-level support with the expensive machines - even offering Joint Venture at $100/year per machine without having to buy 5 machines of coverage if you own one machine would help. They actually used to - it was called ProCare, I believe.\n Perhaps some more hardware choices (their hardware is really nice, but I wish you could choose \"heavier with more ports\", for example). A simple way to do this would be to license MacOS for a few workstation-class machines, since a Mac is basically a UEFI PC with a few specific bits of hardware.\nDan", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:40.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "af9ad361ee64eee655259199ef4ebbfe80c1137a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju347H6Bbx3Ysr3cDTXKdjWsb.chnrKqywAMcLutppTgQb8fzcpBZobDwkLUibvrva386qutY5mOMyw--", "site_full": "www.ign.com", "site": "ign.com", "site_section": "http://www.ign.com/boards/forums/the-vestibule.5296/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "The Vestibule | IGN Boards", "title": "It is Thursday in December my dudes", "title_full": "It is Thursday in December my dudes | IGN Boards", "published": "2017-12-06T17:38:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.ign.com/boards/styles/default/ign/ign-logo-100x100.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 383, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7136d3d7f7c57c512dd2842e5a00ae70dd029715", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju347H6Bbx3Ysr3cDTXKdjWsb.chnrKqywAMcLutppTgQb8fzcpBZobDwkLUibvrva38rk_sViSXy8A--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Raven327", "published": "2017-12-06T17:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Thank you calendar.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:40.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3ecfcd388e528700ce79b1a947f95157f472fe0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UfFBTIA_duo2ZHGsUXwBCkIT8QLzRBE5PF.P8cJ0E6_RTK_7QstHV3FkeKjTIZlPpnmyLqeO3g8LQ--", "site_full": "drugpolicycentral.com", "site": "drugpolicycentral.com", "site_section": "http://drugpolicycentral.com/bot/rss", "site_categories": ["illegal_content", "tech", "internet_technology"], "section_title": "breaking drug news latest 25", "title": "Projects - Toronto Star", "title_full": "[BOT] Projects - Toronto Star", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3ecfcd388e528700ce79b1a947f95157f472fe0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UfFBTIA_duo2ZHGsUXwBCkIT8QLzRBE5PF.P8cJ0E6_RTK_7QstHV3FkeKjTIZlPpnmyLqeO3g8LQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "drugpolicycentral.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Projects - Toronto Star", "text": "Canada: Projects - Toronto Star \nFound: Thu Dec 07 01:03:01 2017 PST\nSource: Toronto Star (CN ON)\nCopyright: 2017 The Toronto Star\nContact: lettertoed@thestar.ca\nWebsite: http://www.thestar.com/\nDetails: http://www.mapinc.org/media/456\nWebpage: https://www.thestar.com/projects.html   \npropaganda analysis \nSearch the print archives \nProjects \nStar InvestigationHow your tax money is effectively paying these companies' environmental fines \nSince 2010, dozens of companies across Canada who've violated environmental rules have received more than $2.6 billion in public money. The penalties they faced were not just offset, but dwarfed by government largesse. \nStar InvestigationThese average Ontarians are taking on big polluters \nIndustrial polluters in Ontario are rarely punished despite repeatedly breaching environmental standards. Left feeling the government will not take meaningful action, everyday people from across the province have dedicated themselves to getting justice. \nHomelessness13 people who've all been homeless show the city from their unique point of view \nThe 13 people whose photographs grace the pages of the MYTORONTO calendar all experienced homelessness.

The 23-year-old was one of thousands of Ontarians who have turned to temporary employment agencies to find jobs that often come with low pay and little training for sometimes dangerous work. The Star's Sara Mojtehedzadeh went undercover for a month at the factory where Diaby worked. \nVimy Ridge 100th anniversaryThe tangled routes of our Vimy oak \nDays after Canadians took back the ridge in 1917, a soldier walking the barren battlefield pocketed a few acorns from a shattered oak. He mailed them home to Scarborough where they were planted on the family farm. Now, 100 years and some surprising twists later, Vimy oaks, descended from those very acorns, will once again rise over the site of Canada's remarkable Great War victory. \nRazing CaliIn Colombia, saving a city from climate change means razing thousands of homes \nIn Cali, Colombia, saving a city from climate change means evicting thousands from their homes. The city is relocating some 30,000 people living on the Jarillon -- a 23-kilometre dike holding back the powerful Cauca River -- to prevent a ' catastrophe worse than Katrina.' \nCongo'The violence here was so terrible we didn't hear the birds sing for days' \nStar Editor Michael Cooke travelled to the Democratic Republic of Congo -- the heart of one of the world's biggest refugee crises -- to see the horrors firsthand. \nIraqBound.

I had several keys that stopped working. I have to admit the new MacBook Pros are not without issues. Apple publicly stated this week through Johny Ives that they will be addressing all the issues. So, here's hoping. Nevertheless, I called Apple, made an appointment with a Genius and took my laptop in. Luckily I have an iMac to use in the meantime. They were super nice at the store. The genius I had recognized me from LuLa and had a bunch of his co-workers come by and say hi. It's nice to see all the readers and hear about how much they enjoy LuLa. This person went in the back and did a diagnostics and came back about 10 minutes later and said there were a number of bad keys and that the whole top with the keyboard would have to be replaced. For this, they would have to send it out and it would take 3-5 days. It went in on Dec 1 and was returned today by FedEx priority Wed. Dec 6. 3 Business days in the shop. not bad. ended up having a new logic board and keyboard put in. Restoring from time machine with no problems.\nI own a lot of Apple gear, phones, computers etc. They have always been top notch in help and service. I own a ton of Apple stock bought a very long time ago. Yes, I like Apple. It just works (usually all the time). My experience with windows has never been good. I haven't used the latest OS but I have looked that the hardware. I have horrible memories of disk fragmentation, crashes, registry issues and so on. Never anything like that with a MAC.\nMacs just work and I believe they will get better. I am looking forward to the iMac Pro due soon. For me, it is knowing I have never been second-guessed, treated like an idiot when I do need help and they always make it right. The Apple store ten minutes from my house is always packed. The Microsoft store a few doors down is empty. Usually, you see the employees playing games waiting for a customer to come in.\nFor me it has been Apple and will be. Yes, they stumble sometimes, more lately than before, but they are figuring it out. My portfolio is looking good too Low 109.16 - High 176.24 Nice gains especially when I look at what my original purchase price was.\nBottom line I have my laptop back. The dongle issue isn't that bad anymore as I either now have USB-C drives and or a special all in one adapter. For me it works and except for the latest issue, it works all the time.\nGet the machine and OS that is best for you. I don't hear anyone asking me what platform I develop the website on.

Yes, security software has gotten better, but that's a time commitment the Mac doesn't have. Much of this is that Berkeley Unix (on which the Mac is based) is inherently relatively secure. The most recent Mac vulnerability (yes, it's embarrasing that Apple left the root account OPEN!) requires physical access to the computer. Many of us aren't that worried about someone sitting down at our computer and getting in - we are concerned at being network-hacked.\nWindows Update: Takes over the system randomly (generally on restart, but I've had Windows machines insist on restarting for updates in the middle of a work session). Some update cycles are up to an hour long. Some required updates are not user-beneficial (the classic example is what at least used to be called Windows Genuine Advantage - a piracy detector that initiates long system updates and occasionally mistakes non-pirated software for pirated). There was no benefit to the USER in Windows Genuine Advantage, although it certainly benefits developers. Macs have long update cycles, too - but you can always schedule them.\nI have many more hangs in Adobe software and Capture One on Windows than Mac - I know this isn't everybody's experience.\nThe Blue Screen of Death still exists - it's relatively rare, but I haven't had a Mac do that to me in many years.\nNo systemwide color management - the critical applications (anything Adobe, Capture One, etc.) ARE color managed, but there are times when it's nice to have correct color in a browser, or Word, or some other non-obvious piece of software.\nOutlook is far more complex than Mac Mail, and far more trouble prone - if you need the power of Outlook, I'm sure Windows Outlook is better than Mac Outlook - but it can be nice to have a simple e-mail client.\nDan", "highlightText": "",

For instance: we loved that Pete Wentz was wearing a Carson Wentz jersey. And we love that Charlie Puth is a big enough Biggie fan to spend $500 on a tee (at least, that's what he told us he spent when he was on the red carpet). \nThat being said, though, there was more than clothing choices to talk about. Here are nine things we learned at the 2017 Q102 Jingle Ball. \nLiam Payne is a puppy whisperer. Everyone loves puppies, but most of us are happy with just one. The former One Directioner, however, will take three. The Q102 Jingle Ball had puppies at the red carpet and Payne good-naturedly posed while holding three of these adorable furballs. You can see the photo in the gallery at the top of this post. Can't see the gallery? Click here \nCharlie Puth doesn't have to sing his own songs. The crowd will do it for him. The audience sang along so loud to \"Attention\" that he let them have the mic, popping in every now and then to help them along. And you know what? The crowd sounded pretty great. \nTrans-Siberian Orchestra makes for the best entrance music. Fall Out Boy came onto the stage to the sound of music by the Trans-Siberian Orchestra (we're pretty sure it was \"Christmas Eve/Sarajevo,\" but aren't 100 percent positive). It was a perfect way to start what was, in fact, a rocking set. \n\"Closer\" never gets old. That's especially true when you're listening to Halsey and The Chainsmokers perform it together live. It's always great when artists join each other onstage, so the fact that Halsey came out made the performance one to remember. Of course, the pillars of smoke that erupted routinely throughout the song also helped. \nLogic is the king of positivity. The rapper was not only adorably goofy on the red carpet (telling photographers he didn't know what he was doing, thus the reasons for his unusual poses), but during his set he made a point to have the crowd bond with each other, instructing them that they were all friends now. He concluded his set with his hit \"1-800-273-8255,\" which is about someone struggling with depression. He encouraged his audience to get help if they were hurting, and finished by having them shout out their desire to be alive. \nPentatonix, Jay Z, Nicky Jam: 35 must-see concerts in Pa. this December \nNiall Horan just wants to be on his own. Or so he sang. \"On My Own\" was our clear favorite in his set (yes, it even trumped \"Slow Hands\" in our book). It's always exciting to see a singer have a chance to really go to town on his guitar, and \"On My Own\" gave him a great opportunity to show off his rocking guitar skills. \nSabrina Carpenter is proud of her Pa. roots. The singer took a moment in her set to talk about what it meant to her to perform at the Wells Fargo Center, where she went to see so many shows herself as a kid growing up in Lehigh Valley. She then launched into a solid rendition of \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\" The hometown pride continued offstage though -- she later tweeted: to hear 19,000 people in my hometown arena sing the words to my song louder than me... my eyes are sweating thank u so much. -- Sabrina Carpenter (@SabrinaAnnLynn) December 7, 2017 \nWhy Don't We is the boy band we all wanted. Boy bands are alive and well thanks to Why Don't We, which performed to deafening screens at the Wells Fargo Center. With their dance moves and earworm hooks, it's safe to say we'll be hearing a lot from this group in the future. \nThere are no words to describe Kesha's performance. Except for wonderful. Moving. Emotional. \"Praying\" was insane and \"Tik Tok\" still makes you want to dance seven years. So for all that, we'll forgive her for spitting onstage. \nWhat was your favorite moment from the Q102 Jingle Ball? Let us know in the comments!

Unfortunately, these medications do not address the true cause of the pain and often lead down a dark path. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in four patients who are prescribed opioids for long-term noncancer pain in primary care settings struggle with addiction and face an increased risk of turning to heroin usage. Furthermore, the downward spiral of opioid addiction leads to more than 1,000 people being treated in emergency departments each day for misusing prescription opioids . \nWhile this sounds dire, there is an encouraging alternative to achieving healthy pain management. This alternative not only provides pain relief, but also education, support and a road toward a healthier lifestyle. The alternative to putting a bandage over pain is to treat the root cause through physical therapy. \nWith the backing of the CDC, physical therapy is one of the recommended non- opioid alternatives for pain relief. Physical therapy alleviates pain through helping patients improve strength, flexibility and range of motion. Along the way, physical therapists also educate patients about pain, serving as a dedicated teammate for patients on their wellness journeys. \nInstead of addiction , depression and withdrawal symptoms, physical therapy leads to increased independence, identification of health concerns and prevention of additional health problems through movement and exercise. \nIf you or a loved one are among the many Americans who are being prescribed opioids , know that there are better options for pain management. Professionals within the field of physical therapy are eager to help remove the bandage over chronic pain by treating the true root of the problem and providing support on the journey to healthy pain management and an improved way of life. Choose physical therapy. \n(Maria Gruetzmacher Hammon is a first-year student in Western Carolina University 's doctoral program in physical therapy and a resident of Stillwater, Minnesota.) \nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.blog comments powered by Disqus \nTweet \n* Explore Elkmont \nRelated items * Sexual violence and the workplace \n* Holiday traditions are worth their weight in gold \n* All hands on deck to address opioid epidemic \n* New opioid legislation to limit prescriptions \n* Vision for 'Art of Music Festival' is attainable \n* Remembering the quieter, essential aspects of a life \n* Reaching out for help: Local services available for adults with mental illness \n* Haywood Regional expands to meet behavioral health needs \nMedia \nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.blog comments powered by Disqus \nMost Popular \n* Beyond words: WCU community overflows with gratitude for Belcher's leadership \n* Ramsey Center to get new skin \n* Homeless in Haywood for the holidays \n* Blue jays arouse mixed feelings among humans \n* All hands on deck to address opioid epidemic", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "smoky mountai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria gruetzmacher hammon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belcher", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western carolina university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wcu", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "nc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stillwater", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:42.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c5078af23b66defa3efdd5186b486b66cb084455", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOS_5hBLgIvVPUNJTUCr6KtUmCzUBwbYrPsghAgxL1rgkt2YiW9EXTvYsZEh1XguuwCZQjD4ttWj1pX47GWVqBMYX0EcUW0zHHCDeBuLuQ0wh5kVqrghLtPm5ZW39aFLvk-", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com", "site": "tripadvisor.com", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g150786-i45-Pacific_Coast.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Pacific Coast Forum, Travel Discussion for Pacific Coast, Mexico - TripAdvisor", "title": "Pickleball in Nuevo Vallarta? - Nuevo Vallarta", "title_full": "Pickleball in Nuevo Vallarta? - Nuevo Vallarta Forum - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-07T08:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 189, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c811a3a14cbdadc065b56f0deef2ddc3013b610a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOS_5hBLgIvVPUNJTUCr6KtUmCzUBwbYrPsghAgxL1rgkt2YiW9EXTvYsZEh1XguuwCZQjD4ttWj1pX47GWVqBMYX0EcUW0zHHCDeBuLuQ0wh5kVqrghLtPWNzH8_iadM48udRuCVr7Ug--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Jonnie-Kay M", "published": "2017-12-07T11:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Thank you!

\nThe Swede was out-scored this year by his teammate Pascal Wehrlein, who has been ousted and looks set to leave F1. \nEricsson admits that Wehrlein, the highly-rated young Mercedes driver, was \"the perfect measure\" for him in 2017. \nHowever, it is believed 26-year-old Ericsson's strong links with the new Sauber ownership were enough to secure his place for next season. \n\"I had a few nervous weeks but of course it's nice that everything is ready now, especially with Alfa Romeo as a major sponsor and partner,\" he told the Swedish motoring magazine Teknikens Varld. \nEricsson, who has also raced in F1 with the now-defunct Caterham team, admitted he is relieved that Sauber looks set to have a more competitive car in 2018. \n\"It has been quite a tough career so far in formula one,\" he said. \"It has been difficult to show what I can do with cars that are always at the back of the grid. \n\"But now with Sauber together with Alfa Romeo, it should mean that for the first time I can be much higher on the grid,\" Ericsson added. \nHe will be paired next year with Charles Leclerc, the new Formula 2 champion and a Ferrari junior driver. \n\"Charles Leclerc is an incredibly talented driver who really dominated F2 this year and will of course be a tough opponent for me next season,\" Ericsson said. \n\"He is also Ferrari's new super junior but I'm sure we will work well together to develop the car in the best way.\" \n(GMM)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marcus ericsson",

The campaign aims to strip corruption of its socially accepted status and aspirational appeal by getting Ghana to see it in the same light as rape, murder and armed robbery. Speaking about the campaign, Mr. Richard Quayson, the Deputy Commissioner of CHRAJ noted that \u201cIt\u2019s so unfortunate, but the fact is, corruption has now become a norm in Ghana. People freely talk about their corrupt intentions and are rather cheered by their friends and described as \u2018sharp\u2019 or \u2018smart\u2019. The Commission is committed to changing this.\u201d The campaign which started in the week of ahead of the launch with an \u2018anonymously leaked\u2019 video of a certain \u2018Teacher Bismark\u2019 admonishing his primary school students to \u201cchop Ghana\u2019s money\u201d when they are older, revealed at the end of the video that it was staged and prompted viewers to consider what their lifestyles are teaching children. The video went viral, with many Ghanaians sharing their anger at the thought of such a thing happening. This was all planned. At the launch, Jerry Sam, Programme Director at Penplusbytes urged Ghanaians to channel all rage and anger into fighting corruption by taking the anti-corruption pledge and sharing the message with their family and friends. Anyone can take the pledge at www.ghanasaysno.org . \u201cWe built this idea on a strong insight that; at the heart of corruption is selfishness and a desire to live comfortably and present an image of success at all cost. So we crafted a campaign that attacked that image attained corruptly. If all of Ghana saw and treated corruption like rape, murder and the worst social vices, then people in the position of trust will think more carefully and be less willing to resort to corrupt means to fuel a corrupt lifestyle. We have very compelling TV, radio and social media ads to help drive home the message which will be released in the course of the week.\u201d Another interesting feature of the campaign is how it gives everyone the chance to anonymously report any act of corruption through the \u2018whistleblower function\u2019 of the campaign website. CHRAJ is committed to investigating and prosecuting any culprit found to be guilty as a result of a tip-off. The campaign is targeting 50,000 pledges and anyone can take the pledge at  www.ghanasaysno.org  and/or join the conversation on Social Media using #GhanaSaysNo. Source: penplusbytes.org   ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "admi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penplusbytes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerry sam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard quayson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "commission on human rights", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chraj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social media", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "accra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la palm hotel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penplusbytes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ghana", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:43.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4c93ee5debfb93aa5395b036945c23b520d87574", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTrVmkasVq0s_yZcxEX3pqagPingD_nZ5pqgXxNkO_U9qVs1vbLEyCxUQGaV6wGdqaRQbXIzC50Tg--", "site_full": "www.unitedlounge.com", "site": "unitedlounge.com", "site_section": "https://www.unitedlounge.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=6", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Football - United Lounge", "title": "Champions League Last 16 draw", "title_full": "Champions League Last 16 draw - United Lounge", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4c93ee5debfb93aa5395b036945c23b520d87574", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTrVmkasVq0s_yZcxEX3pqagPingD_nZ5pqgXxNkO_U9qVs1vbLEyCxUQGaV6wGdqaRQbXIzC50Tg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dante", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Champions League Last 16 draw", "text": "No easy games, but that said, I'm glad we didn't get Bayern or Juve!\nFull draw:\nJuventus (ITA) v Tottenham (ENG)\nBasel (SUI) v Man.

Huge study putting 3-D scans to the test", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray \u2014 and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer.\nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year?\nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat \u2014 overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment.\nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms \u2014 known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" \u2014 with standard two-dimensional digital mammography.\nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers.\n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most.\nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices.\n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\"\nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM?\nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.)\nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40.\nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram.\nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening.\nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS?\nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles \u2014 not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer.\nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts.\nHOW TO DECIDE?\nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer.\nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image.\nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death \u2014 but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening \u2014 that overdiagnosis problem.\nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost.\nTHE NEW STUDY\nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year.\nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening.\n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens.\n___\nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

All opinions are my own. For many years, our daughter asked for a puppy. Now, not just any puppy. This was a very specific request. She wanted a tiny puppy that stayed small. A puppy that would be in the house. And a puppy that would be able to sleep with her. So we waited\u2026. Her first puppy request was when she was probably 6 or 7 but we wanted to make sure she was old enough to actually help care for this beloved dog. Well, about 3 years ago, an acquaintance of mine posted about their litter of purebred Yorkie pups. This included the one lone female that had yet a home to call her own. So I messaged her and asked some questions. Well, by the time my husband got in the house that night, the excitement was almost unbearable as the kids were all waiting on a yes from him to add this teeny, less than 1# pup, into our family. Because seriously, who could RESIST this cutie! Angel at 3 months old and weighing less than a pound! So What Do You Do? Get Her Printed On A Shoe! \nHere we are a couple years later and everyone loves our sweet Angel more than ever. And our daughter, who is now 12, is in heaven over the fact that she has her teeny pup. Now full grown, she weighs just 3 pounds. So what else can a mom do but surprise that daughter with her very own pair of customized sneakers featuring non other than Angel! Process \nFirst off, select what shoe size you need. They are available in Toddler size 10 all the way through Adult Women\u2019s size 10. Then select low top or high top. Finally, hit customize now and upload a photo as well as add any text. Review \nThe company then sends you a trial sneaker (to ensure the right fit) as well as a mock up of your design for approval. (They do send a pre-paid label to send the trial shoe back as well.) Once both of those are accepted, they print your sneakers and send them right to your door. The Shoes \nWhen our custom sneakers arrived, our daughter was super excited. She loved how they turned out! (They come with white laces in as well as an extra set of red.) And the hi-top converse style sneakers are popular right now and look great with everything. \nFinal Thoughts \nOverall, we are really happy with the process. The company worked really hard to stay in contact and keep me updated on our shoes as well as to make sure we were happy with the results. And the best part is that these shoes are quite affordable at just $34.99 for the low-top style and $39.99 for the high top style. So tell me, what would you put on your customized sneakers? \nBuy It: Head over to Amazon to learn more about these customized sneakers or visit the Gold Pigeon Shoes Website to see what else they have to offer.

Huge study putting 3-D scans to the test In this Nov. 21, 2017 photo provided by the Montefiore Health System, Dr. Tova Koenigsberg at The Montefiore Einstein Center for Cancer Care in New York shows an example of a traditional mammogram scan. U.S. health officials are beginning a huge study to compare traditional mammograms with 3-D versions, to see if the newer choice might really improve screening for breast cancer. (Montefiore Health System via AP) AP Tumblr \nWASHINGTON \u2014 A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray \u2014 and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt\u2019s the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat \u2014 overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms \u2014 known scientifically as \u201ctomosynthesis\u201d\u2014 with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\u201cBut the idea isn\u2019t so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\u201d said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt\u2019s one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\u201cThe most important thing about this study is that it\u2019s moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\u201d predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston\u2019s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\u201cWe are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\u201d \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles \u2014 not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they\u2019re not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they\u2019re often advertised as particularly useful for younger women\u2019s dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society\u2019s chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women\u2019s breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death \u2014 but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening \u2014 that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enrol healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They\u2019ll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don\u2019t have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman\u2019s results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\u201cMammography has been provocative over many decades. It\u2019s important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\u201d said McCaskill-Stevens. \n\u2014\u2014 \nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

France also has a contingent of soldiers at the base, which is crucial to the ongoing fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria and to the war in Afghanistan.\nMacron smiled and shook hands with the French and American soldiers who greeted him at the base before walking into a meeting with the base's top commanders.\nSpeaking to coalition soldiers, he said the next few months of battle will determine the outcome of the war against the IS group in Iraq in Syria.\n\"This military win does not signify the end of the operations and the end of our battle because first we need to stabilize and win peace in Iraq and Syria,\" he told troops. \"Next spring is decisive in the situation in Iraq.\"\nMacron also stressed in his remarks at the air base that France wants to avoid partition in Syria and \"avoid the domination of certain international elements whose interests contradict peace.\"\nThe French president later will hold talks with Qatar's ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.\nMacron is traveling with Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who in 2015 as defense minister helped negotiate a multibillion dollar deal with Qatar to buy 24 Rafale fighter jets. Qatar may announce during Macron's visit that it will purchase up to 12 more of the French-made Dassault Rafale jets.\nMacron's visit comes just days after a Gulf Cooperation Council meeting in Kuwait failed to bring the standoff any closer to a resolution in the dispute engulfing Qatar. In June, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut relations with Qatar over allegations it supports extremists and has too-close relations with Iran.\nQatar has long denied supporting extremists and shares a massive offshore natural gas field with Tehran.\nAlso likely to come up during Macron's visit is President Donald Trump's announcement that the U.S. recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim the city's eastern sector, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as the capital of a future independent state.\nBefore Macron's arrival, Qatar's ruler held calls with Trump, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Jordan's King Abdullah II and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Paul Leinwand and Matthias B\u00e4umler, in an article posted on Harvard Business Review, contend that very few executives follow through with detailed execution plans to make sure their organizations achieve their goals. \nMaking a significant change to an organization, such as launching a new product, requires significant resources. Most managers are wrapped up in their current day-to-day challenges, and it\u2019s easier for them to default to known issues than to tackle a huge unknown. Without focused attention and ongoing follow-up, either in meetings or through a project management system, new initiatives will struggle to get off the ground. Here are a few ways for leadership team members to address this issue. \nLeinwand and B\u00e4umler recommend taking a top-down approach to ensure success. For example, you might want to hold an off-site meeting for senior leadership members to discuss how they and their teams will shift resources to support new product development. Senior managers also need to review the current organizational structure and determine whether it will work in the context of undertaking a major new project. Should specific employees change their role in the organization to ensure success? Should resources be taken from an existing project to support the development or testing of the new product or service? \nCommitment to strategic changes must take place throughout the organization. Once your leadership team has structured the plan for execution, you can increase chances of success by soliciting input from the rest of the organization. One way to approach team members is through a survey. Ask them how they see themselves contributing to a proposed change. Then ask them if they want to be involved in a way that differs from their current role. This approach moves your organization\u2019s culture to where it should be \u2013 to one of inclusion and participation. Your employees should feel safe and valued when they offer feedback, whether it\u2019s positive or negative. \nIncluding the feedback of managers and employees can help you refine your strategy. These additional perspectives will allow you to articulate how your proposed product or service offers a unique angle. This vetting process will also encourage the development of a coherent launch and operating plan. \nThe marketplace is an unforgiving environment, so it\u2019s important to logically plan and execute your strategy properly the first time around.

In addition, researchers will study how the anti-bullying law is being implemented in the state of Maine to inform anti-bullying legislation that could affect educators, state and local agencies, legislators and students and families. \n\u201cThis valuable partnership will help to ensure that Maine\u2019s anti-bullying law is effective in promoting the safety of Maine\u2019s students,\u201d said Robert G. Hasson, Jr., Ed.D., Maine DOE Commissioner \nIn 2013, Maine passed a comprehensive anti-bullying law with new requirements for schools, including the implementation of a bullying incident-reporting system. Maine is one of only four states that require the state DOE to provide a model policy to schools. To maximize the effectiveness of this provision, Maine\u2019s DOE will grant researchers a unique opportunity to conduct surveys with school administrators and school counselors across the state to learn how schools are adopting the state\u2019s model policies and whether these implementation factors affect youth violence outcomes. \nTo understand both the challenges and the successes in bullying prevention, researchers want to hear the viewpoints of all types of school districts and staff with various levels of experience. Six schools representing rural and urban communities in Maine have been selected to participate in this opportunity. Confidential interviews will take place with a superintendent, principal and school counselor in charge of anti-bullying activities at each school (a total of 18 interviews). The information that the selected school leaders and staff share in the study will help identify supports needed for all schools. \nThe study group will use the results of the conversations, which will be kept confidential, to form an online survey that will be administered to all Maine schools in the spring of 2018 and the spring of 2019. Results will also be summarized in a research report that will be available to the public. \nFor more information contact Rachel Paling, Maine DOE Director of Communications at Rachel.paling@maine.gov or (207) 624-6747.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert g. hasson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rachel paling", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "maine doe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of iowa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maine department of education", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of minnesota\u2019s school of public health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "temple university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maine center for disease control", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maine doe director of communications", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "maine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:46.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5dcc8e154b05727d9dd883572def51d7fbe2b2fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRwevY2qTeI9usEivFKteZ7yUsrMfbP_zLHOZC20TUFKo6bchX.XALo2eUW1T4l75RJYE3GdHYKbmfXdECAvt3ihCM2KWx2YHZyZyuzCpGRYqKKBI3C.3G_xIzRZohL2Al1J15A..dVWn8NyEgivHzV", "site_full": "forum.cdrinfo.pl", "site": "cdrinfo.pl", "site_section": "https://forum.cdrinfo.pl/f107/", "site_categories": ["home_video_dvd", "tech"], "section_title": "Nap\u0119dy optyczne Blu-ray, Ultra HD Blu-ray, HD DVD - Forum CDRinfo.pl", "title": "[ARTYKU\u0141] Pioneer BDR-211-S11 Ultra HD Blu-ray- recenzja nagrywarek BluRay - Strona 2", "title_full": "[ARTYKU\u0141] Pioneer BDR-211-S11 Ultra HD Blu-ray- recenzja nagrywarek BluRay - Strona 2 - Forum CDRinfo.pl", "published": "2017-12-03T11:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "PL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9155f898c6f7b7781b12bc4a1a0236dbc67a5888", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRwevY2qTeI9usEivFKteZ7yUsrMfbP_zLHOZC20TUFKo6bchX.XALo2eUW1T4l75RJYE3GdHYKbmfXdECAvt3ihCM2KWx2YHZyZyuzCpGRYqKKBI3C.3G_xIzRZohL2Al1J15A..dVWpotyAX.cavcSsmODog9O2InJqBrRJYWfw--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "czary2mary", "published": "2017-12-06T02:23:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Philips 4x Mini DVD-R MID: CMC MAG.

Written By Shikha Kohli Mumbai Updated: December 7, 2017 02:35 pm 84491 reads 0 comments Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u2019s engagement was announced recently and they will get married in May next year. Their engagement has been the talk-of-the-town ever since the couple made their first public appearance at the Invictus Games walking hand-in-hand. The official announcement was made by Harry's father and The Prince of Wales Prince Charles. Following the news of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's engagement, it was expected that people will draw fashion inspiration and observe the style of the soon-to-be royalty very closely. The ability to have a strong effect on consumers buying choice is not new to the royal family. A report by \"The News Week\" suggested that Meghan's soon-to-be sister in law Kate Midleton's the \" Kate Effect\" contributed up to \u00a31 billion to the UK fashion industry each year. This success story of \"The Kate effect\" applies to our very own Indian designer Anita Dongre aswell. During her royal tour to India Kate was seen wearing a printed Anita Dongre dress. Owing to the fact that Kate was seen wearing this dress, Anita Dongre's factory was temporarily forced to stop their production only to meet the demand of that dress. Kate Middleton in Anita Dongre on her Royal Tour to India and Bhutan But what is shocking is that every single piece that Meghan is spotted wearing is immediately sold out. People in the fashion world are calling it \"The Meghan Effect\", here are a few instances that prove that \"The Meghan Effect\" is stronger than ever. 1. The tortoiseshell 'Percy' sunglasses by Finlay & Co When Meghan marked her first public appearance with Prince Harry in September at the Invictus Games, she wore a pair of tortoiseshell 'Percy' sunglasses by Finlay & Co. She was seen wearing those sunnies again when she was spotted shopping in London. After Meghan was seen wearing the sunglasses twice, the brand revealed that sales have since increased by a whopping 1,000 percent.

Meghan Markle's engagement winter-white coat When Meghan stepped out in a white winter coat for a photo-call post her engagement announcement, she was seen dressed in a white wool wrap coat from Canadian brand \"LINE\". Of course, the fans of the Royal family went gaga over the coat and soon after the images were released the brand's website to crashed due to the overwhelming demand for the coat. The coat is now renamed as the \"The Meghan Coat\" by the brand and was sold out within minutes. The Meghan coat will now be restocked in February.

Meghan Markle's Strathberry Handbag After the sunglasses and white tote set the world of fashion and internet on fire, the next fashion item that garnered a lot of attention was her handbag. Meghan teamed her navy coat from Canadian brand Mackage with a bag from Edinburgh-based label Strathberry for her first royal walkabout in Nottingham. Reports suggest that the \u00a3495.00 \"Strathberry Midi Tote - Tri Colour Burgundy/Navy/Vanilla\" was sold out in 11 minutes.

Quick-service restaurants need to commit to new marketing channels that align with consumer behaviors. \n\u201cFood court patrons spend time outside of the mall, yet most brands do nothing to engage with them beyond the four walls. Attracting these guests for an additional visit, and staying top of mind for next time would do wonders to increase traffic.\u201d \nLocal restaurants could consider expanding in mall food courts. And the ones already there should re-think how they appeal to Frequent Mall Shoppers. They\u2019re like the \u201cregulars\u201d that fine dining establishments rely on. The new AudienceSCAN survey revealed 8% of Americans shop at retail stores, a mall or shopping center three to four times per week! And another 4.3% shop five or more times a week! \nHere are three avenues Joseph Szala recommends to take the reigns on realizing success in the highly competitive mall food court space: \nSocialize like a human. \n\u201cQuick-service brands have to start acting like a human on social to get traction. Interact and engage with people\u2019s posts. Offer something fun and unexpected to the narrative. Post things for the fans, not just the brand. And, yes, once you\u2019ve built a rapport, you can post a deal or promo. At least now, it will be coming from a friend.\u201d \nFood-court restaurants can court Frequent Mall Shoppers through Facebook and YouTube. The new AudienceSCAN data showed 82% of Frequent Mall Shoppers are on Facebook and 60% are active on YouTube. \nBuild loyalty through rewards. \n\u201cBring loyalty and rewards to them where they spend the most time: on their phones. Consumers aren\u2019t just looking for a new way to order, which is what most brands push from the start. That should come later down the consumer journey. What they want is a way to collect points and engage with brands on a deeper level; a level frequent buyers deserve.\u201d \nLet customers know their favorite restaurants are in the mall via the phone! The new AudienceSCAN research reports 52% of Frequent Mall Shoppers took action after getting mobile smartphone app ads or text message ads in the past month. \nBring the food to them. \n\u201cBrands inside the food court are positioned well to leverage the power of third party delivery. With some simple number crunching and product mix evaluation, a quick-service restaurant can open a new line of revenue that extends the brand outside the mall. By utilizing new technology that aligns with consumer behaviors, mall food court quick-service restaurant can take a more proactive approach to thriving and succeeding in this space.\u201d \nFrequent Mall Shoppers are ordering food from their phones anyway, so they might as well be getting it from the mall! The new AudienceSCAN survey showed 31% ordered food from mobile devices in the past six months. \nAudienceSCAN data is available as part of a subscription to AdMall for Agencies , or with the SalesFuel API .
