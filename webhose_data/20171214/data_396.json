Reviews of the Roseanne Therapy Jackie goes to therapy and Roseanne comes with her to one session to help her because Jackie feels Roseanne is too judgemental and forces things on her. Darlene has some problems in school which result in her being beaten up.The therapy was pretty funny. I kind of agree with Roseanne, if she sees a mistake she wants to prevent it before she has to help solve the aftermath. But still she is invasive which was the fun part.I also liked the tattoo thing, they actually don't hurt and I don't believe that Dan wouldn't handle the whole Roseanne's name on his arm, but it was funny he made her Rose to shorten it.

The Expedia page informed me during booking that there were renovations. It specifically said the \"dining venue\" was under renovations. Having stayed here before, I know that the dining area is at the back of the hotel on the ground floor. This hotel is under major renovations spanning the entire area of the main floor, and several floors up. I booked the hotel knowing that I would arrive very late, but be able to sleep in and head to my flight after a good sleep. No such luck. First thing this morning, hammering and power saws started. My room was on the other end of the hotel from the dinning area, and on the 7th floor. It sounded like the workers were in a room very close, possibly directly underneath my room. When I mentioned to the front desk that I would have never stayed here and spent such a large amount of money, if I had been told this was going on, she assured me that it was all explained during booking. I showed her the Expedia page and she was very surprised, but unapologetic. She did however mutter something about needing to get that changed. This has always been a good hotel, and will be again, but this was a terrible experience, and I feel that nobody at the hotel seamed to care.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 2.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:01.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "47ddb5f23ffd4711b9cda659c89ac9a83f49a5ad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgznOMcFi_gU9oFD4tmcxnun.jWCMekg6CoSoOfe5cwe_DGIki7NyPuZ", "site_full": "forum.tz-uk.com", "site": "tz-uk.com", "site_section": "http://forum.tz-uk.com/forumdisplay.php?4", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "scuba_diving", "sports", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "painting"], "section_title": "TZ-Forums", "title": "What HAQ do people have?", "title_full": "What HAQ do people have?", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 29, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 60941, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f55857703f0cdcafe67b79bcd195f743beef22cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgznOMcFi_gU9oFD4tmcxnun.jWCMekg6CoSoOfe5cwe_KUIrBCv0aAEgi1NJLE44KQ-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "mycroft", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : Are the Bulovas in this thread actually High ACCURACY Quartz?

Reviews of the Gunsmoke Old Man In this episode we get another nice story where an old man is convicted of a murder that he did not commit. And only by chance does Marshal Dillon find the man that set all this in motion.The episode begins when two cowpokes met up on trail outside Dodge. Joe Silva and Harve Litton stop at the same creek to refresh. Litton tries to steal Silva's horse but while riding away his horse is spooked by a snake and Silva beats the heck out of Litton for the horse.In another part of the prairie, a man named Danny Adams comes up on an old man that is sick with fever. He nurses the old man back to health and the two ride into Dodge. While inside Dodge, Danny and the old man run into Joe Silva that has some type of disdain for the old man. The old man tells Silva that he better watch out cause he is going to get him. Danny gets the old man and they go to the Lady Gay to drink.Meanwhile Litton has made his way to Dodge and sees Silva (the one that beat him up). So he sneaks into his room and stabs Silva to death. Litton then goes gets the passed-out old man and throws him in the room and puts the knife in his hand. The next morning the hotel manager calls Marshal Dillon to the room and shows him the scene. Silva did not even have time to remove his hat before he was stabbed.Judge Brookins finds the old man guilty of murder and sentences him to hang. Matt along with Danny, will take the old man to Hays City for the sentence to be carried out. After returning from the hanging, someone makes a terrible mistake. They reveal something about the murder that no one else could have knew. That is when they find out that they hung the wrong man.A very nice story that was full of interest the entire time. The only drawback to the episode was the writer made the old man to snarly. It appears they wanted the viewers to really like the old man but the lines they gave him to read were sometime rough and unfriendly. I am not sure if it was the actor or the lines but it did not play well for the viewers to get behind this old man-- that is until near the hanging.

While his mother is away, he has to stay with his grandparents. Thus, he starts learning new things about his missing father. Reviews of the Sandcastle Although it made waves at the Critics' Week in Cannes, Sandcastle receives only a splash from me. But it is an encouraging one, a playful slap on the water, rather than a reaction of so-so-ness. Singaporean director Boo Junfeng's first feature film is a promising debut, a composed effort that with good word-of-mouth would attract a fair share of viewers. The film, while not autobiographical, has a story that is loosely based on Boo's life experiences. It is part family drama, part rooted in Singapore history, and is quite an excellent take on the Singaporean culture.Sandcastle explores the relationship between the older and younger generation of Singaporeans through the lives of one particular family. Boo focuses on the lead character, En (Joshua Tan), who plays a typical 18-year old teenager, who while waiting to enlist for National Service discovers the secret past of his late father through his grandparents \u0096 his grandfather's old videos and photo negatives kept in a box, and the remnants of past memory from his Alzheimer-ravaged grandmother.Boo's film opens with a reel of archival footage documenting briefly on the fervent political scene in the fifties, where passion drove many of the Chinese \"protesters\" to stage rallies against unpopular government policies. This is set to a Mandarin choir rendition of a poignant Singaporean song, Home, immediately creating a \"patriotic shared memory\" of the past by those who may or may not have been around during that tumultuous chapter of Singapore history.Boo stressed in a dialogue session that his film is not meant to be political and should be read as a social study of that \"patriotic shared memory\" that continues to bind Singaporeans across all generations together. However, I feel that his film is an observation (or even an indirect criticism) of the state of Singaporeans' perception of their political role in society. Where has that fervor gone to? Has it just simply dissipated over a generation? Are we happy to lose our voice just because things are going so well for us?Sandcastle is slow-moving, almost poetic in its visual style with shots of a moving ship passing through the harbor, and still shots depicting the serenity of urban dwelling. Boo's film is consistently melancholic in tone, which is a plus point for me, because it creates a quiet feel of sadness for the nostalgia of the past. The characters, however, are not quite fleshed out to their fullest, resulting in only a slight emotional attachment to them. The acting is also only above average in that respect.Sandcastle is a half-decent film that impresses only to a certain extent. It is never a landmark of contemporary Singaporean cinema. But Boo shows that he has the potential to elevate his game, to probe at issues of our society through his personal stories. If he sticks to this direction and slowly improves on the quality of his output, he will be one to look out for, and also one to be remembered in decades to come.SCORE: 7/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!

On 1 December, Minsk made public an agreement with Russia to supply a joint regional group of Belarusian and Russian troops. In return, Russia\u2019s Defence Ministry has committed to providing Belarus with necessary equipment and arms in times of \u201cincreasing military threat to the Union state [ of Belarus and Russia ] and in times of war.\u201d Meanwhile, the weapons and training Minsk gives its army show little in common with how Moscow develops its military. The Belarusian government is making its army ever smaller and getting rid of most of its expensive, heavy weapons necessary for all out offensive operations . Increasing rearmament Minsk usually buys major arms systems from Russia. This year, Belarusian defence ministry official media reported that Belarus had received six Mi -8M TV -5 helicopters and a division of Tor -M2 surface -to-air missile systems from Russia . L ess costly\u2014yet still important\u2014purchases from Russia include t he 2017- produced RPO-A Shmel, an infantry flamethrower that the Belarusian army already uses, and its modernised version, the Shmel \u2013 M, bought for the first time. Minsk has also signed contracts on purchasing 12 Su -30 SM aircraft and some Protivnik \u2013 GE radars from Russia. National arms industries are supplying the Belarusian army more and more equipment, too. A key new piece of equipment is the Palanez, Belarusian multiple -launch rocket system. At the end of October, an improved version, the Palanez \u2013 M, was successfully tested at a distance of more than 300km for the first time. The Belarusian military is also planning to continue purchases of communication, navigation, and surveillance means, armoured vehicles, small firearms and body armour. Some of this equipment will be from Belarus\u2019s defence industries ( see Table one below ). Minsk also plans to buy over 50 drones, which are mostly Belarus \u2013 manufactured, and to continue modernisation of T- 72 B tanks. Source of data in the table: MoD official statements & Belorusskaya voennaya gazeta in 2014-2017. The picture of modernisation looks, however, contradictory. Speaking to reporters on 28 November, Deputy Defence Minist er for Armaments Siarhei Simanenka said as many as four T \u2013 72B, 30 GAZ -66 military trucks , and some other old Soviet era eq uipment had been successfully modernised. However, the refitting of military truck models from the 1960s, which had already proved highly vulnerable during the Soviet war in Afghanistan, raises questions about the rationality of such modernisation. The situation concerning Belarus\u2019s heavy weapons is another story. Minsk is clearly not replacing most of its heavier, Soviet -inherited weapons. It decommisions them for further sales, like Su-2 7 heavy fighter jets or Su-24 bombers, or it simply does nothing about them as they grow older, like T- 7 2 tanks. It is highly likely that the government is going to build a new army, which will not deploy these older heavy weapons. Indeed, i n an article published on 3 November in Belarus Segodnya , the main Belarusian government daily, hinted at exactly such vision by declaring, \u201c The main aim for the period until 2020 is to construct a compact, mobile, well- trained and well-equipped army.\u201d In plain words, an army with only a minimum of heavy weapons. Special forces model for Belarusian army of the future Belarusian Special Operations Forces (SOF) Commander Vadzim Dzyanisenka spoke with Belorusskaya voennaya gazeta , a military industry newspaper, on 21 November and presented the Belarusian military leadership\u2019s vision of contemporary armed conflicts. Dzyanisenka emphasised that the role of SOF was growing rapidly. He said that without these forces \u201cit is not possible to solve the tasks related to ensuring national security.\u201d Dzyanisenka described these forces as \u201cmobile, agile and not burdened with heavy weapons .\u201d Vadzim Dzyanisenka, SOF Commander. Image: CTV.by That is the direction in which Minsk is developing its military. The SOF seem to be serving as the model for the future national army . The special operations forces were established in the early 2000s and, a ccording to Dzyanisenka, the ir composition and the scope of their responsibilities remain unchanged . SOF units have became a priority for the government and, therefore, they receive more new equipment than many other parts of the army. This year, the SOF received a trove of new equipment: Kaiman and Volat V-1 armoured vehicles designed and manufactured in Belarus, Chinese-made CS/VN3 Dragon armoured vehicles, the Belarusian-modernised BTR-70MB1 armoured personnel carrier, Russian-made P \u2013 7 parachute platforms for cargo, and Russian-made NONA M-1 120mm mortar. On the one hand, this list of new equipment for the SOF is larger than for any other part of the Belarusian armed forces, excluding air defence. In short, Minsk sees the SOF as its highest priority. On the other hand, it lends credence to the idea that Minsk wishes to build a smaller, yet more efficient fighting force, which can deal with Donbas- or Kosovo-like conflicts, but harbours no ambition of fighting a major war, say, with NATO. The President \u2018s new arms? Minsk has little money and it has always tried to get funding for its military from Russia. Speculation about secret deals between Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenka and the Kremlin abound. And for good reason, too, as the case of a recently published agreement with Russia shows. The agreement concerns supplying a joint regional group of Belarusian and Russian troops. Minsk and Moscow signed the agreement on 2 November 2016 and it entered force on 14 November. Belarusian citizens learned about the document only post factum , last Friday. Image: vsr.mil.by However, the terrible secret of that agreement turns out to be banal. The Kremlin essentially made clear that Minsk would only get free arms from Moscow in the case of full out war. Therefore, the Belarusian government\u2019s attempts to arm itself without bearing too much of financial burden seem to have failed. Indeed, the appearance of such an agreement should be no surprise, because the Kremlin for some years has already stopped supplying its post- Soviet allies through CSTO mechanisms . Inhibited by the Kremlin\u2019s staunch refusals to provide Belarus with heavy weapons, the Belarusian government adapted its policies. Minsk is now silently building a new army better suited to its limited needs and financial constraints. It is letting its Soviet- era, heavier arms be silently discarded without replacement\u2014 a huge fleet of T \u2013 72 tanks that have been neither modernised nor replaced provides an illustration. Simplification of existing army structures automatically follows, which also means a reduction of offensive capacities. all articles \u00bb Tags If you thought this page is useful to your friend, use this form to send.

The upbeat summary is a remarkable surprise. On 15 November, Belarusian Foreign Minister Uladzimir Makey announced his country\u2019s willingness to dispatch peacekeeping forces to Eastern Ukraine. In addition, for the first time, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov voiced Russia\u2019s support for the deployment of Belarusian peacekeepers, which Minsk has repeatedly proposed since 2014 . Thus, Belarus appears to be on its way to secure the support of key international players for an active role in defusing the Ukrainian crisis. The deployment of peacekeepers in Eastern Ukraine offers Belarus a chance to raise its international status. Minsk finally accepted as a peacekeeper? Minsk has sought to play a peacemaking role in the Ukraine crisis for years now. A new window of opportunity emerged on 5 September when Russian President Vladimir Putin called for the deployment of UN peacekeeping forces in Eastern Ukraine. On 9 November, The Wall Street Journal reported that the US government\u2014it did not specify what part\u2014suggested the deployment of 20,000 peacekeepers in Eastern Ukraine because it believed Putin might be interested in ending the conflict. The Belarusian government is undoubtedly involved in horse trading over the Donbass region, home to Ukraine\u2019s two separatist \u201crepublics.\u201d On 17 October, President Lukashenka met with the director of Russia\u2019s Foreign intelligence service ( SVR), Sergei Naryshkin. Without any direct mention of Ukraine, official sources say their meeting dealt with the \u201ccoordination of activities and adjustment of directions of joint work aimed at protecting national interests.\u201d These are serious grounds to assume that Lukashenka and Naryshkin discussed Ukraine. Indeed, as early as in October 2014, at the very beginning of the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, Lukashenka offered to send Belarusian peacekeepers to the Donbass region. Belarusian officials have continued to cautiously articulate the idea to no avail. As recently as October, the Kremlin still did not support the deployment of Belarusian peacekeepers to Ukraine. Ukrainian reaction \u0424\u043e\u0442\u0430: Sputnik \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u044c. Certainly, the position of the most important party to the conflict\u2014 Ukraine itself\u2014 is unclear. First, Kommersant , a Russian daily newspaper, on 15 November quoted a source within the Ukrainian administration saying Kyiv would prefer Polish and Lithuanian peacekeepers. The same source continued to say that Russia would hardly welcome such an option. As a compromise, Kyiv might instead agree to Belarusian and Kazakh peacekeepers . Second, re lations between Minsk and Kyiv are improving but not ideal. On 1 5 November, Ukrainian Parliament First Deputy Chairwoman Iryna Herashchenko accused Belarus of \u201cstabbing Ukraine in the back for the second time\u201d after it had voted in the UN General Assembly against a Ukranian \u2013 sponsored resolution on human rights violations in Crimea. The first time was exactly a year earlier in 2016 when Belarusian representatives voted against a UN resolution on investigating human rights abuses in the Ukrainian city of Sevastopol. \u201c Voting by the Belarusian delegation contradicts loud statements about its neutrality,\u201d Herashchenko said. Minsk, however, insists that it always votes in the UN against \u201ccountry resolutions.\u201d Ukrainian radical politicians have attacked the idea of Belarusians helping to restore peace in Eastern Ukraine. On 16 November, a prominent member of the Ukranian parliament, Ihor Mosiychuk, said that Belarusian peacekeepers could become a \u201cTroyan horse.\u201d It would be Russian occupation forces disguised as Belarusians entering the Donbass region. Mosiychuk, who represents a major right-wing radical party, said, \u201cBelarus has behaved not as a neutral state, but as a satellite of the aggressor country, the Russian Federation.\u201d For proof, he cited recent Belarusian voting at the UN, the joint \u201cWest\u201d 2017 military exercises with Russia , and \u201c the kidnapping by the [Russian] FSB of a Ukrainian political prisoner , Igor Grib, from Belarusian territory.\u201d Another well \u2013 known r epresentative of another Ukrainian right-wing party, Ihor Miroshnychenko, on 16 November said Belarus was an \u201c enemy territory ,\u201d which has \u201ccommon military interests \u201d with Russia. \u0427\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0446\u044b \u0431\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0433\u0430 \u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430, \u0448\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0430\u044e\u044e\u0446\u044c \u0443 \u0441\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0437\u0435 \u045e\u0437\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0456\u043b \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0456\u043d\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u0414\u0430\u043d\u0431\u0430\u0441\u0435. \u0424\u043e\u0442\u0430: YouTube He also urged Ukrainian diplomats to do everything to remove Belarus from the sphere of Russian influence. \u201cDiplomats [will work to distance Belarus from Russian influence] at their level using various methods. However, we should clearly realise\u2014 and I am talking now sincerely and seriously\u2014 that we cannot achieve this without forming serious subversion and intelligence groups, and carrying out subversive acts on the territory of Belarus and Russia, including within cyber space.\u201d It would be somewhat self-defeating if Ukraine did, indeed, pursue such a disruptive policy. Belarus already persecutes citizens who support separatists in Eastern Ukraine. As recently as 16 November, a court in the southern Belarusian city of Rechytsa sentenced another Belarusian, Vitali Mitrafanau, on grounds of fighting for the self \u2013 proclaimed Donetsk People\u2019s Republic in Eastern Ukraine. He had been detained by police in July. In September, a Vitebsk court in the north of Belarus convicted a Belarusian for the very same reason. The former was sentenced to two years of hard labour, the latter for two years of restricted freedoms. Many Ukrainian politicians speculate on Belarus\u2019s role in the conflict. However, they often ignore the special circumstances that limit Belarus from taking a definite position. All the same, the Ukrainian government and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko so far have demonstrated a willingness to accept Minsk as a partner . However, powerful forces in and outside Ukraine work to sabotage Belarusian participation in the peace process. In addition to the calls of radical parliamentarians quoted above, other odd incidents occur regularly, which threaten to derail bilateral relations. On 25 October, for example, Minsk detained a Ukrainian citizen, Pavel Sharoiko, for espionage. Sharoiko is officially a journalist. However, until 2009 he openly served with Ukrainian military intelligence . Belarusian authorities have tried to downplay the incident, keeping quiet on the issue until Ukrainian activists on 17 November revealed the story, which is now generating tensions between Minsk and Kyiv. Minsk has Ukraine\u2019s best interests in mind Despite Russia\u2019s hesitancy and Ukraine\u2019s concerns, Minsk has shown its primary interest to bring it to an end the conflict in Eastern Ukraine. Indeed, Minsk has ignored other opportunities for joint military operations with the Kremlin. For instance, in recent years, international media have speculated on Belarus\u2019s participation, together with other member states of Russia- dominated Collective Security Treaty Organisation ( CSTO), in ensuring peace in Syria. However, that scenario has never materialised. On 27 October, the Belarusian Foreign Ministry announced there are no plans to discuss the sending of CSTO member state troops on a peacekeeping mission to Syria. Belarusian airborne troops. Image: Vayar news agency. In the 1990s, Russia also tried to convince Minsk to send Belarusian airborne troops as peacekeepers to Transnistria. Belarus did no such thing. Its participation in peacekeeping operations has so far been limited to deploying a symbolic number of Belarusian military personnel as part of UN operations, in particular in Lebanon. Indeed, this is in stark contrast to many of Belarus\u2019s neighbours, all of whom have participated in one international operation abroad or another. Since 2014, the Belarusian government\u2019s offer of peacekeeping services to Ukraine has to do with the transformation of Belarus and its neighbourhood. Minsk wishes to find a new, international niche for itself through engaging in conflict resolutions. A central goal is to break out from the tired \u201clast European dictatorship\u201d epithet.   volatility of the region has pushed Belarus along this course of action. Russian support is uncertain and increasingly limited. Thus, the Belarusian government has tried both to defuse at least some tensions around Ukraine and to gain more international respect. Until now, Minsk\u2019s efforts to become more neutral have appeared problematic. Moscow, in general, has never appreciated these attempts. The West has been unsure of Belarusian claims of neutrality. However, if Belarus does deploy peacekeepers, then arguably Russia, the West and other neighbouring states would, in effect, be validating Belarus\u2019s right not to choose sides. https://belarusdigest.com/story/cartoon-fields/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexander lukashenka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaiman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uladzimir makey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lukashenka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herashchenko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iryna herashchenko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharoiko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ihor mosiychuk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dzyanisenka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naryshkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mosiychuk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vadzim dzyanisenka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sergei naryshkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siarhei simanenka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "petro poroshenko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sergei lavrov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ihor miroshnychenko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pavel sharoiko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sigmar gabriel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "igor grib", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vitali mitrafanau", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "siarhei bohdan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defence ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "friend email siarhei bohdan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kommersant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sof", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "svr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un general assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "collective security treaty organisation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belarusian special operations forces", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fsb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "csto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament first", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belarusian foreign ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kremlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ge", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "minsk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vitebsk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belarus segodnya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russian federation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crimea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palanez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukraine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belarus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donbass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "transnistria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lebanon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dzyanisenka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belorusskaya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sevastopol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rechytsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kremlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donetsk people\u2019s republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eastern ukraine", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:01.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b64c433d0afcf9d68a6f620582668776118c502c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT.JzkJu_t78zmWOpzDvXSK2uWOeDggAq_2V0cJC.sLcFNxHcW8J4.mNn7NzdjXiVW2zyMZ8aX0jQ--", "site_full": "play.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://play.google.com/store", "site_categories": ["media", "hobbies_and_interests", "comic_books"], "section_title": "Android Apps on Google Play", "title": "WhatsApp Messenger", "title_full": "WhatsApp Messenger -

The Greco-Persian War has given us some of the most iconic moments in history such as Leonidas and the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae, the Marathon Run and a huge legacy today in politics and many other areas. However, other than the 3 days of the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae, the remainder of the 49 year war between Persia and Greece has been almost completely overlooked, and has never appeared in a documentary. It covers the full story from the Ionian Revolt (497BC) to the Peace of Callias (449BC) also known as the Peace of Kimon, and includes a detailed introduction, the birth of Democracy and the aftermath and the legacy of the period. Reviews of the The First War for Western Civilization Horrible, just horrifically awful. If the number scale about could have went negative numbers, I would have chose them. Worst acting I have ever seen on anything. Costumes and props made from cardboard and a budget that seemed to consist of loose change found in couch cushions.

Victoria captioned the pictures: \u201cMe being cute vs. me being cute.\u201d The attack she got on social media forced her to issue a statement defending herself. \nIn the statement, she revealed how she cried over the vile comments she received for the photos but claimed that she is strong irrespective of what happened. \n\u201cRecently it seems like so many people have something to say about the way I look with or without make or about the fact that I don\u2019t post pictures without makeup. \n\u201cAccounts have been posting pictures of me with makeup versus no makeup telling me I\u2019m a catfish and that I\u2019m hideous. \n\u201cPeople in the comments telling me to kill my self because I\u2019m lying about my looks. \n\u201cTelling me that no one will love me because I\u2019m so ugly and have to wear makeup to cover my \u201creal face\u201d. \n\u2018And as this has happened I learned what people say about you has so much more to do with them as a person than it does you as an individual. \u201cFirst I want to clarify: I love the way I look in makeup and out of makeup. \n\u201cI don\u2019t wear makeup to hide or to \u201ccatfish\u201d people because I don\u2019t give a sh** what any guy or girl has to say about how I look. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to lie it gets to me, some comments are so vile they make me cry but I always remind myself that I\u2019m more than my looks.\u201d \nShe later issued a heartfelt statement on Instagram, saying she had been forced to do so because she was \u201ctired of trying to explain herself in the comments\u201d. \nShe wrote: \u201cI\u2019ve been sitting here trying to debate whether or not to disable comments on my last post and I realized there is no point. \u201cPeople who want to say something are going to say something. \n\u201cSo many people are saying that my foundation doesn\u2019t match and that I\u2019m trying to appear light skin but if you look at my chest it does. \u201cMy face matches my chest and you can tell there is no foundation there because I have acne scars. \n\u201cAnd if you look at my recent pictures you\u2019ll see my face matches my body there as well. \u201cFor those of you who are uneducated, you are supposed to match your foundation shade to your body and not your face. \n\u201cDifferent lighting affects how light/dark complexions appear and a lot of people don\u2019t seem to understand that.

I spoke to Jetstar today and the plan is to sit tight. If the airline cancel at the last minute, we will have an opportunity to fly elsewhere. For us Perth people, that will probably be Singapore. If the DPS airport is still open, we will get a flight from Singapore to Bali. If the airport is closed, we plan to fly to Surabaya instead and make our way overland to Bali. My advice would be to bring a box of FFP2 face masks (for you and to give away) and bring some goggles. Obviously, stay away from the volcano area, but but the Balinese need our support. If we are not in imminent danger, then we are still going. If we are stuck up there, we do have insurance cover, but we are also taking extra $$, will probably move to a $20 per night (with breakfast x 2 PAX) Homestay (which is cheaper than what we can live at home for) and will not need to rush back for anything. If you can do this, no need to cancel. If you can't do this, go elsewhere. Flying home with Garuda, which won't have the same issues as Jetstar.

Congressman Ted Yoho, who chaired the hearing, supported the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2017 which proposes to deny US visas to Chinese government officials involved in restricting access to Tibet. \nAlleging that human rights and personal freedoms in Tibet were \u201calready in a poor and worsening state\u201d, Yoho said the government of China engages in \u201csevere repression\u201d of Tibet\u2019s unique religious, cultural and linguistic heritage by and \u201cstrictly curtailing\u201d the civil rights of the Tibetan population, including the freedom of speech, religion, association, assembly and movement. \nThe authorities have used \u201cheavy-handed and violent tactics\u201d to maintain control in Tibet, especially in response to unrest, including \u201cextra-judicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, extra-judicial detentions and house arrest\u201d, he said, he said. \n\u201cTibet remains extremely isolated. The flow of information in and out of Tibet is tightly restricted. Tibetans are prevented from obtaining passports and moving freely, and foreigners, especially journalists and officials are frequently denied access,\u201d he said. \nCongressman Brad Sherman demanded that Congress must act quickly to counter China\u2019s \u201crepressive tactics and policies\u201d toward Tibet. \u201cThis is important for our own standing as leaders in world human rights,\u201d he said, as he praised India for accommodating Tibetan refugees. \n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to build a strategic relationship and partnership with India, and we\u2019ve got to commend India for providing refuge to over 90,000 Tibetans, including the Dalai Lama himself, who have had to flee Chinese repression,\u201d he said. \nAccording to Congressman Steve Chabot, China\u2019s \u201cdecades-long oppression of Tibet is a constant example of its total disregard for religious freedom and human decency\u201d. \u201cJust this past weekend, another Tibetan monk set himself on fire to protest China\u2019s ongoing tyranny. China has systematically marginalised Tibet for over 50 years now,\u201d he said. \nAmerica\u2019s own national security interests dictate that it oppose China\u2019s \u201cincreasingly repressive policies\u201d on Tibet and that the US work toward a negotiated solution and start making the treatment of the people of Tibet an important factor in our relations with Beijing, asserted Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. \nCongressman Jim McGovern, author of the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2017, said the Dalai Lama can play a constructive role in negotiating a better future for the Tibetan people, but China \u201cclearly doesn\u2019t see it that way\u201d. \u201cChina is waiting him out and counting on his eventual departure to remove Tibet from the international agenda, so we need to move now, and we need some leverage, and that is why earlier this year, along with a bipartisan group of members, I introduce HR1872, the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIf China wants its citizens and officials to travel freely in the United States, Americans must be able to travel freely in China, including Tibet. \u201cBut allowing travel to Tibet is only one step China needs to take, and there are others. Most especially, China should permit His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, to return to Tibet for a visit if he so desires,\u201d McGovern said. \nGere told lawmakers that reciprocity is an important principle in diplomatic relations that should be implemented not only when it comes to trade, but also to freedom of movement and freedom of information. \u201cIf they (Chinese) want to be the superpower they claim to be and the world leader they claim to be, these norms are to be followed,\u201d he said. \nGere said another important part of the Tibet Policy Act was to encourage the negotiations between the Dalai Lama and his representatives and the Chinese government. \u201cWe have not done that recently, and this needs to be the forefront of what our policy is with China. It\u2019s not unreasonable, and it\u2019s actually good for China. To resolve this Tibetan issue is good for everyone, especially the Chinese,\u201d he said.

But the fact it is just the 14th event on the schedule shows what a tough year it has been for players like Pretswell Asher who are trying to make a living on the LET.\n\nFive tournaments went by the wayside this year, leading to the departure of the circuit\u2019s CEO, Ivan Khodabakhsh, in August. \n\nDuring the Solheim Cup in Des Moines, LPGA commissioner Mike Whan revealed that he had instigated talks with Keith Pelley, chief executive of the men\u2019s European Tour, to see what could be done to help the LET. However, it emerged recently that the LET has declined the offer of assistance for the time being after being encouraged by the potential for a healthier 2018 schedule. \u201cNo chance,\u201d replied Pretswell Asher, who was on the LET committee before resigning earlier this year, to being asked if there was a possibility of as many as 24 events being on that list, which is expected to be unveiled at this week\u2019s event in the UAE.\n\u201cI think you\u2019d be looking at 18 events next year and, for me, that would probably be a good schedule. \u201cI think there is genuine interest, but whether that can be put in place for 2018, who knows. Even getting a couple back would be a start. But I think it will be 2019 before we really see a difference, so patience is the key.\u201d \n\nSpeaking at an Aberdeen Standard Investments golf clinic in Edinburgh, the Scot added: \u201cFor me, the sad thing is that talent on the LET at the moment is the strongest it has been in the last five years. That\u2019s the thing that frustrates me the most. \u201cWe have so many good players but they don\u2019t have anywhere to play and don\u2019t have to go to America if you don\u2019t want to. But, at the moment, the only option is to go to the States. Georgia Hall, for instance, has to be there to progress her game after doing remarkably well to get into the Solheim Cup team this year from so few starts on the LET.\u201d \n\nPretswell Asher has been the leading Scot on the circuit for the past two years but heads into this week\u2019s event behind Michele Thomson on this I season\u2019s money-list after the Aberdonian finished second in last month\u2019s Indian Open. Due to bad smog, Pretswell Asher withdrew from that event but, after recording a top-15 finish in the following week\u2019s Sanya Ladies Open in China, she is looking to end her season on a high in a field that is headed by Ricoh Women\u2019s British Open champion In-Kyung Kim. \u201cMichele had a great week in India but, if I can have a good week in Dubai, we\u2019ll see where it leaves me at the end of the year,\u201d said the former Curtis Cup player, who also has US Solheim Cup duo Angel Yin and Brittany Lincicome as her rivals this week. \u201cThis is a tournament I really enjoy, it\u2019s the best one after the Scottish Open and it is one of the biggest on the schedule. \nI\u2019ve been pretty happy with my game. I just haven\u2019t seen the results I would have wanted, though I had a good week in China. In fact, that was the best golf I\u2019ve played for a long time. \u201cMy aim this week is to get a good finish to what has been a frustrating season. I think next year the schedule is looking better, though I don\u2019t think it could be much worse, to be fair. \u201cThere were various reasons I came off the committee.

Follow 8-year-old Kevin McCallister through a series of hijinks as he attempts to navigate life during the holidays while separated from his family. Though most have seen the first \u201cHome Alone,\u201d you may not know that the movie kicked off a five-part franchise. Unfortunately, not all of the following movies feature the same cast of characters. For a sing-along: \u201cHow the Grinch Stole Christmas\u201d (1966) \u2014 Reminisce about holidays past and join the Whos of Whoville, the Grinch and his adorable dog Max with this classic 25-minute cartoon. For a watch party with friends: \u201cLove, Actually\u201d (2003) \u2014 This well-loved romantic comedy unites an all-star cast through multiple romantic, platonic and problematic stories. The film is set in London during the month preceding Christmas. If you\u2019ve seen \u201cLove, Actually\u201d more times than you can count, the BBC ONE recently released a 15-minute video allowing fans to check in on the characters in the present day. For those who don\u2019t care about originality: \u201cNew Year\u2019s Eve\u201d (2011) \u2014 If you are looking for something similar to \u201cLove Actually,\u201d you might try this film, which also relies on a cast of recognizable faces and multiple stories that come together at the end through various interpersonal connections. This time, the setting is New Year\u2019s Eve in New York. For the romantic: \u201cThe Holiday\u201d (2006) \u2014 This romantic comedy stars Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law and Jack Black. Diaz and Winslet\u2019s characters swap houses and fall in love while on their respective trips. It\u2019s the perfect movie to watch if you\u2019re looking for something light and romantic with a wintry setting. For someone in search of a new holiday favorite: \u201cThe Family Stone\u201d (2005) \u00ad\u2014 A mix of drama, comedy, tragedy and romance, \u201cThe Family Stone\u201d features another star-studded cast, which includes Sarah Jessica Parker, Rachel McAdams, Diane Keaton and Claire Danes.

While the first is by far the best, the later two films in the trilogy provide more options if you\u2019re looking to binge watch Christmas movies. The second and third were released in 2002 and 2006, respectively, and portray life in the North Pole with Charlie as a teenager. For the Amtrak lover: \u201cThe Polar Express\u201d (2004) \u2014 This artfully animated film follows a group of children to Santa\u2019s Workshop via a magical and mysterious ride on the \u201cPolar Express\u201d train.

With a moving plot, the film grapples with the influence a single person can have on the greater world. For the bookworm: Harry Potter movies (2001-2011) \u2014 Winter break is the perfect opportunity to watch all seven Harry Potter films, which should take you slightly less than 20 hours total. Significant holiday moments include the first film\u2019s depiction of 11-year-old Harry and Ron spending Christmas together at Hogwarts and the fourth film\u2019s Yule Ball during the Triwizard tournament.

It\u2019s like a mini fresh start 12 times each year\u2014when I can high five myself for anything that rocked, let go of anything that didn\u2019t, and focus on planning something way better. \nOn the first of the month, every month, I fill in my big spreadsheet that tracks everything in my blog and business. Things like traffic, income, course sales, social media stats, emails I sent, blogs I published. ( You can get a template for that spreadsheet over here .) I read my giant monthly horoscope from Astrology Zone to get a heads-up on how rad my month could potentially be. And I take quick notes on what went well during the previous month and what didn\u2019t. \nBut, oh baby, December is my FAVORITE because I get to fantasize about everything I could try and change and conquer next year. And this December is especially exciting because so much shit didn\u2019t work last year that I\u2019m planning to try a bunch of totally new stuff in 2018. I\u2019m changing old stuff and launching new stuff and even digging up some really old projects that never saw the light of day. I can already feel that I\u2019m ready to aim for some bigger things that will give me that, \u201cHoly shit, I can\u2019t believe that happened\u201d feeling. \nYou in for some 2018 \u201choly shit!\u201d feelings too?? \nI planned one big event already\u2014something you + I are going to make happen together mid-2018, that I am REALLY looking forward too. (And #honestly mildly freaked out by.) There will be a big change to Dare to Grow that will likely launch in February (with all new lessons + videos) to help more of you get closer to whatever blogging + biz goals you\u2019re charging toward. And I\u2019m digging up a project that I started in 2014 (had to go waaay back into the Google doc edits to figure that out!) that never saw the light of day. \nI\u2019m also focusing on small wins like publishing a blog post once/week, every week that makes me excited for YOU to read. Sticking to my daily gratitude + meditation practice. (I was looking for a notebook with enough pages for an entire year but finally put on my smarty-pants and ordered a regular planner that I\u2019m going to fill in with gratitude lists instead of daily tasks.) I also want to hire a few people to take things I\u2019m doing pretty well and make them amazing. And I want to travel, even though I am pretty satisfied with the number of mountains and oceans and deserts we have here in San Diego. \nThis week I\u2019m also running a few of my Power Half Hour sessions (1:1 quick + dirty Skype coaching calls with me, where we blast through your challenges and roadblocks and set a plan of action for 2018. There\u2019s still time to score yourself a session by applying over here. ) \nJust the act of taking notes and working through other people\u2019s challenges has been SO enjoyable and has me fired up to do more face-to-face problem-solving. It feels good to work on someone else\u2019s stuff without any rules for how I find the solution. With my own business, I\u2019ve been deep in it for six years now and it can be difficult to get outside of my own box and find creative solutions. Especially in the blogging + business industry, where there are so many other people doing similar things, it can be hard to come up with something new that feels like it\u2019s all my own. It takes a lot of brainstorming to avoid getting stuck fighting against what is proven to work because that\u2019s what everyone else does or just doing what everyone else does because it\u2019s proven to work. \nI\u2019ve been chatting with some of my business buddies and hiring coaches to help bust through my own bullshit, but in the meantime, working through other people\u2019s blogging + business challenges has been really refreshing. \nI\u2019m hopping on a call with my Dare to Grow peeps tomorrow evening to help them with their 2018 planning, so if you\u2019re a member, I hope to see you there! Otherwise, mark your calendar to join us in D2G in February and then check out this blog post for more new year planning ideas . Tell Me: What\u2019s your go-to plan for new year planning?

Al Green, 70, introduced a House resolution (H.Res. 646) to impeach President Trump on Wednesday. Representatives motioned to table the articles that claimed Trump \u201cis unfit to be president\u201d and should be \u201cimpeached for high misdemeanors.\u201d However, the resolution to impeach Trump was voted down by a 364-58 margin, with many members of the Democratic Party voting against Trump\u2019s impeachment. In his articles of impeachment, Green issued two specific articles. The first said that Trump has \u201charmed the society of the United States\u2026 by associating the majesty and dignity of the presidency with causes rooted in white supremacy, bigotry, racism, anti-Semitism, white nationalism, or neo-Nazism\u201d on multiple occasions. In his second article of impeachment, the seven-term representative said that Trump \u201charmed American society by publicly casting contempt on individuals and groups, inciting hate and hostility, sowing discord among the people of the United States, on the basis of race, national origin, religion, gender, or sexual orientation.\u201d Green also specifically referenced the most recent travel ban to six mostlymuslim countries that fulfilled Trump\u2019s campaign promise of a \u201ccomplete shutdown\u201d of Muslims entering the U.S., the banning of transgender individuals serving in the military, as well as denigrating comments he made about NFL players, Puerto Ricans, and Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.). Green\u2019s efforts to impeach Donald Trump failed woefully, even Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) who can't stand Donald Trump opposed the move. Pelosi in a statement said: \u201cNow is not the time to consider articles of impeachment.\u201d Democrats' vote to impeach Donald Trump fails woefully Reviewed by naijamediahub on December 07, 2017 Rating: 5 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald t", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al green", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frederica wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "green", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:42:03.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b64c433d0afcf9d68a6f620582668776118c502c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT.JzkJu_t78zmWOpzDvXSK2uWOeDggAq_2V0cJC.sLcFNxHcW8J4.mNn7NzdjXiVW2zyMZ8aX0jQ--", "site_full": "play.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://play.google.com/store", "site_categories": ["media", "hobbies_and_interests", "comic_books"], "section_title": "Android Apps on Google Play", "title": "WhatsApp Messenger", "title_full": "WhatsApp Messenger - Android Apps on Google Play", "published": "2017-11-30T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 39, "participants_count": 34, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a07321bc661c6c590672ef6bdfb2dee98227158c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT.JzkJu_t78zmWOpzDvXSK2uWOeDggAq_2V0cJC.sLcFNxHcW8J4.mNn7NzdjXiVUhHLfpG8277SezfzeRmCE9NI40VbqjLxLlWssHfhsgL6GaNdPN8uJcseXZ8dEq_jkMeuOnnHRz9OFXqCw6KDctaeXA_gbB2ukQ2yCw67Br78DgRqVG3ZykKrunoLSM_0oOCXzWfSiEvBp8ucVIqJNxFzAQA0aiHsrBywLAgP7DozNRwavsOmX_XX7TRA8heMY-", "ord_in_thread": 10, "author": "Abhijit Kumar", "published": "2017-12-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "After Update i.e. on 1Dec 2017 it is not running it keeps stopping and i am unable to open it and view my chats or chat with anyone pls.
