ALSO READ Buhari heads to London for medical treatment, as his health condition worsens \nAccording to him, other activities by the Commission to grow the industry include the opening of the 70/80GHz to facilitate broadband deployment; the licensing of the 2.3GHz for 4G/LTE deployment; and the authorisation given some Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) to re-farm the 1800MHz for 4G/LTE deployment. \n\u201cAll these speak to the opportunities for growth and investment in the Nigerian telecommunication sector,\u201d he said. Danbatta stated the Commission\u2019s ongoing efforts demonstrate, in a concrete sense, NCC\u2019s commitment to the implementation of its Strategic Vision Plan 2015-2020 as derived from the 8-Point Agenda, which first item is the facilitation of broadband penetration. \nThe EVC said the basis for such vision is oriented in the established correlation between broadband utilisation and job creation, economic growth as well as global competitiveness. \nSpeaking to the theme of the biannual forum \u2013 \u2018Taking the African Internet to the Next Level through Policy, Collaboration and Education\u2019 \u2013 the CEO of NCC urged all stakeholders to evolve sustainable policies and forge greater collaboration to achieve optimal utilisation of the resources of the Internet. ALSO READ BREAKING: Senate suspends amendment of Code of Conduct law \nIn addition, Danbatta said the challenge posed by cybercrime also requires collaboration of all stakeholders in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) ecosystem. \nThis, he said, explains why \u201cNCC is partnering the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to set up the Africa Regional Cybersecurity Centre in Abuja to enhance information sharing and capacity building on cybersecurity issues in the African region.\u201d \nHe commended AFRINIC for its sterling achievements in rallying stakeholders together to provide the widest possible use of Internet resources by all interested communities. \nSimilarly, Nigerian Communications Minister, Mr. Adebayo Shittu, who was represented at the event by the Director of e-Governance at the Ministry of Communications, Mr. Tope Fashedemi, praised AFRINIC for providing the leadership that has contributed to the positive accomplishments in the Africa ICT ecosystem. \nShittu informed the delegates that Nigeria\u2019s Internet penetration is already at 47.44 per cent and noted that the figure is set to rise as NCC finalise processes for the licensing of companies to fill the infrastructure gap and open the floodgate for citizens and enterprises to access Internet resources.

Turkey to host Muslim leaders after Trump\u2019s move Share This Story \nJERUSALEM \u2014 The Latest on President Donald Trump\u2019s expected recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital on Wednesday (all times local): \n1:05 p.m. \nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s spokesman says the Turkish leader is inviting leaders of member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to an extraordinary meeting to discuss Jerusalem\u2019s status next week. \nIbrahim Kalin told reporters on Wednesday that the meeting, planned for Dec. 13, will give the opportunity for Muslim countries leaders to act together and coordinate following President Donald Trump\u2019s expected recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. \nKalin also said that Turkey calls on the U.S. administration to \u201cimmediately turn away from this grave mistake that will virtually eliminate the fragile Middle East peace process.\u201d \nErdogan said on Tuesday that Jerusalem was a \u201cred line\u201d for Muslims and could lead Turkey to cut diplomatic ties with Israel. \n___ \n1 p.m. \nThe Kremlin is also concerned about President Donald Trump\u2019s expected announcement recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. \nThe move could upend decades of U.S. policy and risk potentially violent protests in the Middle East where the Arab Muslim majority is strongly opposed to the idea. \nSpeaking to reporters in Moscow, President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the \u201cthe situation is not easy.\u201d \nHe said Putin discussed the issue with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas late on Tuesday and expressed his concern about \u201ca possible deterioration.\u201d \nPeskov said, however, that the Kremlin would refrain from commenting a decision that has not been announced yet. \n___ \n12:40 p.m. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel isn\u2019t likely to be able to sign peace treaties with Arab states without a deal with the Palestinians, but asserts that it can enjoy covert ties with many of them. \nNetanyahu spoke on Wednesday at the Jerusalem Post Diplomatic Conference and was notably silent on the issue of President Donald Trump\u2019s anticipated announcement later in the day recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. \nThe prime minister said that while relations with Arab states have thawed, \u201cit doesn\u2019t mean that we can make peace treaties yet with the Arab world without some kind of movement with the Palestinians.\u201d \nHe says: \u201cPeace treaties, no, everything else below that, yes, and it\u2019s happening.\u201d \n___ \n12:35 p.m. \nA senior Palestinian official says President Donald Trump\u2019s expected recognition of contested Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital means that \u201cthe peace process is finished\u201d because Washington \u201chas already pre-empted the outcome.\u201d \nUnder an international consensus backed by successive U.S. presidents, Jerusalem\u2019s fate is to be determined in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. \nThe Palestinians seek a capital in east Jerusalem, captured and annexed by Israel in 1967. Unlike its predecessors, the current Israeli government rejects partition of the city. \nHanan Ashrawi warned Wednesday that a U.S. shift on Jerusalem is a dangerous \u201cgame changer.\u201d \nTrump has promised a Mideast deal, but Ashrawi says that \u201cthere is no way that there can be talks with the Americans.\u201d \nAshrawi says the Palestinian leadership is to hold consultations soon and decide on the next move. \n___ \n12:25 p.m. \nBritain\u2019s top diplomat is calling on the U.S. administration to present a Mideast peace plan quickly following President Donald Trump\u2019s move to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. \nBritish Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Brussels. \nHe said, speaking alongside Tillerson, that the U.K. will have to \u201cwait and see\u201d what Trump says in his speech later on Wednesday. \nBut Johnson says the decision clearly \u201cmakes it more important than ever that the long-awaited American proposals on the Middle East peace process are now brought forward.\u201d \nHe says that should happen \u201cas a matter of priority.\u201d \nTillerson did not comment on the president\u2019s decision but says it hasn\u2019t been a major topic with fellow diplomats during his meetings this week at NATO headquarters. \n___ \n12:15 p.m. \nIran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has condemned President Donald Trump\u2019s imminent recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nThe state TV\u2019s website quotes Khamenei as saying that \u201cwhen they (U.S.) claim that they want to declare Jerusalem as the capital of occupied Palestine, it shows their inability. \u201c \nHe also added that he is convinced \u201cthe victory will ultimately be for the Islamic nation and Palestine\u201d and that \u201cthe Palestinian people will be victorious\u201d in their struggle. \nIran does not recognize Israel, and supports anti-Israeli militant groups like Lebanese Hezbollah and Palestinian Hamas. \n___ \n12:05 p.m. \nChina has expressed concerns over \u201cpossible aggravation of regional tensions\u201d in response to the expected U.S. announcement recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. \nGeng Shuang, a spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said on Wednesday the China would monitor developments on the issue. \nHe says the \u201cissue of Jerusalem\u2019s status is complicated and sensitive\u201d and that \u201call sides should focus on regional peace and tranquility, act with caution, and avoid sabotaging the foundation for the settlement of Palestinian issues and triggering new confrontation in the region.\u201d \nChina has provided the Palestinians with financial and technical aid. It also has built stronger ties with Israel, providing a large market for Israeli technology. \nChina says it views both Israel and the Palestinians as \u201cimportant partners\u201d in its \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative, a mammoth Chinese-funded push to develop transport routes including ports, railways and roads to expand trade in a vast arc of countries across Asia, Africa and Europe. \n___ \n11:55 a.m. \nSyria\u2019s Foreign Ministry says President Donald Trump\u2019s expected announcement to recognize of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital is a \u201cdangerous step\u201d that will fuel global conflict. \nThe ministry in Damascus issued a statement on Wednesday calling Trump\u2019s imminent move the \u201cculmination of the crime of the seizing of Palestine and the displacement of the Palestinian people.\u201d \nIt also urged Arab states to stop normalizing relations with Israel. \nIsrael has mainly stayed out of the conflict in Syria, though it has carried out a number of airstrikes against suspected arms shipments believed to be bound for Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah militant group, which is fighting alongside President Bashar Assad\u2019s forces. \n___ \n11:50 a.m. \nTwo leading Lebanese newspapers have issued front page rebukes to President Donald Trump over his expected announcement recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nThe An-Nahar compares the U.S. president to the late British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour, who a hundred years ago famously promised Palestine as a national home to the Jewish People, in what is known as the Balfour declaration. \nThe paper\u2019s Wednesday headline reads: \u201cTrump, Balfour of the century, gifts Jerusalem to Israel.\u201d \nThe English-language Daily Star newspaper has published a full-page photo of Old City of Jerusalem capped by the Dome of the Rock beneath the headline: \u201cNo offense Mr. President, Jerusalem is the capital of PALESTINE.\u201d \n___ \n11:35 a.m. \nPope Francis is calling for the status quo of Jerusalem to be respected and for \u201cwisdom and prudence\u201d to prevail to avoid further conflict. \nFrancis made the appeal during his weekly Wednesday audience, ahead of the expected U.S. announcement by President Donald Trump recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. \nFrancis said he was \u201cprofoundly concerned\u201d about recent developments, and declared Jerusalem a unique and sacred place for Christians, Jews and Muslims that has a \u201cspecial vocation for peace.\u201d \nHe appealed \u201cthat everyone respects the status quo of the city\u201d according to U.N. resolutions. \nHe says: \u201cI pray to the Lord that its identity is preserved and strengthened for the benefit of the Holy Land, the Middle East and the whole world and that wisdom and prudence prevail to prevent new elements of tension from being added to a global context already convulsed by so many cruel conflicts.\u201d \n___ \n11:30 a.m. \nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu says the \u201cwhole world is against\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s move to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and eventually move the U.S. Embassy there. \nCavusoglu\u2019s remarks came just before a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday. \nHe says that moving the embassy to Jerusalem would be a \u201cgrave mistake.\u201d \nCavusoglu says such a move would \u201cnot bring any stability, peace but rather chaos and instability.\u201d \nThe Turkish diplomat says the whole world is reacting, not just the Muslim world. He says he\u2019s raised the issue with Tillerson in the past and plans to do so again. \n___ \n11:20 a.m. \nPope Francis has called for dialogue that respects the rights of everyone in the Holy Land and expressed his hope for \u201cpeace and prosperity\u201d for the Palestinian people, ahead of the expected announcement that the U.S. will recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. \nFrancis made the comments on Wednesday during a previously scheduled meeting with a Palestinian delegation of religious and intellectual leaders. The Vatican says it was coincidental that the audience fell on the same day as the U.S. announcement. \nIn his remarks, Francis said the Holy Land was the \u201cland par excellence of dialogue between God and mankind.\u201d \nHe said: \u201cThe primary condition of that dialogue is reciprocal respect and a commitment to strengthening that respect, for the sake of recognizing the rights of all people, wherever they happen to be.\u201d \n___ \n11:10 a.m. \nIsrael\u2019s justice minister says she welcomes Trump\u2019s declaration on Jerusalem and encourages him to \u201cmove the embassy de facto\u201d to Jerusalem. \nAyelet Shaked told The Associated Press on the sidelines of the Jerusalem Post\u2019s Diplomatic Conference on Wednesday that Trump has to go beyond the paperwork stage and not be intimidated by Arab threats of violence. \nShaked says: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be worried about this event or the other. If Arab leaders take steps to prevent unrest, there won\u2019t be any unrest.\u201d \nShe spoke ahead of a speech at the conference by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \nPresident Trump is slated to make an announcement about recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, which has garnered widespread condemnation from the Palestinians and the wider Arab world, later on Wednesday. \n___ \n10:35 a.m. \nBritain\u2019s foreign secretary is expressing concern about reports that U.S. President Donald Trump might recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nBoris Johnson says: \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see what the president says exactly, but we view the reports that we\u2019ve heard with concern.\u201d \nHe told reporters at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday that Britain thinks \u201cJerusalem obviously should be part of the final settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians \u2014 a negotiated settlement that we want to see.\u201d \nJohnson added: \u201cWe have no plans ourselves to move our embassy.\u201d \n___ \n10:30 a.m. \nPope Francis has spoken with the Palestinian leader about the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and is meeting with a Palestinian delegation of religious and academic leaders. \nVatican officials say Wednesday\u2019s meeting was organized well in advance by the Vatican\u2019s interreligious dialogue office, and that it was purely coincidental that it fell on the same day as the U.S. announcement, expected in the early afternoon in Washington. \nThe Vatican says Francis spoke by telephone on Tuesday with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas after President Donald Trump called Abbas to advise him of his decision. The call came at Abbas\u2019 initiative. \nThe Vatican has long sought an internationally guaranteed status for Jerusalem that safeguards its sacred character for Jews, Muslims and Christians. \n___ \n9:40 a.m. \nTurkey\u2019s prime minister says President Donald Trump\u2019s expected recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital will make the region\u2019s problems \u201cunresolvable.\u201d \nU.S. officials have told The Associated Press the announcement would come on Wednesday and would include instructions for the State Department to begin moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. \nPrime Minister Binali Yildirim spoke about the possibility at a news conference with South Korean officials in Seoul. \nYildirim said it was vital for the Middle Eastern region and for global peace that Trump not make such an announcement. \nJerusalem is sacred to Christians, Jews and Muslims and is a contentious part of Israel-Palestinian negotiations. \nThe prime minister said a declaration could cause religious clashes and destroy efforts toward formation of a Palestinian state. \n___ \n9:15 a.m. \nPresident Donald Trump will recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital despite intense Arab, Muslim and European opposition to a move that would upend decades of U.S. policy and risk potentially violent protests. \nU.S. officials say Trump will also instruct the State Department on Wednesday to begin the multi-year process of moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city. \nThe officials said numerous logistical and security details, as well as site determination and construction, will need to be finalized first. Because of those issues, the embassy is not likely to move for at least 3 or 4 years, presuming there is no future change in U.S. policy. \nThe U.S. officials spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity Tuesday because they were not authorized to publicly preview Trump\u2019s announcement. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The Punjab government, at the behest of the Lahore High Court, made the report for the Model Town incident public on December 5. The report was drafted by Justice Baqir Najfi and termed the 2014 tragedy in Lahore's Model Town as the \"most unfortunate incident\" in the country's history. \nPress conference comes a day after release of Model Town inquiry commission report \nAt least 14 people were killed and 100 others injured in police action against PAT workers during an 'anti-encroachment operation' on June 17, 2014. \n\"We stand for democracy in the country and won't let anyone do politics on dead bodies,\" he said. \"People who were martyred were our people.

The media reflected on a big result for the Reds \u2013 and for more than just the score-line \nMelissa Reddy , for Goal.com , felt the result still flattered Spartak Moscow: \nTheir gifts, so varied and in sync, meant the almightily impressive scoreline was still flattering for the visitors. It could have been more and it would have been deserved. \nThe Telegraph\u2019s Jason Burt hailed reaching the last-16 is a \u201csignificant landmark\u201d for Klopp\u2019s developing side: \nMore importantly, for Liverpool, it is the first time they have reached the Champions League group stages since 2009 and it felt like a significant landmark for them, having fallen short in 2010 and 2014, ahead of Sunday\u2019s Merseyside derby. \nMeanwhile, the Liverpool Echo\u2019s Andy Kelly noted how the group stage has provided a vital learning experience for the Reds, as well as a successful one: \nWhile the presence of Sevilla meant the Reds could take nothing for granted in terms of winning Group E, their return to Europe\u2019s premier competition was undoubtedly aided by a kind enough draw. \nIt meant they were able to learn on the job again at the highest level without any mistakes proving too costly. Jurgen Klopp earned deserved praise for assembling such a lethal side and guiding the Reds through \nThis Is Anfield\u2019s Henry Jackson credited the boss for producing such a \u201cfearless style of play\u201d: \nKlopp has Liverpool playing some of their best football in years and he deserves so much praise for masterminding such a fearless style of play. \nThe Mail\u2019s Ian Ladyman felt Liverpool showed \u201cexhilarating basics of the Klopp prototype\u201d and thought the performance illustrated something special is brewing: \nThis is why Jurgen Klopp was brought to Anfield, and this is why as long as the German stays there will always be hope that something special may eventually be built on Merseyside. \n[\u2026] \nThere are currently flaws in Klopp\u2019s grand design \u2013 the Premier League table tells us that \u2013 but here on a cold Anfield night were the exhilarating basics of the Klopp prototype. Energetic, intuitive, hypnotic passing football with a devastating cutting edge. \nThe Liverpool Echo\u2019s James Pearce believes the Reds are better prepared to succeed this time around due to having Klopp at the helm: \nThree years ago Liverpool squandered the opportunity when they returned to the Champions League . They looked out of their depth and had a manager who was a rookie in European terms. \nNow they have the required class both on the field and in the dugout to shine at this level. Klopp knows what it takes. Those two-legged ties brought the best out of him tactically en route to the Europa League final in 2016 and Liverpool are on the march under him once again. As you would expect, reporters eulogised over the Reds\u2019 attacking play \u2013 and the \u2018Fab Four\u2019 in particular \nThe Mirror\u2019s David Maddock believes the Reds\u2019 fire-power means the Reds will carry the Reds far into the competition: \nOn this form, with this \u00acruthless mentality, the attack looks virtually unstoppable, and even with a vulnerable defence they have the fire-power, the intimidating threat, to go far this season. \nPearce believes the display will have struck fear into Evertonians ahead of Sunday\u2019s derby: \nThe Fab Four purred from start to finish as Philippe Coutinho , Sadio Mane , Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino wreaked havoc. \n[\u2026] \nTheir blistering pace, intelligent movement and lethal finishing will have been enough to give Evertonians cold sweats ahead of Sunday\u2019s Merseyside derby. \nJack Austin , writing for the Independent , thinks the Reds will boast one of the \u201cmost exciting\u201d attacks in the competition come February when Adam Lallana is also back to fitness: \nAdd the nearly fit-again Adam Lallana to that mix and suddenly you have one of the most exciting attacks left in the competition. \nMeanwhile, the Independent\u2019s Mark Critchley thinks not even Man City \u2019s attack as is good as Liverpool\u2019s: \nFew of the others, perhaps not even Manchester City , can claim to have an attack as devastating as the one at Jurgen Klopp \u2019s disposal. Philippe Coutinho was singled out after shining with a superb performance as captain \nKelly simply labelled Coutinho\u2019s showing \u201ca captain\u2019s display\u201d: \nA captain\u2019s display no doubt. \nThis Is Anfield\u2019s James Nalton thought Coutinho fully merited being awarded the captaincy: \nCoutinho has captained Brazil in the past as part of their manager Tite\u2019s policy of rotating the armband, but there was no question that the No. 10 was Liverpool\u2019s captain on merit and it was not a random selection. \nLooking deeper into Klopp\u2019s decision to hand Coutinho the armband, Austin thought the boss sent a clear message to Barcelona: \nBarca have made noise about having the finances to go back in for Coutinho in January with the playmaker still believed to want the move to the Catalan capital but Klopp\u2019s move in handing him the armband suggests his and the club\u2019s stance has not altered from the summer. \nThey still see Coutinho as their main man, and they\u2019re making sure Barca know it. Reporters offered alternative thoughts on certain aspects of performance and selection \nNalton assessed the starting lineup as Liverpool\u2019s strongest despite the absence of Jordan Henderson , and thought the performance proved as much: \nJurgen Klopp \u2019s team selection led to suggestions that this XI was his best lineup. \nSome may prefer different faces in the centre of defence, and Joel Matip is widely considered the club\u2019s best centre-back, but aside from this the team looked like Liverpool\u2019s strongest, at least on paper. \nAustin noted how Klopp\u2019s side coped far better with a commanding lead, and assessed this improved know-how will be crucial for the latter stages: \nKlopp has consistently rebuffed suggestions of a mental fragility within his squad and on this occasion his team illustrated their ability to manage their advantage through to the final whistle. That kind of discipline will be critical when they come to the two-legged knockout stage ties ahead. \nPearce praised Liverpool for \u201cdelivering when it mattered\u201d: \nThe Reds had made hard work of Group E \u2013 throwing away leads home and away to Sevilla, and wasting a stack of chances in the draw away to Spartak. But when it really mattered, they delivered and it\u2019s another significant milestone in Klopp\u2019s reign. Finally, the watching journalists discussed Liverpool\u2019s aims and chances of success for the competition ahead \nReddy was among numerous journalists who assessed the Reds proved they can compete on this stage: \nLiverpool couldn\u2019t have sent out a clearer message as they reached the last 16 for the first time since 2008/09 \u2013 this is not simply a stage they belong on, but one they also intend to use to show off the full extent of their artillery. \nESPN\u2019s Mark Ogden believes Klopp\u2019s side have proven themselves \u201ca dangerous outsider\u201d: \nWith such attacking quality in their squad, Liverpool will be a dangerous outsider. \n[\u2026] \nBut Liverpool\u2019s cutting edge, plus the legendary Anfield atmosphere on European nights, will give them hope and belief against any opponent. \nMaddock believes Liverpool\u2019s goal threat makes the Reds \u201cgenuine contenders\u201d: \nFor all the talk of frailty in both mind and body, there is one quality that makes Liverpool genuine Champions League contenders: goal threat. \nFinally, Reddy believes Liverpool will be the team all potential opponents want to avoid in Monday\u2019s last-16 draw: \nBasel, Bayern Munich, Juventus, Shakhtar Donetsk, Porto and Real Madrid are the potential opponents and none of them will want Monday\u2019s draw to result in them having to devise a plan of containment for Liverpool\u2019s \u2018Fab Four\u2019.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "klopp", "sentiment": "positive"}],

"Back to Brexit \nBrexit talks amid a deadlock over the Irish border which threatens to drag on until the new year. \nThe British Prime Minister is hoping to make a new offer by Friday to satisfy both Ireland and the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party which props up her Government and scuppered a deal on divorce issues on Monday. \nPressure is growing on Mrs May to get leaders at the December 14 European Council summit to declare sufficient progress has been made on divorce issues so trade talks can begin, with business chiefs warning companies will activate contingency plans that will cost Britain jobs if there is further delay. \nAfter talks in Dublin, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Dutch PM Mark Rutte made clear the EU would not compromise and allow the Irish border to be kicked down the road to phase two of the talks, even under threat of Britain crashing out with no deal or divorce negotiations dragging on to 2018. \nAnd after a phone call with Mrs May on Wednesday, Mr Varadkar said the PM was hoping to return with a new formal written offer \"tonight and tomorrow\", but warned if there was no agreement talks would be picked up in the New Year. \nDowning Street said Mrs May told Mr Varadkar she was \"working hard to find a specific solution to the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland\" and was committed to \"moving together to achieve a positive result on this\". \nThe PM also spoke with DUP leader Arlene Foster, whose rejection of plans for \"regulatory alignment\" between Northern Ireland and the Republic led to the collapse of a proposed deal on Monday. \nBut it is understood Mrs Foster has no immediate plans to fly to London for talks with Mrs May and any such move would depend on progress in negotiations between the DUP and the Government in London. \nConfederation of British Industry (CBI) president Paul Drechsler underlined businesses' \"immediate\" need for a transition deal, telling the City of London Corporation: \"Or 60% of firms with contingency plans will have put these into effect by Easter. That means jobs leaving the UK - in most cases irreversibly.\" \nMeanwhile, senior ministers came under attack over their positions on Brexit as Chancellor Philip Hammond revealed the Cabinet had not yet discussed details of the UK's preferred long-term relationship with the EU. \nMr Hammond also received a slapdown from Downing Street after suggesting it was \"inconceivable\" the UK would not pay a financial settlement to the EU, regardless of whether it obtains a trade deal. \nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman swiftly said the payment - estimated at up to \u00a350 billion - was \"dependent on us forging (a) deep and special future relationship with the EU\". \nAnd opposition MPs demanded that Brexit Secretary David Davis be sacked and face investigation for contempt of Parliament after admitting his department had produced no impact assessments of the likely effect of Brexit on different sectors of the UK economy. \nAs conflicting reports suggested the EU was considering when exactly Mrs May would pass the point of no return in her hopes to get an agreement on \"sufficient progress\" before next week's summit, Mr Varadkar warned in the Irish Dail: \"We want to move to phase two but if it is not possible to move to phase two next week because of the problems that have arisen, well then we can pick it up of course in the new year.\" \nLater in a press conference alongside Mr Rutte, he said Mrs May \"wants to come back to us with some text tonight and tomorrow\". \nMr Rutte said they \"will not loosen\" their position on the \"fundamental\" points of citizens' rights, the exit bill and the border. \nElsewhere, 19 Remain-backing Tory MPs wrote to Mrs May to condemn \"highly irresponsible\" Brexit -backing colleagues who \"seek to dictate terms\" that could leave Britain leaving the EU with no deal as negotiating pressure mounts. \nAmong the signatories to the letter were former cabinet ministers Nicky Morgan, Dominic Grieve and Stephen Crabb, as well as select committee chairs Sarah Wollaston and Bob Neill.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "david davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrs foster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dominic grieve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen crabb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark rutte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hammond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicky morgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mr varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arlene foster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taoiseach leo varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rutte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob neill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul drechsler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah wollaston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrs may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philip hammond", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "confederation of british industry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "city of london corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cabinet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern irish democratic unionist party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brexit ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irish dail", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dublin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:57.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "be2f08b07a18e8636ad9d6f171b4ee76dbec3b68", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT7qSkZft1_Z_UHXsEj4G0J3Gy2KgSluAURu5m5WtSbtutc5ZW7hap7WSbhWUsBNdCnwgcrEU9kHg--", "site_full": "www.magicmum.com", "site": "magicmum.com", "site_section": "https://www.magicmum.com/phpBB/viewforum.php?f=63", "site_categories": ["pregnancy", "family_and_parenting"], "section_title": "MagicMum.com \u2022 View forum -

But what if you build interconnects to a country that already has vast hydro storage capacity (Norway)? You can build a lot of interconnects for the cost of one nuclear plant.\nI don't think Norway has much (or any) PHS, but that's because they don't need it. There was an article a few years back that they have about 20GW of additional hydro potential if they want to tap it, and could (of course) add PHS to some of the hydro by building catchment lagoons too. So, yes, loads of potential, especially if it's of value to them. On the downside, wind and PV are getting so cheap now, that overcapacity, or less efficient bulk storage like P2G (power to gas) becomes viable, as the cost of the leccy is so cheap at peak times, v's the value it can be sold at, at peak times.\nAnd battery storage? Expensive today, yes. But in a decade or so it's likely that we can put 1-2 days worth of storage into every household in the UK for about the cost of one Hinkley C. That's a lot of storage.\nYep, or perhaps no, as it won't take a decade for prices to fall far enough. The Powerwall II is pretty attractive to PV households now if it dropped 33% in price, so let's say a year or so for costs to fall by a grand or more, then a subsidy of \u00a31k, perhaps \u00a35bn (5m PV households long term) for 67GWh. Then there's EV storage, which with ever falling batt prices may be subsidy free in 5yrs or less. 10m of them would provide around 500GWh of storage.\nThen there's storage at PV and wind sites which can be retro-fitted easily, and is close to happening already.\nThen there's 'free' storage, such as that offered to large businesses by Siemens , or Good Energy , with costs covered by savings.",

Show Helpful Hints Welcome to CreateDebate \nCreateDebate is a social debate community built around ideas, discussion and democracy. If this is your first time checking out a debate, here are some quick tips to help get you started: Arguments with the highest score are displayed first. Argument replies (both in favor and in opposition) are displayed below the original argument. To follow along, you may find it helpful to show and hide the replies displayed below each argument. To vote for an argument, use these icons: You have the power to cast exactly one vote (either up or down) for each argument. Once you vote, the icon will become grayed out and the argument's score will change. Yes, you can change your vote. Debate scores, side scores and tag scores are automatically calculated by an algorithm that primarily takes argument scores into account. All scores are updated in real-time. To learn more about the CreateDebate scoring system, check out the FAQ . When you are ready to voice your opinion, use the Add Argument button to create an argument. If you would like to address an existing argument, use the Support and Dispute link within that argument to create a new reply.

The main politicians and central bankers in USA, UK , DE , FR are with some 30 % approval vs 50 % disapproval or are afraid to take posts in DE as capital holders and scientist rule behind them to steal money with inflation for the coming recession. In USA and EU there is by some trillion illegally printed money already and by some another trillion in safes from QE . That is equal to M1 for USA and money may multiply to M2 so some 20 to 100 % hyperinflation is expected by now , while money will start to multiply with inflation as when money devaluate it is nice to have loans. Now USA EU people hold in safes nearly twice the liquid money in FED , ECB and their banks so the people are the real central bank in this situation. With 2 , 3 % inflation people will prefer soon to spend the money from safes not lose the inflation and this will accelerate suddenly and sharp the inflation. FED and ECB should be careful not reckless in such circumstances. The organized crime of rich USA and EU will print first just enough to steal your money but latter will cover by some 2 trillions in health , 2 trillions in pensions and 2 trillions housing losses so here later printing is expected as well. The high sovereign, private bonds and debts and currency reserves will be devaluated . When the currency reserves are over soon the USD and EUR will decline in currency crisis, similar to the pound. The shares are supported with illegally printed money for some year by now so the devaluation of the dollar and EUR and pound will continue and inflation will follow soon so follow alone price basket. What will follow in the economy of USA and EU is similar scenario to the end of Solviet union with change of economic system with strong inflation that leads to disruption of economy. Ask the mentioned by me policymakers in other posts and FED and ECB , UK the raised here questions as who is behind them to be so unpopular, is the only choice they have right now to inflate the USA , EU , UK economies substantially to see if irrational exuberance is possible when growth , profits data are falsified and social indicators as inequality , demography, obesity, social support and many othershow clear deep crisis in western societies the same questions for USA, DE, FR, UK, IT , ES premiers. Ask if money are printed illegally and provided straight to USA , EU , UK banks to bail them out and buy shares to prop the prices on people account ? . . . currency crises for bubble\u2026 with the illegally printed money to prop the share market for a bubble fed provided a lot of liquidity on the market that is kept in jars. That liquid money reduce the price of the dollar and create avalanche effects of returned currency reserves. Last one two months fed continues to printing money to intervene on stock exchange , but also spends the currency reserves hold by the commercial and fed banks to hold the price of dollar stable for a while. The criminal policy of ECB is similar. There is also increase in inflation in US and EU for this reason though the growth is manipulated data to stop outflow of deposits in EU seen in Target 2 loans among eu countries with this bluff , while usa Is bluffing growth for stock exchange bubble correlated news. When the truth is revealed the money from the jars that may be by trillion for eu and usa only from the quantitative easing will be added as liquidity to new illegally printed money straight donated to banks by you public to create inflation. This policy usually ends with hyperinflation as currency crises as social costs cannot be postponed and money will be printed to cover them. Follow eu , uk for similar story not to be happening there for printed money for a bubble that create inflation and reduce currency on your account. . Ask them until when they will endanger the health of my family for the facts I reveal that endangers their financial markets forever. My family was moderately poisoned these days to scare me not to write here. \n\n\nAsk the questions raised in the hyperinflation text the persons mentioned in the next text \nGe0rg1 \u2026The scientists and the capital put themselves in the shoes of the politicians to control them. on weak policymakers to be used for economic catastrophe. Ask the mentioned persons until when they will endanger the health of my family for the facts I reveal that endangers their financial markets forever. My family was moderately poisoned these days to scare me not to write here. They paly with version of fake strong economic growth for share bubble to cheat you , I present version with a lot of illegally printed money and waisted currency reserves and waisted EU deposits you pay for and they poison me to scare me. Look behind unpopular policymakers in these difficult times. USA strives with share bubble to steal the money of USA citizens, EU will steal EU deposits that will cover EU bank losses and the deposits of Draghi friends taken away to be refinanced. EU leaving deposits cannot be covered by ECB printed money or the trillion or more redistributed with TARGET 2 and may be stolen by USA. So look for the centers of power for the coming events as USA and for EU France , Germany and UK. If policymakers are responsible in front of people , behind them are scientist and behind scientists capital. You see the record low policymakers support in many cases for persons as Trump , Christine Lagarde , May , Macron , Merkel , Draghi and all ECB governors, Yellen , Powell and all FED governors , Carney , Junker , Moscovici and all EU commissioners. Sometimes these low popular politicians may be influenced with legal cases and other means as Lagarde or Trump. So raise these questions in front of knowledgeable scientists as Krugman , Obstfeld , Rogoff ,Tibshirani , Stiglitz , Tirole , Deaton , Blundell , Thaler , Guillen ,Schauble, Kretshmer , Falk, Shiller , Bernanke ,Summers , Romer , all Bruegel . Ask them for economic data in EU , UK and USA if they think that are correct as economic growth , inflation , profits , currency reserves , deposits. Ask them if money are printed in USA , EU , UK illegally to finance share bubbles and if they are not the minds behind these low support politicians , what they expect to happen in the economy to be appointed so unpopular politicians and if they are controlled with unfair means. If deposits leave EU hidden when USA banks open and on Friday as you see EUR rate last days , but next days ECB will change this pattern in a bluff that is not successful. Raise these questions to all mentioned up people publicly for court to preserve democracy , economy and follow carefully for abuse of law and democracy. Ask all company managers that participated in USA 7 trillion buyback if they are in collision and USA banks , nasdaq companies if they are aware for FED illegally printed money.

READ MORE Tokyo to become carbon-free for four days during 2020 Olympic Games The Olympic and Paralympic designs, which celebrate the themes of harmony, diversity and resilience, were unveiled by pupils at a Tokyo elementary school. After a bungled rollout of the official Olympic logo that led to it being scrapped following accusations of plagiarism, local organisers have left the selection of the Tokyo 2020 mascots in the hands of schoolchildren. From December 11 to February 22, pupils at every elementary school across Japan - and Japanese schools overseas - will choose their favourite design, with each class casting a single vote. The winner will be announced on February 28. The competing mascots are instantly recognisable as \u201cMade in Japan\u201d, ranging in appearance from sci-fi cool to a glum-looking fox closer in spirit to the country\u2019s beloved \u201cyuru- kyara\u201d (soft characters). Design A\u2019s futuristic blue-checked design with pointy ears and oversized eyes evokes Japanese manga, while Olympic organisers revealed it has a \u201cstrong sense of justice\u201d and can apparently move faster than light. Its Paralympic cousin, meanwhile, sports red checks derived from cherry blossoms and possesses the ability, helpfully, to \u201ctalk with stones and the wind.\u201d Design B pairs a cartoon hybrid of a \u201clucky\u201d cat and a fox draped in a red flame-like cloak with a blue lion-dog of the type seen guarding Japanese shrines - the common thread between them big round eyes resembling disco lights. Olympic Mascot B also \u201cloves to take naps underneath the sunlight,\u201d said Japanese organisers, adding that it \u201cgives happy energy to people by touching them with its tail.\u201d The softer appeal of Option C, meanwhile, brings together a fox looking less than overjoyed at being decorated in prehistoric \u201cmagatama\u201d beads and a red raccoon looking a little bemused by all of the commotion. Tokyo organisers will hope to make smooth progress on the mascots to build on recent momentum following a series of public relations disasters. Last month, Tokyo opened its first new permanent venue for the 2020 Olympics - a welcome boost after plans for the main stadium were torn up by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe two years ago over its $2 billion price tag. \u25a0 What to read next", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shinzo abe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "tokyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:59.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3ba909eac54909276ed2820a4ab5bad24c905550", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSdtP3LHb6wXgwpyr_hW5jo5LY_5Q5DUjyO59t3Ls7v1ISLzwtMpXm7aEFYqQNZQYKd4cyIQ0eXSsksTTTCQ2BSSdVt491Xgqi4nwnJ5j63UQREv.vvKX2yJF9gClcQtvElHb3VIsDhSWNp.uS6srh_5ERjtmz3xyGd2Ogj2BzzgFPK9NUCZWW", "site_full": "www.thepaypers.com", "site": "thepaypers.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/thepaypers/cfKW", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Paypers Headlines", "title": "Authentication startup Hypr receives investment from Mastercard", "title_full": "Authentication startup Hypr receives investment from Mastercard", "published": "2017-12-07T12:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.thepaypers.com/images/linkedin-share.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3ba909eac54909276ed2820a4ab5bad24c905550", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSdtP3LHb6wXgwpyr_hW5jo5LY_5Q5DUjyO59t3Ls7v1ISLzwtMpXm7aEFYqQNZQYKd4cyIQ0eXSsksTTTCQ2BSSdVt491Xgqi4nwnJ5j63UQREv.vvKX2yJF9gClcQtvElHb3VIsDhSWNp.uS6srh_5ERjtmz3xyGd2Ogj2BzzgFPK9NUCZWW", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "Authentication startup Hypr receives investment from Mastercard", "text": "Authentication startup Hypr receives investment from Mastercard   11:03 AM CET Hypr , a US-based authentication solution provider, has received a sizable investment from Mastercard to expand its technology to Mastercard\u2019s ecosystem. \nIn October 2017, the startup received an additional USD 2 million on a Series A funding.

It will eventually feature in my Lost and the Damned Army as the Nurgle list offers an opportunity to have one for free (!) and it will accompany my unit of zombies and help their instability tests. \nThe old Citadel sculpt it great, however you'll notice a few changes and additions to my version. The sculpt of the original rider was a bit too squat and comic like for my tastes, so instead I plumped for a a more sinister Nurgle champion. He himself was given a plastic gong and bells from a Skaven kit (with all the iconography scraped off) to add [silent] sound to his impending arrival and I bent his feet a bit so that they looked as if they were gripping the shaft of the wagon. \n\nYou'll also note the addition of a Plague Doctor who had a greenstuffed mask applied over his face. This is also a contemporary Citadel from the Fighter range I believe (a thief if I recollect). \n\n\nYou'll also note a few additions to the skeleton pile - the original piece looked a bit scant so I added a few skulls and an additional skeleton almost falling off the back for a bit of dynamism and movement to the overall effect. His slightly pained pose looked perfect for this. \n\n\n\nIn terms of the painting I challenged myself to go for a monochromatic palette. I wanted to avoid the obvious inclusion of a spot colour of, for example, glowing eyes in exchange for a more ghostly approach to the ethereal colour scheme. I wanted this to contrast with the dark, solid plague doctor and the colour coming from the basing. This was achieved by priming white, washing with a dilute Nuln Oil, then highlighting with small amount of Nuln Oil and white in increasing quantities and then re-washing with a very dilute Nuln Oil. \nThe cotton wool mist effect was something I have wanted to experiment with for a while and after long consideration decided to apply it very finely here. I think it adds rather than detracts from the model; although of course, as always, I'm intrigued to hear your opinions. Overall I'm pretty happy with this model though!

How would you like to force a Feminist owned business to cater a convention for Male Cheauvanists?

He is the type of person who is secure with himself, and has no need to force others to agree with him. He is like the Black man not constantly playing the victim game against the whitey. He is the type of person I can respect, because he understands it is not any person's particular sin that Christians fight against. We have all sinned! He understands that the battle boils down to activists trying to rewrite our Christin faith to exclude passages saying Homosexuality is a sin. He is a Gay person who understands that these court battles between Gay activists and Christians are only happenng because the activists refuse to respect the Christian's right's to their faith and beliefs. The ultimate goal of Gay activists and the Left, is to force Christians to change their faith to fit the Gay agendas. They understand that our Christian faith says Homosexuality is a sin, but they could not care less. Their insecurity would force Christians to bow to this insidious politcal correctness regardless our own personal beliefs. They don't care that many many businesses would cater their events, because it's not about their ability to have their events catered, etc. It's all about sanctioning their lifestyles as natural and normal. They are too insecure to allow diversity of opinion on issues of sexual orientations. Not only must Christians change their faith to fit political correctness, science must also change biology to fit their agendas.

USA tax reform .USA redistribute money to the rich , though GDP additional growth cannot cover the budget deficit at this level of debt , to see how credit rating will be reduced with tax bill and raise sovereign yields for such country ruled by rich on loss is doomed to decline. USA similar to QE , cannot increase spending as there is no more return of government investments , so they let public retain some incomes , but the effect of such a tax policy is smaller as only multiplications of expenditures count. EU USA Politics exploiting middle class . The politicians in EU and USA show to people they do not intend to abide by democracy with violence in Catalonia and unpopular measures to transfer incomes from middle class to a circle of selected people as politicians , not profitable capitalists organized in criminal structures. The inequality is increasing for decades to reach the levels of 1929 in usa as well as the decline of population there, there is no American dream and everybody knows the middle class in USA and EU is exploited so nobody migrates here. The rating of politicians declines for days as France , USA , UK probably Italy , Spain and Germany soon to record levels as some 30% approval vs over 50 % disapproval . The fed and ecb print money to give to banks illegally , even quantitative easing idea is to issue debt your children will pay , so that the organized criminals will pay low interest rate on their debt. Now the last attempt of central bankers is to print illegally money to give them to banks to buy shares for bubble they will sell to middle class to steal their savings. France president lost popularity with labor reforms to push the lazy French to work more , to pay the high sovereign debts with unfair labor bargaining. Italy , bailed out banks that violates EU directive and EU seems set to allow all troubled banks in EU to be sported by taxpayers. To remind you there are some 7 dwarfs in EU , big banks with trillion assets with low evaluation of some tens of billions that should be bailed in by shareholders and bond holders by EU directive in troubles. . . USA president lost popularity with usa health care measures proposed to leave tens of millions in USA without health support that even the corrupted for public congress was afraid to accept. The tax reforms also leave incomes to the companies and wealthy that increases inequality. With such record inequality as in 1929 the economic growth decreases but not the opposite. Fed , ecb intend to cheat all data for growth to achieve share bubble before the secular recession, so they will have some money for 10 or more years from you. Fed intervenes with printed money to cheat for all news that for example corporate tax reduction will lead to growth. There are fed interventions even on the currency market to stop dollar decline with currency reserves until there is irrational exuberance on usa stock market so usa all of a sudden may lose international money function. USA have over 100 % sovereign debt , by some 2 trillions overspent in health, some 2 trillion in pension, some 2 trillion housing sectors so the criminal circle of politicians and hidden non profitable capitalists will risk to take some money on stock exchange or increase the debt to 150 % and default , but the conflict with middle class will prevent this. . .So all the recent conflicts in EU and USA with politicians are for economic reasons as EC , EP support the big EU countries and violate democracy , especially Germany and France even with violence in Catalonia today. \n\n\n\n\nDollar or the bubble by Ge0rg1 . .The FED should intervene with their or banks currency reserves, until they are depleted for now .To imitate bull market , fed , ecb has to keep the growth of stock market indexes over 10 % on year to escape zone of dead. They print money and give them to banks to intervene on stock market. This leads to decline of their currencies , especially dollar. At this level of decline starts avalanche effect for the dollar as currency reserves are returned by central banks before further decline and before the others. Dollar and stock indexes move in the opposite directions so there is choice between the bubble and currency crises. Fed and ecb cannot intervene many times for some 1 % increase on stock exchange as on the next day when they do not keep the dollar it declines and may go for currency crises. After unsuccessful attempt with buyback to create bubble and irrational exuberance , now rich hold nearly all share as the buyback was for 7 trillions out of some 25 trillions shares. Still the new policy of fed and ecb printing money for intervening on stock markets is not successful as surveys show bearish sentiment prevailing. There is no expectation the next 6 months shares to increase. Ask the inventor of irrational exuberance why he claims agents expect shares to increase next year.

(Red MacIver/The Canadian Press) \nElizabeth Thompson Senior Reporter \nAward-winning reporter Elizabeth Thompson covers Parliament Hill. A veteran of the Montreal Gazette, Sun Media and iPolitics, she currently works with the CBC's Ottawa bureau, specializing in investigative reporting and data journalism. She can be reached at: elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca. 'Completely unhelpful': Trump's Jerusalem decision will have wide-reaching repercussions \nPrime Minister Joe Clark's government backed down on its controversial 1979 promise to move Canada's Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem in part over fears of possible economic fallout, according to secret cabinet documents obtained by CBC News. \nBehind closed doors, cabinet ministers like Finance Minister John Crosbie and Industry Minister Robert de Cotret were particularly concerned, warning that ministers should carefully consider the possible economic effects and how to mitigate them. Communications Minister David MacDonald advised his colleagues that a company was \"very concerned about its contract in Saudi Arabia.\" \nWhile the name of the company is blacked out in the documents, obtained by CBC News under the Access to Information Act, cabinet discussions a month later mention that Bell Canada had a contract in Saudi Arabia. \nWhen Clark's government announced its decision on to shelve its promise, it downplayed any suggestion that fears of an economic backlash had played a role in its decision. \n\"The Prime Minister agreed with the view expressed by other Ministers that his statement should avoid reference to commercial considerations and should be confined to a brief but frank exposition of the government's policy on the location of the Embassy,\" say the minutes of a hastily called cabinet meeting on Oct. 29, 1979. Janice Stein of the Munk School of Global Affairs says the cabinet documents shed new light on why the Clark government shelved plans to move Canada's Embassy. 'Economics trumped politics' \nJanice Stein of the Munk School of Global Affairs said the cabinet documents shed new light on the Clark government's decision. \n\"For the first time, documents confirm the preoccupation of the Conservative government with the consequences for the Bell Canada contract in Saudi Arabia, of its decision to move the Embassy to Jerusalem,\" said Stein. \n\"It appears that economics trumped politics.\" \nThe question of where Canada's Embassy in Israel should be located was again in the spotlight on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced his government recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's capital and plans to move its embassy there from Tel Aviv. Canadian government officials have confirmed they have no plans to follow suit. U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital despite intense Arab, Muslim and European opposition. (Alex Brandon/Associated Press) \nWhile Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump's decision, it angered Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas who said the U.S. is withdrawing from the role it has played in the peace process. \nJerusalem, which is home to Jewish, Christian and Muslim holy sites, is hotly disputed territory for both Israelis and Palestinians \u2014 both of which have staked claims. \nIt was also a hot button issue in 1979 when Conservative Leader Joe Clark made an election promise to move Canada's Embassy there. Trump declaration raises concerns outside Middle East \nThe cabinet minutes provide a unique glimpse at what happened behind the scenes as Clark came to power and had to grapple with the issue. \nAt a meeting of his inner cabinet on June 7, only three days after he was sworn in, the \"Jerusalem question\" was raised by MacDonald, who relayed concerns expressed by the company with the contract in Saudi Arabia. \n\"The Prime Minister noted that on the question of Jerusalem the government commitment stood but there was no timetable established,\" say the minutes. \"He indicated that Ministers should 'keep their heads down' on the question as much as possible as it was important not to exacerbate the situation.\" Calming concerns \nAt an inner cabinet meeting on June 19, it was Crosbie and de Cotret's turn to raise concerns. \n\"The Minister of Economic Development and Trade and the Minister of Finance suggested that Ministers should be carefully considering the possible economic efforts of the planned move of the Canadian Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and whether these effects could not be mitigated by taking some of the steps suggested publicly by the Secretary of State for External Affairs (Flora MacDonald), such as sending a mission to consult with Arab countries.\" \nClark moved to calm their concerns and unite his cabinet behind a common position. ANALYSIS | While Western allies criticize Trump's Jerusalem move, Canada remains muted \n\"The Prime Minister agreed the Cabinet should indeed carefully consider the implications of the decision, but underlined the importance of not appearing to be unnerved by the pressures being applied by the Arabs and of not increasing the public profile of the policy by seeming to discuss it in Cabinet at every opportunity.\" \nTwo days later, on June 21, the issue was back before cabinet with Clark advising his colleagues of his plan to hold separate meetings with the Arab ambassadors, the ambassador of Egypt and the ambassador of Israel to inform them of his plans to name former Conservative leader Robert Stanfield to examine the question. \n\"In explaining the action, the Prime Minister pointed out that it would provide breathing space on the issue and allow the government to return to a low-profile position.\" Clark discusses his plans to move the embassy to Jerusalem during a 1979 news conference. (CBC) 'Commercial considerations' \nIt all came to a head again in late October when Stanfield presented the government with an interim report and Clark's inner cabinet debated whether to hold to its election promise or accept Stanfield's recommendations to shelve it until the status of Jerusalem was clarified. \nOnce again, economic questions were part of the debate. \n\"It was noted that Mr. Stanfield had skirted the issue of commercial considerations in his report. A Minister suggested that the opportunity to respond to the expressed concerns of the business world should be grasped and that the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce should immediately take steps to visit and to help restore trade with the Arab world.\" \nClark agreed his statement should avoid \"reference to commercial considerations.\" \nCanada's Jewish community was also among the considerations. \n\"A Minister suggested that the Jewish community would find offensive the report's failure to acknowledge that Israel has established its capital in West Jerusalem since 1949. Also difficulties could be expected if the closing paragraph of the report were interpreted to imply a degree of uncertainty in the position to be taken vis-\u00e0-vis the Arab boycott.\" \nElizabeth Thompson can be reached at elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "clark", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "elizabeth thompson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flora macdonald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe clark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macdonald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahmoud abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crosbie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janice stein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john crosbie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert stanfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david macdonald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert de cotret", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cbc news secret", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alex brandon/associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montreal gazette", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "economic development and trade", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canadian embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trade and commerce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cabinet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "finance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbc news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestinian authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "red maciver/the canadian press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conservative", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bell canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of industry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sun media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "munk school of global affairs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ottawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:00.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "31e37a6079b257536bf998a8a6ba8756b9d3d184", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Bh55tG5__07I33Cp8C0rDClF.eUbcnCclRWcv5m8bJowt.LZAl83xzAnoUwRb920RvtakM9BLKmzABfJgxDJTElnDidVTZfpBDUOtwylCo0ucsOUcMjRj.KoeCHjHoto.msXWR9zPl0u9FfgNEuPEYuLsSc.XcgQ-", "site_full": "www.createdebate.com", "site": "createdebate.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics"], "section_title": "", "title": "I asked all those questions, & only one Gay person had the guts to honestly answer me! | CreateDebate", "title_full": "I asked all those questions, & only one Gay person had the guts to honestly answer me! | CreateDebate", "published": "2017-12-07T06:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.037, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "31e37a6079b257536bf998a8a6ba8756b9d3d184", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Bh55tG5__07I33Cp8C0rDClF.eUbcnCclRWcv5m8bJowt.LZAl83xzAnoUwRb920RvtakM9BLKmzABfJgxDJTElnDidVTZfpBDUOtwylCo0ucsOUcMjRj.KoeCHjHoto.msXWR9zPl0u9FfgNEuPEYuLsSc.XcgQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T06:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "I asked all those questions, & only one Gay person had the guts to honestly answer me! | CreateDebate", "text": "Paste this URL into an email or IM: Click here to send this debate via your default email application.

I asked these questions over and over and no one had the guts or honestly to answer them, except for one person. How would you like to force a divorcee to cater their ex spouse's wedding? How would you like to force a Peta business owner to cater a fur trapper's convention? How would you like to force African American family owned businesses to cater KKK conventions? How would you like to force Prolife family owned businesses to cater pro abortion conventions! How would you like to force a Jewish owned family business to cater a nazi convention? How would you like to force a Feminist owned business to cater a convention for Male Cheauvanists? He was a Gay person who agreed with me on how these activists should not be trying to force privately owned businesses to cater things that go against their faith or conscience. Can you imagine that? He is the type of person who is secure with himself, and has no need to force others to agree with him. He is like the Black man not constantly playing the victim game against the whitey. He is the type of person I can respect, because he understands it is not any person's particular sin that Christians fight against. We have all sinned! He understands that the battle boils down to activists trying to rewrite our Christin faith to exclude passages saying Homosexuality is a sin. He is a Gay person who understands that these court battles between Gay activists and Christians are only happenng because the activists refuse to respect the Christian's right's to their faith and beliefs. The ultimate goal of Gay activists and the Left, is to force Christians to change their faith to fit the Gay agendas. They understand that our Christian faith says Homosexuality is a sin, but they could not care less. Their insecurity would force Christians to bow to this insidious politcal correctness regardless our own personal beliefs. They don't care that many many businesses would cater their events, because it's not about their ability to have their events catered, etc. It's all about sanctioning their lifestyles as natural and normal. They are too insecure to allow diversity of opinion on issues of sexual orientations.
