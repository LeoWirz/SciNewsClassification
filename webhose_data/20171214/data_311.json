It is expected to be rolled out in stages from the third quarter of next year. \n\u201cMavcom has been in operation for two years and by the time this comes out, it will be three years. And while they haven\u2019t got a quality of service framework, they have already raised airport tax and will charge consumers RM1 for their services,\u201d Fernandes told The Star. \nFrom January, all passengers leaving Malaysia by air will have to pay a levy of up to RM1 to cover Mavcom\u2019s operational costs, as the government will stop funding the commission after this year. \nIn addition, passengers flying out of klia2 from Jan 1 next year will have to pay 46% more in passenger service charge (PSC), or airport tax, for international destinations beyond Asean, as the rate will be increased to RM73 from the current RM50. \n\u201cMavcom must serve the people, not just Malaysian airports. Why not do the work and then decide on the charges?\u201d Fernandes asked. \nEarlier this month, the Public Transport Users Association hit out at Mavcom over the 46% increase in airport tax, saying Mavcom appeared to be turning into a tax body instead of an aviation commission that was meant to protect consumers. \nIt\u2019s president Ajit Johl was also concerned over reports that the government might impose a new form of security tax known as the Advance Passenger Screening System. \n\u201cAbove this, Mavcom will soon start charging RM1 for every departing passenger to finance its operations since the government stopped its funding.

In response, Moore expressed his gratitude to the president for his support.\n\u201cI look forward to fighting alongside the President to #MAGA!\u201d Moore said in his Twitter account, using Trump\u2019s hashtag for his slogan \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d\nMoore also denied allegations of an ethical breach during his tenure as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama. However, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that he believed in the accusations hurled against him. McConnell was joined by several senators in urging Moore to step aside. However, he also said that Moore\u2019s fate will be up to the will of the electorate in Alabama.\n\u201cI\u2019d have a real hard time voting for Roy Moore. But Alabama voters very well may hold their nose and vote for him rather than a Democrat,\u201d Representative Matt Gaetz said during an interview.\nIn a recent statement, Trump also slammed Democratic candidate Doug Jones, a former US Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama. The president said that Jones has been lenient in his law enforcement duties during his tenure. He also described Jones as a \u201cpotential puppet\u201d for the incumbent Democratic lawmakers in Congress.\n\ud2b8\ub7fc\ud504, '\uc131\ucd94\ubb38' \ub85c\uc774 \ubb34\uc5b4 \ud6c4\ubcf4

If you read any of my previous posts, I always start a game as Man Utd as they give an idea as to what tactics work and what don't.\nThey are not world beaters far from it, but with the right additions can fight for all the major competitions, I find they are the right team to use for a \"test run\" (Man City would be a walk in the park), after that I always start as Exeter.\nSince I have now played a season and tested multiple formations in different circumstances, I will now start a save with Exeter.\nI find lower league management can be more fun, the game is much more challenging as you have to change the team/players as fitness levels are lower and you play a lot more games.\nI get really excited when going into FA Cup games, 2nd, 3rd round games at home to bigger teams, really make me 2nd guess/think about formation and the right players to give me the best chance.\nChampions League games on FM don't even get a remote of excitement until the quarters or semi's - Oh I am home to Besiktas, exciting...\nOr maybe I just find the game more exciting and enjoyable as I support the team I am playing as.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:35:31.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "af8ba5329f57244f33ef1fc229ff8a981cb7de99", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9QCjJMm01ny4U2zWncMArrewUvVtYTz3FlyptTRg15wEiuK1XuDyrbIVIDbXuSNitwPrHHu_Encs803ATS5TEr", "site_full": "www.politicsforum.co.uk", "site": "politicsforum.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.politicsforum.co.uk/forum/viewforum.php?f=105", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "World View - The UK Politics Forum", "title": "jUResalem", "title_full": "jUResalem - The UK Politics Forum", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "af8ba5329f57244f33ef1fc229ff8a981cb7de99", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9QCjJMm01ny4U2zWncMArrewUvVtYTz3FlyptTRg15wEiuK1XuDyrbIVIDbXuSNitwPrHHu_Encs803ATS5TEr", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aurealis", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "jUResalem", "text": "The temple mount attracts every crazy on the planet.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:35:31.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6113bcb6ee374343e343cb857c5b5cf72a32452d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mst9_W1Y5yp3NElf.eNCXI.", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/co/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/co/ - Comics &amp;

Updated December 7, 2017 10:13 GMT Monica Palomino was forced to keep the dead body of her baby in her fridge at home after the hospital delayed the child's death certificate - Representational image FRED DUFOUR/AFP/Getty Images \nA Peruvian mother has claimed that she was forced to keep her dead baby's body in her fridge after a hospital, where the premature child was born, delayed in providing her with a death certificate. \nMonica Palomino said that she delivered the baby on Saturday, 2 December, after a gestation period of just 25 weeks, and the child died on Monday. But her ordeal went from bad to worse when the hospital discharged her and asked her to take the deceased baby without giving her time to complete all the paperwork in order to process the death certificate. \nPalomino alleged that the security personnel at the Sergio Bernales hospital in Lima's Comas District in Peru \"gave me my son when I was discharged\". \nShe told AFP, \"He's in the refrigerator in my house because they did not give me the time to do the paperwork for his death certificate. I want to bury him but to do so I need the death certificate.\" \nThe woman said her baby is still in her freezer at home, where she has placed a sign that says \"Do Not Touch\". \nMeanwhile, the hospital's director Julio Silva said on Wednesday that he would order an investigation into the incident. He added that he believes the security guards broke all the hospital's rules. \n\"I assume full responsibility. What should have been done is wait in the mortuary for the death certificate to be issued, to then be able to remove the body,\" Silva told AFP. \nThis is not the first time such inhumane behaviour by hospital staff has come to light. In May 2009, a woman from Crawley, West Sussex in England alleged that when she called a hospital after suffering a miscarriage while at home, she was advised to put the dead foetus in her fridge for two days until her scheduled appointment. \nSophie Hill said at the time that she had been \"betrayed by the National Health Service [NHS]\". The Daily Mail reported that the nurse who had advised Hill was put on leave but not disciplined.

Teach yourself and maybe a year down the line see if you still have a passion for it.\nA couple of key points about programming and software dev:\nSoftware dev is not programming. Software Development is an entire process from start to finish. You'll probably be involved in more than one of the stages but there's no guarantee you'll just be programming all the time.\nTo program well requires an interest in programming. I don't want to be rude but you sai you became interested in programming recently. And that you regret taking your current degree. Can you be absolutely sure that this is something you really want to do down the line?\nDo you know what sort of programming you'd like to do as a job? Do you want to make software, write code for games, etc. Do you want to freelance or work for a company? Having an idea of the sort of code you want to write and the projects you want to work on helps determine where you want to go. By extension...\nMaths is not a huge requirement for all types of programming. Some things are more maths heavy than others. Some will boil down to basic GCSE Maths. You need to be comfortable dealing with Maths but you don't need A Level knowledge, providing you are able to pick things up reasonably quickly. A better skill is problem solving.\nIf you are looking at doing Computer Science, keep in mind that CS is not solely programming. You'll probably have to cover some things like Networking, Computer Architecture and Web Design. These may interest you, they may be of no interest. Would you want to do another 3 year degree for stuff that doens't entirely interest you?\nGet coding and making stuff, keeping a \"portfolio\" on github so to speak. Someone with good, evidenced experience programming is worth more than someone with a CS degree.\nProgramming on the whole is something you can teach yourself. You miss out on the degree but also the added debt. And a degree doesn't guarantee you'll be a good programmer.

However, have lost passion for this course greatly. (Quite frankly regret my decision on taking it).\nI've become interested in programming/coding lately especially making apps. However, I'd like to become a software developer down the line and I'm just trying to figure out what is the best route for me.\nAny suggestions/tips would be greatly appreciated! Thank you :) My honest suggestion at this point is to stick with it outside uni for a while. Teach yourself and maybe a year down the line see if you still have a passion for it.\nA couple of key points about programming and software dev:\nSoftware dev is not programming. Software Development is an entire process from start to finish. You'll probably be involved in more than one of the stages but there's no guarantee you'll just be programming all the time.\nTo program well requires an interest in programming. I don't want to be rude but you sai you became interested in programming recently. And that you regret taking your current degree. Can you be absolutely sure that this is something you really want to do down the line?\nDo you know what sort of programming you'd like to do as a job? Do you want to make software, write code for games, etc. Do you want to freelance or work for a company? Having an idea of the sort of code you want to write and the projects you want to work on helps determine where you want to go. By extension...\nMaths is not a huge requirement for all types of programming. Some things are more maths heavy than others. Some will boil down to basic GCSE Maths. You need to be comfortable dealing with Maths but you don't need A Level knowledge, providing you are able to pick things up reasonably quickly. A better skill is problem solving.\nIf you are looking at doing Computer Science, keep in mind that CS is not solely programming. You'll probably have to cover some things like Networking, Computer Architecture and Web Design. These may interest you, they may be of no interest. Would you want to do another 3 year degree for stuff that doens't entirely interest you?\nGet coding and making stuff, keeping a \"portfolio\" on github so to speak. Someone with good, evidenced experience programming is worth more than someone with a CS degree.\nProgramming on the whole is something you can teach yourself. You miss out on the degree but also the added debt. And a degree doesn't guarantee you'll be a good programmer. I recommend teaching yourself, working on projects for a year or two and seeing where you want to go from there. If you work super hard you may find that actually the job offers start coming to you, or you can at least find employment in lower level jobs without a degree at first.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:35:31.069+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15121355, "moreResultsAvailable": 15121255, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512639331069&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 625}
