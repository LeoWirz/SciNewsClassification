VMware works much easier with AMD cards because they don't lock down the driver as much. At the time of me starting my server I only had a HD 6670, a pair of GTX 460 SE cards and a single GTX 960 SSC. Tried for a while to get them working with vmware with no luck, switched to unraid made a few tweaks and had it semi working with amd first then nvidia. This is when i found out my 960 was having an issue, did an RMA on the card and while i was waiting on that i got a Radeon 7870 to game with and test. Now i have unraid running with both of those cards and a separate but very similar box (same motherboard xeon e5649 cpus and 12 gb of ram instead of 48) that has esxi which i'll be doing some testing with. In fact if i was building a new box for gpu pass through id try to go with AMD cards since they've worked more seamlessly for me so far. The 960 was just what i had at the time. Also i did receive the hyper 212 evos and had an issue mounting them to the tyan board. it had an attached backplate so it doesnt support that 1366 mounting out of the box for server boards which i found odd. it took some playing with and modification but i got them attached. there is about 2-3mm of clearance issue to the top of the case but not a huge issue since it still closes and i have room in my rack so its not a tight fit. Whats the plan for VMware in particular? Is it workload specific or just what you know? As i was saying if GPU pass through is important i may be inclined to recommend another option, unless you'll be going with AMD cards then it shouldnt make much of a difference for compatability.",

Questions over their compliance with the campaign finance rules at June\u2019s general election risks causing harm to voters\u2019 confidence in elections,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere is significant public interest in us investigating Momentum to establish the facts in this matter and whether there have been any offences.\n\u201cOnce complete, the Commission will decide whether any breaches have occurred and, if so, what further action may be appropriate, in line with its enforcement policy.\u201d\nEmpics Entertainment Momentum founder Jon Lansman Momentum was founded in 2015 by Jon Lansman, the veteran leftwing activist, in a bid to protect Corbyn\u2019s new leadership amid fears that Labour MPs would resist his plans to change the direction of the party.\nIt has since grown into one of Labour\u2019s most powerful groups, with networks across the country and members elected to key positions in local constituency parties and on the ruling National Executive Committee (NEC).\nLansman is currently running for one of three new seats on the NEC open to constituency members.\nThe Commission said it would investigate:\nwhether or not Momentum spent in excess of the spending limits for an unauthorised non-party campaigner in the UK Parliamentary general election;\nwhether or not Momentum submitted a return that did not include accurate donation information and/or the required declaration stating that the donation return was complete and accurate;\nwhether or not Momentum submitted a return that was not a complete statement of payments made in respect of controlled expenditure;\nwhether or not Momentum submitted a return that did not include all invoices for payments of more than \u00a3200.\nUnder the law, \u201cnon-party campaigners\u201d who wish to undertake \u2018targeted spending\u2019 \u2013 intended to influence people to vote for one particular registered political party or any of its candidates \u2013 have to to do so within prescribed spending limits.\nThe limits are \u00a331,980 in England, \u00a33,540 in Scotland; \u00a32,400 in Wales; and \u00a31,080 in Northern Ireland.\nThe group has 170 local branches and more than 31,000 members nationally. Its campaigners played a key role in the June election, mobilising voters in key seats as well as amplifying Labour\u2019s message on social media.\nThe organisation\u2019s Facebook page reached 23.7 million views and videos were watched by 12.7 million unique users in the election.\nMomentum underlined its strength within Labour at this year\u2019s party conference in Brighton, when its candidates swept the board in elections to the Conference Arrangements Committee and National Constitutional Committee.\nMany of its former key figures now work for Jeremy Corbyn or the Labour party.\nA Momentum Spokesperson told HuffPost UK: \u201cMomentum put a lot of effort and resources into detailed budgeting and financial procedures during the election to ensure full compliance.\n\u201cOur election campaign was delivered on a low budget because it tapped into the energy and enthusiasm of tens of thousands of volunteers across the country.\n\u201cMuch of the Electoral Commission investigation refers to administrative errors that can be easily rectified. We have a good working relationship with the Electoral Commission, and will fully comply with the investigation going forward.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeremy corbyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corbyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob posner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul waugh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jon lansman  momentum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jon lansman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "electoral commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national executive committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:27.097+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "28f9676436d82c652fb58bfc8b84e91490409044", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSNj5QlPgLHrmhbCJCi29QxJLIxryZ3H6hflf0tOOJcGWAG7YLiffcuLepn8J6DmWjxiwzxHQZ_JsuTu_XtdU6zpVSrKc5B2icL935aTnrHzU5aTx191M32g--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "popular links", "title": "She was being restored by a young man who got called away to WWII and never returned home [OC] [1067x1600] : AbandonedPorn", "title_full": "She was being restored by a young man who got called away to WWII and never returned home [OC] [1067x1600] : AbandonedPorn", "published": "2017-12-07T02:51:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 192, "participants_count": 152, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "038374aa0759c1a8ea91e9c4586ba90a02d256e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSNj5QlPgLHrmhbCJCi29QxJLIxryZ3H6hflf0tOOJcGWAG7YLiffcuLepn8J6DmWjxiwzxHQZ_JsuTu_XtdU6zpVSrKc5B2icL935aTnrHzWpMr1sHepTff5xAmsONb.e4T0Un1IwP9o-", "ord_in_thread": 144, "author": "JAproofrok", "published": "2017-12-07T10:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Funny thing about this signed document ....
