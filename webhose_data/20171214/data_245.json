The MD pamphlet written by a Chicago based journalist gives no indication where the author came up with that factoid nor what population of cyclists does the factoid allegedly apply? Chicago cyclists, Md. cyclists, all cyclists, or is it a guesstimate based on what the author has gleaned from the Internet, or are from the manual on The Conventional Bicycling Wisdom taught at a Cycling Safety Class.\nI am not questioning the recommendation to ride in the direction of traffic, just am skeptical of the use of statistical claims about bicycling safety and comparisons of various techniques that claim that this or that is \"safer\" or more or less dangerous and cite numbers that seem to be pulled out of thin air. Well, first, riding against traffic is against the law. Period.\nSecond, it is in the best interest of the state to make laws and the legal interpretations of such laws in a clear manner that puts public safety first. If the state has decided to interpret its own law regarding how far right is both safe and practical as often being in the center of the lane, then that means it is highly, highly likely that is the safest place to be.

Quite a few I expect.\nAccording to this source 1.7 million in the US alone. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/...=.9a4c7e9f30a8\nWe could then posit that most of those collisions occurred when the following vehicle either did not see the vehicle in front of them or drove in such a way that they could not avoid collision. These 1.7 million struck vehicles probably having not only running lights but brake lights to aid visibility.\nWe could then ask if any cyclist is considered more visible than those larger, well lit vehicles occupying the same space. Probably not.\nThen we could ask why \"Take the Lane\" advocates try to convince cyclists to occupy a space statistically proven to be a high risk zone for rear end collisions rather than a statistically unproven seems sort of dangerous or inconvenient zone such as shoulders and bike lanes. I think we could say, statistically speaking, vehicles tend to drive in road lanes and rear end other vehicles more than they do in shoulder or bike lanes.\nFuzzy feelings of not being noticed vs actual data showing where danger really exists.\nAnd to be clear, the damage done to a cyclist in a rear end collision from a motor vehicle is probably always catastrophic.\nI have heard tires squeal behind while on my commute and had a car rear ended right beside me. A common occurrence statistically speaking. If I had been \"taking the lane\" I would have been crushed between both of those bumpers. No thank you. If that car could not stop to avoid another car what leads anyone to think it could/would stop to avoid hitting me.\nSo really.. how dangerous/common is a rear end collision in a road lane compared to the presumed danger of a close pass while riding the shoulder?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2015/06/08/there-are-about-1-7-million-rear-end-collisions-on-u-s-roads-each-year-heres-how-to-stop-them/?utm_term=.9a4c7e9f30a8"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:45.038+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f6a52c34827d95153b710df886002ad0c11d29b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_StcUp8dvfp7Xmu2.AFjVd7rYTFg8QaoQ9peV.VoeVmsaPiFYjduZKRXD_Qs8W9jsH4muoCgH_HJw5_gkDrfEviSVgLLnK13gU_BaKOT4h84Ry8aCR0NN", "site_full": "www.bikeforums.net", "site": "bikeforums.net", "site_section": "https://www.bikeforums.net/advocacy-safety/", "site_categories": ["bicycling", "sports"], "section_title": "Advocacy &amp; Safety - Bike Forums", "title": "How dangerous are close passes really? - Page 7", "title_full": "How dangerous are close passes really? - Page 7 - Bike Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T04:10:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 18862, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e5f75c3dc717095905d62d886c33302faec56536", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_StcUp8dvfp7Xmu2.AFjVd7rYTFg8QaoQ9peV.VoeVmsaPiFYjduZKRXD_Qs8W9jsH4muoCgH_HJw5_gkDrfEviSVgLLnK13gU_BaKOT4h5VRO2CNvz2L", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "AlmostTrick", "published": "2017-12-07T06:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : c.

Frei will return to the scene of his greatest professional moment Saturday when the Sounders face Toronto in the championship match trying to become the fourth team in Major League Soccer history to win consecutive league titles. A year ago, Frei made one of the most stunning saves in the history of MLS championship matches, changing directions and leaping in desperation to get his left hand on Jozy Altidore\u2019s attempted header in extra time that seemed destined for the top corner of the goal. It was the save Seattle needed to get to penalty kicks, in which Frei made another save on Michael Bradley and Roman Torres eventually won the title for the Sounders with his made penalty in the sixth round. But it was the save on Altidore that everyone remembers and is certain to be shown repeatedly prior to Saturday\u2019s rematch. \u201cI\u2019m going to try and do the same thing as last year and, at some point, really zone out you guys and social media and just focus on the game,\u201d Frei said. While last year\u2019s game will get a lot of the attention this week, it is the defensive performance in this year\u2019s playoff run that deserves the focus. Seattle has yet to allow a goal in four postseason games. The Sounders have not allowed a goal since a 2-0 loss to Philadelphia on Oct. 1. That is a span of six full games since a shot got past Frei or backup Tyler Miller. Miller started the first leg of the West finals against Houston while Frei was slowed by a leg injury. In the postseason, the Sounders have not allowed a goal since the first leg of the 2016 West finals, the longest postseason shutout streak in MLS history. \u201cIt builds confidence throughout the squad when you have someone like Stef in goal,\u201d Seattle forward Will Bruin said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to make a big save when needed.\u201d For Frei, the final in Toronto will be the conclusion of nearly two nonstop seasons of soccer. It started in February 2016 when Seattle opened its training camp. Between the length of last year\u2019s MLS season and being called into the U.S. national team training camp last January, Frei had only a few weeks of rest in between last year\u2019s championship match and the start of preparations for this season. But this has arguably been his finest season in MLS. Frei led the league with 13 shutouts in the regular season. In a sign of how much Seattle has improved defensively, he was forced to save just 84 shots in the regular season, the fewest of his four seasons with Seattle. Frei made it a point to appreciate the atmosphere and celebration after Seattle beat Houston to clinch the Western Conference title last week. A year ago, all Seattle celebrations took place away from home. When the final whistle blew last Thursday, Frei climbed on the crossbar of his goal in front of Seattle\u2019s most rabid supporters and pumped his fists in celebration. While the championship match will again be in Toronto, at least part of this run was shared with the fans at home. \u201cIt was awesome. I wish I could have given everybody in the stadium a hug,\u201d Frei said. \u201cWe were so fortunate to get on that run last year and capture two trophies, but unfortunately both of them were away from home. So this last weekend when we had a chance to win one at home was amazing.\u201d 18934292 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stefan frei", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "frei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jozy altidore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stef", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "will bruin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael bradley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "altidore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roman torres", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyler miller", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "major league soccer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sounders", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:45.064+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ecbb074026ee91cbdb96e592ef95a55bb7ef251b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsK3zEc1jpKyM6D43kbCXlSOdpYK6pFUQTPIGE2HpDz9uDSnmIRhGj2f2R2.I6zIRphWsjUwKrY4TkEpVe6I2nOh0if8A0rOCQojumFeKkAJNeuh2OcBfF7", "site_full": "medicinebyalexandros.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://medicinebyalexandros.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Medicine by Alexandros G.Sfakianakis", "title": "Necrotizing Soft-Tissue Infections", "title_full": "Necrotizing Soft-Tissue Infections", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ecbb074026ee91cbdb96e592ef95a55bb7ef251b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsK3zEc1jpKyM6D43kbCXlSOdpYK6pFUQTPIGE2HpDz9uDSnmIRhGj2f2R2.I6zIRphWsjUwKrY4TkEpVe6I2nOh0if8A0rOCQojumFeKkAJNeuh2OcBfF7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alexandros G.

But making that goal a reality relies on something they\u2019ve not really invested in \u2014 well-trained employees with the kinds of wages and regular hours that make them want to stick around. This illustrates traditional retailers\u2019 dilemma. In the face of existential threats such as e-commerce and declining mall traffic, more generous pay might improve service. But it comes at the risk of spooking skeptical investors, who are already closely monitoring costs and margins. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a delicate tightrope, where retailers that are watching their profit squeezed need to figure out where to cut,\u201d said Simeon Siegel, an analyst at Instinet LLC. \u201cLooking at the people who drive that business as an asset instead of a liability is difficult.\u201d As they boost payrolls during the crucial holiday shopping season, chains are mostly sticking to low-wage and part-time positions. With unemployment at an almost 17-year low and a broader shortage of workers, it\u2019s a tough time to change the long-established model. While some major players, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp., have announced plans to increase pay, low wages persist. Workers say they can\u2019t get the flexible hours they want, and hiring part-timers remains a common way out to avoid spending more on benefits and perks. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a tighter job market, but the wage power is all with the employer,\u201d said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James Financial Inc. in St. Petersburg, Florida. Chains don\u2019t see the need to increase compensation or add full-time positions, he said. \u201cRetail is usually seen as being low on the food chain, so you\u2019re not going to see much pressure, even during the holidays.\u201d S. Mahmud, who works two part-time retail jobs in New York, sees the industry as a temporary stop before moving on to something better. She had hoped to earn extra cash this holiday season, but so far has been unable to do so. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to give you full-time,\u201d said Mahmud, who asked that her first name not be used. \u201cAlthough they need people, they\u2019re distributing the hours.\u201d Neither of her two employers is willing to move her up to a full-time position with regular benefits. Her wages have barely changed. The only concession she\u2019s been able to secure is more predictable hours. She\u2019s in a management-training program after having completed her four-year degree and doesn\u2019t expect to always work in retail. \u201cRetailers say they\u2019re trying to staff up, but the easiest thing to do would be to offer their part-time workers full-time jobs,\u201d said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. Forty-seven percent of frontline employees \u2014 such as sales associates and cashiers \u2014 work part-time, according to a survey from the Fair Workweek Initiative. Part-time workers reported an hourly wage of 32 cents less than their full-time colleagues, with hours fluctuating from 16 to 29 per week. One in three workers said they hadn\u2019t received a raise in the last two years. That may need to change, and soon, if retailers mean what they say about creating memorable experiences to win over shoppers. This often requires a bigger workforce, such as an initiative by Macy\u2019s that deploys 250 stylists to help shoppers create outfits. Nordstrom, meanwhile, has opened a store with no inventory: Customers work with fashion experts to build a wardrobe that is then shipped to their homes. Some of the largest retailers, such as Target and Wal-Mart Stores, are also bumping pay higher to improve customer service and public perception. Others, such as the Container Store, are already known for comparatively higher wages, while Home Depot shares profit with workers. But these aren\u2019t indicative of a broader trend for the industry. Average hourly earnings in retail are now lagging behind overall worker pay by a record amount, according to Labor Department data. Even though some companies are boosting pay, the median U.S. retail sales employee salary was only $22,900 in 2016, according to the figures. The industry also faces an unstable workforce: Retailers\u2019 September turnover rate was 4.2 percent, indicating they lose about 50 percent of their sales staff over a full year. Lauren Johns, 31, a visual merchandiser who creates window displays and arranges outfits at the H&M in New York\u2019s Times Square, is one of the few who have been able to turn retail employment into a steady gig. She\u2019s worked in the field since she was 21. Now a member of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, she has been with H&M for four years and makes $22 an hour with regular, full-time hours. The ease with which retailers can bring in part-time workers is part of what keeps staff from being able to ask for more, she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a way for retailers to hold you hostage in a sense because everybody needs a job,\u201d Johns said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to do it, there\u2019s the door because someone else will. That\u2019s the mentality in retail in general, if not at H&M specifically.\u201d At H&M, Johns says she\u2019s never seen an external applicant get the \u201chandful\u201d of full-time positions that open before someone already working there: \u201cThere\u2019s so many people who want them.\u201d This dynamic drives the \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d approach to worker pay, Raymond James\u2019s Brown said. The flip side is that workers have come to expect so little from these jobs. \u201cWhen you have employers who don\u2019t invest in their workforce, either through training or providing sustainable hours, you are not going to have a workforce that\u2019s really invested in the work that they do, and they\u2019re not going to have the skills to do their job well,\u201d said Nina Terhune, of the Center for Frontline Retail, a nonprofit. 18946213 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lindsey rupp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shobhana chandra", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahmud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stuart appelbaum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lauren johns", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s. mahmud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raymond james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simeon siegel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johns", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nina terhune", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "home depot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "target corp.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raymond james financial inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department store union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wal-mart stores", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nordstrom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "h&m", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for frontline retail", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "container store", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wal-mart stores inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labor department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instinet llc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. petersburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:46.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "20490512fcda2f1429e0465bd3ee35cb58cef41c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScqJxGpeUZ0zn.IcpZp2Z31QR8bSzt4S8enJaC62Wap7Td2u7C6dDXeVeBtscF9.0KOqS9iMh7TWifbAzlgQmbG4PjChkzTsJDdRR626yk4_4eDkR1P6pXM_I1d.bEhME-", "site_full": "www.politico.com", "site": "politico.com", "site_section": "https://www.politico.com/rss/politicopicks.xml", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics"], "section_title": "POLITICO - TOP Stories", "title": "Flynn texted partners about nuclear plan during inauguration, whistleblower says -", "title_full": "Flynn texted partners about nuclear plan during inauguration, whistleblower says - POLITICO", "published": "2017-12-01T03:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 237, "participants_count": 104, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.225, "main_image": "https://static.politico.com/94/43/884d916d4483a4d9508ed12628de/171206-michael-flynn-ap-17335558080810.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 531, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "458a392ee11e763dc78daf3ac287dae0a10f5bb6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScqJxGpeUZ0zn.IcpZp2Z31QR8bSzt4S8enJaC62Wap7Td2u7C6dDXeVeBtscF9.0KOqS9iMh7TWifbAzlgQmbG4PjChkzTsJDdRR626yk4_4eDkR1P6pXRIXYZHNQdhiQoALm.gOkew--", "ord_in_thread": 232, "author": "Olaf Shiel", "published": "2017-12-07T09:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "The investigation itself has probably been over for some time now.

He never donned the garnet and gold as a player, but he has managed to one-up that goal. Taggart was introduced as the 11th head coach in Florida State history Wednesday, returning to the state after one season at Oregon. The 41-year old Bradenton, Florida, native coached at South Florida from 2013 to 2016 before taking the Ducks job. The news conference capped a hectic two weeks at Florida State that included Jimbo Fisher resigning last Friday to accept the opening at Texas A&M. \u201cGuess I wasn\u2019t good enough to get a scholarship to play here,\u201d quipped Taggart, who played and later coached at Western Kentucky. \u201cNo matter where I went, I rooted for the Seminoles. Until I went to South Florida. That was the first time I had to root against the Seminoles. \u201cPeople say blood is thicker than water. Not in my household. We\u2019re playing the Seminoles, and my brother, die-hard \u2019Nole fan, was talking about the game and said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, bro, I love you. But I can\u2019t go against my \u2019Noles.\u2019 That\u2019s just how it was.\u201d It was an emotional news conference for Taggart, who fought back tears when he talked about returning home and cheering for FSU stars Deion Sanders, Charlie Ward and Derrick Brooks when he was growing up. Three days after Fisher resigned, Taggart met with Florida State president John Thrasher, athletic director Stan Wilcox and board of trustees member Ed Burr on Monday in Scottsdale, Arizona. After weighing the offer overnight, Taggart accepted on Tuesday and informed his players at Oregon. Taggart said he appreciated Oregon athletic director Rob Mullens for giving him his first chance at a Power Five job, but he added that the chance to coach at the school he has followed since childhood was too good to pass up. \u201cI know I let him down, and I\u2019m sorry. The timing was probably not right, but it is never right,\u201d Taggart said. \u201cThis one chance was perfect. To be closer to family and coach in a Power Five and an opportunity to win a national championship are personal goals.\u201d Taggart will earn $30 million over six years. Florida State will also pay the remaining $1.37 million he still owes South Florida and the $3 million owed to Oregon as part of buyouts of his previous contracts. Taggart has a 47-50 career record, including 7-5 at \u00adOregon this season. He has a reputation of rebuilding Western Kentucky, USF and Oregon, but he views coming to Florida State as more of a realignment effort. 18945395 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "taggart", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "willie taggart", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "joe reedy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "john thrasher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ed burr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimbo fisher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fisher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deion sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stan wilcox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob mullens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie ward", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derrick brooks", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "florida state", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fsu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "texas a&m", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "power five", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seminoles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ducks", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "fla.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tallahassee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western kentucky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bradenton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scottsdale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u00adoregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:46.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d0d994ae086f02d3f6c01ddee8c902cde1a7cca8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxHh2mRSZHPd2Rh5SKuym.3p4s7TTRRaWP4fKMV.i.kZq3lFign41IKpnw_IaSSPgX.4Uhx9zoKfNLlIg.iY0FG8waFIOlGf6swdXXSNPxKqawiHIsQB5aQ", "site_full": "filmen-streaminggratuit.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://filmen-streaminggratuit.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Film En Ligne Gratuit film complet en Streaming Film en Streaming Gratuit", "title": "Strategies To Consider When Hiring Florida Foreclosure Attorneys", "title_full": "Strategies To Consider When Hiring Florida Foreclosure Attorneys", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d0d994ae086f02d3f6c01ddee8c902cde1a7cca8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxHh2mRSZHPd2Rh5SKuym.3p4s7TTRRaWP4fKMV.i.kZq3lFign41IKpnw_IaSSPgX.4Uhx9zoKfNLlIg.iY0FG8waFIOlGf6swdXXSNPxKqawiHIsQB5aQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Make Jakansi (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "Strategies To Consider When Hiring Florida Foreclosure Attorneys", "text": "By Dennis Snyder \n\nPeople face problems that they feel is hard to deal with in person and thus opt to find people, who can play a role to make things work as expected.

A real live person that tried to efficiently juggle all the balls you kept throwing at them. Today Alexa is not a living, breathing person. Instead it is Amazon\u2019s answer to not dropping any of those balls you\u2019ve been juggling on your own. \nIf you think that nobody could ever take over the duties of your assistant and do a better job, think again. Your human \u201cAlexa\u201d is about to become as obsolete as telephone operators or AOL dial-up. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s here already and will soon take over our lives. ECHO from Amazon and it\u2019s $29.95 offspring DOT will probably be the #1 selling item for Christmas this year. Amazon\u2019s little helpers set on your desk, living room, workshop and even resides in your phone ready for you to communicate with your modular home factory, your sales reps, modular home builder, the factory\u2019s engineering department and your customers and prospective home buyers. \n\nThe latest ads and video tutorials for Echo are an obvious signal of intent: Amazon is on the march for (even) more user terrain. After Prime and dash buttons gained significant ground, Alexa and the possibilities of hands-free everything, could very well be the final step to Amazon\u2019s absolute commercial dominance. A world in which you can read the news, recite recipes, manage your calendar, control your home\u2019s smart devices and play music\u2014all without hands\u2014is a world that Amazon dominates hands down. \n\nThe device opens up a new realm of marketing opportunities for companies through voice-automated apps called \u201cSkills,\u201d which anyone can develop and distribute on the mother platform. \n\nTo increase Alexa\u2019s attractiveness to users, Amazon is enticing a slew of companies to join the platform as developers of the aforementioned voice-activated Skills. Unsurprisingly, many companies jumped at the chance to hop on Amazon\u2019s new platform. \n\nCurrently, there are over 10,000 Skills available in the US Skills store which is pretty good considering that it only launched last year.  Companies around the world seem to be more than happy to bet on Alexa being a major success\u2014and thus reaping the lucrative potential rewards. \n\nThe big question every modular home factory and modular home builder has to ask themselves is what does Alexa \u2018tell\u2019 someone that asks about your business or your modular home? \n\nWhat you think will make a great Christmas or Birthday present for you kids will soon begin moving into every phase of your personal and business lives. \n\nHere are just some of Alexa\u2019s 'Business Skills\u2019 currently in use: \n\nEmail Management Managing emails can be time consuming. The \u2018Astrobot\u2019 skill lets you manage your Gmail or Office 365 email from your Amazon Echo. With this skill, Alexa can read, reply and manage your emails, as well as help you prioritize new ones. Additional functions include delete, archive, quick replies and more. Website Monitoring With the Vigil website monitoring skill, you can ask Alexa to report on the status of your websites. As more small businesses add more sites, knowing they are up and running at all times will ensure your customers can access your services. When a site is down, Vigil automatically sends a push notification so you can fix the problem. Managing Schedules Staying on top of your schedule when you have one too many things to do can get overwhelming. FreeBusy Scheduling Assistant uses Alexa to coordinate meetings so you never miss your appointments. You can check the availability of individuals using contacts and syncing with Microsoft Outlook and Office 365, Google Calendar, and iCloud. Finding Your Business As a modular home builder, you never know when someone is beginning the search for a new home. The Intently.co skill brings together more than 1 million service providers which could just as easily include you. All your customer will soon have to do is ask Alexa \u201cFind me a modular home builder near me\u201d , and it will connect them hopefully with you within minutes. Providing Reminders The combination of Alexa and Remember The Milk, a proven reminder app is a marriage made in digital heaven. Using this skill, you can hear what is due on a particular date. You can also add tasks for meetings, pay invoices and other tasks you might forget because of your busy schedule. You can also give tasks to your contacts on RememberTheMilk, such as reminding one of your employees to deliver something. Tracking Factory Shipments I understand that a Skill being developed for Jones Trucking will soon be available to let the company know where each of their trucks are, ETA, fuel consumption, average speed and will access the truck driver\u2019s eLog all with a simple verbal question to Alexa. The idea that a modular home builder can know instantly where the trucks carrying their customer is and the ETA should make life a little less stressful. Keeping Track of Business Travel Small business owners usually make their own travel arrangements. The Expedia for Alexa skill provides information about the entire itinerary, make reservations and reminds you what to pack. This includes details about your upcoming trips, check your flight status, book you a rental car, and even check your loyalty points. \n\nManaging Conferences Audio and video conferences play a great role in today\u2019s collaborative workforce environment. The Conference Manager skill from Vonage interfaces with Google Calendar to detect your next conference and dial it for you. By simply saying \u201cstart my call\u201d to Alexa, it will extract the conference information, dial the bridge number, meeting number, participant code and make the call.The platform also supports WebEx, Goto Meeting, BlueJeans and Vonage Business conferencing solutions. Connecting With Wunderlist Wunderlist is popular task manager app, and Task Master is a skill linking it directly to the app. Once it is linked, you can access lists to add tasks, find out what is due, view your inbox and more. Staying in Touch With Your Team SoftServe\u2019s VoiceMyBot  helps you stay in touch with your team. With a simple command to Alexa, this skill lets you listen to a user feed or a notification feed. You can listen to recent messages and check on the status of projects. Providing Business Intelligence As small businesses increase their presence digitally, being able to monitor sales, unit sales, and best or worst sales with reports provides valuable information for making informed decisions. With SalesTalk, which combines customer relationship management (CRM) and business intelligence (BI) you can use Alexa to ask for these reports. Keeping up With Google Analytics Having a website for ecommerce means using analytics to measure different metrics. Unofficial Google Analytics links with your Google analytics account and lets you get the information by asking Alexa. You can ask for the number of page views for a single day, between two dates and more. Sending SMS Texts Created by Convessa, Mastermind uses Alexa so you can send and read SMS text messages, make and answer phone calls, caller ID, find your phone, get notifications and launch apps on your mobile device and television. This skill can be used for business and personal communications. Using Slack With Alexa Slack is a collaboration tool used by businesses of all sizes. The Alexa skill from PromptWorks called Chat Bot for Slack is not created, affiliated with, or supported by Slack Technologies, Inc. However, you can link Alexa to your Slack account and post messages to communicate with your team. \nWhat is the Downside of Using Alexa? Amazon is doing all the right things to create a platform in which developers can easily create skills. This of course has led to a dramatic rise of available skills for consumers and businesses. The downside of using Alexa for businesses at this very moment is the technology is going through some growing pains. And for businesses, they can ill afford to have system in place that can be prone mistakes, no matter how few they are. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anthony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "convessa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexa slack", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wunderlist wunderlist", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "amazon echo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google analytics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "slack technologies, inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google calendar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unofficial google analytics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vonage business", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "expedia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vonage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "webex", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:46.024+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3fdb0b8cbcf511287adf564b14ea78df6aecf049", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSgu_iamq6Ha.3SFknFBETPPqQL4_8RZbwdIAOSaVMURrU.lVQlZ6O9U.FhkrKP.ZjObQa34RVslninzQxuRrrNlNmelOxMmcDDtLNA4TmnbF1FWbckntjuVxor8HSBI9Ia.btPRjpGfUomZZg9ogUl", "site_full": "ls1tech.com", "site": "ls1tech.com", "site_section": "https://ls1tech.com/forums/fueling-injection-8/", "site_categories": ["auto_racing", "vehicles", "auto_parts", "sports"], "section_title": "Fueling &amp;

This week the Seminoles sent a letter to top legislators regarding pending bills that would declare fantasy sports legal and not subject to regulation. A Senate committee is scheduled to take up one of the bills (SB 374) on Thursday. \nThe letter contends the legislation would violate the deal that allows the tribe to offer blackjack as well as slot machines at several locations. \nFlorida's attorney general in 1991 issued an opinion saying football fantasy leagues were a form of illegal gambling.

Over 450 startups applied, with 67 approved by prooV and 28 accepted by Isracard. The accepted startups received access to dedicated testing environments that included IT databases and APIs on which they ran the PoCs. The entire process from selection to evaluation took less than two months, saving Isracard significant time and money compared to traditional PoC processes.\nThree startup winners were awarded with cash prizes amounting to 400,000 NIS , and were announced as part of the Isracard prooVday closing event. TapReason , which provides an artificial intelligence-based system to maximize in-app conversion rates, won first place and a cash prize of 200,000 NIS . OverAI , which provides conversational AI for phones and communications, won second place and was awarded 120,000 NIS . Paid It , a startup that simplifies mobile payments, won third place and received 80,000 NIS .\n\"Since we started our relationship with prooV through a single PoC opportunity, our engagement has flourished into a strong and strategic partnership that relies on prooV to help us find, test-drive and roll-out the latest technologies,\" Ron Weksler , CEO of Isracard said. \"prooV has an unrivalled position to pinpoint the most innovative startups quickly, comprehensively and securely, which has culminated in the PoC competition that we've held two years running.\"\nIn addition to announcing the PoC competition winners, the Isracard prooVday closing event brought together industry experts who shared the latest insights and future predictions geared towards improving the shopping experience. Speakers included Ron Gura , Senior Vice President at WeWork, Roey Shochat , VP Sales at SplitIt, and Dorel Blitz , Head of Fintech at KPMG Israel.\n\"Organizations must prioritize technology investments to gain a competitive edge and thrive in today's cutthroat business environment - a reality that is most pertinent to highly regulated and complex industries such as financial services,\" said Toby Olshanetsky , co-founder and CEO of prooV. \"We're proud of our ongoing partnership with Isracard, and our unique ability to deliver a secure and remote testing environment to implement new technologies that support Isracard's underlying business and technology goals.\"\nAbout prooV\nprooV\u2122 ( https://proov.io ) is the first PoC-as-a-Service platform that brings together global enterprises and startups/independent software vendors to discover, connect, execute and evaluate Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) through remote, secure and data-rich testing environments. Founded by serial entrepreneurs who recognized the inefficiencies in the modern PoC process, prooV offers a radical new approach to testing, tracking and analyzing vendor solutions, accelerating the journey from RFP to PoC.\nMedia contacts\nLisette Paras\nGravitate PR\nlisette@gravitatepr.com\nPhone: +1-415-490-7613\nLiel Bari\nprooV\nliel@proov.io\nPhone: +972-72-221-0063\n ActiveOps Releases Workware\u2122 v6.1", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://assignmenteditor.com/pr-newswire-3/?rkey=20171207enUK201712064649&filter=1673", "http://paidit.io/", "https://tapreason.com/", "https://proov.io/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lisette paras", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ron gura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ron weksler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roey shochat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isracard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toby olshanetsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liel bari", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fintech", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorel blitz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kpmg israel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:46.045+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a11636351f0769c3f2bc04d59ae8abb9e5510d2f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KvZtRHOQUvzzuNjKVN5oGg4CCFOAiUZ1JONRlKypMERW3cB457o74mPZwLP90KSym9MTb05zG9cREP1758a8In5c8umOhiEg-", "site_full": "www.bendbulletin.com", "site": "bendbulletin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "A look at who might be next up in Eugene;", "title_full": "A look at who might be next up in Eugene;", "published": "2017-12-07T07:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.201, "main_image": "http://www.bendbulletin.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=N_is5nJnqnjkdx6hUCwN1c$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYv97Ymns$kWtBUav_Hb0KUFWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 93497, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a11636351f0769c3f2bc04d59ae8abb9e5510d2f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KvZtRHOQUvzzuNjKVN5oGg4CCFOAiUZ1JONRlKypMERW3cB457o74mPZwLP90KSym9MTb05zG9cREP1758a8In5c8umOhiEg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Steve Mimsthe", "published": "2017-12-07T07:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "A look at who might be next up in Eugene;", "text": "Here\u2019s a list of a few possible candidates for Oregon\u2019s football coach opening: Oregon coordinators Mario Cristobal: Oregon\u2019s co-offensive coordinator and offensive line coach under Taggart, Cristobal was hired in 2007 as the second coach ever at Florida International, which started its football program in 2002. He went 27-47 in six seasons before the school fired him following a 3-9 record in 2012. In 2010, FIU won the Sun Belt title and went 8-5 the following year to reach bowl games in back-to-back seasons. Cristobal spent four seasons as the offensive line coach at Alabama, helping the Crimson Tide win the national title in 2015 before Alabama lost to Clemson in last year\u2019s championship game. Jim Leavitt: Taggart\u2019s first hire at Oregon as defensive coordinator, Leavitt helped the Ducks rank fourth in the Pac-12 in total defense (359.8 yards per game) and seventh in scoring defense (28.2 points per game) after they were 11th in both categories the previous year. He is expected to follow Taggart to FSU, but Mullens did not rule him out as a candidate Tuesday. Leavitt was hired to start South Florida\u2019s program at the FCS level from 1997 to 2000 before the Bulls moved to FBS in 2001. He went 95-57 in 13 seasons with five bowl appearances but was fired in 2010 after being accused of hitting a player. Leavitt sued the school and received $2.75 million. The ex-Ducks Jeff Tedford: Oregon\u2019s offensive coordinator during the Joey Harrington era from 1998 to 2001, Tedford moved to Cal, where he became the winningest coach in school history with 82 victories from 2002 to 2012. After Fresno State went 1-11 last year, Tedford returned to his alma mater \u2014 where he was offensive coordinator before coming to Oregon \u2014 and led the Bulldogs to a 9-4 record, including 7-1 mark in conference play to reach the Mountain West Conference title game. Justin Wilcox: The Junction City native and former Oregon defensive back went 5-7 at Cal this season in his first season as a head coach at any level. He also is a former defensive coordinator at Washington and USC, among other schools. One of the practice fields at Oregon is named after his family: both his father, Pro Football Hall of Fame linebacker Dave, and brother Josh also starred for the Ducks. Another coordinator Beau Baldwin: Baldwin completed his first season as offensive coordinator at California after going 85-32 in nine seasons as head coach at Eastern Washington, including an FCS national title in 2010. He coached quarterback Vernon Adams Jr. for the Eagles before Adams transferred to Oregon in 2015. It seems unlikely that Oregon would hire a coach who was reportedly passed up by Oregon State. Group of 5 coaches Bryan Harsin: Hiring the Boise State coach would add some interest to the Las Vegas Bowl, where the Ducks will face the Broncos on Dec. 16. Harsin seems likely to get a Power 5 job soon after going 41-12 in four seasons as coach. He led Boise State to the MWC title for the second time this year with a 7-1 record in conference, going 10-3 overall and defeating Fresno State in last week\u2019s conference championship game. Mike Norvell: The former Arizona State offensive coordinator from 2012 to 2015 took Memphis to the American Athletic Association title game in his second year before losing to Central Florida, 62-55, in double overtime. Has gone 20-7 in two seasons with the Tigers, including a 7-1 conference record this season. Lane Kiffin: After Florida Atlantic went 3-9 last season, Kiffin was hired and led the Owls to a 10-3 mark and Conference USA championship. He spent the previous three seasons as offensive coordinator at Alabama, reaching the CFP championship game twice, including a national title in 2015. Attention and controversy seem to follow the 42-year-old, who coached the Oakland Raiders before taking over programs at Tennessee and USC, but Kiffin seems certain to be moving up to a bigger program soon. Fallen stars Kevin Sumlin: Sumlin went 51-26 in six seasons at Texas A&M before being fired last month after the Aggies finished 7-5. In his first season, Texas A&M went 11-2 and quarterback Johnny Manziel won the Heisman Trophy, but the Aggies never finished above .500 in Southeastern Conference play during his final five seasons. Sumlin\u2019s first coaching job came as a graduate assistant at Washington State in 1989, but he has spent the past 17 seasons coaching in Texas or Oklahoma. Considering Taggart fled to Florida after one season, Mullens may not want to bring in another coach who could leave for a southern school if he finds success with the Ducks. Butch Jones: Jones became one of the nation\u2019s top coaching candidates after going 19-6 at Cincinnati in 2011-12. Colorado wanted Jones before he chose Tennessee, which fired him after a 4-6 start this season. He won nine games the previous two seasons with the Volunteers and went 34-27 in five years on the job. Tennessee went winless in the SEC this year. Bret Bielema: Another coach who had plenty of success in the past but recently joined the unemployment line after going 4-8 at Arkansas, Bielema went 29-34 in five seasons with the Razorbacks, including an 11-29 record in the SEC. He won 68 games in seven seasons as coach at Wisconsin from 2006 to 2012 and led the Badgers to three straight Rose Bowls, including a 45-38 loss to Oregon in the 2012 game. Les Miles: Somebody is going to hire Miles, who won the national title at LSU in 2008 and was national coach of the year in 2011 when the Tigers lost to Alabama in the championship game. He went 114-34 in 12 seasons with the Tigers and has a 142-55 record, including four seasons at Oklahoma State. EUGENE \u2014 The Oregon Ducks quickly promoted Mario Cristobal to interim head coach for the Las Vegas Bowl after Willie Taggart left for Florida State on Tuesday. Cristobal, the former Florida International coach, appears to be one of many candidates for the full-time job. Ducks coaching possibilities Here\u2019s a list of a few possible candidates for Oregon\u2019s football coach opening: Oregon coordinators Mario Cristobal: Oregon\u2019s co-offensive coordinator and offensive line coach under Taggart, Cristobal was hired in 2007 as the second coach ever at Florida International, which started its football program in 2002.

He spent the previous three seasons as offensive coordinator at Alabama, reaching the CFP championship game twice, including a national title in 2015. Attention and controversy seem to follow the 42-year-old, who coached the Oakland Raiders before taking over programs at Tennessee and USC, but Kiffin seems certain to be moving up to a bigger program soon. Fallen stars Kevin Sumlin: Sumlin went 51-26 in six seasons at Texas A&M before being fired last month after the Aggies finished 7-5. In his first season, Texas A&M went 11-2 and quarterback Johnny Manziel won the Heisman Trophy, but the Aggies never finished above .500 in Southeastern Conference play during his final five seasons. Sumlin\u2019s first coaching job came as a graduate assistant at Washington State in 1989, but he has spent the past 17 seasons coaching in Texas or Oklahoma. Considering Taggart fled to Florida after one season, Mullens may not want to bring in another coach who could leave for a southern school if he finds success with the Ducks. Butch Jones: Jones became one of the nation\u2019s top coaching candidates after going 19-6 at Cincinnati in 2011-12. Colorado wanted Jones before he chose Tennessee, which fired him after a 4-6 start this season. He won nine games the previous two seasons with the Volunteers and went 34-27 in five years on the job. Tennessee went winless in the SEC this year. Bret Bielema: Another coach who had plenty of success in the past but recently joined the unemployment line after going 4-8 at Arkansas, Bielema went 29-34 in five seasons with the Razorbacks, including an 11-29 record in the SEC. He won 68 games in seven seasons as coach at Wisconsin from 2006 to 2012 and led the Badgers to three straight Rose Bowls, including a 45-38 loss to Oregon in the 2012 game. Les Miles: Somebody is going to hire Miles, who won the national title at LSU in 2008 and was national coach of the year in 2011 when the Tigers lost to Alabama in the championship game. He went 114-34 in 12 seasons with the Tigers and has a 142-55 record, including four seasons at Oklahoma State. View More Oregon athletic director Rob Mullens is seeking a football coach for the second year in a row after pulling Taggart out of South Florida last year only to see him head back home with the Seminoles after a 7-5 season with the Ducks. Mullens hired Taggart on Dec. 7 last year, eight days after firing Mark Helfrich. There is a greater sense of urgency this season because of the new NCAA early signing period for recruits that runs Dec. 20-22. Taggart compiled a recruiting class ranked No. 1 in the country by 247Sports.com, but after the coach\u2019s departure, Oregon has already lost some players who had committed to the program. Because of that, the next coach will have to be hired quickly to keep as many commitments as possible. Some candidates who might have intrigued Mullens are off the market, including former \u00adOregon offensive coordinator Scott Frost, who was hired by Nebraska on Saturday after he took Central Florida from winless to undefeated in two seasons. TCU\u2019s Gary Patterson has been rumored to be on Oregon\u2019s radar during each of the past two coaching searches because of his friendship with UO boosters Phil Knight and Pat Kilkenny. Patterson, however, just signed an extension through 2022 that will pay him nearly $5 million per year. Last year, Oregon reportedly showed interest in Florida coach Jim McElwain and Ohio State defensive coordinator Greg Schiano. They probably are not on Mullens\u2019 list this time: McElwain was fired in October when the Gators were 3-4. Tennessee was ready to hire Schiano last month before fans protested because he was on the staff at Penn State with former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted of sexually abusing children. 18945460 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sumlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vernon adams

All you need to do is to cut the biscuits lengthwise into halves as they\u2019re quite thick, then melt some butter with garlic and herbs and brush this delicious mixture on the biscuit halves and stack them on top of each other and put them together in a loaf pan. \nPretty simple to do, right? \nNow, it\u2019s important to make stacks of four so you can pick them up easily. Make all the stacks and then move them into the loaf pan and adjust them. \nI always say this: be generous with garlic. You can never have too much garlic, my friends. A couple of garlic cloves won\u2019t be enough and garlic powder won\u2019t do justice. \nI made this easy garlic cheese pull apart bread using Immaculate Baking organic biscuits . Immaculate Baking Company uses real and wholesome ingredients to make its products. They also have gluten-free products so there\u2019s something for everyone to love. \nImmaculate Baking has made it its mission to create wholesome baking products \u2013 most of which are certified gluten free or organic. That\u2019s why it\u2019s my go-to for the holidays! Notes and Tips to make garlic cheese pull apart bread: Use a pairing knife to cut the biscuits into halves length wise.
