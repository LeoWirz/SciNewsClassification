We were both in the semis. I said if we both get through, I can\u2019t have this coming out, or if it is into the last week of the season. I could lose out on a place in the cup final team, or it could throw me massively. \n\"It was a very bad week for me and a stressful time. \n\"Ten days from the cup final, we had lifted the league trophy and to be honest, there was a small section and I\u2019d say very small, maybe 15 people in the Cork end that were actually booing me. \n\"This stuff [speculation] was seeping out. People were giving me a bit of abuse. \n\"We were lifting the trophy in front of the Shed and I thought, you know what, I\u2019ll let it off. I didn\u2019t want to take away from what was happening on the pitch that day.\" \nIn the week leading up to the cup final, Kenny was asked about signing Sheppard and said: \"I\u2019m not going to put him in an awkward situation but it\u2019s not something I\u2019m going to deny either at this stage. I\u2019m not going to lie to you.\" \n\"Going into the cup final, more came out, and it went from bad to worse,\" said Sheppard. \n\"John [Caulfield] had a meeting with the players on the Thursday, sat everyone around and said, \u2018look lads, we need to address the elephant in the room. Shep, it seems, is leaving us. He\u2019s been great, but I trust him to do the business on Sunday\u2019. \n\"Going into the game there was a massive load of pressure on me. If I was having a bad first half I was off. \n\"[The players] knew the only reason I was going to sign for Dundalk was the fact that my girlfriend has a little one and she is in Dublin and wouldn\u2019t be able to come up and down to Cork so much. \n\"That was the only reason I was going to leave. Thankfully that situation has changed. \n\"I knew going into the cup final I wasn\u2019t leaving. The stress drained out of me after the full-time whistle.\" \nSheppard says that Kenny took his decision not to switch with good grace \n\"I made the decision on the Friday. I spoke to Stephen the day before I signed back with Cork. I said to him, \u2018look Stephen, I think you went against what we spoke about'. \n\"He said that he didn\u2019t want it to come out that way, that it wasn\u2019t his intention in not denying it.

It is never nice to lose a game. \n\"But we have said many times we cannot win all the time, we are going to lose games. We needed to lose a game. \n\"It will be good for the club, for all of us and the media. People say things when you win a lot and you can forget that now. \n\"We saw many good things but we made mistakes and we are going to improve on that. Football is how you recover in the good moments and bad moments to stay stable.\" \nGuardiola handed opportunities to 17-year-old Phil Foden, who made his full debut, and 20-year-old defender Tosin Adarabioyo. Brahim Diaz, 18, also appeared as a second-half substitute. \nGuardiola said: \"We played to win until the end. We did a good performance and young players like Tosin (Adarabioyo), Phil (Foden), Brahim (Diaz) played really well. \n\"Players like Yaya (Toure) and (Ilkay) Gundogan made a good performance as well and Bernardo (Silva) was brilliant. We created chances. Now it's about recovery and preparing for the next game.\" \nThere was some fun after the game as Shakhtar coach Paulo Fonseca, who was recently linked with Everton, fulfilled a promise to hold a press conference dressed as Zorro if his team reached the last 16. \nShakhtar's victory secured second place in the group and Fonseca donned the black hat, mask and cape of the swashbuckling fictional character to perform media duties. \n\"This is the most joyful press conference of my career,\" the Portuguese said. \nReflecting on his side's performance, he said: \"We played an almost ideal game. I feel great joy. \n\"I think not only Shakhtar's supporters but all Ukrainians have to be proud of our team. Twelve points in such a group is fantastic.\" View Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "silva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brahim diaz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brahim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ismaily", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paulo fonseca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tosin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zorro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tosin adarabioyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fonseca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sergio aguero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phil foden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yaya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pep guardiola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guardiola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernardo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diaz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toure", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gundogan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "manchester city", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "city '", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arsenal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shakhtar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester united", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "everton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shakhtar donetsk", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "metalist stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kharkiv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "old trafford", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:17.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9c7cb9f5c5271e8587f8315f7e018e91e3d69113", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQApyRnPnOVUizlV.FSHhYBRkZYo3jaNWhlerKm6FL6PA--", "site_full": "vk.com", "site": "vk.com", "site_section": "https://vk.com/koskamalenkaya", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "\u041a \u041e \u0421 \u042c \u041a \u0410", "title": "\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0451\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0451\u043d\u043a\u0430 Kiska Zhenya", "title_full": "\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0451\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0451\u043d\u043a\u0430 Kiska Zhenya", "published": "2017-12-07T05:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "RU", "spam_score": 0.532, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 21, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f7aa9a55c9cc22a4bfa9f032f259d2ca8df4dfc9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQApyRnPnOVUizlV.FSHhYBRkZYo3jaNWhgqqIswSD5ga2Ck_o82L2l", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Violetta Bayramgulova", "published": "2017-12-07T05:31:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "\u041a\u0438\u043d\u044c\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b \u043f\u043b\u0438\u0449", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:17.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bd4abe12c4f1429e5861eb5a93db786da2fdd193", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSNDPCVJlPfxMwNymexRPe57DGty4avXKPHp4FGH4ZGQwUyUVWtqEwUrUqiY2vo3aWV6cRogQUqa8Ar07HF3ANGglaA246BOetjp1KHUopoB.tkan0XUosx", "site_full": "www.rte.ie", "site": "rte.ie", "site_section": "http://www.rte.ie/rss/soccer.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "RT\u00c9 Sport soccer", "title": "All my lovin' -

What can I say? I like them all. I'm really happy with our performance. We played fantastic football. In a team game you need everyone.\" \nCoutinho led the way with his first Liverpool hat-trick with Mane scoring twice, Firmino and Salah got the others. \nIt meant Liverpool topped Group E and avoided the likes of PSG, Barcelona and Roma but could still draw Bayern Munich, Juventus or Real Madrid. \nIt's a daunting prospect, but on this form, no one will fancy the Merseysiders either. Reflecting on his team's chances of going all the way, Klopp said: \"If we perform like this tonight, if we are that clinical, then yes. \n\"But we had the same players already and they didn't score (in some previous games). \n\"If we perform like this then it is obviously a threat, 100 %. If you see how Dom Solanke performed in Stoke, how Daniel Sturridge performed when he came on, he could have scored two or three, he made a goal for Sadio, that's good. \n\"We knew if we won we would top the group so that's not the biggest surprise but I think it's strange this year in the group stages. \n\"There are a lot of really strong teams. This year is quite special. Not often you can face Bayern Munich and Real Madrid, but Juventus and all the others. \n\"Antonio Conte (Chelsea manager) said it yesterday there are no easy opponents and I don't think anyone is happy when they get us in the draw. \n\"We will not be happy when we see who we face in the next round, but we will be ready.\" \nSpartak boss Massimo Carrera struggled to defend his side's performance. \n\"I can't explain this. Liverpool were better in everything: in quality, in anger, in passion. It seems like we're not yet ready for such big games,\" he said. \n\"We had enough chances to return into the game after conceding the first goal but we couldn't.\" View Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jurgen klopp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "klopp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sadio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roberto firmino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coutinho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mo salah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony o'donoghue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippe coutinho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel sturridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massimo carrera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "firmino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dom solanke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antonio conte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sadio mane", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "spartak moscow  liverpool", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liverpool", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "psg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "real madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris st-germain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rt\u00e9 sport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juventus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bayern munich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelsea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merseysiders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spartak moscow", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tottenham", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:17.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cba4e55aab6982ec9956ddcac9cfc4ed0751b502", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdJ7iQZMIbduWWP_OBLHElcOxFZi55sBqleQEKT0jC2Hm.ldeVTAPZ0bM3C7SRrjG.d2tA.4ZrY4rT2hnWAGAMC5Dl3MxdmExI-", "site_full": "castwb.com", "site": "castwb.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["credit_debt_and_loans", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Too Many Children in California Can\u2019t Read, Lawsuit Claims \u2013 Castwb", "title_full": "Too Many Children in California Can\u2019t Read, Lawsuit Claims \u2013 Castwb", "published": "2017-12-07T12:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.724, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cba4e55aab6982ec9956ddcac9cfc4ed0751b502", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdJ7iQZMIbduWWP_OBLHElcOxFZi55sBqleQEKT0jC2Hm.ldeVTAPZ0bM3C7SRrjG.d2tA.4ZrY4rT2hnWAGAMC5Dl3MxdmExI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Thomas Smith", "published": "2017-12-07T12:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "Too Many Children in California Can\u2019t Read, Lawsuit Claims \u2013 Castwb", "text": "Finance Too Many Children in California Can\u2019t Read, Lawsuit Claims \u201cIn the meantime, children in underserved districts fall further behind and lack even the most basic literacy skills,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the state to be held accountable for the success of every student.\u201d The state of California, its Education Department and Board, and the superintendent of public instruction, Tom Torlakson, were named as defendants in the lawsuit. A spokesman for the Education Department, Bill Ainsworth, had no comment on the lawsuit. But he said that California had one of the nation\u2019s \u201cmost ambitious\u201d programs to serve low-income students, and that it was investing more than $10 billion annually to help underserved students. The state also collects data to help educators figure out where to target resources, he said, adding that 228 districts will receive additional support next year, including the three schools named in the suit. Last year, the schoolwide proficiency rate in reading at La Salle Elementary was 4 percent, and as many as 171 students out of the 179 tested were not proficient by state standards, the lawsuit says. One was an 11-year-old boy who tested at an early third-grade reading level when he was finishing fifth grade. The schoolwide reading-proficiency rate was 6 percent at Van Buren, which is in the Stockton Unified School District, the third-lowest performing large district in the nation. One student there, who is now 14, read at a second-grade level when he was in seventh grade, the lawsuit says. At Children of Promise, the reading-proficiency rate was 11 percent in the 2016-17 school year. In one classroom, teachers used an audio version of a social studies paper because students were unable to read it.

READ MORE Islamic terror plot to assassinate British PM May thwarted Naa'imur Zakariyah Rahman, 20, from north London, was charged with preparing acts of terrorism and assisting Mohammed Aqib Imran in terror planning. Imran, 21, from Birmingham, was charged with preparing acts of terrorism. A media report on Sky News said the prosecutor in court Wednesday morning outlined details of the case against the two men, alleging that Rahman had planned to use a bomb in a carrier bag to blow open the security gates at Downing Street, with an intention to then gain access to 10 Downing Street to kill May with a knife. It was claimed he also intended to wear a suicide vest. During a seven-minute hearing, the two accused only spoke to confirm their names, ages and addresses. Both men were detained on Nov. 28 during raids by armed officers from the Met's Counter Terrorism Command.

In this regard, the company has today received expressions of interest in certain non-core assets that will release a minimum of \u20ac1bn of liquidity,\u201d Steinhoff said. \n\u201cIn addition, the company\u2019s subsidiary Steinhoff Africa Retail Limited (STAR) will today formally commit to the refinancing of its long-term liabilities due to the company.\u201d \nThe additional liquidity of about \u20ac2 billion (about R36 billion) expected to be achieved through these measures would strengthen the company\u2019s balance sheet and should provide additional comfort to stakeholders of its ability to fund its existing operations and reduce debt, it added. \nSteinhoff said earlier this week its supervisory board had approached accounting firm PWC to perform an independent investigation after information came to light suggesting accounting irregularities. \nIt said the board had accepted Jooste's resignation with immediate effect and urged shareholders and other investors to exercise caution when dealing in the group\u2019s securities. \nOn Thursday, South Africa's Public Servants Association (PSA), which represents more than 230 000 members of the Government Employees\u2019 Pension Fund (GEPF), said it was intensifying the call to safeguard public servants\u2019 pension investments in the wake of the Steinhoff fallout. \n\"The GEPF is the biggest single investor in the JSE and losses because of share-price drops on the JSE following the Steinhoff disaster are still unknown, but are expected to be severe,\" PSA deputy General Manager Tahir Maepa said. \n\"It is claimed that members of the Fund may have lost about R12.5 billion through losses in investments in Steinhoff.,\" Maepa added, saying the PSA would seek to verify this. \nSteinhoff cancelled the announcement of company results that had been scheduled for Wednesday, and said it would publish audited 2017 consolidated financial statements when in a position to do so. \nIn its latest statement, the company said group CFO La Grange would remain in his position. \nSteinhoff, which has its origins in Germany, but is based in South Africa, is a global furniture and household goods retailer with more than 40 brands in over 30 countries .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "markus jooste", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tahir maepa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siphiwe sibeko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maepa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steinhoff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben la grange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jooste", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "public servants association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "government employees\u2019 pension fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cfo la grange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steinhoff africa retail limited", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nnesburg stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pwc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "psa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gauteng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:18.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4275244ff576756075e8a713e9fc42f28149dd7f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.04W1im.9w88EKRQrOStzEfjbfxwrbbuU1YpkBm7KT0Z8HEm53QMwdZPZLzMm4SY3WHrYOjN5XOkBJkO_9Nqk8ap1yed0PKhA754t1K255iQ--", "site_full": "www.asianfilmvault.com", "site": "asianfilmvault.com", "site_section": "http://www.asianfilmvault.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Asian Film Vault", "title": "Forgetting Vietnam (2015) by Trinh T.

Minh-ha", "text": "Made in commemoration of the 40th anniversary from the end of the war between US and Vietnam, the documentary presents a thorough analysis of the latter, in a documentary that implements, once more, Trinh T. Minh-ha's experimental approach. \n\n. The film is part of  ICA's retrospective of Trinh T. Minh-ha , that will be on December 2 until 9.  \n\nVietnam in ancient times was named \u0111\u1ea5t n\u1ee9\u1edbc v\u1ea1n xu\u00e2n\u2013the land of ten thousand springs. One of the myths surrounding the creation of Vietnam involves a fight between two dragons whose intertwined bodies fell into the South China Sea and formed Vietnam\u2019s curving \u2018S\u2019 shaped coastline. Legend also has it that Vietnam\u2019s ancestors were born from the union of a Dragon King, L\u1ea1c Long Qu\u00e2n and a fairy, \u00c2u C\u01a1. \u00c2u C\u01a1was a mythical bird that swallowed a handful of earthly soil and consequently lost the power to return to the 36th Heaven. Her tears formed Vietnam\u2019s myriad rivers and the country\u2019s recurring floods are the land\u2019s way of remembering her. \n\nIn her geo-political situation, Vietnam thrives on a fragile equilibrium between land and water management. These two elements \u2013earth (\u0111\u1ea5t) and water (n\u1ee9\u1edbc) \u2013form the two main structural threads that run through \"Forgetting Vietnam\", with images of the people and their related activities accordingly featured. Water has always played a vital role in Vietnamese culture. Its life-sustaining power is evoked in the widest range of mythical stories as the latter act on people\u2019s daily lives.\n\n\nTrinh highlights all of the above in the documentary, through a number of videos and photos, shot in Hi-8 video in 1995 and in HD and SD in 2012, in a slideshow that could be interpreted as a tour guide of the backbone of Vietnam. The various footage are quite impressive, as Trinh moves from the country to the urban settings and vice versa, all the while intermingling image with history and myth, with the latter deriving not from narration, as is usual the case, but from writings that are presented on screen. These writings include famous sayings of the country, historic and geopolitical information, and various myths of the country. This approach is quite original, and I found out that it works quite well in the general context, as it allows the spectator to focus on the image and the local music that permeates the film. In that fashion, Trinh's own editing serves this approach to the fullest. \n\nTrinh does not forget to show elements of culture and entertainment, with the water puppet theatre being one of the most impressive. At the same time, the blights of the country (the export of human labor, human trafficking, and the sex trade) are also mentioned, making the presentation of Vietnam even more thorough. \n\n\nAnother focal point is the history of the war between USA and Vietnam, with the director making an effort not to let the catastrophic events be forgotten, thus fulfilling one of the main purposes of the documentary as a medium. At the same time, since, as I mentioned before, the film functions as a tour guide of the country, it also succeeds to the fullest in that aspect, since, after watching the documentary, I am sure that the audience will feel a need to visit Vietnam. At least that is what I felt.\n\n\"Forgetting Vietnam\" is a very interesting spectacle in experimental fashion, as it succeeds in all its purposes despite its rather unusual approach to the medium. \n\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trinh t. minh-ha made", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trinh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trinh t. minh-ha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l\u1ea1c long qu\u00e2n", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dragon king", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vietnam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south china sea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:18.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "72aea7fe30ecab56a8e3641fb6a309f64f779505", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacHHgfO4E22FtYUloa8o4MhsK3CPAnsGLZI6tv1PbBt631xkEn1URmfg--", "site_full": "www.nairaland.com", "site": "nairaland.com", "site_section": "http://www.nairaland.com/phones", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Phones - Nigeria - Nairaland", "title": "Infinix Zero 5 Vs Infinix Zero 4 Plus Camera Comparison(with PICS)", "title_full": "Infinix Zero 5 Vs Infinix Zero 4 Plus Camera Comparison(with PICS) - Phones - Nigeria", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.026, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 951, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "864da2c8a8d3741d793365fea9b362043aabdb47", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacHHgfO4E22FtYUloa8o4MhsK3CPAnsGLZI6tv1PbBt633R0FU9MHk3ycvEIVcTvVr", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "allstarcomic", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Driver please lets goo.\nThis is not a bus stop for me. 2 Likes Re: Infinix Zero 5 Vs Infinix Zero 4 Plus Camera Comparison(with PICS) by theapeman : 10:18am On Dec 07 All this agents!\nYou think I don't know what you did!\nYou tweak the zero 4 camera to a lower resolution 3 Likes Re: Infinix Zero 5 Vs Infinix Zero 4 Plus Camera Comparison(with PICS) by bamac ( m ): 10:18am On Dec 07 All i know is that you can make your orders on Jumia through me.

Prosecutors say Melgen, a prominent Florida eye doctor who was accused of bribing New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, should get a 30-year sentence for Medicare fraud. A three-day sentencing hearing for Melgen is scheduled to begin Tuesday, Dec. 5, 2017, in West Palm Beach on 67 counts. Prosecutors say the 63-year-old doctor stole more than $100 million from the federal government. He was convicted in April after a 2 1/2- month trial. Palm Beach Post via AP, File Lannis Water Prosecutors insist eye doc stole $136 million from Medicaid By TERRY SPENCER Associated Press December 07, 2017 05:58 PM UPDATED 7 MINUTES AGO WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \nEither Dr. Salomon Melgen is one of the biggest Medicare swindlers ever, stealing more than $100 million from the federal health care program, or a penny ante thief who walked off with $64,000. \nThose were the widely contrasting arguments made Thursday by prosecutors and Melgen's defense attorneys as they tried to persuade U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra to sentence the Dominican-born, Harvard-trained doctor to 30 years or something significantly less. \nProsecutors are seeking 30 years. They say the doctor subjected elderly patients to painful tests and treatments they didn't need, for diseases they didn't have, to support a vacation home in his native Dominican Republic, lavish trips to Europe and outside business interests. The government also says he bribed New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney Alexandra Chase told Marra that Melgen's practice was so \"permeated\" with fraud that the judge should accept the government's estimate. Chase said even if the 63-year-old Melgen stole just $65 million \u2014 about half as much \u2014 he would be eligible for a life sentence. She pointed to Melgen often seeing more than 100 patients a day, and his employees performing in seconds tests that normally take 10 minutes or more, making them useless for diagnosis but allowing the doctor to bill Medicare for them.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \n\"The system was set up to maximize fraud,\" she said. \nMelgen's attorneys argued that the government only proved Melgen stole about $64,000, the amount they will concede was falsely charged for 30 patients who stood in during the trial as a representative sample of the more than 2,000 Melgen saw between 2008 and 2013, most of them numerous times. They say the selection of those patients came from a larger sample of 310 that wasn't random but cherry-picked and any extrapolation from those samples should be thrown out. They want a short sentence, perhaps even time served. \nJosh Sheptow portrayed his client as ahead of his time, injecting patients with then-experimental drugs that are now approved. Medicare does not pay for experimental treatments, noted Sheptow, who suggested Melgen may have falsified billing statements to get around those restrictions. That would still be fraud, Sheptow said, but he said the treatments were legitimate and therefore the government didn't lose anything with many of his patients. \nA jury found Melgen guilty of 67 counts last April after a two-month trial, including health care fraud, submitting false claims and falsifying records in patients' files. \nHe is charged separately with bribing Menendez in exchange for interceding with the Medicare officials investigating his practice and other favors, including getting visas for his foreign mistresses. A federal jury in New Jersey hung on that case last month, and prosecutors there have not said whether they will retry them. \nMelgen's attorneys rested much of their sentencing argument on the doctor's use of the drug Lucentis between 2008 and 2013. During most of that time, Medicare approved its use only for wet age-related macular degeneration or ARMD, a retinal disease that can cause blindness. \nLucentis is injected in tiny doses \u2014 0.5 milliliters, or a sixty-fourth of a teaspoon. It comes in single-use vials that contain four times that amount \u2014 a sixteenth of a teaspoon. The manufacturer's instructions say doctors should pull the vial's entire contents into the syringe and then squeeze out and dispose of the excess \u2014 about a thirtieth of a teaspoon \u2014 before administering the injection. Medicare reimburses doctors their wholesale cost of $1,900 per vial plus a 6 percent surcharge, $114. \nMelgen used each vial for three or four injections, charging Medicare $2,014 each time. Prosecutors say the two or three extra injections were theft. Melgen's attorneys argue that he cost the Medicare program no extra money by avoiding what he would have spent buying more vials. \nMelgen also administered the drug to patients who did not have wet ARMD, although he told Medicare they did. Sheptow suggested that the patients had diabetic-related sight loss, types of which Lucentis is now authorized for. He said Melgen and other eye doctors knew Lucentis worked on those diseases and suggested Melgen gave a false diagnosis to Medicare to be reimbursed for a treatment he knew was effective, even if it wasn't yet approved. That might be fraud, he said, but Medicare lost no money because its mission of providing medical care to the elderly was met. \nWhat had been a scheduled as a three-day hearing that started Tuesday will now need a fourth, possibly later this month or in January, as the sides did not finish their presentations. Marra has said he will then need time to process the information before pronouncing sentence.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salomon melgen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melgen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenneth marra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "medicare", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s district", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:18.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1d465b8ba449d05b303e4acd310a180eb10c8d8c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvisg_n.T6Md6uMjw93wN5RbrRa0gYRUr4XUJ5Db1F7ivBAymPIa5lZKyxHgk8D_S9JCf8m2ZlM.mLlZfeO8nxA.B8_pa9K6xhDeHkWrNnLMV3fUDLcErCxNMmqQifcEYkJWxxYWaYUaq8gjmyAcnqFNU.vMQjdutBGBwxA4ExDB4bPaKOd_ReQCj_yqLDBo0P", "site_full": "www.4-traders.com", "site": "4-traders.com", "site_section": "http://www.4-traders.com/rss/FeedNews.php", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Stock market news - Company News  - 4-Traders.com", "title": "The US Convenience Store Market: Size, Trends & Forecasts (2017 Edition) - Research and Markets", "title_full": "The US Convenience Store Market: Size, Trends & Forecasts (2017 Edition) - Research and Markets", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27554, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "34f36b56e4a6006855678d209ede4f1335e151dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvisg_n.T6Md6uMjw93wN5RbrRa0gYRUr4XUJ5Db1F7ivBAymPIa5lZKyxHgk8D_S9JCf8m2ZlM.mLlZfeO8nxA.B8_pa9K6xhDeHkWrNnLMV3fUDLcErCxNMmqQifcEYkJWxxYWaYUaozm1UFjbC0ig--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "www.4-traders.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "The US Convenience Store Market: Size, Trends & Forecasts (2017 Edition) - Research and Markets", "text": "The \"The US Convenience Store Market: Size, Trends & Forecasts (2017 Edition)\" report has been added to Research and Markets' offering. \nA convenience store is a form of kiosk or a small retail business which is opened as a part of gas stations in the US.

At the time of writing, this scheme is not in operation but soon will be. \nLRIS is meant to simplify investment choice for CPF members. Although the CPFIS has good intentions (to provide members with a wider range of investment options), the take-up rate under this scheme has been dismal. For example, as of Q3, 2017, only 1,252 members were CPFIS investors. Their total investment amounted to only $22 billion, a paltry sum compared to the aggregate OA and SA balance of $215 billion. Thus, many members prefer to leave their money with the CPF Board than invest it for higher returns. This is a pity because properly invested, CPF savings can be a valuable source of retirement income. In particular, asset classes like equities provide higher average returns than cash, a", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "lris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cpf board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cpf", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:19.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "60636bd4e9770ab84da6ecfc51e84744b2ce697a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvv5X8Ali4h5tiTF6ercR3S_IHR1beQSX7Rj305i3NkjK_qVxTV4AtXb2mORHRZyIABkg2t_DSmXE_oLWjU2i.BKmgAyC5PZo4hCu54T4nS7Qx.lsxJKD6_0WCyqY3KHdknoi0GOCM3AaR80HYeFtr6zO2KVtMTQ8aLLR7O6LGYH3Y-", "site_full": "www.4-traders.com", "site": "4-traders.com", "site_section": "http://www.4-traders.com/rss/FeedNews.php", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Stock market news - Company News  - 4-Traders.com", "title": "Neustar Launches Next Generation DDoS Defense Network: SiteProtect NG", "title_full": "Neustar Launches Next Generation DDoS Defense Network: SiteProtect NG", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27554, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e1195bc423b22c5f2fd8e058f7e5e0644bfe5954", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvv5X8Ali4h5tiTF6ercR3S_IHR1beQSX7Rj305i3NkjK_qVxTV4AtXb2mORHRZyIABkg2t_DSmXE_oLWjU2i.BKmgAyC5PZo4hCu54T4nS7QyohsknMqZ6lw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "www.4-traders.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Neustar Launches Next Generation DDoS Defense Network: SiteProtect NG", "text": "Dec 7, 2017 \nDefense system upgraded to protect enterprises from the next evolution of DDoS and application attacks \n\nNeustar , Inc. , a trusted, neutral provider of real-time information services , today launched SiteProtect NG \u2122 (Next Generation), its new solution to protect brands against DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks . It is the latest wave of the company's purpose-built DDoS mitigation solution designed to meet the security requirements of all brands, on-premise and in the cloud, to deal with the next generation of cyber threats. This powerful upgrade adds Neustar's state of the art WAF (web application firewall) solution to the award-winning Neustar SiteProtect solution to extend network protection to the application layer. A new real-time user interface provides consolidated in-depth trend analysis and gives brands unprecedented access to attack forensics that are not currently available through traditional defense services. \n'Years of experience and cybersecurity engineering capabilities have gone into the development of the SiteProtect NG defense network and operating portal,' said Barrett Lyon, Vice President, Research and Development, Neustar Security Solutions. 'Neustar is investing in the future of DDoS defense from an architectural standpoint and sees the expansion and closer integration of its security solutions portfolio as a long term strategic commitment for the company.' \n'Neustar's clients have the best protection, best user experience, broadest selection of configurations, and powerful analytics at their disposal. DDoS attacks will continue to present brands across the globe with significant challenges to their operational efficiency for the foreseeable future, and our investment in mitigation solutions will continue at pace,' added Lyon. \nSiteProtect NG breaks with the tradition of designing network protection that makes use of a high volume of small scrubbing centers with fewer, highly fortified and highly connected locations. SiteProtect NG network has deployed large, full scale, nodes, each with its multi-terabit scrubbing capacity in North America, Europe, and Asia with South America, Africa, Australia, and India slated for early 2018. \n'DDoS attacks reached unprecedented levels in 2017 and all trends Neustar is mapping indicate that 2018 is going to see the situation worsen dramatically. Cybercriminals, both private and state funded, have the wherewithal to surgically target individual brands, or initiate brute force attacks with the potential to cause catastrophic damage on a global scale. For many cybersecurity professionals, there is no respite, with attackers probing and often breaching defenses on a daily basis,' commented Rodney Joffe, Senior Vice President and Fellow, Neustar. \n'Future proofing mitigation networks to stop attacks before they reach their target destination will save brands billions each year from the impact of DDoS attacks. Neustar's R&D spend is reflective of the very real need to continually innovate in the face of such adversity and today protects thousands of brands from an increasingly diverse threat landscape. SiteProtect NG is a product that leverages the latest innovations in internet security and evolves to meet existing and future requirements.' \nNeustar is giving clients more control and more functionality to build stronger defenses for their brands against DDoS attacks than ever before. The SiteProtect NG mitigation network combines innovative technologies and advancements from existing Neustar security solutions with powerful data traffic analytics powered by machine learning data analytics. This gives brands in-depth trend and attack analysis, leaving them with invaluable insights, which enable them to make smarter decisions about the configuration of their network security moving forward. \nNeuStar Inc. published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 10:06:10 UTC . \nOriginal document https://www.home.neustar/about-us/news-room/press-releases/2017/SiteProtectNG \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/39236F3010D15C4A11D5179792987DD8CE745CA8", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barrett lyon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rodney joffe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "neustar", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "research and development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neustar , inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neustar inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neustar security solutions", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lyon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:19.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "72aea7fe30ecab56a8e3641fb6a309f64f779505", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacHHgfO4E22FtYUloa8o4MhsK3CPAnsGLZI6tv1PbBt631xkEn1URmfg--", "site_full": "www.nairaland.com", "site": "nairaland.com", "site_section": "http://www.nairaland.com/phones", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Phones - Nigeria - Nairaland", "title": "Infinix Zero 5 Vs Infinix Zero 4 Plus Camera Comparison(with PICS)", "title_full": "Infinix Zero 5 Vs Infinix Zero 4 Plus Camera Comparison(with PICS) - Phones - Nigeria", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.026, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 951, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b787e440d356f86be9c03a123df128694cb9dcad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacHHgfO4E22FtYUloa8o4MhsK3CPAnsGLZI6tv1PbBt633R0FU9MHk33VEpsdJ.hLM", "ord_in_thread": 11, "author": "desire01", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "the infinix zero 5 is obviously better than zero 4 in light conditions but not better in low light conditions 1 Like Re: Infinix Zero 5 Vs Infinix Zero 4 Plus Camera Comparison(with PICS) by firstolalekan ( m ): 10:23am On Dec 07 INFINIX NA PHONE?

The latest controversy is it's designed to circumvent the BS/Core developers while implementing their controversial changes funded by AXA, the second largest transnational corporation on the planet.\nI'll put it this way: There is a hostile takeover happening in bitcoin one side wants to change the white paper and introduce new rules and incentives without addressing the trade-offs, the other wants to remove the limit and let bitcoin function as described in the original bitcoin white paper . see sections 2 and 5 - valid transactions are chains of signatures and blocks are not invalidated because they exceed 1,000,000 bytes, the rule that rejects them is counterproductive and does not need the support of the Nodes doing the \"Work\" that is required to write a block of transactions to the blockchain.\nThe bitcoin white paper concludes:\nAny needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.\nBCH and BCH forked, pre August 1 a bitcoin was 1BTC, post August 1, 1BTC+1BCH=1 bitcoin\nhttps://twitter.com/Adrian_Xt/status/933540996566020096", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitco.in/forum/threads/buir-2017-01-29-statement-regarding-excessive-block-by-bitcoin-unlimited-software-29-jan-2017.1790/", "https://twitter.com/Adrian_Xt/status/933540996566020096", "https://bitco.in/forum/threads/the-bitcoin-whitepaper-by-satoshi-nakamoto.2002/", "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/06/bitcoin-project-blocks-out-gavin-andresen-over-satoshi-nakamoto-claims", "https://medium.com/@johnblocke/r-bitcoin-censorship-revisited-58d5b1bdcd64", "https://blog.plan99.net/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7", "https://bitco.in/bitcoin.pdf", "https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-March/013921.html", "https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:19.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6b1592994a461a04cf252f3f1458bd3e5e9eb7f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZeQ6FfIkhdBQOHSdM5ZF04NUSjMY95mU_dk9M7iETW6jWC5JU_DQskDxaock6lAzBfgNAy0YfoxttqWPO.vl5DZamjGs5KkCUYxXsrt2UWIQ--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money", "title": "Holy crap.
