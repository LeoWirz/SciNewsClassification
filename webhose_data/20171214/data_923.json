He's a character that experienced such a devasting loss of identity, and has all this self-hatred and neediness to him. He wants to be good, but is convinced he's a monster and will never truly be capable of it. And yet he's still so charming and funny, even while processing all of that. That's compelling stuff, and it meant a lot to see him in Ragnarok having come to better, less frantic place where he seems more at peace with who he is. He did express remorse a couple times - when he was 'dying' in TDW and again in the play. Heck, even in Avengers he had several moments of doubt. That's why Loki's so great. He has a real humanity to him that people empathize with. Plenty of us have done the wrong thing and want to feel like it's possible to work for redemption.\nYes, that scene in Avengers where he's talking to the Other is fascinating - I'm not sure we can say 'tortured' for sure, but he was definitely threatened with it. The Other did give him that painful goodbye slap that didn't seem pleasant. Loki really looks freaked out that entire scene where the Other is circling him. Just look at all the weird blinking here: https://youtu.be/TkFEvUT0PvI?t=1m30s\nIt's harder to tell because the quality's bad, but his eyes look pretty wet in my HD copy. He spends that conversation posturing and trying to look tough, but that's just more Loki veneer.\nLoki was in a bad, vulnerable place after THOR. All Thanos had to do was scoop him up and point him in the direction of a purpose. He needed guidance; he got the very, very bad sort.

Scientists have now found a super-sized black hole. It is the most distant black hole ever discovered. The old and farthest black hole ever witnessed is a celestial brute 800 million times more extensive than the sun which is providing scientists with some wonders about the nature of the universe. \nAstronomers on Wednesday declared the black hole, residing at the centre of a highly bright celestial object named a quasar, is located about 13.1 billion light-years away from Earth. The quasar\u2019s light discovered by the researchers dates back to approximately 690 million years after the Big Bang that formed the universe when the cosmos was only 5% of its present age. \nThe researcher Eduardo Banados of the Carnegie Institution for Science, who led the research published in the journal Nature said that so if the universe was a 50-year-old person, we are seeing a picture of that character when he or she was 2-1/2 years old. When we were looking at further distances, we were also looking for the history because of the time it takes for light to move across the universe. That means this object dates back 13.1 billion years. By way of observation, Earth is about 4.5 billion years old. \nProfessor Robert Simcoe of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said that this object provides us with the measurement of the time at which the universe first became illuminated with starlight. Discovering such a massive black hole existing so early in the universe\u2019s history amazed the researchers. Its very existence then challenges current notions about the formation and growth of such objects, they said. \u201cThe universe is full of wonders,\u201d Banados said. \nThroughout the time of this newest quasar, the universe was arising from the Dark Ages. Stars and galaxies were first resembling, and their radiation is ionising the around hydrogen gas to illustrate the universe. Banados suggest that there are more examples like this out there, between 20 and 100. Quasars, strengthened by gases spiralling at high speeds into an enormous black hole, are identified to inhabit the centre of individual galaxies, sometimes outshining all the stars in those galaxies. \nIn black holes, gravity has such a high pull that not even light can escape. This black hole was seen gorging material at the centre of the galaxy. \nThe object was examined using ground-based telescopes in Chile and Hawaii and NASA\u2019s orbiting Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eduardo banados", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert simcoe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banados", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nature", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts institute of technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carnegie institution for science", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chile", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:24:15.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "da2324e2a64aed97d03cb5a80738ba728e4eb194", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgy67buOhd9D2._h5tl.ZQsNMSZeQuIHtMIOX0vpLWyTm5nVJqNzrFEoHoCpsh.L8bq1LPAqJuU538ERZhwh2uc_7OEmwY0Vq0CzXquU8TLxfw--", "site_full": "feverclan.com", "site": "feverclan.com", "site_section": "http://feverclan.com/forums/calendar/", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "scuba_diving", "sports", "adult", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "painting", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Events Calendar", "title": "Worst sickness you've had?", "title_full": "Worst sickness you've had?", "published": "2017-12-06T09:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "da2324e2a64aed97d03cb5a80738ba728e4eb194", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgy67buOhd9D2._h5tl.ZQsNMSZeQuIHtMIOX0vpLWyTm5nVJqNzrFEoHoCpsh.L8bq1LPAqJuU538ERZhwh2uc_7OEmwY0Vq0CzXquU8TLxfw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "|Fever| FluffMcDuff", "published": "2017-12-06T09:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "Worst sickness you've had?", "text": "I'm just curious about what other people have dealt with, other than my autoimmune the worst i've dealt with is going septic after a surgery.

We do not know very much about them. \n'They seem to have been Black N\u00famen\u00f3reans that swore to serve Sauron during the later years of the Second Age, before the Last Alliance of Elves and Men besieged Barad-d\u00fbr. Many were the cruel Men who sought to serve the Dark Lord in those days, but few only won his favour. Mithrandir would not say how he came to know this, but he believes Sauron bled his favourites with the edge of Gulthauk, his prized morgul-knife. \n'They need no longer fear the passage of time, for by this act they were made Deathless. They are like to the Nazg\u00fbl, but lesser in power, and unlike those wraiths they can be slain. There will be no returning from death for such as they. \n'I understand you wish to add to our store of knowledge concerning the G\u00farzyul? I will travel with you into Talath Urui. Let us first find the settlement of Fushaum Bal. Reports indicate it is a lawless settlement on the south-western side of Orodruin.' Background \nHarthal\u00edn wishes to see the slopes of Orodruin again, disbelieving that Sauron is truly gone, and will accompany you as you search Talath Urui for knowledge of the G\u00farzyul. Objective 1 Meet up with Harthal\u00edn outside Fushaum Bal, in Talath Urui \nThe lawless settlement of Fushaum Bal is south-west of Orodruin, in Talath Urui. Objective 2 Talk to Harthal\u00edn outside Fushaum Bal \nHarthal\u00edn is outside Fushaum Bal, in Talath Urui. Harthal\u00edn : 'It is so strange to me, <name>. This place is both alike to and very different from when I last was here at the close of the Second Age. For all the tumult within its heart, Orodruin seemed as if it would always endure. And yet, even the Mountain of Fire has changed since then: the southern face blown open, a lake of fire spilt onto the plain. 'This settlement was not here then, but I recognize its type. Military encampments have a sense of order and of place about them. Well do I know it, for I served beneath High King Gil-galad at Dagorlad and during the Siege! 'But once the campaign is ended, all such order is discarded alongside the attention of the commanders. This settlement, Fushaum Bal, has that air about it. Many inhabit it now, and lawlessness runs rampant, but some of the Easterlings within might be high enough in the hierarchy to have information of use to us. Hunt them down around Fushaum Bal and its environs, and see what they might know of the G\u00farzyul.' Objective 3 Defeat Easterlings in Talath Urui (0/8) \nEasterlings can be found around Fushaum Bal, in Talath Urui. Objective 4 Search Easterlings for any message \nEasterlings can be found around Fushaum Bal, in Talath Urui. Objective 5 Bring the orders concerning Nargroth to Harthal\u00edn outside Fushaum Bal (The orders can be read from your inventory) \nYou found a crumpled parchment on the body of an Easterling in Talath Urui. Objective 6 Find the road that leads to Nargroth, on the eastern side of Talath Urui \nNargroth, the Caverns of Fire, can be found on the eastern side of Talath Urui, beyond the Gh\u00e2shghurm. You feel a presence regard you from within the carven stone Objective 7 Talk to the spirit in the stone \nA watching-stone outside the Caverns of Fire has taken an interest in you. Watching-stone : The carven stone is dreadful in form, and it does not seem out of place within Gorgoroth. But there is something else that sets it apart, a cold and watchful presence. And then, there is more: a voice that whispers in your head. Images rise unbidden behind your eyes. They are drained of color, as if the one who creates them has no knowledge of shade or hue. You see a place of darkness, and a tiny point of light flickering high above. Then, below, there is a knife held in a cruel fist. It descends in an arc, and blood flows from a wound. The darkness deepens. The voice in your head speaks no words, but you are suddenly awash on a questioning sea. You recover your own words enough to reply, 'Yes, the G\u00farzyul.' The interrogative waves vanish as quickly as they had arrived. In their place is an overwhelming sensation: the promise of knowledge and secrets held close for centuries. As you try to express that such knowledge will be welcome, it is whisked cruelly away, dangled just out of reach. The giving sensation is gone, replaced with a taking desire. You see a prison in your mind's eye, and the details are so clear you know it is a real place. The spirit shows you a certain cell in this prison, and a scorched skull in one corner. The images fade, and the whispering voice returns. It speaks a single word, but the word is enough. The word is 'want.' You are released from the spirit's hold and the whispering in your head fades away. The presence remains, regarding you silently. Objective 8 Find the scorched skull in a cell within the prison of Naerband using the information in your quest journal \nThe spirit in the stone outside Nargroth showed you the location of a scorched skull within a cell in Naerband. If you understood its wish correctly, it has promised to tell you about the G\u00farzyul if you return with the skull. \nYou witnessed that Naerband consists of three large chambers, connected by hallways and subdivided by walls and iron bars. The skull is on the floor of a cell in the south-western corner of the largest, northernmost chamber. The iron door to the cell was half-open, and you saw flame-spirits floating over the fog-covered floor. Malice emanates from the skull. Scorched by heat, it has neither splintered nor cracked Objective 9 Bring the scorched skull to the watching-stone outside Nargroth \nA watching-stone outside the Caverns of Fire has taken an interest in you, and awaits delivery of the skull you agreed to bring to it. Watching-stone : You place the skull at the base of the stone, and the images return. Once again you see the prison of Naerband, but something this time is different. It takes you a moment to reconcile what has changed, but held in the grip of the spirit it is impossible to tell how long the moment might have been. The prison stands in the shadow of Orodruin, and then you see it: the southern slope of the Mountain is intact; the Gh\u00e2shghurm has not yet been made. The images flicker behind your eyes, and you see that Naerband is filled with prisoners. Downtrodden Nurnhoth, rebellious Easterinlings, and Haradrim deserters rattle the cages of their cells. Their jailors walk the corridors of Naerband, and they tap their weapons on the iron doors, and they scrape their blades on the iron walls, and they tap their boots on the iron floor. You are seized by a sensation of eager anticipation, but it does not belong to you. It comes from the whispering spirit, and fills you with revulsion and dread. Then the Mountain blazes, and the southern slope explodes in a shower of rock and flame. The torrent flows inexorably down the side of Orodruin, and the rocky plain becomes a lake of fire: the Gh\u00e2shghurm. The images become sharper and more distinct, as if the spirit seeks to draw your attention. At last you understand. As the lava pooled at the foot of Orodruin, the iron prison of Naerband became super-heated by its proximity to the lake of fire. Naerband became more than a prison. It became an oven. You close your eyes to shut out the sight, and at last the spirit relents, its price paid. 'Zagh\u00e1rog,' it says to you: the name of the spirit in the stone.

In this edition of LIFEadvice, coaches Kim Giles and Nicole Cunningham share the trick to pausing before you react to check yourself and show up at your best. Question: I am, admittedly, a drama queen at times. I hear this from my family and I have had friends comment on it too. I frankly think they are every bit as much the problem as I am. How can I get them to see they are projecting onto me and are also drama queens? How can we all not let things make us overreact? Answer: The only person you have any control over is you. So, it makes sense for each of us to focus on being the best version of ourselves we can be. That is actually a big job and could keep us quite busy.The opposite of overreaction and drama queen behavior would be the ability to see the world accurately, handle emotions maturely, and thoughtfully respond from a place of trust and love, instead of reacting to situations from fear. We realize that\u2019s a tall order and isn't easy, but we believe working to reach for that should be the goal.We all need to work on gaining the self-control to pause before reacting so here are 7 simple questions you could ask yourself, that would help you to think and respond with more emotional maturity. Though, we realize the hard part is stopping your reaction long enough to remember to ask them. You might want to make them your wallpaper on your phone for a while.Here are the 7 questions to ask yourself before reacting: 1. How big of a deal will this be 10 years from now? If you can tell that 10 years from now, this will be insignificant, then consider letting it go now. If you feel like it still needs to be addressed, ask for some time and space to get clarity around the right (loving and respectful) way to approach it. If you don\u2019t know how, you might want to find a coach or counsellor who could teach you some communication skills around having mutually validating conversations. 2. Am I taking this more personally than I have to? Most of us only behave badly when we feel threatened. We are either afraid of looking bad or being insulted (failure) or we are being mistreated in some way (a loss). These two fears drive most of our bad, reactive behavior.Most of the time, other people's bad behavior isn\u2019t about us at all. They are behaving this way because they feel threatened and unsafe in some way. It is all about their fears about themselves and what\u2019s happening in their life or in their own head. It\u2019s usually not about you (even when they attack you).If you can step back and see the situation accurately, and understand it\u2019s not about you, you are much less likely to respond badly. Remember, your value is the same, no matter what anyone else does, thinks or says. You cannot be diminished and whatever happens in your life, happens to serve your education in some way. So, you really have nothing to fear. When you take the time to pause and remember this, your responses are much more mature. 3. Is my own fear of not being good enough making this worse? We are all afraid we aren\u2019t good enough at some level, and this fear can get subconsciously projected into every experience we have. You could see everything that happens, as happening because you aren\u2019t good enough. But just because this can be applied to every situation, doesn\u2019t mean it should be or is accurate.You must pause before responding to anything and remind yourself that you have the exact same value as everyone else and nothing can change that. Your value is infinite and absolute. You cannot be wounded, insulted or hurt, without your participation. So, choose to see yourself as bulletproof and let offenses bounce off. You will be surprised how much energy and charge this one simple idea can remove from a situation. 4. Am I claiming my power to experience each situation the way I choose to? You may not get to choose which situations show up in your life, but you absolutely get to choose how you will feel about them. You can choose to be hurt and offended if you want to. You can create all kinds of unnecessary drama around offenses if you want to.You can use this to cast the other person as the bad guy and feel superior to them, or you could use this to play the victim and get sympathy love \u2014 if you want to, but you also have other options. You could choose to claim the power to choose your inner state. You could decide not to allow circumstances or other people to dictate your emotions or behavior.You have the power to feel bulletproof or feel joy, love, or peace in any situation if you want to. Don\u2019t give anyone the power to make you feel anything that doesn\u2019t serve you. They cannot make you upset. You choose to be \u2014 or choose not to be. This claiming of your power will calm you down and make you feel more secure too. 5. Am I seeing the other person or people involved as the same as me? Our fear of not being good enough makes us subconsciously see other people as either better than us or worse than us. This tendency creates unnecessary drama, self-pity and conflict in all our relationships.But you also have the power, in any moment, to choose to see all human beings as the same as you (in value). When you choose to see other people as the same as you, and remember you are imperfect too, you are more likely to respond with love, compassion and wisdom. 6. What does this person really want and need? What is the underlying cause of their behavior? Most people behave badly because they are scared, and are desperately in need of love, attention or validation. Bad behavior is not a good way to request love, attention, and validation, but often people do not know a better way.When other people are behaving badly, if you can recognize what they need and give them love, attention or validation, they quickly become easier to work with. It isn't easy, but you can do it. 7. Does another person\u2019s bad behavior need to be addressed? As often as possible ignore it, let go and forgive others their bad behavior, especially if you can see it isn\u2019t about you and it is their own fear problem. But, there are some circumstances that need to be addressed. When there is a serious problem or behavior that must change, you must learn how to address it in a strong, loving and validating way.You must first set aside your need to be right, superior or angry. Then, you must focus on your love for them and your desire to have a good relationship. Then, ask questions about how they feel and think, and listen, honor and respect their right to feel the way they do. Do not agree, disagree or criticize them.After you have listened to them for a while and they feel heard, ask permission to share your feelings. If they are willing to listen, make sure you use more \u201cI\u201d statements than \u201cyou\u201d statements and focus totally on their future behavior, not on their past behavior (which they cannot change). Ask them if, in the future, they would be willing to behave differently. This approach works like a charm most of the time.The holiday season is wrought with stress, family gatherings and opportunities to practice your communication and relationship skills. Go into each event this year with a commitment to practice being your most mindful, aware and mature self. If you go into each event with this intention, it\u2019s a lot more likely to happen.If you still have a hard time seeing situations accurately and responding in a mature, logical and loving way, you may want to find a counselor or coach to help you. A little professional help can make a big difference.You can do this.

In this problem, snow begins falling sometime before 12PM. We use a constant rate of snowfall R = 1 and use this to predict the rate of snow removal performed by the snowplow. Once we have an accurate guess of this, we use this rate to predict when the snowfall actually began. In my code, I have rate of snowfall R = 1. I use predictor-corrector to guess the removal rate and the time when snow began.\ndouble Time, a, b, RemovalRate, c, d; double RateFall = 1; double i = 0.0; double PlowDistance = 0.0; double Tolerance = 0.0002; a = 0.0; b = 10.0; Time = (a+b)/2; c = 0.0; d = 50.0; RemovalRate = (c+d)/2; double Depth = RateFall * Time; double mile = 5280.0; double halfmile = 2640.0; for(;;) { PlowDistance = 0.0; for (i=1; i<=3600; i++) { Depth = RateFall*Time + i*(RateFall/3600); PlowDistance = PlowDistance + (RemovalRate/Depth); } if(Math.abs(PlowDistance - mile) <= Tolerance) { break; } else if(PlowDistance < mile) { c = RemovalRate; } else if (PlowDistance > mile) { d = RemovalRate; } RemovalRate = (c+d)/2; } PlowDistance = 0.0; for(;;) { PlowDistance = 0.0; Time = .618; for(i=1; i<=3600; i++) { Depth = RateFall*Time + i*(RateFall/3600); PlowDistance = PlowDistance + (RemovalRate/Depth); } if(Math.abs(PlowDistance - halfmile) <= Tolerance) { break; } else if(PlowDistance < halfmile) { b = Time; } else if(PlowDistance > halfmile) { a = Time; }\nIn the first for loop, if the snow plow travels a distance of 1 mile (5280 feet), I have the correct estimate for the rate of removal, and break out of the loop. In the 2nd loop, I use predictor-corrector to guess the time the snow was removed. If the snow plow travels half a mile (2640 feet), I have the correct guess for the time, and break out of the loop.\nMy first for loop works perfectly and gives the correct output for the rate of snow removal. However, my second for loop is running in an infinite loop.

The work is in three phases: firstly, evidence gathering, learning more about \u2018 trust \u2019, secondly, building out visualisation tools and diagnostics , and, thirdly, putting together developmental approaches, practical things that we can actually do with this evidence and knowledge. With this post, i\u2019m kicking off this third phase, sharing a proposed development pathway around \u2018 trust \u2019, and couching it in terms of \u2018 Leading with Trust \u2019.\n\nPrimarily, i\u2019ll use this post to provide a broad development structure, and as an index point, to link out to the other writing i\u2019ve done so far. All three strands of work are ongoing, and my aim, as always, is to #WorkOutLoud, to prototype the new work fast, and to evolve it as the evidence grows. This structure will initially form the basis of some prototype development programmes i am running, but will possibly also form the structure of the book, which i provisionally intend to work on June to December next year.\nModule 1: Foundations of Trust \nThis module examines the foundational concepts, based firmly in the research work:\nThe Subjective nature of trust : why not all types of trust are equal The Landscape of Trust : what it is, and where we sit within it The 12 Aspects of Trust : the complexity of a multivariate environment The Taxonomy of Trust : can we measure the level, and is there such a thing a \u2018too much trust\u2019? Trust and Mistrust : why opposites may not exist Module 2: The Structures of Trust \nIn this module, we will explore how trust is held, at each of the different levels. This takes us into considering the social structures of trust:\nTribes : the strongest trust bonded structures Communities : meta tribal structures, and how they are connected. Organisations : formal entities that host trusted tribes Structural limitations on organisational trust, and how we can overcome them Module 3: The Failure of Trust \nThis module is explicitly about how trust is eroded, fractured, and broken:\nImplicit rules : the hidden side of failure Fracture or erosion: mechanisms of failure, and how we can inoculate ourselves. Testing the Temperature : synchronous and regular temperature checks Integrity and authenticity : the counterpoints to failure Module 4: The Flow of Trust \nIn this module, we consider how trust flows within the different structures, the forces that block or amplify it, and whether it flows freely:\nInduction into tribes: conformity and induction Cultural Alignment : primary and secondary culture Consequence and Trust: formal and social consequence Degrees of connection : how trust flows more easily in some directions than others Module 5: Technology and Trust \nIn this module, we specifically consider technology and trust. Looking at how the ownership of technology impact trust, and the differences between physical and virtually held trust:\nOwnership : how ownership impacts trust Identity : the link between concrete identity and consequence in trust Virtual vs Physical trust: does it vary, and how. The sequencing of trust: does the location of formation impact the type and persistence of trust Module 6: The Projection of Trust \nThis module is based around a model of how trust is projected, and the various biases and barriers that can impinge upon, or shape, this:\nThe projection of trust : how trust forms and flows Bias in trust: why we may not be as discerning in trust as we would like to think Monoculture vs multi-culture in trust: how trust works in global organisations Module 7: The Diversification of Trust \nIn this module, we consider how we look at trust in terms of building the Socially Dynamic Organisation , how we diversify our Trust networks:\nInterconnectedness : the growth and interconnectivity of tribes Confirmation bias : the limitation of monoculture Structural and contextual barriers to trust, and how to overcome them Module 8: Leading with Trust \nThis final module links the Trust work into the wider work around Social Leadership . It considers how we put trust at the heart of our leadership approach:\nManaging Pollution : reconciling the formal and social space Forces for good: exploring the role of authenticity , fairness , and humility Building Social Authority ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social leadership", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "building social authority", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:24:18.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1883e987c698a1bb73efe702da792f21eeafd9d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Bh55tG5__0ynuH89r9aaOwTvaPBF0hadvCAynwFbuAfQAvP7y6DpBk6t7QhNnQVQ-", "site_full": "www.creativesavv.com", "site": "creativesavv.com", "site_section": "http://www.creativesavv.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "creative savv", "title": "Lentil Love", "title_full": "Lentil Love", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1883e987c698a1bb73efe702da792f21eeafd9d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Bh55tG5__0ynuH89r9aaOwTvaPBF0hadvCAynwFbuAfQAvP7y6DpBk6t7QhNnQVQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lili (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Lentil Love", "text": "\nI spent a very long afternoon in a waiting room yesterday (for a family member, not me). Fortunately. they had free coffee and tea. I think I personally emptied their pot of decaf. I meant to grab a banana on my way out the door, but got side-tracked printing out a map. All I had to eat in my purse was a tiny candy cane and a few Tums. Not exactly gourmet dining. By the time we got home it was 4:30 and I had nothing made for dinner, or even partly made, and I was pretty hungry. Lentils to the rescue.\n\nI worked as hard and fast as I could and managed to get a lentil, sausage, and vegetable soup plus Yorkshire pudding made by 5:45.

It is the only authorised Volkswagen centre in Negri Sembilan and is the second Volkswagen 3S Centre by Hicom Auto after Volkswagen Semenyih. \nSpanning over a total of 2,298 square metre, the 3S Centre\u2019s showroom is able to fit eight cars for display and there is a guest lounge for customer convenience. The service centre has a total of 13 service bays manned by 18 experienced aftersales staff and can service up to 20 cars daily. \nThe 3S Centre is strategically located at the Oakland Industrial area, which is an automotive hub in Seremban. With an initial investment of RM1.5 million by Hicom Auto Sdn Bhd towards the overall build-up, purchase of Volkswagen approved equipment, training and staff acquisition, it is able to cater to customers in Seremban 2 as well as Negri Sembilan. \nAs a value-added service, the 3S Centre also provides \u201cpick up & drop off\u201d service to customers who live within a five-kilometre radius from the centre. Sales advisors will also deliver new vehicles to their homes or office if requested. \nVPCM managing director, Erik Winter, said that the Volkswagen Seremban 3S Centre is a testament to VPCM\u2019s continuous efforts in ensuring that customers are well taken care of. \u201cVPCM will continue to work closely with our dealer partners to ensure constant improvement and enhancement to our dealer network, and towards the overall ownership experience. \n\u201cWe enjoy a good relationship with Hicom Auto and DRB-HICOM, and we feel that this new 3S Centre further demonstrates the commitment shown by the Group. Congratulations Hicom Auto on today\u2019s launch and thank you for your commitment to the brand.\u201d \nDRB-Hicom Bhd head of automotive, automotive distribution, and manufacturing and engineering division, Rohime Shafie, said that the group is committed to ensuring a positive ownership experience for Volkswagen customers in Negri Sembilan. \u201cWe are indeed confident that the collaboration between Volkswagen and DRB-Hicom, which personifies the coming together of two industry-leading brands, will continue to pave the way for a mutually beneficial long-term partnership. \n\u201cThe Volkswagen Seremban 3S Centre will set the benchmark for further improvements within our network both in sales as well as after-sales service.

The navy-and-white striped flag carried around by the Broncos this season \u2013 one star in the upper-left corner for each title, 1934 across the middle to commemorate the program's beginning \u2013 is about to be updated yet again. Burrillville\u2019s seniors exit with a third championship in four years, having also pocketed the Division IV crown in 2014. \n\u201cOur seniors have tremendous desire to win and to accept challenges,\u201d Burrillville coach Gennaro Ferraro said. \u201cWhen it mattered the most, they played the best.\u201d \nIt was a pair of juniors who combined on the winning score, as Gelinas and Lockwood provided the last of 21 unanswered points for the Broncos. Lockwood made a leaping grab in the end zone\u2019s right corner for a 10-yard touchdown with 6:48 left, extending the lead to 21-7. Gelinas closed 17-for-28 for 269 yards, sparking the offense after a scoreless first quarter. \n\u201cI\u2019ve got to be a leader out there,\u201d said Gelinas, who was named the game\u2019s Most Valuable Player. \u201cIf I\u2019m rattled, they\u2019re rattled. I\u2019ve just got to keep my composure, keep on playing hard and be a leader.\u201d \n\u201cCoaching him is as easy as getting up in the morning,\u201d Ferraro said. \u201cHe\u2019s a talent, but he matches his talent with tremendous work ethic and desire to be good. That\u2019s what we need as a quarterback.\u201d \nGelinas\u2019 opposite number, JPW\u2019s Elijah Matthews, nearly dragged his team all the way back inside the final five minutes. His 19-yard touchdown pass to Dennis Gastel with 5:00 left made it a one-score game, and Matthews took over again after a Burrillville punt at his own 19 with 1:57 to go. The last of the senior\u2019s 192 rushing yards weren\u2019t enough, as the final drive stalled at the Broncos\u2019 38. \n\u201cWe knew coming through the season it was probably going to be a collision course,\u201d Ferraro said, as each team carried a 9-0 league record into Sunday. \u201cCredit to their staff and their players \u2013 they competed right to the end.\u201d \nJust like last year\u2019s thriller, the rematch started off as a defensive battle. The two teams traded 1-yard touchdown runs inside the final 2:18 of the first half, with Matthews sneaking in for JPW and Tyler Richards banging over the goal line on the final play before the break for Burrillville. The 7-7 tie after 24 minutes was nearly identical to the Broncos\u2019 7-6 victory in 2016, one that came on a Zach Lefebvre touchdown pass to Nick Deering with 12 seconds left. \n\u201cThey\u2019ve been a part of a revolution and bringing the program back,\u201d Ferraro said. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of them. This is one of the happiest, proudest moments of my life.\u201d \nJuanita/PCD/Wheeler 0 7 0 7 \u2013 14 \nBurrillville 0 7 7 7 \u2013 21 \nJPW \u2013 Elijah Matthews 1 run (Dennis Gastel kick) \nB \u2013 Tyler Richards 1 run (Darren Jenks kick) \nB \u2013 Ryan Lockwood 9 pass from Jake Gelinas (Jenks kick) \nB \u2013 Lockwood 10 pass from Gelinas (Jenks kick) \nJPW \u2013 Gastel 19 pass from Matthews (Gastel kick) \nbkoch@providencejournal.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bill koch jou", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lockwood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyler richards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burrillville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jake gelinas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darren jenks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juanita sanchez/providence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gennaro ferraro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick deering", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan lockwood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthews", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gelinas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ferraro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elijah matthews", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gastel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jenks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dennis gastel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zach lefebvre", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "burrillville", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cavaliers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "interscholastic league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "broncos", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cranston stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burrillville", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:24:19.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2cd7cbde8d047b5436d158dc0937d6f02ba8cb87", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRfBTJDgZ3haFglhBvQxR22JYt47sLJTKKWsM5DSoJYMgiXtiu3xkfLLnfThapI.ciZiVhT2JIbgWhJpr3Cem2P", "site_full": "www.petforums.co.uk", "site": "petforums.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.petforums.co.uk/forums/cat-chat.6/", "site_categories": ["dogs", "pets"], "section_title": "Cat Chat | Pet Forums Community ", "title": "Is this allowed? | Page 3", "title_full": "Is this allowed? | Page 3 | Pet Forums Community", "published": "2017-12-07T12:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.petforums.co.uk/data/avatars/m/21/21770.jpg?1500233504", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "06ae9d41062dbd96555fff3d5a30afc83f266c1e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRfBTJDgZ3haFglhBvQxR22JYt47sLJTKKWsM5DSoJYMgiXtiu3xkfLLnfThapI.ciZiVhT2JIbgaAE9EoiB08eqkTnDO22oKE-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "oliviarussian", "published": "2017-12-07T12:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Up to 5th now but neck and neck", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:24:19.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f728308b8fe784f7af0db80a5ca7916544e36686", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSVhxeW_jLAEnSUuO7c8bGtd47E460DpBa1m9WYS7CN_w--", "site_full": "www.zerochan.net", "site": "zerochan.net", "site_section": "http://www.zerochan.net/?xml", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Page 1 - Zerochan Anime Image Board", "title": "Rouge the Bat", "title_full": "Rouge the Bat", "published": "2017-12-06T23:13:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 11381, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f728308b8fe784f7af0db80a5ca7916544e36686", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSVhxeW_jLAEnSUuO7c8bGtd47E460DpBa1m9WYS7CN_w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T23:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "Rouge the Bat", "text": "Entry by Chibiterasuchan 13 hours ago .

Suffice to say it's his best venue.

Barring his runs in the second innings at Brisbane, when effectively the contest was done, I'm sure we would take his three other innings, both the scores he's made and more importantly the manner he's done it in. He's not exactly finding a way to score a total that hurts us to be fair, so I don't think that's necessarily a contradiction (or 'a bit backward'). flibbertyjibber Yesterday, 06:02 AM #3324 flibbertyjibber Hall of Fame Member Join Date Dec 2009 Location Mrs Miggins pie shop Posts 19,232 Originally Posted by Woodster Barring his runs in the second innings at Brisbane, when effectively the contest was done, I'm sure we would take his three other innings, both the scores he's made and more importantly the manner he's done it in.

That is what I mean, he hasn't hurt us in a first innings yet or scored outlandishly quickly to put us under the pump like he usually does. Scoring a 50 in a game that was all but over isn't really hurting us as we would have lost anyway. He may well come out all guns blazing at Perth but to me doesn't look in the same nick as he has in the past so probably won't.

He may well come out all guns blazing at Perth but to me doesn't look in the same nick as he has in the past so probably won't. He really did look good at Brisbane though. Okay, he wasn't smashing everything through wide mid-off for four, but the pitch didn't really let him do that, and he looked more settled and confident at the crease in other, more important ways. I still expect him to put up a big score or two in this series (and if he doesn't, that would almost be a first for a home summer) Reply With Quote: Yesterday, 06:31 AM #3326 Woodster Cricket Web Staff Member Join Date Nov 2006 Location Manchester, England Posts 5,995 At Perth, with his record there, he's going to be a huge threat, averaging just under 90 with a strike rate of 90 if he doesn't fire there then we've either executed some very good plans again or it's going to be a dry series for him.

A lack of climatic information across this vast continent makes it difficult to plan a cropping strategy which would go some way to remedying the chronic hunger. Using a combination of weather pattern data and predictive computer models gathered by TAHMO, farmers in Africa can more efficiently plan their crop cycles, improve water productivity by up to 26% and plant more crops, with the risk of failure due to drought or flooding severely diminished. \nTAHMO\u2019s requirements for transmitting climate data across a huge distance, from different countries and in an extremely patchy coverage environment made choosing a sufficiently resilient IoT connectivity solution difficult, as many multi-network solutions are not able to transmit data efficiently across borders, and many operators are simply not present in the areas of Africa that benefit from TAHMO\u2019s system. \nPod\u2019s Best Signal Multi-Network SIMs connect to the best available signal on device start-up, and automatically switch networks in case of signal loss. This provides the TAHMO team with the resilient connectivity they need to measure weather systems across multiple countries without risk of losing valuable data. Thanks to Pod\u2019s coverage in 185+ countries and over 600 networks, TAHMO has no problem collecting results from all the countries their devices are present in, and is assured of receiving the best possible coverage in Africa, as well as in US and European partner bases.Rebecca Hochreutener, TAHMO Operations Manager, immediately recognised the advantages of PodM2M\u2019s specialist remote and mission-critical IoT SIM cards; \u201cAlthough connectivity in Africa is not always simple, PodM2M has been able to provide reliable services and a very good and responsive support team,\u201d she commented. \nCharles Towers-Clark, Managing Director of Pod Group added, \u201cTAHMO\u00b4s application is an excellent example of how the IoT can vastly improve standards of living and help to resolve some of the world\u00b4s most complex problems. We are extremely excited that our specialist mission critical connectivity is helping to make this project possible.\u201d \nAbout PodM2MPodM2M is a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) specializing in global, mission critical data connectivity solutions for the M2M/IoT market. Our expertise, dedication to innovation, and comprehensive range of products and services help companies develop resilient, future-proof M2M/IoT solutions, generating innovative new revenue streams for IoT communications. www.podm2m.com \nAbout TAHMO:The Trans-African HydroMeteorological Observatory (TAHMO) aims to develop a vast network of weather stations across Africa. Current and historic weather data is important for agricultural, climate monitoring, and many hydro-meteorological applications. The idea behind this project is to develop a dense network of hydro-meteorological monitoring stations in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 one every 30 km. This entails the installation of 20,000 stations across the continent. By applying innovative sensor technology and ICT, TAHMO stations are both inexpensive and robust. Stations are placed at schools and integrated in educational programs, adding richness to the curriculum and helping foster a new generation of scientists. Local weather data will be combined with models and satellite observations to obtain insight into the distribution of water and energy stocks and fluxes.

Smith is, not sure Warner at this present moment is better than the player of the last ashes down under.

Last time you knew he would tee off and be on 40+ within an hour, this time it seems he is fighting himself but still getting a score. The way he is playing is how a few of the English players should be, finding a way to score even when not at his best.

Yes that's a fair comment, but don't you think he's going against the main thing that makes Warner the threat he is in Australian conditions ? His absolute positivity and getting the team off to a flier and literally forcing bowling off their lines and lengths. He's becalmed and trying to just occupy the crease, I hope he stays in this mindset throughout. flibbertyjibber likes this. http://batallday.blogspot.com/ - Cricket blog dedicated to domestic cricket.
