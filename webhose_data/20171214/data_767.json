These reasons lie in both admiration for the recent campaign and a sincere feeling that Paisley so richly deserves the renewal that could result from being chosen. \nThe campaign was so high-energy and positive, with huge community involvement at the grassroots, that it was inspiring even to non-Buddies across the UK. Just as the UK City of Culture would confer benefits on Paisley, Paisley\u2019s campaign has exemplified all that is good about the concept of having a UK City of Culture. All five places shortlisted before today\u2019s decision have seen hard times and deserve support. Few will be unaware of how badly Paisley has suffered from unemployment and deprivation but the Buddies have shown a desire for change and a willingness to put the shoulder to the wheel. \nPaisley\u2019s great past is seen all around in its magnificent buildings. Its present sees an engaged grassroots and a thriving cultural community. Its future could be bright, and the boost from becoming UK City of Culture (an estimated \u00a3172 million in investment and nearly 5,000 jobs over 10 years) would do such a lot to take it forward. \n \nWe wish the other contenders well but we are backing Paisley.

WHICH TEAMS HAVE QUALIFIED? \nReal Madrid , the reigning world champions, booked their return to the competition by lifting the 2016-17 UEFA Champions League trophy. \nMadrid beat Mexican outfit Club America in the semi-finals of the 2016 Club World Cup, with Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo scoring the goals, before seeing off Kashima Antlers in the final. \nRonaldo struck a hat-trick against the Japanese side and Real eventually won 4-2 after extra time. They go into this year's tournament as its first defending champions. \nAl Jazira will participate this year as national league champions from the host country, while Pachuca , Auckland City , Wydad Casablanca and Urawa Red Diamonds qualified as the continental champions of North America, Oceania, Africa and Asia respectively. \nBut the biggest challenge to Madrid is likely to come from Gremio , who won the Copa Libertadores in South America. WHAT VENUES WILL BE USED? \nThere will be two venues throughout the tournament: Zayed Sports City Stadium in Abu Dhabi and Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium in Al Ain. \nZayed Sports City Stadium (pictured above) is the largest in the UAE, with more than 43,000 seats, and was the host of the Club World Cup final in 2009 and 2010. It will also hold the final of the 2018 Club World Cup. \nAn open-air stadium, its arches carve an iconic backdrop in the city. \nThe Hazza bin Zayed Stadium, opened in 2014, has a capacity of 22,717 and is a multi-purpose stadium which acts as the home for UAE Pro-League club Al Ain FC. \nThe stadium sits approximately 150 km east of Abu Dhabi, close to the borders of Oman, and is the first stadium to feature a parasol roof designed specifically to keep supporters and players cool in soaring temperatures. CLUB WORLD CUP FIXTURES & DATES \nThis year's tournament will kick off on December 6, with the opening tie of the tournament to be a play-off game between host-club Al Jazira and Auckland City. \nThe quarter-final stage of the competition will be played on December 9, with the two semi-final games taking place on December 12 and 13 in Al Ain and Abu Dhabi, respectively. \nThe final of the competition, also to be played in Abu Dhabi, will be on December 16 along with the third-place match.

Different time periods may be used when using the RSI indicator. The RSI may be more volatile using a shorter period of time. Many traders keep an eye on the 30 and 70 marks on the RSI scale. A move above 70 is widely considered to show the stock as overbought, and a move below 30 would indicate that the stock may be oversold. Traders may use these levels to help identify stock price reversals. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wilder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ecosynthetix inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parabolic sar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "parabolic sar", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:13.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ac90b212df50bec89185aeb6d9d97f2503ec0b6b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_0zrWQjC3rcJ19KiQIiNXO64rVqjvI.i8V.BIxnSZGkotrQevxEcW91qaW763rBBZi0sd9yY0_.DtiuxB9l1Rs", "site_full": "www.productreview.com.au", "site": "productreview.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.productreview.com.au/c/home-builders.html", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Home Builders Reviews - ProductReview.com.au", "title": "Eight Homes", "title_full": "Eight Homes Reviews - ProductReview.com.au", "published": "2017-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.productreview.com.au/products/images/8-homes_509c85af64dca.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 14314, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1765de7d18469d31fb6bbcce2ca76b8ab3c0dcbe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_0zrWQjC3rcJ19KiQIiNXO64rVqjvI.i8V.BIxnSZGkotrQevxEcW91qaW763rBBZi0sd9yY0_.FdCI5hiAilm5ic__VQEUMg-", "ord_in_thread": 19, "author": "Amit", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Excellent, Perfect, Honest and Reliable", "text": "First of all I would like to deeply thanks to Eight Homes for building such a fantastic and comfortable home for me which I only thought in my dreams . Now I am living in my new house for more than two weeks and everything which I touch here is beautifully and perfectly built. The whole process of building my house was quite easy and fast.\nMy journey started with Eight homes last year when I met Maddy Patel at davis Road office. He explained everything so simply that I could imagine my house straight away in my vision. Everything he told me was truth and nothing was concealed until the end.\nOn my contract signing date I met Melanie Bouvet who was so quick in all paper work that she made my starting more easier.\nWhen construction started my file was transferred to Telisha Fowler who was the superb construction customer service specialist from the beginning to end. Anytime I needed her help she was always there to solve the issues. I would specially appreciate her for quick responses. She always took my case as priority one doesn\u2019t matter how busy she was.\nFinally I will come to the real hero of the story who was my construction supervisor JASON DRAPER. I would title him the supervisor of the year. He is so knowledgeable and perfect in his work that he wouldn\u2019t leave any error behind. Every time when we visited our site the work was done more then expectations. All the workmanship has been wonderful from A to Z. I think the best of all tradies were selected for my home. We can\u2019t find any mistake in the whole house. I would give 10 out of 10 to Jason.\nNow our three months inspection is due but I don\u2019t think that we have any problems to report in that. I am sure that we couldn\u2019t be more happier if I had gone to any other builder.\nI would only say to Eight Homes \u201c KEEP IT UP\u201d.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 5.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:13.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b6df18ff737d2ddd159a8c2edde09dc6573813d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbUVUH_6t0c.YHvs36WjsPgqPQA3g22d8wTKQ2c225ZGQqc0eyDxlugdvYZtCdU_XPN4DTgsBvv72ZGJ3ZpoHN9KXkMcakokOh1I1MPrj9trzusvWRisUGNAsZ.WyW2RJW9h66nGCFqzY", "site_full": "www.expedia.es", "site": "expedia.es", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.es/Robinsonville-Hoteles.d12052.Guia-Viajes-Hoteles", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "49 Hoteles en Robinsonville baratos con Expedia.es", "title": "Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Tunica Resorts", "title_full": "Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Tunica Resorts (Robinsonville - Tunica, Estados Unidos) | Expedia.es", "published": "2017-08-23T04:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 18, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26131, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c8b924bc19fcb7fae96e23a0318411c62d38aa18", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbUVUH_6t0c.YHvs36WjsPgqPQA3g22d8wTKQ2c225ZGQqc0eyDxlugdvYZtCdU_XPN4DTgsBvv72ZGJ3ZpoHN9KXkMcakokOh1I1MPrj9trzusvWRisUGNAsZ.WyW2RJW5tylnxcCKMwDJEF6fdjfUju54GuhAgmJQLeqHYr1gf5", "ord_in_thread": 17, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-29T02:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Ghetto employees who refuse to help, employees outside smoking weed while I rang the bell for service at the front desk for at least 10 to 15 minutes.

The task of making the proper changes to the Bill determined to be needed in the Senate Hearings. 2. The task of addressing the concerns by the AG that the present Bill as an Initiative violates the \u0093process\u0094 under the law \u0097 meaning the Legislature will have to start OVER with a \u0093Petition Drive\u0094 or just make it a Legislative Act that becomes law once the Governor signs. 3. The Bill must make sure the CNMI can be fully capable and accountable to comply with the Fed\u0092s \u0093Cole Memo\u0094. The Cole Memo is named after former Deputy Attorney General James Cole, who served under Barack Obama and it outlines a series of \u0093rules\u0094 that states have to follow in order for the federal government to maintain a \u0093hands-off approach.\u0094\nThese rules of the Cole Memo required states to: \u00931.Ensuring that minors don\u0092t gain access to pot, 2. Ensure drivers under the influence of cannabis are dealt with harshly, and 3. The cannabis grown within a state stays within that state\u0094 \u0097 so NO importing or exporting as it was once proposed in the Bill. The Feds can also still arrest and prosecute those who violate the state\u0092s new marijuana laws. For example: If the state says you can grow 10 trees but you have 100 the Feds can step in and take the 90 trees and prosecute you in Federal Court. So don\u0092t think the Feds are out of this with Legalization and I\u0092m sure they will be watching. But don\u0092t worry about Jeff Sessions who thinks \u0093only good people don\u0092t use marijuana\u0094 as he is surely blowing smoke if the GOP wants any chance of staying in power in Congress and the WH \u0097 he is figuratively trying to \u0093un-ring the bell\u0094 with marijuana legalization which is something every first year law students learns they CAN\u0092T DO. Legalization is here to STAY!\nHowever, my main concern for now is for the people who want to become growers as \u0093ARE the Growers Ready\u0094 because the Cannabis Industry CANNOT run on the quality of marijuana that is presently being sold on the streets in the CNMI, especially on Saipan. In fact, some of the marijuana sold on the streets in the CNMI could get you a \u0093beat-down or worse\u0094 on the mainland for selling \u0093poor quality pot.\u0094 I did read an opinion letter about Tinian Growers being ready but the challenge with the Cannabis Industry is to \u0093have developed STRAINS of marijuana that are ALL CLONES\u0094 which I don\u0092t think is happening anywhere in the CNMI like it was in places like California and Colorado and other states where a lot of cultivation is done \u0093INDOORS.\u0094 There is virtually no such thing as using seeds to generate marijuana crops in the Cannabis Industry unless you are creating a new strain that needs \u0093breeding\u0094 because each \u0093product (plant)\u0094 must remain the same in each cultivation cycle \u0097 just like any product you purchase in the store it has to be the same thing in every can or package year-in and year-out. If our growers are not cloning their crops with multiple Stains the CNMI will not be ready for the Cannabis Industry.\nUnlike California with a population in the millions and a location where the climate allowed for thousands of growers to develop many strains and Colorado with millions that also had literally thousands of people growing various high quality strains indoors through \u0093cloning,\u0094 the CNMI\u0092s marijuana is still being driven by the planting of seeds which is really guess work and a \u0093outdated\u0094 practice. We are \u0093dinosaurs\u0094 figuratively. Marijuana Strains are products that are marketed and sold like any other product on the open market. If you buy a coke today you expect it to be the same next year. But many of the small Grow Businesses are now being challenged by BIG Business all the more reason for the Bill to make sure Locals have the FRIST advantage of being the initial marijuana suppliers which I will talk about in part 2.\nBut one of the things that should be noted is that I have been trying to make sure of in S.B. 20-62 is that it will make it possible for ALL the present growers to become LEGAL growers which will also kill the immediate supply and even the future supply for any Black-market or Boot-leg sales. If Local growers are \u0093rejected\u0094 they will likely remain Black-market or Boot-leg growers and it will be ALL OUR FAULT as we will have created Boot-legers instead of diminishing the capacity for bootlegging just like we created the Cartels by declaring War on Drugs. A lesson history has ALREADY taught!\nJust think, it wasn\u0092t long ago that people who used marijuana were viewed as bad people and criminals but now we want to exclude these SAME people once marijuana is legal \u0097 a pure hypocritical political act to insinuate everyone and everything in the industry is SOOOO good. The Cannabis Industry should be the ONE industry in America where your record DOES NOT matter unless it requires you to carry a gun \u0097 as ex-criminals are the ones who know the most about marijuana, how to grow it and marijuana products.\nMore importantly is the fact that the Cannabis Industry is the simple economics of \u0093supply & demand\u0094 and if we don\u0092t have the supply for the demand its futile to legalize. Aren\u0092t we learning anything from Guam\u0092s dilemma and their inability to even get started two years later. Another example I want to remind readers of is the fact that Las Vegas ran out of marijuana the \u0093FIRST WEEK\u0094 they opened the dispensaries for recreational use because Nevada is desert with not nearly as many growers as Colorado. In fact, creating the supply of marijuana for our Cannabis Industry is our biggest FIRST challenge which needs to begin LONG before marijuana is legalized as it will take at least a year or more for the CNMI to develop a quality and sustainable supply of marijuana. The Cannabis Industry is a VERY serious business and we need the Legislature and the present growers to bring their \u0093A-game\u0094 literally. We must keep in mind that the Cannabis Industry is a self-starting industry so we don\u0092t be like Guam \u0097 two years after legalization and still no crops or dispensaries. So if you are a grower and want to be part of the Industry then you need to learn how to clone quick, fast and in-a-hurry so you can become a real legal entrepreneur as a licensed commercial cultivator!

The talented cast and orchestra produced spontaneous applause with their sparkling performance. \nPitlochry Theatre attracts its share of middle-aged to elderly audiences but, on this occasion, any falling into that grouping left looking at least 10 years younger. Such were the bursts of laughter and the happy smiles on the faces of the audience that it seemed there was almost an argument for tickets to be made available on the NHS . \nI could convince myself that some of those who had arrived supported by walking sticks left with them looped over an arm, while others who had arrived limping left with a spring in their step. \n \nIt was an outstanding and imaginative production all round.

However, Transport Minister Humza Yousaf explains that an expert panel in 2016 \u201cwas incredibly impressed with the high level of design\u201d. It had not been designed in detail in 2016. \nAt a recent public consultation it was necessary for cyclists to point out to officers that provision shown for a right turn off Victoria Road in Glasgow was quite inadequate. \nOnly subsequently has the council announced it is proposing to use an innovative Dutch-style junction, subject to government approval. \n \nGlasgow City Council\u2019s good design is skin deep. Last week at a consultation about plans for Battlefield junction, the council displayed four options, none of which considered the needs of cyclists, and with only a couple of token pedestrian crossings shown. We\u2019ll consider them later, was the explanation offered. Proposed road layouts with alignments skewed to permit junctions at right angles were drawn to suit cars, yet statistics presented showed significant pedestrian, cycle and bus usage, at times more people are using them than cars. \nWhy aren\u2019t pedestrian and cycle facilities being considered routinely across the city when a project starts, and given priority? \nThe design mentality is still to consider them as something added on when vehicle needs have been designed for. \nThe council is providing high quality segregated cycle facilities on relatively wide uncongested roads, the South City Way; not so on recently upgraded Union Street. It has no facilities for cyclists because, the road being narrow, they would hinder vehicular traffic. \nTo provide safe space on inner city roads it is often necessary to give cyclists dedicated road space, something the council doesn\u2019t yet do routinely on highways if it hinders vehicle flows. Look for the cycle box on the recently upgraded St. George\u2019s Road; it is missing. \nSustrans\u2019s Daisy Narayan wants to see \u201cimproving conditions for people who choose to walk or cycle\u201d. Why then did Sustrans fund the tarmacing of a 50 metre length of footpath on Kelvin Walkway that is less than 1.5 metres wide for cyclists to use instead of the designated national cycle route across the river through the Botanic Gardens arboretum? \nPedestrian facilities have been downgraded. Sustrans is credited on a council sign that invites cyclists to bypass the proper cycle route that closes at dusk. \nThe sign was erected just before the arboretum was closed for three weeks for the commercial Jurassic event. Coincidence? Now Land Services at the council wants cyclists to use the footpath permanently, instead of arranging to keep the national route open all of the time. \nAnd what about the steep cyclepath link off Garrioch Drive, funded by Sustrans, that has been permanently closed at a loss of \u00a36,353? The council ignored a warning that it was hazardous. \nWhen a cyclist fell off Sustrans acknowledged it wasn\u2019t fit for all users, so the council had to close it; not exactly the best design or funding decision. \nMr Yousaf trumpets the virtues of the South City Way, a segregated cycle facility. \nIs anyone telling him that across Glasgow are poorly designed and maintained cycle facilities? When are they going to be put right? \nPat Toms, \nFlat 1/2, \n68 Shakespeare Street, \nGlasgow.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "daisy narayan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelvin walkway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "humza yousaf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sustrans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pat toms", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yousaf", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "glasgow city council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "land services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shakespeare street", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "st. george\u2019s road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victoria road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south city way", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glasgow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "union street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "botanic gardens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garrioch drive", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:13.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d01ca204e4b42987ade3183d59237f031ce507a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTc3Wt6gO_FFgz6vufddClL9rGxha6u1cnJuG.f9CotuB70mAe8JkaYzfdmGX_XeJlVtyD_3k4QxykDv2I78i2VU_Cv6KLmtpBf", "site_full": "www.heraldscotland.com", "site": "heraldscotland.com", "site_section": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/rss/", "site_categories": ["media", "climbing", "sports"], "section_title": "HeraldScotland | Opinion", "title": "Letters: Time to choose life or death", "title_full": "Letters: Time to choose life or death | HeraldScotland", "published": "2017-12-07T00:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7146279/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31684, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "740c6458b5cf3ee0f1e4ee12d19338a95db10985", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTc3Wt6gO_FFgz6vufddClL9rGxha6u1cnJuG.f9CotuB70mAe8JkaYzfdmGX_XeJlVtyD_3k4QxykDv2I78i2VU9._Nww0tlY2G.FRnXnOJAg-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Michael Lloyd", "published": "2017-12-07T14:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Well said, Brian.

will occur. \nThe Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded to Ican, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear weapons. \nIt is being given the prize for its work in achieving a treaty banning nuclear weapons agreed by 122 states at the United Nations on July 7 this year. \n \nBoth these historic acts have been boycotted by the nine rogue nuclear states. Britain is going ahead with the renewal of Trident at a cost of \u00a3200 billion. \nWestminster clearly sees the UK as remaining a nuclear-armed state in perpetuity, with Scotland housing the biggest arsenal of H-bombs in Europe for aye. \nThis is in spite of the opposition of the churches, the trade unions and all of the political parties except the Tories. \nWho cares about the \u201cdemocratic deficit\u201d? There is no austerity for the nuclear jihadis. To all true British patriots our atomic status symbol is cheap at the price. \nAmerica is planning a $3 trillion \u201cmodernisation\u201d programme for its nuclear weapons. \nSo, it\u2019s business as usual for those states to which Divine Favour has granted the right to threaten the world with weapons of mass destruction, a privilege forever denied lesser breeds. \nAnd how dare North Korea do what we are doing (\u201cTop UN official in rare visit to North Korea\u201d, The Herald, December 6)? \nWhat is unforgivable is that both the Peace Prize and the treaty have been largely ignored by the mass media. \nAfter all, they mean that we just might have a future.

Yes, something more amazing than Tyrell Wellick\u2019s English-speaking accent adjustment in the following three years. \nElliot \u201cwakes up\u201d to find himself standing in front of his mirror and Mr Robot having carved \u201cThey own the FBI\u201d into it. \u201cWhat did Mr Robot do last night?\u201d he asks us. And here\u2019s the amazing part: Mr. Robot immediately shows us. \nThroughout almost three full years of this show, we\u2019ve grown accustomed to questions like \u201cwhat did Mr Robot do last night?\u201d going unanswered for an extended period of time. Season 3, however, has proven more willing than most Mr Robot seasons to put its cards on the table. \n\u201cStage 3\u201d might be the clearest, most helpfully expository hour yet. It\u2019s the right move as \u201cStage 3\u201d is also a near-perfect setup for the sure to be conclusive finale next week. \nOf course, Mr Robot and Elliot\u2019s stories this week aren\u2019t completely simple \u201cA to B\u201d storytelling. There are some timeline shenanigans afoot. The episode cuts between Mr. Robot\u2019s trip to Tyrell\u2019s house and subsequent encounter with Philip Price and Elliot\u2019s plan to enact \u201cstage 3\u201d the next day. \nThis timeline messing works well but in a different way from Mobely and Trenton\u2019s demise two weeks ago. That was pure shock and awe (and well-done shock and awe) but this works thematically in a way that the show needs to work right now. \nSo much of Mr Robot has been about the strange relationship between its two leads - both of course being Elliot Alderson. Last week\u2019s flashback to Elliot\u2019s father\u2019s death and the emergence of the Mr Robot persona worked wonders for the show\u2019s establishment of this relationship. Now, Stage 3 not only promises a strong finale but a better (and more interesting) future of Elliot-Mr Robot relations. \nBy having Mr Robot and Elliot come to similar revelations simultaneously within the narrative, it helps create their burgeoning alliance in a much more fascinating way than say a trip to Krista\u2019s office or a joint viewing of Careful Massacre Of The Bourgeoise over popcorn and M&Ms. \nMr. Robot comes to the realisation that the Dark Army is the real author of all this pain through Philip Price of all people. Mr Robot heads to Tyrell\u2019s house after Tyrell\u2019s been released, as verbally shitting on the Swede is apparently Mr Robot\u2019s favorite pastime. As Tyrell returns the favor with his fists*, there\u2019s a knock on the door and wouldn\u2019t you know it, Philip Price has stopped by. \n*Do I know why Sam Esmail draws a comparison between Tyrell Wellick and Donald Trump by having Tyrell stammer \u201cNo puppet. No puppet. YOU\u2019RE the puppet.\u201d No, I do not. But it\u2019s pretty funny. \nPhilip is there to tell Tyrell that he has been granted the role of CTO at E Corp. But he also wants to tell him in person that it will be a \u201cin name only\u201d position. Just one last indignity Whiterose has thrown Price and Tyrell\u2019s way. \nPrice graciously allows Elliot/Mr Robot to stay for his meeting with Tyrell and in the process, Elliot has a question for Price. \n\u201c5/9, fsociety. You knew the whole time, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Elliot asks Price. \n\u201cWorld catastrophes. They don\u2019t happen from lone wolves like you,\u201d Price responds. \u201cThey happen because men like me allow them to happen. You just happened to stumble into one of them.\u201d \nThe 'powerful men pulling the strings' trope should be an overused and tired one at this point. Perhaps it would be in a different political climate but Mr Robot has lucked into some well-timed support from reality and it\u2019s accidentally become the show\u2019s grandest and most impactful thematic statement. Stage 3 finds a perfect way to make the betrayal of being a puppet on a string personal. Once again it\u2019s Price who provides the fire quotes. \n\u201cYou\u2019re still thinking like a lone wolf,\u201d Price tells Elliot before he leaves. \n\u201cWhat should I be thinking like?\u201d \n\u201cA leader.\u201d \n\u201cI am a leader.\u201d \n\u201cThen where are your followers?\u201d \nA great question indeed. It hammers home what a solitary, selfish endeavour this has been for Elliot and Mr Robot. Elliot is at war with himself and so far it\u2019s the rest of humankind that has paid the price. The satisfying thing about Stage 3 is that just as Mr Robot and Elliot begin to come to a shared understanding, they both agree on what the next course of action is: they have to fix this. So Mr Robot looks up information about the FBI\u2019s Sentinel server, leaves the message on the mirror and Elliot takes it over from there. \nMotivated, vengeful Elliot is a protagonist that it is just flat out nice to spend time with. As Elliot begins the process of coming to terms with himself, he also begins the process of undoing all the damage this process of self-discovery has done so far. \nElliot shares his plan with Darlene (who has some unfortunate alterations), tries to shake Angela out of her craziness, and then finally retreats back to his apartment where he finds Leon waiting for him. Unfortunately, Leon doesn\u2019t share any new thoughts on NBC 90s sitcoms this time around but he does rightfully point out that Angela is \u201ctripping.\u201d \nLeon takes Elliot to his agreed meeting with the Dark Army, as set up with Irving earlier. Whiterose isn\u2019t there but it doesn\u2019t matter. Elliot gets what he wants. He feeds Whiterose\u2019s assistant* some easily seen-through b.s. about Stage 3 involving the elimination of E Coin. In reality, he is just installing his own malware onto the Dark Army\u2019s servers so that he can take them over as he does by episode\u2019s end. \n*I can\u2019t recall if Whiterose\u2019s assistant (whose English really has improved) has a name. IMDB says Grant so\u2026.hey, Grant! \nStage 3 works well emotionally and thematically but one of its biggest missteps is logical. How is Elliot so easily able to Trojan Horse onto the Dark Army\u2019s networks with a USB drive when accessing the FBI\u2019s servers is nearly impossible? It\u2019s easy to take a logical leap of faith like this, especially when we\u2019re all far technologically dumber than Elliot. But it ends up not being fair to the characters involved as Elliot is able to enact his part of the plan easily and flawlessly while Darlene spectacularly fucks up with the FBI. And it\u2019s not clear that it\u2019s really her fault other than the show needing Elliot to succeed and her to fail. \nElliot has a plan for hacking the FBI. But Darlene insists upon going her own way since she has access to an agent she semi-trusts. \u201cTrust me,\u201d she says. Trusting her turns out to be a bad idea as she does not have nearly the plot armour Elliot does. \nPlan A for Darlene is to meet Dom at a bar and remotely copy her key code. This does not work (again: Elliot is able to hack the entire Dark Army via laptop and USB but Darlene's special code-stealing machine is apparently on the fritz), so she goes with plan B: seduction. \nMr Robot has mined the 'women of an indeterminate Kinsey spectrum score kissing' thing before with Angela and Shayla (man, remember her?) And there is undoubtedly some level of fan service/humankind service going on from Sam Esmail here. Still, the encounter gives Grace Gummer another emotional spectrum of Dom to work with. \nGummer really has been excellent in this role. Her portrayal of Dom, who is in the grand scheme of things a minor character, has really run the full rainbow of human emotions and contradictions. Dom is the kind of person who will sleep with a source\u2026 but only after she locks her keycard and gun safely away. \nWhen Darlene gets up in the night to steal the card, Dom catches her immediately and brings her in to the FBI, unknowingly placing her within the clutches of the Dark Army. \nStage 3 is the second 'necessary' episode of Mr. Robot in as many weeks.

I've had my NEW FTW3 hybrid 1080ti for two weeks and love the performance (although i've seen some odd happenings too).\nSo I got lucky with the GPU core clock out the box hitting 2000Mhz. The card will hit 2080Mhz and then drop to say 2075Mhz just altering the core clock offset on the GPU clock by 100Mhz and popping an offset 250Mhz on the memory. This is without altering the power or temp target settings at all. So pretty happy with that. I do have some coil whine but I've had two other 1080ti cards (previous EVGA 108TI FTW very little coil whine but odd humming from fans, Asus 1080ti OC (coil whine present, cooler broke).\nAnyway, moving on I ordered a single Silent Wings 3 (BL070) PWM fan and popped in it for some short testing.\nGranted the fan was only set to 80% fan speed in push (plugged into the Z270 mobo fan header using fan speed) and not the 100% like the EVGA stock was running at of course but it didn't cool it as well I felt. I saw a drop in the clocks. On the positive side. The Be fan was quieter than the EVGA Stock fan by far. Just the sound of the air being pushed through which was a pleasant experience. The quality of the fan build seems pretty premium.\nI'm going to revisit this as soon as I get more time. I did order another Corsair 120 ML Pro single fan (All my case fans are ML Pros 140s apart from the ones on my Kraken X62).\nI'll hopefully get onto some testing maybe next week. Just wondered how others are finding swapping the fans out.\nJust some additional info.\nFan speed didn't work until I exited the Asus Suite 3 software which also controls fans. It does say in the EVGA forum thread not to have any other additional fan software running but this didn't work initially until I exited both Asus Suite 3 and Speed fan and went back into Speed Fan.\nI think the option as mentioned above (by: AHowes ) is prolly to set the fan to be 100% constantly and then not bother with speed fan perhaps. Will try this I think next to see what the temps are like.\nFrom memory, With the EVGA stock fan (100% fan speed as it is plugged into the GPU fan cable) after say 2-3 hours of gaming on Battlefront 2 I get:\nAmbient temp in room is around 18-20c.\n49-50c on the GPU temp\n61-62c on the power temp\n65 c Memory\nGPU Clock 2075Mhz\nMemory +250Mhz\nAgain this is with a single push fan as the cards physical setup elements are stock i.e. single fan.\nI will retest the Silent Wings 3 and post when I get around to it =).\nJust in case anyone is wondering about the odd happenings I mentioned at the start of my post.\nI might reinstall windows as I have had some odd things happen like when installing Nvidia drivers it takes 3 attempts as it fails the first two times always (after a DDU removal of old drivers). First attempts results in either a 640*480 screen with failed to install driver message, second attempt normally ends up with screen curruption during install and then a failed message. Third attempt results in the driver being installed ok. This is using the most recent version of drivers and the second oldest version available from the Nvidia site.\nBattlefront 2 alt + tabbing to desktop and then popping back into the game again results in Battlefront 2 crashing out to desktop completely and EVGA Precision X loosing the profile setting I had it set too. Clicking on the same profile number again looks like it works at first but then going into the game or any other game shows the clocks aren't boosting correctly. However, selecting a different profile setting will work. The fix is too completely exit Precision X and go back in.\nBoot bug: I have to boot three time to get into windows correctly (cold boot). The first time I installed the nvidia drivers and precision x resulted in the first boot getting past the windows load screen with the balls spinning in a circle but then a blank screen where the login screen should be showing. The second time you load you will get into windows but the GPU temp will slowly rise from 20c to 50c when the gpu clock is idle at 150-450 mhz.\nThird times the charm.\nHowever, after using the newsiest version of DDU, downloading the latest NVidia drivers (as a new version appeared recently) and uninstalling/also deleting the precision X folder the GPU temp rise hasn't occurred again (yet).\nSo the other two issues are still there. I have to boot twice now as the intial boot (cold boot) gives me a blank screen instead of the windows login screen and the crash when alt tabbing in Battlefront 2.\nThe Alt tabbing isn't a problem really for me.\nI'm going to reinstall windows I think as it's had two different 1080ti's in it plus my old 1080 gigabyte twice from my other PC while i was RMAing my 1080ti''s. The systems had fair bit of software installed and uninstalled over the time. Clean slate time!\nAnyway, thanks for reading! =)\npost edited by Yoda_In_Area51 - 2017/12/07 02:16:04\nGaming Rig 1: CPU: Intel i7 7700K @ 5.2Ghz (de-lidded) , Mobo: Asus ROG Apex Z270, Memory: 16GB DDR4 Gskill Trident Z 3200 Mhz, GFX: EVGA 1080TI FTW3 Hybrid , Cooling: X62 Kraken, HDD1: Samsung 960 EVO M2 250 GB SSD, HDD2: Samsung EVO 850 500GB HDD3: 1TB WD, Audio: AKG, Astro A40s and Razer Hammerhead Pro V2,Monitor: ROG Asus PG279Q, BenQ 27\", Mouse: Zowie FK2, Keyboard: Corsair K70, 850w EVGA G2!\nGaming 2 Rig: Alienware Area-51 R2\nCPU: 5820K,Cooling: H80 V2 GT, GFX: Gigabyte Xtreme 1080GTX, Memory: 16GB Hyper X Savage 2400 Mhz DDR4, HDD1: 250GB Samsung 850 EVO SSD HDD2: 2TB Toshiba , Sounds Card: On board Sound blaster Recon 3Di, Monitor: Eizo FG2421, Mouse: Corsair M65, Keyboard: Razor Deathstalker\n#11", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.evgagaming.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:14.036+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee14d9fcb16ed127f05d6f3b5395fb53719c3373", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT_CORyXZORmQq2T8in_CwLzFfu.wfPEY4H91rtkZW843Eu50ooIBBya1ncFbxk90t8pmyOA0ip3Fip1ENbn0sjA2BcpDfeJIu1wPy8tywUSQ--", "site_full": "www.organicconsumers.org", "site": "organicconsumers.org", "site_section": "https://www.organicconsumers.org/rss/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["food", "health_lowfat_cooking"], "section_title": "Organic Consumers Association News Headlines", "title": "Today's Chicken Meat Contains 224 Percent More Fat", "title_full": "Today's Chicken Meat Contains 224 Percent More Fat", "published": "2017-11-30T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.organicconsumers.org/sites/default/files/chicken_chain_link_fence_eye_1000x523.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ee14d9fcb16ed127f05d6f3b5395fb53719c3373", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT_CORyXZORmQq2T8in_CwLzFfu.wfPEY4H91rtkZW843Eu50ooIBBya1ncFbxk90t8pmyOA0ip3Fip1ENbn0sjA2BcpDfeJIu1wPy8tywUSQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Joe Loria", "published": "2017-11-30T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Today's Chicken Meat Contains 224 Percent More Fat", "text": "Today's Chicken Meat Contains 224 Percent More Fat Today's Chicken Meat Contains 224 Percent More Fat November 30, 2017 chicken chain link fence eye cc 1000x523.jpg \nBreeding chickens for unnatural growth decreases the nutritional value of the meat. \nAn article in the Huffington Post shatters the myth that eating chicken is healthy. On modern farms, chickens raised and killed for meat have been bred to grow \u201cso big so fast\u201d they often become immobilized under their own weight and endure debilitating pain. They also suffer heart attacks, organ failure and other problems as a result of rapid growth. \nBreeding chickens for unnatural growth is not only cruel to the chickens but also decreases the nutritional value of the meat. \nA study published in World\u2019s Poultry Science Journal states, \"The ever-increasing genetic pressure to improve growth rates and breast yields of broiler chickens has led to a high incidence of several abnormalities in breast muscles.\" \nIn 2012, another study showed 55.8 percent of broiler chickens had been impacted by muscular myopathies called white striping. By 2016, that number had skyrocketed to more than 96 percent. White striping causes severe product quality and nutritional problems, such as fatty muscle meat. \nIn fact, chicken sold today has 224 percent more fat and 9 percent less protein. Additionally, pound for pound, chicken has about the same amount of cholesterol as red meat. \nChickens comprise 95 percent of animals raised and killed for food in the U.S. and lead some of the most miserable lives of all farmed animals . What\u2019s more, no federal law protects animals during their lives on factory farms. In fact, the law that\u2019s supposed to protect animals at the slaughterhouse, the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act, doesn\u2019t extend to birds, leaving chickens with virtually no protection from abuse. \nUndercover video taken by Mercy For Animals at a Perdue factory farm in North Carolina revealed chickens violently kicked, thrown against walls and stomped to death by sadistic workers.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "poultry science journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huffington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perdue", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:15.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e4acbcdd6f44566aaf9c1c6a3cb43edbc710010f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_dlGaiyHn9kDUa_u6LiPoacx9EhguERruduwRn.rLi8pF1JeT3oVkFUTXBkimsy_OGDrDjkfMxE7UJzjvxQvjP", "site_full": "www.aldeer.com", "site": "aldeer.com", "site_section": "http://www.aldeer.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=postlist&Board=17", "site_categories": ["hunting_shooting", "sports"], "section_title": "TEAM ALDEER - Aldeer", "title": "9 Every Inch Counts -", "title_full": "Team 9 - Every Inch Counts - Aldeer", "published": "2017-10-25T08:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7b25fb8a2b47b59b846e21f94af995fdbd6e75d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_dlGaiyHn9kDUa_u6LiPoacx9EhguERruduwRn.rLi8pF1JeT3oVkFUTXBkimsy_OGDrDjkfMxE6H5c0y84OTGSAv6FstVPf7kIFW8FKB7ZQ--", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "Brent", "published": "2017-12-06T10:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Posting for Orion. 7 point because both brows were broken off.\n\"How in the hell did you get to be a moderator?\"...Skinny\nGod Bless Nick Saban!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://i.imgur.com/75IzLoz.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:15.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e4acbcdd6f44566aaf9c1c6a3cb43edbc710010f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_dlGaiyHn9kDUa_u6LiPoacx9EhguERruduwRn.rLi8pF1JeT3oVkFUTXBkimsy_OGDrDjkfMxE7UJzjvxQvjP", "site_full": "www.aldeer.com", "site": "aldeer.com", "site_section": "http://www.aldeer.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=postlist&Board=17", "site_categories": ["hunting_shooting", "sports"], "section_title": "TEAM ALDEER - Aldeer", "title": "9 Every Inch Counts -", "title_full": "Team 9 - Every Inch Counts - Aldeer", "published": "2017-10-25T08:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cf9456c9fe543721058e55eed4b7c0526d6bbbda", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_dlGaiyHn9kDUa_u6LiPoacx9EhguERruduwRn.rLi8pF1JeT3oVkFUTXBkimsy_OGDrDjkfMxE6H5c0y84OTGL_o8DSkYApmpzsE_TjI_4A--", "ord_in_thread": 11, "author": "bamaeyedoc", "published": "2017-11-27T23:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Got a doe today but forgot to get a pic of it with me in it.

Another Scottish independence referendum felt imminent. Victory was far from assured. So they turned on their old enemy: the media. \nAt a rally in Glasgow , one patriot, channelling the language of President Donald Trump and the American alt-right, denounced \u201cfake news\u201d while others booed the BBC and particular and the press in general. \nThe event? A launch for Scotland in Union, the pro-UK campaign group. It could just as easily been a demonstration by some of the country\u2019s more counter-productive pro-independence campaigners. \n \nThat is the thing about those on the fringes of Scotland\u2019s competing nationalisms: their rhetoric and often dysfunctional behaviours are so similar you have to check their flags to know which side they are on. \nIndeed, they can have more in common with each other than with the mainstreams of their respective movements. \nScotland\u2019s 2014 referendum, especially in comparison with bitter and divisive processes under way elsewhere, looked like a triumph for democracy. \nBut it had its problems, not least online, where pro-independence \u201ccybernats\u201d and their unionist equivalents seemed intent on being counter-productively aggressive. \nSome commentators have called the pro-independence fringes \u201calt-nats\u201d, perhaps because they so closely echo Trumpist rhetoric on the media, perhaps because they are so often radicalised online, in an alternative political reality. They are increasingly detached from the real SNP and Greens. \nA similar fracturing has been taking place on the No side. Along with alt-nats, we now have \u201calt-yoons\u201d too. This isn\u2019t good news for unionism. \nAt their Glasgow rally, in March 2017, Scotland in the Union\u2019s then chief executive, the respected former police officer and Labour MSP Graeme Pearson, had no time for those who boo reporters. \nMr Pearson has now stepped aside. Another ex-Labour politician, Pamela Nash, has taken his place. Both seek to build a broad cross-party base, a kind of reserve Better Together campaign. \nYet there was also clearly a yearning for a more abrasive stance. \nA new group, UK Unity, has set its sights on becoming the voice of unionism or perhaps, to use an SNP term, \u201cultra-unionism\u201d.

surgery is something that changes the lives of many people. However, there are limitations and risks to these procedures. The first thing to consider when getting plastic surgery done is doing the proper research. The piece that follows offers some great facts about cosmetic surgery that may facilitate a better decision.\nInvestigate whether or not the surgeon has a license. Also, look to see whether, or not the person you are considering is board certified, or not. While neither of these things guarantees that your surgery will be performed without error. Generally surgeons with these qualifications, are more experienced in their field.\nCheck out your cosmetic surgeon\u2019s malpractice history. You can contact the Office of Insurance Regulation in your state. Find out about any resolved malpractice claims against your surgeon. Having malpractice claims should not necessarily be a deal-breaker. You may want to rethink your choice if there are multiple, recent malpractice claims.\n\nCosmetic surgery will always require at least one day of recovery. Many times the recovery period will be much longer. Ensure that you have planned these days out, including who will assist you and especially how you will maintain your expenses when you are away from work and salary.\nIn addition to checking up on your surgeon, you also want to check out the clinic, or hospital where the surgery will be performed. Oftentimes this location will be unrelated to your practitioner. You will want to see if it maintains the standards that you demand.\nYou should explore different alternatives to cosmetic surgery. For instance, if you are interested in changing the size of your breasts or getting a liposuction, a healthy diet and a lot of exercise could help you reach your goals and save a lot of money. Give yourself a few months to try different alternatives before getting surgery.\nConsider going to another country to have your plastic surgery. Having cosmetic surgery in foreign country may be an option if you are looking to save money. Make sure to do your research, however, so that you choose a reputable center to have the work done at.\nAsk about surgery fees in advance, and be sure to watch out for hidden fees. The surgeon\u2019s cost is not the only one in the equation. There are also fees for the use of the operating room, the anaesthetic, and the implant itself if one is being used. Ask about final walk-out-the-door costs.\nAsk your surgeon if he will be handling anesthesia for your plastic surgery alone. If so, insist on having an anesthesiologist, or anesthesiology nurse participate in your surgery. If there is a problem with anesthesia during the surgery, the doctor may have difficulty dealing with both the anesthesia, and the surgery.\nIf you are looking specifically at getting a nose job, you have an interesting option available to you- if you are brave! India is the mecca of rhinplasty, it has been for many years. Many people are put off by this option because of the distance. There are many quality surgeons, who charge far less than the United States.\nBe https://startsat60.com/lifestyle/style/brazilian-butt-lift-the-surprising-plastic-surgery-thats-replacing-the-breast-implant in your expectations. Surgery can change your physical appearance, but there are limits to its effects. For example, if you want surgery because you suffer from low self esteem, you are probably going to continue to have low self esteem, even after your surgery. You might want to consider counseling, before you decide on surgery.\nYou should understand all the positives and all the negative health risks that are associated with the cosmetic procedure you are going to undertake. Cosmetic surgery is still surgery, and any type of surgical procedure is going to have its related risks. Discuss all the risks with your board certified cosmetic surgeon.\n\nMake sure you ask questions. It is imperative that you understand what your doctor is saying, especially if it sounds complicated. Ask the surgeon to repeat himself using normal language, and repeat back anything the surgeon says to confirm you understand.\nIf you are considering getting plastic surgery but are sedentary, you first need to change that about yourself. Not only, exercise is important for your overall health, but it specifically helps your body to improve your skin quicker and more efficiently. This will help you to avoid any unsightly scars afterwards.\nWhile diet is always important, it should be maintained throughout your life. It is especially important around one month before a cosmetic surgery. A proper diet means, that your body is better prepared to heal itself in the recovery period. Avoid fried, or fatty foods. Stick with healthy whole carbs, and proteins.\nIf you are planning your surgery for the long-term, then you should fix your diet immediately. If you already have a reasonable diet, you can fine tune it. The important point is to have a healthy lifestyle before, changing your body through surgery. This will allow the procedure to have the best impact possible.\nWhile there are no magical benefits to visualization, it can still be a helpful technique. Before you start your procedure, visualize everything going well. After you have undergone the surgery, begin to visualize a quick, complete recovery. This won\u2019t actually improve the recovery, but it will improve your state of mind.\nIf possible, fill prescriptions for post-surgical antibiotics and painkillers before you have surgery. This way, the medications are ready and waiting for you when you return home. You won\u2019t have to make another trip out while in pain, or try to remember to fill your antibiotics while in a post-anesthetic fog.\nPlan ahead before having your procedure done. Make sure to schedule your surgery during a time when you don\u2019t have other family, or work commitments. Give Recommended Web page of time for recovery after the procedure is done. If you do not take the time to recover, your results might not end up being what you are hoping for. You might experience more pain than is truly necessary.\nMaking the choice to undergo cosmetic surgery is a very big, and important decision. It might very well change your life!

Under the bright Italian sun, the girls walked around exploring the architectural beauty of the Renaissance city. (Naver V app) When the bell started ringing from the St Mark\u2018s Campanile, they stopped walking and stood still in a bid to fully savor the beautiful sound. At San Marco Square, the K-pop starlets were surrounded by a group of tourists asking for a photo. The sextet happily posed for a photo with the tourists and also made attempts for conversation despite the language barrier. (Naver V app) Even after taking the photo, the fans lingered around the bandmates, seemingly unwilling to let go of this unexpected rendezvous with the pop stars. The bandmates bid a reluctant farewell to the fans, by saying \u201cGrazie Mille\u201d with a big smile.Naver\u2019s real-time broadcasting app V allows fans to interact with their favorite K-pop stars through live broadcasts.

Bozeman, owner of iCann Consulting, pleaded guilty to manufacturing, delivering and possessing drugs, with intent to manufacture or deliver in 2005, Pennsylvania court records show. Bozeman, who was 20 at the time, was also charged with possession of marijuana and paraphernalia, but those charges were dismissed.\nThe department hired iCann for two consulting contracts: to help draft rules and regulations for medical marijuana product manufacturers and to provide expertise during the department's evaluation of applications to grow medical marijuana.\nThe department agreed to pay Bozeman up to $150,000 for his work. To date, he has been paid about $12,892 by the department this year, according to state expenditure records.\nThe department last week announced 12 winners out of 109 applicants for large-scale medical marijuana grow operations.\nLt. Gov. Mary Taylor was among a handful of state officials who said Tuesday the state should not award any licenses until the process has been reviewed.\n\"As a mother who has struggled with addiction in my own family, I am outraged that a convicted drug dealer played a major role in determining who was suitable to receive a license,\" Taylor said in a statement. \"At a minimum, the integrity of the process has been called into question and it is unconscionable to imagine that this process would be allowed to continue until we have a full reckoning.\"\nJimmy Gould, CEO of cultivator applicant CannAscend, said the department's failure to disclose the prior conviction is one more reason for a full review of the department's cultivation application review process.\nCannAscend's bid for a license was disqualified for an unspecified reason.\n\"Did the Department of Commerce not think it important to check and report the fact that at least one of the scorers of the Medical Marijuana Control Program had a criminal record for dealing drugs, and potentially other brushes with the law?\" Gould, who co-founded ResponsibleOhio and the group's 2015 marijuana legalization effort, said in a statement. \"If not, why not? Did they require a background check to get a license, but not to give a license?\"\nThe department, in writing the rules for the program, barred people with felony drug convictions from applying for a cultivator license and required each applicant to undergo a background check. The department would not say Tuesday whether they performed a background check on the consultants.\nA department spokeswoman said all consulting companies hired by the department \"met the standards provided within their contract.\"\n\"Obviously, we're not surprised to learn that people who applied and didn't get a license are disappointed,\" spokeswoman Stephanie Gostomski said in an email. \"Any applicant who did not receive a license has the right to appeal the decision if they so choose.\"\nGostomski said the applications were scored with a combination of state employees and consultants. The department has not responded to further questions from cleveland.com about the level of involvement consultants had with the process.\nThe department received permission earlier this year to award the contracts to iCann, incorporated last year in Dublin, Ohio; Arizona-based Meade and Wing and Illinois-based B&B Grow from the Ohio Controlling Board, a legislative panel that oversees state spending.\nSen. Bill Coley, a Liberty Township Republican and Ohio Controlling Board member, said the felony conviction should have been disclosed to the board. Coley said the department should re-evaluate the applications and re-score them without a convicted felon among the reviewers.\n\"I'm sure there's plenty of good qualified people with educational backgrounds and professional backgrounds that could do the job that don't have a felony or wouldn't raise any questions or doubt,\" Coley said. \"This whole program's going to be under very strict scrutiny, both from the state and the federal level, and we want to make sure we get it right.\"\n Ohio hired convicted felon to score medical marijuana grow license applications | cleveland.com\nAuthor: Jackie Borchardt\nContact: Cleveland.com Contact Us\nPhoto Credit: David Ramos\nWebsite: Cleveland OH Local News, Breaking News, Sports & Weather - cleveland.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/12/ohio_hired_convicted_felon_to.html", "http://www.cleveland.com/", "http://www.cleveland.com/contactus/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:18.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "50c28bd64ca4ba5af4cc8ebbd7d7665aa3b5608c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xyb6esjcDJRdQfYxhlL49EPxW6zVYc8R6OBj85R9qgXKfxajEVgCJD5dh.Y9oOWwz9bXeHav4acT3nlo6d7Ho7w_QneaeAvscwv26kn4cWkJzZG3IMQKyMlGJFr7FwHYQ--", "site_full": "www.lazada.sg", "site": "lazada.sg", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.sg/shop-fragrances/express-delivery/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Express Delivery Store | Get Daily Needs Fast | Lazada.sg", "title": "Giorgio Armani Acqua Di Gio EDT for Men |", "title_full": "Giorgio Armani Acqua Di Gio EDT for Men 100ml | Lazada Singapore", "published": "2017-04-06T10:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.285, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8973, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "31eeb9e980c9dbf2ff85f9468d387d5b21501084", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xyb6esjcDJRdQfYxhlL49EPxW6zVYc8R6OBj85R9qgXKfxajEVgCJD5dh.Y9oOWwz9bXeHav4acT3nlo6d7Ho7w_QneaeAvscwv26kn4cWkJzZG3IMQKyN_6m5iv1tqlvXhpyuGUdDd", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "Lyndon L.", "published": "2017-12-01T16:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "Good deal", "text": "Very fast delivery and good packaging.
