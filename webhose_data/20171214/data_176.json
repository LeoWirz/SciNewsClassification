Written and published by tax preparation planner Frank Ellis, the article covers important topics every taxpayer needs to know as tax season approaches. These topics also represent key matters people need to be aware of when filing their taxes. \nThe first question covers the documents needed for filing. These include the W-2 form from employers and a 1099-INT form from a bank. Documents with social security numbers are needed as well. Receipts are another necessity. Also, the author reveals how important it is to file taxes even if one did not have a lot of earnings. Even if income is below the IRS\u2019s filing requirement, the author says, filing is still recommended. After all, it is the only way to get a tax refund. Some insight into tax credits is provided here as well. \nMany taxpayers ask who they can claim as a dependent. Ellis also explains who else can be claimed, and how much can be deducted as a result. Deductions and credits for parents are a hot topic, and the author also answers the question of what is available to parents. The child and dependent care tax credit, child tax credit , and earned income tax credit are listed in this section. \nNext, tax benefits for college students are explained. Relief options offered by the IRS include the American Opportunity Tax Credit, Lifetime Learning Credit, and deductions for tuition and fees. These are explained for those who might not be fully aware of the options. \nAfter answering the five key questions, the author talks about the benefits of filing taxes online. One can immediately find out if they qualify for deductions by answering the questions on H&R Block or TurboTax. Ellis mentions how W-2 information can be automatically imported. He also notes the availability of a tax refund calculator that can be of great help. \nTo find answers to important tax filing questions and more, go to the article at http://internettaxconnection.com/five-common-tax-questions/ \nAbout Frank Ellis \nFrank Ellis is a Traverse City Tax Preparation Planner and published author.

In 2015, there were only 454 students. Kaye LaFond / Michigan Radio Listen to part two of UN/DIVIDED, a three-part series by April Van Buren. \nIn May of last year, residents of Albion stepped into the voting booth. \nOn their ballots, they saw this question: \n\"Shall Albion Public Schools be annexed to Marshall Public Schools to be effective July 1, 2016?\" \nThis story is part two of UN/DIVIDED, a three-part series from Michigan Radio \nIn the months leading up to the vote, this question divided the city in a way Jontaj Wallace had never seen before. \n\u201cLike, you would drive through here and you would see signs pro-annexation and anti-annexation. All this other stuff,\u201d he says. \nWallace has spent his whole life in this city. He grew up just a few miles from Albion College. Now, he\u2019s a sophomore there, studying music education. Jontaj Wallace graduated from Marshall High School in 2016 and is now a sophomore at Albion College. Credit April Van Buren / Michigan Radio \nWallace says this community has always felt like a big, extended family. But last year, the question of whether the Marshall district should annex Albion\u2019s schools divided the city, and Wallace saw his tight-knit family start to fray. \n\u201cLike, any time of the day you will see like attacks on social media. You will see people who had known each other for years, like friends for years, just because of this one thing stop talking to each other,\u201d says Wallace. \u201cLike, in public! In grocery lines, in restaurants.\u201d \nThe vote to close Albion\u2019s school system was more than a year ago. \nBut the story of why it closed starts a lot further back. \nSo how did Albion Public Schools get to the point of annexation in the first place? \nvia GIPHY \nAdvocating against annexation \nAlbion City Council member Sonya Brown lives on a quiet street. It\u2019s lined with big trees and lots of ranch-style houses. \nBrown has lived in Albion for most of her life, and she says there is just something special about this city. \n\u201cIt\u2019s just rich in diversity. I mean, we have our issues, every community does, but at the end of the day, there\u2019s a richness here that you won\u2019t find anywhere else,\u201d she tells me. \nAt one end of Brown\u2019s city council precinct is Irwin Ave. It\u2019s a street with stately houses and manicured lawns. At the other end is a public housing complex. \nBrown spent hours walking around her neighborhood in the months leading up to annexation, knocking on door after door and urging her neighbors to vote no. \nShe says when she was growing up, Albion\u2019s schools were the glue that held this diverse community together. \n\u201cSo we all grew up together, no matter how much money you had or where you lived. We all grew up together and we all knew each other,\u201d Brown explains. \nThe schools were where everyone mingled: Rich and poor, black and white. But at some point, that started to change. And for all of the controversy over annexation, there is one thing that everybody seems to agree on. \nThe fate of Albion Public Schools can mostly be traced back to one thing: schools of choice. \nA district in distress \nJerri-Lynn Williams-Harper took over as superintendent of Albion Public Schools in 2012. \nShe says it was immediately clear to her what was to blame for the district\u2019s concentrating poverty and ever-tightening budget. \n\u201cSchool of choice in the state of Michigan, and as it happens many places, really starts with white flight. And so that's what we had,\u201d she says. In the district's last year, 96% of students got free and reduced lunch. \nAlbion, like many cities across Michigan, has a large number of students who live in the city, but attend a different school district. That\u2019s because more than 20 years ago, Michigan passed a law that changed how students chose schools. \nInstead of being assigned to a district based on your city or your neighborhood, you could choose from any district that would take you. \n\u201cSo when I got here, we had a district whose population over the last 20 years had declined 100 to 200 students steadily per year per year,\u201d Williams-Harper says. \nAlbion used to be a remarkably integrated district. Fifteen years ago, there was a nearly even split between white students and kids of color. Albion schools used to be almost evenly split between white students and students of color. Credit Emma Winowiecki / Michigan Radio \nBut as families scattered to surrounding districts, student demographics shifted. The district became majority African-American. And the percentage of students from low-income families climbed dramatically. \nIn the district\u2019s last year, 96% of students got free and reduced lunch. \nBut middle-class families weren\u2019t moving out of Albion. They didn\u2019t have to. Their kids could just hop on one of the buses other districts sent into the city everyday. \nWilliams-Harper remembers the newspaper headlines about her response. \n\u201cWilliams-Harper says \u2018Get your buses out of my district,'\u201d they read. \nShe met with other superintendents and begged them: Please stop sending the buses. Stop stealing our students. \n\u201cI said in essence, and it\u2019s not a nice word, but I said you\u2019re raping us. You\u2019re taking my kids. You\u2019re making sure you\u2019re adding to the demise of this district,\u201d she told them. \nRace and schools of choice \nAlbion isn\u2019t the only district that\u2019s seen shifting student demographics in the wake of schools of choice. \nMike Wilkinson is a reporter for Bridge Magazine . \nAbout a year ago, he worked on a series of stories that looked at how those policies were changing the racial makeup of schools across the state. \nThe bottom line? \nWhen parents use school of choice to send their kid to another district, they often end up choosing one that is more segregated. \nTake Holland, for instance. \nIt\u2019s a city with a nearly even split between white and Hispanic students. But around one out of every three students goes to school somewhere else. And the white students who leave largely end up in much whiter districts. \n\u201cYou ask yourself, 'Why are they making that switch? Is it truly a better school?'\u201d \nWell, Wilkinson says, it depends. \nIn some areas, white kids staying in Holland were doing better. In some cases, the ones leaving the city were ahead. \n\u201cIt's not an absolute \u2018They're going to do best if they leave,\u2019\u201d he explains. \nA downward spiral \nStudents who live in Albion are scattered across surrounding cities. \nForty-two districts have enrolled at least one kid from Albion at some point over the past eight years. But there are seven that have taken in the most students. \nHere\u2019s what those schools looked like in 2002, around the time Albion started bleeding students. Marshall: 94% white In 2016-17, Marshall elementary schools were 82% white on average. The exception? Harrington Elementary in Albion, which was 32% white. Credit Emma Winowiecki / Michigan Radio Homer: 98% white Mar Lee Schools: 97% white Western: 95% white \nAnd whether it\u2019s Albion or Holland or Detroit, when students leave, they take a big chunk of money with them. \n\u201cSo what happens is when some of these choice moves take place -- let's say 100 kids leave. Well, that district has now lost $70,000,\u201d says Wilkinson. \nWilkinson actually meant to say $700,000. Each student in Michigan comes with around $7,000 in state money. When a school loses that much cash, it has to find ways to balance the budget. So it cuts staff, which means class sizes grow. \n\u201cAnd then so now you've got a question of is that teacher going to be effective. So the next year or another 100 kids leave,\u201d says Wilkinson. \nThat same downward spiral played out in Albion again and again. \nAnd each time parents pulled their kids out, Albion was left with a higher percentage of students in poverty. In the district's final year, 96% of Albion students qualified for free and reduced lunch, compared to just 28% of Marshall students. Credit Emma Winowiecki / Michigan Radio \nThe fact is, it takes more money to help students in poverty succeed. They need supports like social workers and extra classroom aids. So, right as the needs of Albion\u2019s students were growing, the budget to meet those needs was shrinking. \nJerri-Lynn Williams Harper says when she arrived in 2012, the district\u2019s finances were completely drained. \n\u201cThat was a huge surprise. Such a surprise that we have someone from the outside come and look and make sure and it was sort of zero minus zero zero,\u201d she says. \nWilliams-Harper says they had no choice but to make some drastic changes. \nThis is what she proposed: \nStarting in 2013, Albion would become a K through 8 district. The city would send 9th through 12th grade students to Marshall, one city over. \nAlbion High School was the center of the community. It\u2019s where people came together for Friday night basketball games and school events. The idea of losing that was painful. \nWilliams-Harper\u2019s plan led to heated school board meetings, protests, and rallies. But in the end, the Albion school board voted yes. They signed a cooperative agreement with Marshall. \nAlbion became a K through 8 district. And in the fall of 2013, high schoolers in Albion started catching an early morning bus 13 miles down the highway. \nWilliams-Harper says it was the only option to keep the district financially viable. \n\u201cIt was still very difficult and very hurtful to this town because it was I think a lot of people would feel that it was that they were sort of being sold down the river, which wasn't the case at all,\u201d she says. \nBut for a lot of people who had grown up in Albion, and had walked the halls of that high school, that\u2019s exactly how it felt. \nHarry Bonner is the head of Kids at Hope Youth Development Center, and he\u2019s been a leader in Albion for decades. \nBonner agrees that closing the high school was the right thing to do. Albion just didn\u2019t have what its students needed. \n\u201cCan you imagine a high school with no high school sports?\u201d Bonner asks. \nThe Albion football team was gone. One girls' and one boys\u2019 basketball team was all they had left. And the school couldn\u2019t compete with the programs at other districts. \n\u201cSame thing with academic classes,\u201d says Bonner. \u201cThe kind of academic classes you need to be ready to enter college and be college ready, we didn\u2019t have that,\u201d says Bonner. Harry Bonner and Marshall school board member Carrie Nicholson. Credit April Van Buren / Michigan Radio \nStill, Bonner took issue with the way the district went about making that decision. \n\u201cIt may be the right decision to make in the end, but it\u2019s the process and the road that you took to get there that determines whether you\u2019re gonna be fighting over this for years or not because people didn\u2019t feel included. They didn\u2019t feel valued. They didn\u2019t feel none of that,\u201d Bonner says. \nThere was hope that sending high schoolers to Marshall would save Albion schools. \nAnd for two years, things seemed okay. \nBut when Albion Public Schools opened in the fall of 2015, they had lost another hundred students. \nThis is when things got chaotic. \nLosing 100 students meant the district\u2019s budget was hundreds of thousands of dollars short. That was on top of the already existing $3 million of debt. \nArt and gym and music classes were cut. Teachers started leaving the district. \nAnd so the Albion school board made a drastic decision. \nThey voted to send 6th through 8th graders to Marshall Middle School, starting in January 2016. \n\u201cWhen do you move middle school students in the middle of the year?\u201d asks Bonner. \u201cI don\u2019t know any school system that would believe that that would be the best way to transition young people. Our young people moved in January to Marshall Middle school. And you ask how did it go? Terrible,\u201d Bonner says. \nStudents in Albion had to start waking up hours earlier. Everyone at Marshall Middle School had their schedules rearranged. There was tension between students. Tension between parents and the school. \nAnd like the closing of the high school in 2013, Bonner says it was a rushed process that had people feeling left out. \nReverend Donald Phillips\u2019 son was at Albion Middle School at the time of the move. \n\u201cI found out from my student about him telling me, \u2018Oh you know, I\u2019m going to Marshall Middle school next semester,\u201d he tells me. \nPhillips says he didn\u2019t get a letter from the district until after his son told him what was happening. \nAs the Phillips and other families were adjusting to this new reality, there was a bigger question hanging in the air. \nWhat was going to happen to Albion Public Schools? \nNeighbors against neighbors \nThat question split the community. \nOpposing Facebook groups formed. There were heated debates on and offline. \nJontaj Wallace was a senior at Marshall High School, set to graduate at the end of 2016, and he was all in for annexation. \nHe\u2019d been going to Marshall since Albion closed its high school in 2013, and he\u2019d thrived there. He was a drum major in the marching band, he ran cross country, and he got great grades. There were plenty of people who felt - and who still feel - that annexation was the wrong decision. \nSo, Wallace would show up at school board meetings and tell the adults: \nLook, high school students have been going to Marshall for three years now. And all of those terrible things you predicted would happen? They didn\u2019t. \n\u201cAnd I remember that there was a comment from a couple of people like, 'You\u2019re the you\u2019re the black poster child of Marshall. And of course you would say that because you\u2019re going to be successful in any school district, so why does it matter for you and all this,'\u201d recalls Wallace. \nAdults against kids. Neighbors against neighbors. Friends against friends. \nThat was the mood in Albion in the months leading up to the annexation vote in May of 2016. \nJontaj Wallace says he knows annexation was the right thing to do. \n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that we needed to annex because, you know, we didn't have enough money. And what better district to annex with than Marshall,\u201d he says. \nBut there were plenty of people who felt \u2013 and who still feel \u2013 that annexation was the wrong decision. \nCity council member Sonya Brown is one of them. \n\u201cI\u2019ve heard parents say, \u2018We did not know.' Like, 'We didn\u2019t have it as bad as we thought we did.\u2019 I mean, granted we were struggling. I can\u2019t deny that. I won\u2019t deny that. But I still strongly believe that we could have turned things around,\u201d Brown tells me. \nShe was actually on the Albion school board at the time. When it voted whether to put the question of annexation on the ballot, Brown was the only one who voted no. \nShe became one of the most vocal opponents to annexation. She says she remembers waiting to see the final vote returns after spending all day knocking doors and getting people out to vote. \nThen the final numbers came back. \nSeventy-one percent of voters had said yes \u2013 they wanted Marshall to annex Albion\u2019s schools. \n\u201cMy heart was aching for our children, but at peace because I did everything that I could have possibly done,\u201d Brown says. \nThe state gave Marshall a total of $6.7 million over two years for the cost of annexing the Albion district. \nThat included paying off its more than $3 million of debt, fixing up Harrington Elementary, and buying buses to get middle and high school students to and from Marshall. \nOn July 1, 2016, Albion Public Schools ceased to exist. \nStill divided \nBut the story of annexation isn\u2019t over for Sonya Brown. \nShe\u2019s remained a vocal critic of the way annexation has played out. Sonya Brown (front, left) and other Albion community members that continue to fight annexation. Credit April Van Buren / Michigan Radio \nBrown says students from Albion, especially students of color, aren\u2019t getting an equitable education. \nAnd she wants to give Albion schools a second chance. \n\u201cWe want a push for legislation that would create an avenue for dissolved and annexed districts to recreate themselves,\u201d Brown told me at a press conference this summer. \nShe and several other community members were there to announce a plan that would give Albion residents the chance to vote on re-opening the city\u2019s public schools. \nKids at Hope director Harry Bonner says that\u2019s a non-starter. \n\u201c\u2018Give us back our school.\u2019 Really? What school you talking about? The one that didn\u2019t have the things in place to get our kids a quality education? I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re even asking that question,\u201d Bonner says. \n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have the infrastructure. We didn\u2019t have none of the different things we needed to offer a quality education system for our kids. So you want us to give it back to you? We\u2019re not gonna support that.\u201d \nNow, more than a year after Albion residents voted to annex with Marshall Public Schools, there are still big disagreements over how to move forward. \nThe community tension that came out of annexation hasn\u2019t gone away. \nPeople on both sides have very different visions for the future of Albion kids. \nAnd it\u2019s not clear how or if they will be able to find some common ground. \nSo where do Albion and Marshall go from here, and what will it mean for the students stuck in the middle? \nCome back tomorrow for Part 3 of UN/DIVIDED, a three-part series from Michigan Radio.

The transaction fees \u2013 charged by the Bitcoin network \u2013 have been as high as $20 per transaction as recent as last week, a massive bump from the $0.20 the network used to charge when Steam first accepted Bitcoin. \nWhen the value of Bitcoin drops, these high fees become even more of a problem. \u201cHistorically, the value of Bitcoin has been volatile, but the degree of volatility has become extreme in the last few months, losing as much as 25% in value over a period of days,\u201d Valve explained . \n\u201cThe value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction doesn\u2019t complete within that window of time, then the amount of Bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change. The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different.\u201d \nValve would either refund the original payment, or ask the customer to pay the difference. In both cases, according to Valve, the Bitcoin network will charge a transaction fee on \u2013 so twice on one order. \n\u201cThis year, we\u2019ve seen increasing number of customers get into this state,\u201d the post went on. \u201cWith the transaction fee being so high right now, it is not feasible to refund or ask the customer to transfer the missing balance (which itself runs the risk of underpayment again, depending on how much the value of Bitcoin changes while the Bitcoin network processes the additional transfer).\u201d \nAs a result, Valve called supporting Bitcoin \u201cuntenable\u201d, but it left the door open for reevaluation \u201cat a later date.\u201d  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "valve", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "valve", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:39.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a646b9a7e152040fe3dea5079552ccb9e1d06808", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuWur7byrlI91g9rtVpGd0IF5kxaZxg8OZTwovpGCJNmVDQeVQjswG3ZLnio31acQ-", "site_full": "topstocks.com.au", "site": "topstocks.com.au", "site_section": "https://topstocks.com.au/", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "geology", "health", "science"], "section_title": "Recent Threads | TopStocks ASX Forum", "title": "Gold trading | Page 16", "title_full": "Gold trading | Page 16 | TopStocks ASX Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T18:31:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://topstocks.com.au/apple-touch-icon-180x180.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f5988f9b6a8e1a630bd7b1d35bd17c0200305bc6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuWur7byrlI91g9rtVpGd0IF5kxaZxg8OZTwovpGCJNmVDQeVQjswGZA9VdR512i0ZLj2lUW6Ik970YuU4tK10", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "MLF", "published": "2017-12-06T23:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Cheers Whispers, and Maxaction.\nTook the cash as well.\nPity Im not there, as it would be my shout!\nAnd yes.

Prosecutors say he accepted a $2 million bribe from Rosneft\u2019s influential CEO, Igor Sechin, for giving the company the green light for privatizing another oil firm. \nThe circumstances of the case have ignited speculation that Ulyukayev was caught in a Kremlin power play against Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin. \nIn his final argument on Thursday, Ulyukayev pleaded not guilty and accused Sechin of setting him up. \n\u201cA horrific and cruel provocation has been perpetrated against me,\u201d he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies. \nSechin, whose testimony was the cornerstone of the case against the former minister, was summoned to testify in court four times but he did not show up, citing urgent matters of business. \nReferring to a common perception of Sechin as a dark force in Russian politics, Ulyakayev said in court on Thursday that the key witness \u201cdisappeared \u2014 what was left was a whiff of sulfur in the air.\u201d \nUlyukaev went to Sechin\u2019s office in November last year to discuss Rosneft\u2019s affairs, and was arrested as he was leaving the building with a bag full of cash that Sechin had given him. Ulyukayev told the court that he thought the bag contained a bottle of wine and a basket filled with sausages. \nIn wire tapes played out to the court earlier in the trial, Sechin was heard telling Ulyukayev to take the bag with the sausage. Russian media has reported that Sechin has a tradition of gifting people baskets of sausages from his own butcher\u2019s shop. \nUlyukayev could face a lengthy prison term if found guilty. Prosecutors have asked the court to send him to a high-security prison for ten years, arguing that Ulyukayev\u2019s actions \u201care undermining the authority of the government.\u201d \nUlyukayev told the court on Thursday that he is not guilty of \u201cthose absurd accusations but guilty of a different thing: I often compromised. I was a hypocrite. I love taking gifts and giving gifts. When you\u2019re doing all right, you shamelessly turn your back on other people\u2019s misfortunes.\u201d \nUlyukayev asked for \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d forgiveness and pledged to devote rest of his life to \u201cdefending people\u2019s interests.\u201d \nThe court is expected to deliver the verdict next week.

The stock has experienced bearish momentum as it\u2019s ATR or Average True Range has dipped consistently over the past 10 sessions. \nWhen focusing on technical stock analysis, traders and investors may choose to also study the ATR or Average True Range. The present 14-day ATR for Moto Goldmines Ltd (MTO.AX) is currently standing at 0.17. The ATR basically measures the volatility of a stock on a day-to-day basis. The average true range is typically based on 14 periods and may be calculated daily, weekly, monthly, or intraday. The ATR is not considered a directional indicator, but it may reflect the strength of a particular move. \nCurrently, the 14-day ADX for Moto Goldmines Ltd (MTO.AX) is sitting at 16.36. Generally speaking, an ADX value from 0-25 would indicate an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would support a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would identify a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would lead to an extremely strong trend. ADX is used to gauge trend strength but not trend direction. Traders often add the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to identify the direction of a trend. \nChecking in on some other technical levels, the 14-day RSI is currently at 50.94, the 7-day stands at 50.78, and the 3-day is sitting at 48.81. Many investors look to the Relative   reading of a particular stock to help identify overbought/oversold conditions. The RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970\u2019s. Wilder laid out the foundation for future technical analysts to further investigate the RSI and its relationship to underlying price movements. Since its inception, RSI has remained very popular with traders and investors. Other technical analysts have built upon the work of Wilder. The 14-day RSI is still a widely popular choice among technical stock analysts. \nInvestors may be watching other technical indicators such as the   Williams %R. The Williams %R is a momentum indicator that helps measure oversold and overbought levels. This indicator compares the closing price of a stock in relation to the highs and lows over a certain time period. A common look back period is 14 days. Moto Goldmines Ltd (MTO.AX)\u2019s Williams %R presently stands at -22.22. The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. A reading between 0 and -20 would indicate an overbought situation. A reading from -80 to -100 would indicate an oversold situation. \nTaking a closer look from a technical standpoint, Moto Goldmines Ltd (MTO.AX) presently has   43.16. Typically, the CCI oscillates above and below a zero line. Normal oscillations tend to stay in the range of -100 to +100. A CCI reading of +100 may represent overbought conditions, while readings near -100 may indicate oversold territory. Although the CCI indicator was developed for commodities, it has become a popular tool for equity evaluation as well. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wilder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "shares of moto goldmines ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moto goldmines ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:40.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4aa9e24f7a54d9d341c980f972a4ee7a667f5206", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwiOUTU8TQgHr.aVkV2XBdE-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4aa9e24f7a54d9d341c980f972a4ee7a667f5206", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwiOUTU8TQgHr.aVkV2XBdE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "return (bool)preg_match('%(?:\r\n                         [\\xC2-\\xDF][\\x80-\\xBF]                 # non-overlong 2-byte\r\n                         |\\xE0[\\xA0-\\xBF][\\x80-\\xBF]            # excluding overlongs\r\n                         |[\\xE1-\\xEC\\xEE\\xEF][\\x80-\\xBF]{2}     # straight 3-byte\r\n                         |\\xED[\\x80-\\x9F][\\x80-\\xBF]            # excluding surrogates\r\n                         |\\xF0[\\x90-\\xBF][\\x80-\\xBF]{2}         # planes 1-3\r\n                         |[\\xF1-\\xF3][\\x80-\\xBF]{3}             # planes 4-15\r\n                         |\\xF4[\\x80-\\x8F][\\x80-\\xBF]{2}         # plane 16\r\n                         )+%xs', $string);", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:40.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e3c87f5c160a17cc3002302144e95bdefb65554b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS7qymNfQA8Gv12pKQMteM3h1yGm0RI4t1kfcTKa.LwHXCjWSx65SMWCB1GQe1YbNdxD_4vIeQL3c3ZbXU8Z9ZKrYKgoT1jxtlgzw6QfZ_WKc-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Australia", "title": "Public gallery sings \"I am, you are, we are Australian\" after Marriage Equality vote", "title_full": "Public gallery sings \"I am, you are, we are Australian\" after Marriage Equality vote : australia", "published": "2017-12-07T09:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b8cb28991a219eb3afc7e5c4691e3ba3cee6b0bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS7qymNfQA8Gv12pKQMteM3h1yGm0RI4t1kfcTKa.LwHXCjWSx65SMWCB1GQe1YbNdxD_4vIeQL3c3ZbXU8Z9ZKrYKgoT1jxtlhvmoCYhZA9y2TfQcuRH40SqtHiuZEFfh", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "TomasTTEngin", "published": "2017-12-07T10:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "If we're doing pop songs as anthems I've always favoured You're the Voice - great positive message of empowerment and independence, equality and democracy.\nImagine us doing the woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh at sports.

Google collaborated with MediaTek to ensure that Android Oreo (Go edition) works well on its line of processors, enabling a faster time-to-market mechanism for device manufacturers, and ensuring a quality Android smartphone experience that is both secure and affordable for devices with 512MB to 1GB of memory. This marks one of the first times that entry-level SoCs are ready to be used shortly after the latest version of Android, in this case Android 8.1 Oreo, has been released to the Android Open Source Project. \nWith Android Oreo (Go edition), Google has optimized its OS platform, first party apps and the Google Play\u2122 Store to improve the capabilities of entry level devices. Limited processing power and storage are top pain points for entry-level device users. Android Oreo (Go edition) was created to not only address these issues, but to also ensure that the devices are secure and that users have more control over data usage. \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) leverages the existing Google Play Store ecosystem to deliver apps that run smoothly on low memory devices. This improves the overall user experience with, and support for, devices that have 512MB to 1GB of memory, which results in significant bill of materials (BOM) cost savings. These savings enable device makers to provide the 400 million users who buy entry-level smartphones every year, a better option. \n\u201cEntry-level devices are the gateway to the internet for many people, and we want to make sure everyone has a great experience when they use these devices,\u201d said Sameer Samat, VP of Product Management, Android & Google Play. \u201cWe\u2019re excited that Android Oreo (Go edition) will significantly improve storage, performance, data management, and security.\u201d \n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement builds upon our existing work with Google, including our recent collaboration on Google\u2019s GMS Express to speed up the certification process,\u201d said TL Lee, General Manager of MediaTek\u2019s Wireless Communication business unit. \u201cWith Android Oreo (Go edition), we are partnering with Google to tackle the performance challenges of lower memory phones, improving the user experience of entry level smartphones for consumers in key markets across India, the Middle East & Africa, Latin America and South East Asia.\u201d \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) leverages MediaTek\u2019s acclaimed turnkey references and chipsets that are designed specifically to reduce product development time and compliance testing. A wide range of MediaTek SoC\u2019s supports Android Oreo (Go edition), including the MT6739 and MT6737 for 4G devices, as well as the MT6580 for 3G devices. This gives device makers the range of capabilities they need to develop devices for specific price points and markets. \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) smartphones powered by MediaTek will be available in world-wide market by Q1, 2018. \nFor more information about the program, please explore: https://www.android.com/ \n*Google, Android, and Google Play are trademarks of Google LLC. \nAbout MediaTek Inc.

Sherif Saed,   08:51 GMT Share on: \nJust like everyone predicted, jet skis are coming to PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds. \nIt was less of a prediction and more of an educated guess. The reason being that the last few PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds patches included references, sometimes 3D models, of many of the items officially announced over the last few days. \nThat includes the R45 six-shot revolver , the pickup truck \u2013 which we now know is exclusive to Miramar (the desert map) \u2013 the sawed-off shotgun and many others. \nRevealed today, the game\u2019s version of jet skis is called the Aquarail, and it\u2019s coming to both Erangel, and Miramar. The model is identical to the one datamined from 1.0 test patch last month. \nThe addition of a faster water vehicle is sorely needed, and should make encounters near and on the water more interesting. \nDeveloper PUBG Corp did not say when the vehicle will be available, but it\u2019s more than likely we\u2019ll see it with the next test patch. The patch will bring the desert map to players for the first time. The map\u2019s name was officially revealed as Miramar yesterday.

I can't understand if it has a use other than to leave a patch blank.\nDoes it have any other function if you put it before or after effects? Because you can't turn it on or off using the pedal. Just curious.\nCheers. Sep 5, 2014, 10:47 AM Like fly135 Cheap Gear Enthusiast Join date: Jul 2007 80 That's it purpose. To not have an effect in that slot. No reason to believe it's order will affect anything.\nAt first glance you might think that having any effect in the slot and not turned on is exactly the same. Except the Zoom appears to apply a DSP usage to every effect and may deny you certain ones if the max is exceeded. So a bypass avoids adding usage for an effect you don't intend to use.

Also, if you have two amp sims active it will automatically bypass one of them.\nAnd no, you can't turn it on or off, bypass is just bypassed - the ability to turn it on would just mean you go from having a bypass to having a bypass!\nHope that helps?

(YuYao Gao) Recently, a child star has attracted attention in China, and she published a very interesting rap song: \u201cFreestyle In the Girl\u2019s Dorm\u201d. Thousands of reposts were received on weibo just one day. The song is sung by a girl named Yuyao Gao, who is only 12 years old. She is a talented child star since childhood, and she has lots of perform experiences on CCTV, local TV and other important events. There are countless art awards she has got. Apart from a great singer, she also has the talent on acting. She got a role in the TV Situation Sitcom \u201cfamily with children\u201d, and also directed and acted in many children\u2019s micro-films by herself. \n(YuYao Gao) Today, Yuyao Gao has been influenced by the hip-hop, and learning rap with the China hip-hop leader group \u2013 XinJieKou Band.It\u2019s amazing that under the guidance of her teacher she finished the whole song independently as the generation after 00\u2019s. \n(Xinjiekou) Her performance means that the first post-00 rapper enters the Chinese music industry and is now the youngest female rapper to officially release her single rap song. More and more children are fond of hip-hop with the support of their parents. In the past the choices were folk music and main stream music. (Group) \nThe new era is quite unexpected. \nWe are expecting hip-hop will be flourishing in China and perhaps make a bigger surprise for the world. \nMedia Contact Company Name: FINANCE NEWS CO., LTD.

The ADX is typically plotted along with two other directional movement indicator lines, the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI). Some analysts believe that the ADX is one of the best trend strength indicators available. \nInterested investors may be watching the   Williams %R.

The Relative   is an often employed momentum oscillator that is used to measure the speed and change of stock price movements. When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. This measurement is based on closing prices over a specific period of time. As a momentum oscillator, the RSI operates in a set range. This range falls on a scale between 0 and 100. If the RSI is closer to 100, this may indicate a period of stronger momentum. On the flip side, an RSI near 0 may signal weaker momentum. The RSI was originally created by J. Welles Wilder which was introduced in his 1978 book \u201cNew Concepts in Technical Trading Systems\u201d. \nFor further review, we can take a look at another popular technical indicator. In terms of moving averages, the 200-day is currently at 2847.05, the 50-day is 2737.40, and the 7-day is resting at 2734.29. Moving averages are a popular trading tool among investors. Moving averages can be used to help filter out the day to day noise created by other factors. MA\u2019s may be used to identify uptrends or downtrends, and they can be a prominent indicator for detecting a shift in momentum for a particular stock.

Yet they have the audacity to come and advise us to forget and move on.\u201d \nThe opposition leader spoke outside a morgue in the capital, Nairobi, while accompanying families collecting bodies of alleged victims. \nThe U.S. Embassy statement on Wednesday called Odinga\u2019s planned inauguration \u201cextra-constitutional.\u201d It came as the top U.S. official for African affairs, Donald Yamamoto, visited the East African economic hub and met with government officials and opposition leaders. \nOdinga\u2019s National Super Alliance has said it will proceed with the event. \nOdinga successfully challenged Kenyatta\u2019s August re-election but then boycotted the new vote in October, demanding electoral reforms. Kenyatta won with over 98 percent of the votes and was inaugurated last week.

Ask yourself these three questions.   I've written several articles highlighting the benefits of influencer marketing . They can improve brand sentiment and deliver high ROI. You can even work with influencers to drive more sales for your business. Even if you realize the impact of influencers from these articles, you might still be unsure whether your business is in need of influencer marketing. As a general rule, I recommend influencer marketing for businesses across all the consumer goods sections. It has also successfully fueled the growth of hospitality businesses -- from international hotel chains to local restaurants. Fair warning: It may be less ideal for promoting business-to-government organizations and some kinds of business-to-business organizations , such as those selling industrial equipment, for example. Know your audience. I'm going to put things into context and help you better understand whether or not you need to partner with influencers . I've put together a few questions that you can ask yourself. And if you say \"yes\" to any of them, there's a good chance you need influencers. 1. Are you struggling to attract and engage a new audience? First of all, you might have a hard time reaching and attracting a new and relevant audience. As a result, you may be unable to expand your reach and grow your business. One of my clients answered \"yes\" to this question. They had tried everything -- from paid search and social media advertising to SEO. But they were still unable to attract a new audience. I recommended an influencer marketing campaign to turn things around. Within just three months, they were driving three times more traffic with the help of influencer content. Influencers usually have thousands of followers; some may even have millions. These followers specifically chose to gain access to the influencers unlike with advertising. Additionally, influencers tend to specialize in specific niches, making their audience highly targeted. So you have an opportunity to reach thousands of people who would be interested in your product or service through influencers. This is particularly important since more and more people are blocking ads. PageFair reports that adblock is being used on 380 million mobile devices and 236 million desktops. With the help of influencers, you can ensure that your promotion efforts can reach the desired audience. 2. Are you failing to win the trust of your target audience? Trust is an important factor that marketers need to consider when attempting to drive conversions. But like many brands that I've come across, you may have a hard time winning the trust of your target audience. A Havas Media study found that people in North American trust only 22 percent of brands. That's why I find it crucial for brands to work with influencers so they can earn people's trust. This works because Nielsen reports that people trust peer recommendation over advertising. And according to a Twitter and Annalect study , the trust people have in influencers is almost as much as their trust in friends. Interestingly, gen.video found that there has been a dramatic shift in the level of trust people have in social media influencers. Their 2017 study found that consumers now have the most trust in social media influencers, even more than they trust their friends and family. So if you want people to trust you, your best option is to get trustworthy influencers to vouch for you. A client of mine who answered \"yes\" to this question saw a drastic shift in brand sentiment after working with influencers. Influencers helped create review content that established trust among the target audience. 3. Are you struggling with low conversion rates? Finally, influencers may be the perfect solution for you if you're dealing with less than ideal conversion rates. Your advertising efforts may have attracted a few people but there's no assurance that those people are going to end up converting. But when influencers promote your products or services, they can effectively create a desire in the audience to try the product or service. They can create context that helps the audience understand how they too can benefit from the product. The previously-cited Twitter and Annalect study even found that exposure to brand and influencer tweets can increase purchase intent by more than five times. And almost 40 percent of respondents have reportedly purchased a product after seeing it in an influencer's tweet. For a client who answered \"yes\" to this question, influencers turned things around for them. After just a month of influencers promoting their products with a discount code, they were seeing five times more conversions. Final thoughts Asking yourself these three crucial questions will help you understand whether or not your brand needs to work with influencers. Influencers can help you attract, engage, and convert your audience, in addition to winning their trust.

Xinjiang Tianye Water Saving Irrigation System Company Ltd (0840.HK)\u2019s   14 day Williams %R currently sits at -100.00. In general, if the indicator goes above -20, the stock may be considered overbought.

The Relative   is an often employed momentum oscillator that is used to measure the speed and change of stock price movements. When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. This measurement is based on closing prices over a specific period of time. As a momentum oscillator, the RSI operates in a set range. This range falls on a scale between 0 and 100. If the RSI is closer to 100, this may indicate a period of stronger momentum. On the flip side, an RSI near 0 may signal weaker momentum. The RSI was originally created by J. Welles Wilder which was introduced in his 1978 book \u201cNew Concepts in Technical Trading Systems\u201d. \nFor further review, we can take a look at another popular technical indicator. In terms of moving averages, the 200-day is currently at 0.73, the 50-day is 0.72, and the 7-day is resting at 0.70. Moving averages are a popular trading tool among investors. Moving averages can be used to help filter out the day to day noise created by other factors. MA\u2019s may be used to identify uptrends or downtrends, and they can be a prominent indicator for detecting a shift in momentum for a particular stock. Many traders will use moving averages for different periods of time in conjunction with other indicators to help gauge future stock price action. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "larry williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "technicals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glance for xinjiang tianye water saving irrigation system company ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xinjiang tianye water saving irrigation system company ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atr for shares of xinjiang tianye water saving irrigation system company ltd", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:42.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "45bfa2c410c5f28f22c622de07d165eea787805a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9UNs_b7vYkcd3KwHZ_cMJgyqR2V6qaf744E4VdvpVmjsz_Az1wDlZ.9RUrkOB0VjfI0m.Sq7nvlSH76VPRGnqT1BMvjLhKnbgK70egkL5vhuX_6hKzSyOUEOrUuaY2oyrJen_dcLXiq2KbceKxRCZsNc9Xs1JIes0-", "site_full": "www.essentialbaby.com.au", "site": "essentialbaby.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.essentialbaby.com.au/forums/index.php?/forum/111-what-do-you-think/", "site_categories": ["pregnancy", "family_and_parenting"], "section_title": "What Do You Think? - Essential Baby", "title": "Do you spend evenly for Christmas?", "title_full": "Do you spend evenly for Christmas? - What Do You Think? - Essential Baby", "published": "2017-12-06T22:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 24, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.essentialbaby.com.au/forums/public/style_images/master/meta_image.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40097, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "55a5428ecfeea46884f41f482afdb653d4f1246e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9UNs_b7vYkcd3KwHZ_cMJgyqR2V6qaf744E4VdvpVmjsz_Az1wDlZ.9RUrkOB0VjfI0m.Sq7nvlSH76VPRGnqT1BMvjLhKnbgK70egkL5vhuX_6hKzSyOUEOrUuaY2oyrJen_dcLXiq2KbceKxRCZshBewZJ4QwzJxF50WD371qQ--", "ord_in_thread": 19, "author": "cvbn", "published": "2017-12-07T00:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Not really, swings and roundabouts and no one seems to mind.\nThe baby often just gets a board book and sand pit toys.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:23:42.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bd6e603e2c06000f06b0a3439341b123f59e7d97", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.WANsvHAXrhorqSji0foxJJcx00OxvT4NFo7rpp.v9KK_gbgyCDj8.DToronYluz4W3KF37ssQrCayCHJXv_eU3", "site_full": "krwg.org", "site": "krwg.org", "site_section": "http://krwg.org/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Australian Parliament Approves Same-Sex Marriage", "title_full": "Australian Parliament Approves Same-Sex Marriage", "published": "2017-12-07T10:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201712/569035628.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bd6e603e2c06000f06b0a3439341b123f59e7d97", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.WANsvHAXrhorqSji0foxJJcx00OxvT4NFo7rpp.v9KK_gbgyCDj8.DToronYluz4W3KF37ssQrCayCHJXv_eU3", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Neuman", "published": "2017-12-07T10:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "Australian Parliament Approves Same-Sex Marriage", "text": "A group of women in Federation Square in Melbourne react on Thursday as it is announced that same-sex marriage will be legal in Australia. Scott Barbour / Getty Images Members of Parliament celebrate at Parliament House on Thursday in Canberra, Australia, after the approval of same-sex marriage. Michael Masters / Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 5:50 am \nUpdated at 5:50 a.m. ET \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nMarriage in Australia is now defined as \"the union of two people\" instead of \"union of a man and a woman.\" \nLawmakers had tried and failed some two dozen times in the past to make the change. \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of the 80 percent of registered voters who cast ballots, ensuring that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\" Copyright 2017 NPR.

Alex Wong / Getty Images \nFour months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in \"tatters\" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics. \nIt's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray. \nOn Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch. 1. Russia, Russia, Russia \nWray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, \"a witch hunt.\" \nWray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied to the Trump campaign, including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nDoes that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Stzrok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation , suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case? \nShould there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him? \nLook for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this. \n\"The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,\" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing. \n\"We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,\" Goodlatte added. 2. Independence \nThe job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was \"the Russia thing.\" \nFor his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees , who have faced criticism from the president this year. \nThis week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to \"keep calm and tackle hard\" amid the current adverse climate. And, at his confirmation hearing, Wray pledged his loyalty was to the Constitution, not a political regime. \"I will never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice, period, full stop,\" he said at the time. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee will no doubt want to ask Wray about his contacts with President Trump and others in the White House this year. 3. Oh, yeah \u2014 FBI business \nIn a matter of weeks, an important electronic surveillance tool will expire if Congress does not reauthorize it. The murder rate has spiked in several major American cities. \nCourts have thrown out corruption charges or reduced sentences of public officials accused of bribery and other offenses, following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the tools the Justice Department's public integrity unit can use to attack graft in state houses across the country. \nThe bureau also has open investigations into activity by sympathizers of the Islamic State in every one of its field offices. \nThe FBI, in short, has its hands in many baskets. And after the questions about Russia and Trump, members of the committee may want to discuss some business in regular order. Copyright 2017 NPR.

Tauseef Mustafa / AFP/Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 5:49 am \nMonths after a tense standoff between China and India along their Himalayan border, Beijing on Thursday expressed anger at an Indian drone that crashed inside its territory. \n\"This action by India violated China's territorial sovereignty. We express strong dissatisfaction and opposition,\" Xinhua cited Zhang Shuili, a senior military official in China's western battle zone command, as saying. \nChina said the drone crashed in \"recent days\" but didn't say where. Zhang said his country would defend its national sovereignty against such intrusions. \nHe said China's border defense forces conducted \"an inspection of the device,\" but didn't elaborate. \nIndia has not responded to the charge. \nAlthough the two countries have made moves toward warmer relations in recent years, they also have a long history of border tensions. In 1962, they fought a brief, but inconclusive border conflict. They have also had ongoing disputes over sovereignty in other border areas, notably Aksai Chin, a Himalayan region that straddles their territorial demarcation in the west. \nThe two countries have also long been at odds over India's hosting of Tibet's government-in-exile and their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, considered by China to be subversive because of his calls for Tibetan independence. \nStarting in June this year, tensions flared again over a disputed region called the Doklam Plateau that borders China, Bhutan and the Indian state of Sikkim. \nAs NPR's Julie McCarthy reported from New Delhi in July , the problems stemmed from China's construction of a road in Doklam Plateau. \"Not far from the plateau lies the narrow passage that connects India's northeast states with the rest of the country \u2014 a strategic link called the Siliguri Corridor but more commonly known as the \"Chicken's Neck. \" Any possibility of China being able to sever that \"neck\" unnerves India. \nAs late as August, India had rushed troops to Doklam Plateau and although an immediate conflict was avoided, heated rhetoric on both sides has soured relations. \nIn September, India's army chief said that his country \"could not afford to be complacent and must be prepared for war,\" according to The Hindustan Times. \nAnd in November, China took umbrage at Indian President Ram Nath Kovind's visit to the remote state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China also claims, Reuters reports.
