I expressed my willingness to consider that because I want us to move to phase two if that is possible next week.\u201d \nVaradkar said he had a \u201cvery good call\u201d with May but that he reiterated the firm Irish position on issue of the border and that any new language proposed by London must be consistent with the text May had originally agreed to on Monday. \nThe leader of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party Arlene Foster also spoke to May earlier on Wednesday and a spokesman for the party said \u201cthere was still work to be done\u201d on any border deal. \nBrussels says Britain must present its offer this week or it will be too late for a decision. \nVaradkar was speaking at a news conference with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte who assured Dublin that a satisfactory deal on the Irish border was essential if EU leaders are to declare that sufficient progress has been made in phase one of the talks when they meet on Dec. 15. \nRutte also agreed with Varadkar that if an agreement cannot be reached next week, then they will have to move into January \n\u201cIt is the desire and ambition and wish of this government that we should move onto the phase two talks but if it isn\u2019t possible to move to phase two next week because of the problems that have arisen, well then we can pick it up in the new year,\u201d Varadkar earlier told parliament.

( AAPL ) fails to make a fundamental change to its business, it could see iPhone sales decline by 17%, according to one team of analysts on the Street who want to see the tech giant employ a monthly subscription model much like Netflix Inc. ( NFLX ). \nIn a recent research note , Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote that Apple faces the same problem with its smartphones as it did with its iPad. As more customers hang onto their old models for a longer period of time, Apple risks iPhone sales following the same trend as its struggling iPad business. Freezing Replacement Cycles \nIn the third quarter, even when Apple finally managed to grow its iPad sales numbers, revenue from tablets only gained 2% as consumers bought cheaper versions. If consumers treat the iPhone the same way, as Sacconaghi thinks they will, annual iPhone sales could tank 17%, a major issue as the smartphones accounted for a whopping 62% of the company\u2019s revenue and profits this year. As the smartphone market becomes more saturated and successive generations of iPhones likely become less differentiated, the Bernstein analyst expects the replacement cycle to grow even longer. \nTo hedge against this trend, Bernstein wants Apple to build off of its iPhone Upgrade Program and turn into more of a subscription business. This should be easy for Apple as consumers become increasingly accustomed to paying monthly subscriptions, \u201cespecially for key \u2018tech utilities\u2019 (e.g. Netflix, Spotify, Microsoft Office 365),\u201d wrote Sacconaghi. \n\u201cCustomers could lease iPhones, iPads, Macs, and services such as iCloud and Apple Music for one 'low' monthly fee. By moving to a subscription model, Apple would be able to lock in recurring revenue streams and freeze the length of replacement cycles, likely leading to a material re-rating of its stock's multiple.\u201d (See also: Apple, Ireland in Deal Over $15B in Unpaid Taxes. )", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bernstein", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shoshanna delventhal", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sacconaghi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toni sacconaghi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spotify", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "netflix inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nflx", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netflix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aapl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:48.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "40f0e0b7d3d169a9b36b4edc0b5d7c8ac1a5d743", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhPXDfj39aaY5FOSOWSTivW6QEJXcyEwa7drkftJkPsgHyDpZK9sBa1mev6AtYwWH7G.fl6ewmkxFDKql.c3OouRxhkNF8THYK.FMiNnm_cqgWm9cwLFo12eZuw_G8kPOQEu7qymJOeoBAk_aF.6pljovWWvcZarRMayk8Fpv4UK0A9EXXmDTAxV6seGNQZ.zI5", "site_full": "www.military-technologies.net", "site": "military-technologies.net", "site_section": "http://www.military-technologies.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["table_tennis_ping_pong", "financial_news", "finance", "sports"], "section_title": "MilTech", "title": "Blood Flow Measurement Devices Market Report: Top Companies, In-Depth Market Analysis and With Inputs from Industry Experts Forecast 2021", "title_full": "Blood Flow Measurement Devices Market Report: Top Companies, In-Depth Market Analysis and With Inputs from Industry Experts Forecast 2021", "published": "2017-12-07T10:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "PL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "40f0e0b7d3d169a9b36b4edc0b5d7c8ac1a5d743", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhPXDfj39aaY5FOSOWSTivW6QEJXcyEwa7drkftJkPsgHyDpZK9sBa1mev6AtYwWH7G.fl6ewmkxFDKql.c3OouRxhkNF8THYK.FMiNnm_cqgWm9cwLFo12eZuw_G8kPOQEu7qymJOeoBAk_aF.6pljovWWvcZarRMayk8Fpv4UK0A9EXXmDTAxV6seGNQZ.zI5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sagar G", "published": "2017-12-07T10:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "Blood Flow Measurement Devices Market Report: Top Companies, In-Depth Market Analysis and With Inputs from Industry Experts Forecast 2021", "text": "Source: imported from this press release . \nBlood Flow Measurement Devices Market new global report offers key vendor landscape, CAGR with market dynamics and forecast.

He feels it\u2019s a character that would make people want to be \u201cbetter\u201d in today\u2019s time. The actor stressed on the need for inspiring characters while discussing his role as Rani Padmavati\u2019s husband and a warrior king Rawal Ratan Singh in Padmavati with GQ India for December 2017 issue, a statement said. \n\u201cI remember when Gladiator came out and Russell Crowe played Maximus, the character felt too good to be true. But it inspired me so much. That was a strong reference for me because I wondered how you play a character who is so noble and good, and make him connect with people today,\u201d Shahid said. \n\u201cSometimes cinema has the power to make us aspire to be something better. Of course, there\u2019s a lot of value in playing something that\u2019s real; I\u2019m coming from \u2018Udta Punjab\u2019, where I played a coked-out, crazy pop star \u2013 not at all the kind of guy you would want to be, not even the kind of guy you would want to be in a room with. \n\u201cWith him, I wondered how to get people to understand someone so off-the-hook, this free radical jumping all over the place. But people got him. I hope they get Rawal Ratan Singh as well. He\u2019s extremely powerful, but always steady in all kinds of high-pressure situations. \n\u201cI\u2019ve always admired people who can do that. We\u2019re living in a time where we need to be inspired by characters who make us want to be better, because there\u2019s a lot happening in the world.\u201d \nSanjay Leela Bhansali\u2019s attempt to bring alive the story of Rani Padmavati on the silver screen with his movie Padmavati hasn\u2019t gone down well with Hindu groups backed by the BJP. It also features Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh in pivotal roles. Padmavati is being slammed for alleged distortion of historical facts about the Rajput queen. The film was scheduled to release on December 1, but it was deferred. \nShahid also spoke about how Ratan Singh protects his wife from invader Alauddin Khilji, essayed by Ranveer. \nHe said, \u201cThe most difficult part was that he is the least known among the three characters. There are several gaps in our knowledge, and it was up to me to fill them appropriately.

China\u2019s credit-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio is now very high by global standards and consistent with a high probability of financial distress, the IMF said, citing an estimate from the Bank for International Settlements. \nWhile China has been taking steps to address its debt risks, reining in excessive credit growth will require a de-emphasis on high GDP projections in national plans that have spurred local governments to set high growth targets, the fund said. But the near-term prioritisation of social stability seems to depend on credit growth to sustain financing to firms even when they are non-viable, it said. Sources have told Reuters that China is likely to keep this year\u2019s GDP growth target of \u201caround 6.5 percent\u201d in 2018 even as Beijing steps up a campaign, now in its second year, to control systemic financial risks. \nThe IMF said the sub-committee it has recommended should report to Beijing\u2019s new Financial Stability and Development Committee. Chinese banks, while meeting Basel requirements, should gradually increase their capital to create buffers to absorb potential losses that can be expected during China\u2019s economic transition as credit is tightened and implicit guarantees are removed, the IMF said. \nThere are widespread perceptions of implicit guarantees, the fund said, with banks often compensating retail investors for losses and lenders assuming that loss-making state-owned enterprises or financial intermediaries will be bailed out. Banks also need to hold more liquid assets, the fund said. \nThe IMF\u2019s assessment was based on findings by a mission that visited China several times this year, as well as earlier visits in 2015 and 2016. The mission met with senior Chinese leaders and officials from regulatory and government bodies including the central bank. \nThe IMF report is part of the fund\u2019s Financial Sector Assessment Program, established in 1999, that assesses the resilience of a country\u2019s financial sector to shocks and contagion. The first such assessment for China was published in 2011.

Securities Markets Improvement Act - NSMIA' \nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act is a law passed in 1996 to simplify securities regulation in the U.S. by apportioning more regulatory power to the federal government. BREAKING DOWN 'National Securities Markets Improvement Act - NSMIA' \nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act (NSMIA) amended the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and went into effect on Jan. 1, 1997. Its main consequence was to increase the authority of federal regulators at the expense of their state-level counterparts, a change that was expected to increase the efficiency of the financial services industry. \nPrior to the NSMIA, state-level Blue Sky laws , which were passed in order to protect retail investors from scams, were considerably more powerful. The NSMIA transferred most of this regulatory power to the federal government, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) . \nSpecific provisions of the law defined which \"covered\" securities are exempt from state regulations. These include any securities traded on national exchanges such as the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange , as well as mutual fund shares.

The lawmakers voted 364 to 58 in rejection of Texas Democratic lawmaker Al Green\u2019s resolution to start impeachment against Trump. \nThe Republican party, which enjoys a majority in the lower chamber of the Congress, was joined by a large number of lawmakers from the Opposition Democratic party to defeat a move to impeach Trump yesterday. Prominent among those included Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Minority Whip Steny H Hoyer, who also issued a joint statement against Green\u2019s push to impeach Trump. \n\u201cNow is not the time to consider articles of impeachment,\u201d the two Democratic leaders said, even as they reiterated their opposition to the many policies of the president. \n\u201cThis President has made statements and taken actions that are beyond the pale for most Americans, embracing those who espouse hatred and division while promoting policies that would harm our economy and undermine our national security. Legitimate questions have been raised about his fitness to lead this nation,\u201d Pelosi and Hoyer said. \n\u201cRight now, Congressional committees continue to be deeply engaged in investigations into the President\u2019s actions both before and after his inauguration. The special counsel\u2019s investigation is moving forward as well, and those inquiries should be allowed to continue,\u201d they said. \nIn his failed pitch, Green alleged that Trump had been inciting violence, hatred and bigotry and is dividing Americans on the basis of race and other traits. \nDemocratic Congresswoman Linda Sanchez said in the last 320 days, Trump\u2019s actions have angered millions of Americans and raised very serious questions about his fitness to serve in office. \n\u201cThere is an ongoing federal investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Muller and it should be allowed to continue. Until we have the final results of a thorough, non-partisan investigation, I believe it is premature to vote for impeachment,\u201d she said. \nHouse Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley also voted against the impeachment. \n\u201cI am one of many Americans that\u2019s disappointed in the direction President Trump has taken our country, and I have grave concerns about his leadership, his policies, and his judgement,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThat is why I was one of the first members of Congress to call for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate. I strongly believe that what the American people want is the facts and, therefore, we should let Special Counsel Mueller and his team complete their task. For these reasons, I do not think today is the right time for a vote of impeachment,\u201dCrowley said. \nCongressman Lou Correa said although he was not a supporter of many of Trump\u2019s policies, he does not support impeaching him at this time. \n\u201cAny discussion of impeachment before the completion of Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation is premature and not in the best interest of our nation,\u201d Correa said. \nDemocratic Congressman Mike Capuano said taking steps to impeach a President were a gravely serious matter. \n\u201cPractically and politically, I think most of us can agree that passing articles of impeachment in this House isn\u2019t realistic at this moment in our history. But sometimes, it\u2019s more important to follow your heart than do the practical or political calculation,\u201d he said. \n\u201cToday, I followed my heart and cast a vote to begin a debate on whether this President has committed impeachable acts. It\u2019s time to have an open, honest debate on President Trump and his fitness for office,\u201d Capuano said.

Jeffrey Feltman, the UN undersecretary-general for political affairs, met with Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho on the second full day of the highest-level UN visit to the North since 2010. He arrived in Pyongyang on Tuesday for a stay expected to last four or five days. \nIt\u2019s not immediately known what the two discussed. According to North Korea\u2019s state-run media, Feltman discussed UN assistance and operations in North Korea along with \u201cother matters of mutual concern\u201d during a meeting with the vice foreign minister yesterday. \nSix UN agencies, with about 50 international staff, are represented in the North. The visit by Feltman, an American citizen and former State Department official, comes amid high tensions on the peninsula fanned by tough talk and posturing by Pyongyang and Washington. \nThe North recently launched its most advanced missile to date and the US and South Korea are now holding joint exercises with some of the world\u2019s most powerful fighter aircraft. \nNorth Korea\u2019s official news agency on Wednesday quoted an unnamed Foreign Ministry spokesman strongly criticising senior US administration officials\u2019\u201cbellicose remarks\u201d and the ongoing military exercises. \n\u201cThe remaining question now is: when will the war break out,\u201d it said. \nThough the North\u2019s state media are prone to publishing alarmist rhetoric, North Korean authorities have regularly criticized the U.N. for its sanctions resolutions, insisting Pyongyang has the sovereign right to test missiles, nuclear devices and launch satellites. \nIn a speech to the UN General Assembly in September, Foreign Minister Ri defended his country\u2019s missile and nuclear programs as a \u201crighteous self-defensive measure\u201d in the face of US hostility and nuclear threats.

And coach Gregg Popovich pointed out, it also was just one game. LaMarcus Aldridge scored 18 points and San Antonio recorded 30 assists in a 117-105 victory over the Miami Heat on Wednesday night. \n\u201cThat\u2019s always wonderful,\u201d Popovich said of the balanced attack for the Spurs. \u201cAnd then when you sit down and when you start feeling good about it, you realize that Golden State does that every night. Ok, we\u2019ve got a ways to go, don\u2019t get too excited, but it is great to see.\u201d \nThe Warriors are tied with the Houston Rockets for the Western Conference\u2019s best record, but the Spurs are only 2 1/2 games back despite the season-long absence of All-Star forward Kawhi Leonard. \nWith Leonard\u2019s return looming from a right quadriceps injury, Aldridge led the Spurs in scoring for the 20th time in 25 games. While Aldridge has been the team\u2019s primary offensive threat in place of Leonard, San Antonio has carved out a 17-8 record by taking advantage of its depth. \n\u201cIt comes from everybody being willing to make a pass for us to be successful,\u201d said veteran Rudy Gay, who signed with the Spurs in the offseason. \u201cWe have to find the open man and pass up a good shot for a great shot. We\u2019ve been doing that well these past few games. I think that\u2019s one of the great things about this system, everybody is playing for each other and it ends up in the win column. That\u2019s part of the reason I came here.\u201d \nThe Spurs shot 52.9 percent from the field and had seven players score in double figures. Bryn Forbes had 17 points, and Gay finished with 16 in San Antonio\u2019s sixth win in seven games. Tyler Johnson led Miami with 25 points, and Dion Waiters had 22. San Antonio got off to a slow start defensively, just like it did in its comeback victory against Detroit on Monday night. Miami shot 58 percent in the first half, including going 9 for 18 on 3-pointers. \n\u201cIt was a little bit surprising that we were able to score 35 in the first quarter,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cWe moved the ball, knocked down some open 3s, that always helps, and then they started to get the game a little bit more to their liking.\u201d San Antonio forced 11 turnovers and outscored Miami 60-47 in the second half. \nThe Spurs\u2019 reserves stepped up again, just as they have done all season. Forbes made three 3s in the third quarter, helping San Antonio to an 86-82 lead heading into the final period after they trailed by four at halftime. \nTIP-INS Heat: Starting center Hassan Whiteside missed his fourth straight game with a bruised left knee bone. \u2026 Spoelstra has 451 career victories, three shy of tying Pat Riley for the most in franchise history. \u2026 The Heat have not beaten the Spurs since Jan. 26, 2014, in Miami. Miami is 18-42 all-time against San Antonio in the regular season. \nSpurs: Forbes made a career-high five 3-pointers. He became the fourth undrafted player to make at least five 3-pointers in a game for the Spurs, joining Bruce Bowen, Gary Neal and Jaren Jackson. \u2026 The Spurs have made a 3-pointer in 1,000 straight games dating to April 9, 2005, the fourth-longest streak in league history. Dallas holds the record with 1,108 straight games with a 3 from 1999-2012. \u2026 Aldridge has 197 blocks, passing Tiago Splitter for 23rd in franchise history. \nUP NEXT Heat: Play Brooklyn on Saturday night in Mexico City in their first game played outside the United States or Canada in franchise history. Spurs: Host Boston on Friday night in the finale of a three-game homestand. \nON-THE-JOB TRAINING Gay is still getting acclimated to the Spurs\u2019 offense, which has led Popovich to simplify his play-calling when the 12-year veteran is on the court. \u201cHe\u2019s just playing basketball,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cEvery once in a while he knows the play, but we stayed in just basically a little bit of motion for a lot of the game when he was out there so he can just play basketball. Because he\u2019s a good player, he doesn\u2019t need me to coach him on how to score, he does that well.\u201d \nGay is leaning on his teammates to make sure he is in the right place on the court as he grows accustomed to San Antonio after leaving Sacramento as a free agent. \n\u201cIt\u2019s great.

( TSLA ) shares jumped Wednesday, closing up over 3% at $312.20 and reflecting a whopping 46.5% gain year-to-date (YTD) compared to the S&P 500 \u2019s 17.5% increase over the same period. As the electric car pioneer faces production setbacks with its first mass-market vehicle, the Model 3 sedan, one team of analysts on the Street expects demand to soften as consumers look elsewhere to the growing number of Tesla competitors coming out with their own electric models. (See also: GM Could Beat Tesla in Autonomous Driving: Barclays. ) \nOn Tuesday, analysts at Cascend Securities downgraded shares of the Palo Alto, Calif.-based automaker from hold to sell along with a $250 price target , indicating a 20% downside over the upcoming 12-month period. Electric Alternatives \nAs consumers who have not already preordered the Model 3 realize that they can\u2019t get new vehicles until 2019, they are likely to seek out alternatives. Cascend Chief Investment Strategist Eric Ross noted that Ford Motor Co. ( F ) alone has 13 electric vehicles set to debut over the next five years. At the same time, \u201cthe company is burning through cash and will likely need to raise capital in the first half of 2018 (and perhaps even the first quarter 2018) \u2026 And there won\u2019t be enough Model 3 production to suggest break-even is around the corner,\u201d wrote Ross. \nOn the bright side, the Cascend analyst highlighted Tesla as a \u201cgreat, exciting brand to which consumers are drawn.\u201d At the helm of the electric car market, Tesla is also positioned to gain from new government regulation. In China, the U.K. France and Norway, the government has already put a sunset date on the sale of vehicles powered by fossil fuels. \n\u201cIf you want risk, we surmise bitcoin will reach $20,000 long before TSLA reaches $700. And you\u2019ll be able to hedge your investment on the CME as of Sunday,\u201d wrote Ross, speaking to the exchange\u2019s plans to begin offering bitcoin futures.

While he made his Tamil debut in the bilingual Neram, the love the good-looking actor has garnered was predominantly due to the blockbuster Premam. As the charming George, Nivin became a household name. The movie captured the imagination of Tamil audience at a level that surprised the actor himself, as he has mentioned earlier. The affable, charming Nivin Pauly is back with a straight Tamil film as the menacing, paan-chewing Richie. Nivin has dubbed himself for the movie and took more than 50 days to voice his parts, in an attempt to sound perfect. \u201cI wanted to do it the right way. It wouldn\u2019t have felt good if they had used a different voice for me,\u201d says the Njandukalude Nattil Oridavela actor. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise it would take this long. It went through several rounds of corrections. I didn\u2019t realise where I was going wrong while a person who knew the language could easily tell me where my diction or pronunciation in wrong,\u201d Nivin admits honestly. \nWhen Nivin sported a beard, donned the black shirt and veshti and strode on-screen to the strains of \u2018Kalippu\u2019, he wouldn\u2019t have realised that he is setting a trend for youth in a different state. Interestingly, the actor sports a similar look in Richie as well. \u201cIt is a coincidence,\u201d says Nivin. The idea was to retain the look from the original Kannada film, Ulidavaru Kandante. \u201cGautham (Ramachandran) told me that I won\u2019t look good without a beard. He told me \u2018Andha area va cover pannunga\u2019 (cover that area on your face),\u201d laughs Nivin. However, they realised comparisons would be there. \u201cThen the belt and the black shirt followed and to differentiate Richie from George, we had him chew paan,\u201d explains Nivin. \nWhile Nivin doesn\u2019t have a filmy background, one of the biggest desires for him as an actor in the early days was to see his cut-out at theaters. \u201cI think it is every actor\u2019s wish that it happens,\u201d says Nivin. \u201cWhile it hasn\u2019t happened in Tamil yet, in Malayalam, Neram got that for me. It was an incredibly special moment,\u201d reminisces the Premam actor. Has he ever been surprised by the adulation he receives? \u201cOnce I was at a multiplex watching a movie, a girl ran up to me and told me she loved me. I said I loved her too! It is the characters they love,\u201d says an unassuming Nivin, flashing his trademark smile. \nWatch Nivin Pauly starrer Richie trailer here: \nOver the years, Nivin has acquired a next-door-boy image on screen thanks to the various feel-good movies he has been part of. However, Nivin says it is necessary to break that image once in a while to do different roles. \u201cWhen one film becomes a hit, you start getting similar scripts. The idea is that we know it works, so if we do the same it will click again. Once in a while it is necessary to do a film like Richie. We have to keep doing new things otherwise people also will be bored,\u201d he reasons.

By: Reuters | Amman | Updated: December 7, 2017 10:45 am Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital despite intense Arab, Muslim and European opposition to a move that would upend decades of US policy and risk potentially violent protests. (AP Photo) Top News Rajasthan labourer hacked: Accused claimed murder in name of rescuing woman, she denies link \nJordan on Wednesday rejected the US decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, calling it legally \u201cnull\u201d because it consolidated Israel\u2019s occupation of the eastern sector of the contested city. Government spokesperson Mohammad al-Momani told state news agency Petra that the announcement by US President Donald Trump violated long-standing UN Security Council resolutions that \u201cstipulated the non-recognition of the Israeli occupation\u201d of the city\u2019s eastern sector and the adjacent West Bank. \nThe staunch US ally considered \u201call unilateral moves that seek to create new facts on the ground as null and void\u201d, the spokesperson added. \nForeign Minister Ayman Safadi said later in a tweet that the move \u201cfrustrated\u201d peace efforts, adding that the status of Jerusalem must be \u201cdetermined in direct negotiations\u201d between the Palestinians and Israelis. \u201cJordan rejects the decision and all its implications and will continue to work for an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital,\u201d Safadi added. \nJordan lost East Jerusalem and the West Bank to Israel during the 1967 war and says the city\u2019s fate should only be decided at the end of a final settlement. \nPalestinians claim East Jerusalem for the capital of a future state. Israel regards Jerusalem as its eternal and indivisible capital. \nJordan\u2019s King Abdullah warned of the repercussions of Trump\u2019s expected move in talks last week in Washington with top administration officials and warned of a backlash across the Middle East. The king\u2019s Hashemite dynasty is the custodian of the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, making Jordan sensitive to any changes in the status of the city. A government source said Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was due to hold talks with the monarch on Thursday in a stepped-up diplomatic offensive to counter Trump\u2019s plan. \nSeveral protests broke out in areas of Jordan\u2019s capital, Amman, inhabited by Palestinian refugees in response to Trump\u2019s announcement. \nYouths chanted anti-American slogans in Amman, while in the Baqaa refugee camp on the city\u2019s outskirts, hundreds of youths roamed the streets denouncing Trump and calling on Jordan\u2019s government to scrap its 1994 peace treaty with Israel. \u201cDown with America. America is the mother of terror,\u201d they chanted. \nJordanian deputies in a special parliamentary session on Wednesday condemned the move and urged the government to expel the US ambassador and boycott US goods. A dozen activists staged a sit-in near the gates of the US embassy. Many people in Jordan are descendants of Palestinian refugees whose families left after the creation of Israel in 1948. Jordan\u2019s powerful mainstream Islamist movement, the country\u2019s largest political party and opposition group, said it would stage several major rallies across the country in the next few days and after Friday prayers.

(AP Photo) Top News Rajasthan labourer hacked: Accused claimed murder in name of rescuing woman, she denies link \nLos Angeles is in line to become United States\u2019 largest city with legal recreational marijuana after the City Council voted Wednesday to license sales and cultivation next year. The landmark vote came after a hearing in which council members characterised the rules as a work in progress, almost certain to see revisions next year after California launches its recreational pot industry in January. \nUnder the Los Angeles regulations, residential neighborhoods would be largely off-limits to pot businesses, and buffer zones would be set up around schools, libraries and parks. \nCity Council President Herb Wesson\u2019s office said the rules would take effect immediately after the signature of Mayor Eric Garcetti, which is expected. \u201cThe other cities in this nation, they are looking to LA,\u201d said Wesson, predicting the city model would become a template for legalization elsewhere. However, with the new year just weeks away-and the holidays coming-industry experts say it\u2019s not clear how many businesses, if any, will be ready to open their doors on January 1. \nIf demand is not satisfied by legal sales then \u201cyou are just giving oxygen to the black market we all want to eradicate,\u201d said Adam Spiker, executive director of the Southern California Coalition, a cannabis industry group. \nThe route to legalisation began last year when voters approved Proposition 64, which opened the way for recreational pot sales to adults in the nation\u2019s most populous state, home to one in eight Americans. The state and hundreds of cities have been saddled with the challenging task of trying to govern a vast, emerging industry with a projected value of $7 billion. The result has been a patchwork. \nSome cities have banned all commercial pot activity, while L.A. is among those that have embraced it, in part for the promise of a cascade of new tax dollars. In San Francisco, Mayor Ed Lee signed legislation Wednesday authorizing recreational cannabis sales that could begin in the first week of January, providing local businesses acquire required licenses. \nSan Jose will allow its 16 medical marijuana dispensaries to sell recreational marijuana starting January 1, providing they acquire required licenses. In LA, the dense set of regulations passed Wednesday dictate where pot can be grown and sold in the new marketplace, along with how businesses will be licensed. \nBusinesses that want to participate in the marketplace need local permits before they can apply for state licenses required to operate in 2018. \nThe rules include provisions intended to benefit those convicted of a marijuana-related offense and lower-income residents who live, or have lived, in neighborhoods marked by high marijuana arrest rates. The program aims to reduce the barriers to ownership of cannabis businesses through access to training programs, employee training and technical assistance. \nThe uncertainty around the emerging market was highlighted throughout the council meeting, with members expressing concern about the potential for shops to inundate neighborhoods or shady operators to slip into the legal industry. \nCouncilman Paul Krekorian said illegal pot cultivators threaten to push out businesses in industrial sections of the city\u2019s San Fernando Valley. Councilwoman Nury Martinez said she feared the city would fail to sufficiently fund enforcement, leaving rogue operators to flourish. \nCalifornia is among 29 states where pot is legal, either for medical or recreational use. \nLos Angeles has long been an unruly frontier in the pot industry, where hundreds of illegal dispensaries and cultivators proliferated. Earlier this year, city voters endorsed another attempt to regulate the local pot businesses, leading to the new rules. The legal marketplace is seen as a way to impose order, hopefully squeezing out illegal operators while raising a cascade of new taxes for City Hall. \nIn the background is widespread uncertainty about whether the Trump administration will attempt to intervene in states where marijuana is legal. Because marijuana is illegal in the eyes of the federal government, many major banks are leery to do business with dispensaries and growers, so much of the business is conducted in cash.

Hence, a committee was set up on August 28, 1949 that decided a Flag Day shall be celebrated annually on December 7. The reason it was called a flag day was because small flags were distributed across the country among the general population which served two purposes \u2013 collection of welfare funds and creating a sense of camaraderie and harmony between the Army and citizens. Over the years, the observance of the day became a tradition. \nThe day also reminds the citizens to care for the living heroes who were either wounded in action or retired from service at a fairly young age. \nEach year, 60,000 defence personnel are compulsorily retired. The necessity to release personnel between 35-40 years of age is required in the armed forces so that the service personnel remain \u201cyoung, physically fit and have qualities of discipline, drive and leadership.\u201d \nThe Flag Day, therefore, highlights citizens\u2019 responsibility and obligation towards looking after the disabled servicemen, and the widows and the dependants of martyrs. Citizens are thus urged on this day to take it as an opportunity to contribute generously to the Armed Forces Flag Day Fund (AFFDF). \nThe Kendriya Sainik Board (KSB) distributes token flags, car stickers in red, deep blue and light colours denoting the three Services. In man places, Armed Forces formations and units conduct programmes to raise charity. The KSB administers the AFFDF and it is operated by a managing committee that is headed by the defence minister.

The Government does not have accurate records. In May of 2013, I went to US Senator Warren Office. She told me to have my doctor write her a note.\n2. After interacting with Senaor\u2019s Warren Office, the garnishments stopped.\n3. I have showed everyone the not my Primary Care wrote.\n4.

Now considering in 2006 and 2009 I worked a total of 180 hours between both years I was not writing alot of checks. Now one group i did not write checks to was to Discover and chase Bank, it is well documented at the Lowell courthouse, I told them, you can all line up and suck my cock that is the only way you assholes are getting anything from me. In front of Lawrence Superior Courthouse 1st Justice Honorable Lynn C. Rooney, I might have used more colorful language but it has the same \u201clegal meaning\u201d I do have some memories however of writing checks to Federal Student Loans, the US Government does not have records of those checks, it what i need my bank for. get this Im not saying its alot maybe a handful, but if its even 1, Im fucking them tell my balls are empty, and the viagra wont give me any reloads.\n8. According to the contract, if I become disabled it is null and void, that is the language of the contract according to general contract law as discussed on Handle on the Law with Bill Handel, since I have signed that contract I was awarded medicare parts A,B, and D. The US Government to my best guess paid out over $250,000 in medical expenses while I went through chemothrapy, now only about $100,000 of it is from actual chemo, the bulk of it would be from this magical weekend I had a Tufts with Gary and the 5 Doctors at my bed side. I think I 1 point I had the Chief Surgeon at tufts Gary, 5 doctors, 1 RN, and Nurses assistant all in my hospital room at the same time. That must have been expensive. Don\u2019t get me wrong medicare is great with chemo, 71 hospital + doctor trips some planned some not during chemo ZERO out of pocket expenses. For those keeping score at home that is 71 trips over a 24 week period. So part of me is curious how accurate bill handel general legal advice was.\n9. Their is part of Brett T Deveau contract that speaks of reasonable legal fees, and that amount of money they cannot exceed is outlined by law. i don\u2019t think legal it would mean to much but I believe they went over.\nthe absolute best part of this, with my desire to be a lawyer and go to law school if able, this might as well be a lab assignment for school.\nIf I have a choice to participate in the Jenny\u2019s kids charities or argue in front of US DC Court Judge Jennifer C.
