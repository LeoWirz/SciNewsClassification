Whereas Libor is the \"ask\" rate at which a bank is willing to lend eurocurrency deposits to another bank, Libid is the \"bid\" rate at which banks are willing to borrow. The difference between the two is the bid-ask spread on these transactions. \nWhile Libor is a popular benchmark interest rate that is calculated and published by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) , Libid is not standardized or publicly available. It is not used outside of the interbank lending market. \"Limean\" refers to the average of Libor and Libid.

The series has sold millions of copies on cell phones, PCs and consoles, but just when you thought you had the entire gimmick mastered\u2026.now you have to start thinking with portals. \nHeadup Games and ClockStone Software present Bridge Constructor Portal, a new twist on the game where getting cars across involves bouncing on faith plates, avoiding turrets and falling upside-down. And of course, Ellen McLain\u2019s GLaDOS will be around to throw snide remarks your way when you fail. \nBridge Constructor fans should be thrilled to have two franchises clash in this way. Portal fans, who have been waiting for a proper Portal game since the second one came out in 2011, are likely less enthused. At any rate, it\u2019s nice to hear GLaDOS again. \nThe PC and mobile versions of Bridge Constructor Portal will be out December 20; the console version will follow in 2018. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ellen mclain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:41.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ccc4b5ceac6600342c67d0781b4db9546792e41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpAYNeM5CifTfjdeUT710W9gynOhtMmxavUlt7OPNKeq7z19P2gbYSMTjOYe0KPuYE6mXyXu4YRHRK5719d17_lZm.srll4AA0.Ly.sL9IcgpkD8WV2f8OUb.F49a7UVTeYGHagZhau4o2GCOSizzgfFZDLfE2y05mojld5fydIcpZR08RY_VqbR1CzBeo.fVJqGlvtfjSmYHZx35JXi1_RV10f2nfMkHUg6ofGglhlQ--", "site_full": "slickdeals.net", "site": "slickdeals.net", "site_section": "https://slickdeals.net/", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping"], "section_title": "Slickdeals Frontpage RSS Feed", "title": "Samsung HW-M360/ZA 200W 2.1 Ch Soundbar w/ Wireless Subwoofer for $89.99 + Free Shipping (eBay Daily Deal)", "title_full": "Samsung HW-M360/ZA 200W 2.1 Ch Soundbar w/ Wireless Subwoofer for $89.99 + Free Shipping (eBay Daily Deal)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 269, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1ccc4b5ceac6600342c67d0781b4db9546792e41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpAYNeM5CifTfjdeUT710W9gynOhtMmxavUlt7OPNKeq7z19P2gbYSMTjOYe0KPuYE6mXyXu4YRHRK5719d17_lZm.srll4AA0.Ly.sL9IcgpkD8WV2f8OUb.F49a7UVTeYGHagZhau4o2GCOSizzgfFZDLfE2y05mojld5fydIcpZR08RY_VqbR1CzBeo.fVJqGlvtfjSmYHZx35JXi1_RV10f2nfMkHUg6ofGglhlQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "DJ3xclusive", "published": "2017-12-07T11:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "Samsung HW-M360/ZA 200W 2.1 Ch Soundbar w/ Wireless Subwoofer for $89.99 + Free Shipping (eBay Daily Deal)", "text": "\nThumb Score: +18 BuyDig via eBay.com has Samsung 200W 2.1 Ch Soundbar w/ Wireless Subwoofer (HW-M360/ZA) for $89.99 (reflected in cart).

Stuart Rosenberg Supply Chain Consultant, First Choice Supply Chain Posted on: Jun, 05 2017 If we limit the standard on judging or determining the best supply chain to just three calculations it does not tell the entire picture. Financial performance metrics are valuable as they capture the economic consequences of business decisions. But supply chain managers make decsions and use organizational resources that impact a company's financial well being. Where is a firm's earnings over a period of time determined by sales less product costs and general/adminsitrative costs? Where is the metric for determining the sources and uses of cash from three perspectives - operational, investment and financial? Where are these supply chain metrics: on-time delivery, lead time, response time to customers, product returns, procurement costs, network distance, inventory carrying costs, forecasting accuracy, sourcing time, etc,. Without knowing the results of all these supply chain calculations the there must be a question as to the accuracy of the 25 top supply chains. Dustin Calitz Project Commercialization Manager, Mondelez Posted on: Jun, 06 2017 I feel this ranking misses the mark in SC. It does not seem to consider a key indicator in days inventory on hand, which is key to determining a SC company's ability to forecast, manage inventory costs and reduce aged stock. In additiion I realize it's difficult to understand what goes into the customer survey, but would I assume specific metrics are being asked. For examples customer's opinion on service level differentiation and the ability to deliver the right product on time, which should then be allocated a bigger weighting than 10%. It would also be interesting to take a view of the above list's SKU portfolio complexity, seasonality and launches/promotions. I would again assume some companies on the list above have a far more complex SC to manage and lead, ultimately requiring a lot more innovation within a SC to stay ahead of competitors, and ultimately satisfy their customers demands. I understand above metrics are difficult to measure, as mentioned in the article, but they somehow need to be considered to give a true reflection. Michael Hurd Posted on: Jun, 10 2017 \nA Very Good Article... \nWhile some feel that lean is a scam that pushes for more out of the personnel and out of the companies through reduction of waste and adding value for the customer, there are several things to remember: \n1) Lean methodologies are designed and implemented to reduce time wasting, so this may seem that you are working harder as an employee. 2) Lean methdoligies only work when everyone from the janitor to the owner of the company get involved and back the program. \n3) Lean methods are there to make you work smarter not harder, although it may feel you are working harder. \n4) YES... Sometimes lean methodologies fail! This is due to project overun or taking on too large a problem and trying to fix it all in one go and not taking the smaller problems that are associated with the large problem and fixing them first. Sometimes fixing the small problems leads to resolution of the larger problem. Akhil Director Supply Chain , skuchain Posted on: Jul, 31 2017 The Supply Chain technology is not considered a problem because traditionally supply chains are thought to be cost centres unlike sales functions. The tendency, in general, to limit expenses and cost cutting on upgrades for technology and for talent have been hindering progress for the businesses. Supply chains lack real time visbility and above all trust across the value chain (not that the participants are dishonest) rather it's about the cascading effects referred to as the bull-whip effect which causes higher magnitudes of disruptions. Supply chain real time information should top the list . Another problem is that of multi homing as so much data is available across several feeds of IOT/Email/Internet /Mobility/ERP that organisations tend to have issues around finding a single platform to collate them for meaning analysis. Blockchain (if deployed appropriately) can be a great solution for solving the issues around the supply chain. Mike Ledyard Vested Program Faculty, Vested Way / University ofTennessee Posted on: Aug, 04 2017 Excellent article. It very much points to the need for Shared Risk / Shared Reward as we teach at Vested. Suppliers will respond when they are made part of the team, and they have a lot to bring to the game. The service provider is the subject matter expert in the services provided, and in an excellent position to enhance the capabilities and services offered by the shipper. Andrew Downard Managing Director, AD Supply Chain Group Pty Ltd Posted on: Aug, 05 2017 As the article points out it is not a lack of technology that is holding back performance but rather a failure to form the right sort of relationships. As well as the length of such relatiohships, practitioners should consider employing arrangements that incentivise both parties to innovate and deliver levels of performance and profit that neither thought possible. By far the best model I have come across to achieve this is the Vested Outsourcing model developed by researchers from the University of Tennessee. See www.vestedway.com for information on the model and case studies that show how others have benefited from creating a Vested deal. Najma logistics, threelineshipping Posted on: Aug, 23 2017 Very informational article. The major focus of logistics is on e-commerce. There is a need to optimize every component of logistics by following the latest trends and technologies. Thanks for uploading this article. Sameer Shukkla Consulting Partner, Wipro Inc. Posted on: Sep, 17 2017 I have recently co-authored a white paper with my colleague wherein we have looked at 2 fundamental guiding principles - 1. Always have enough to Sell / Produce 2. Do not have excess to Sell / Produce These 2 Golden Rules can be the foundation of keeping optimal inventory levels and for organizations to achieve the same. We have looked at a framework which tries to reduce the phase mismatch between Demand & Supply, and tries to bring the shape of the supply curve closer to shape of the demand curve. We have classified symptoms and underlying root causes for the above \"Phase mismatch\" and \"Curve Mismatch\" between Demand and Supply, and then talked about addresssing those individual root causes to strive towards Leaner Inventory levels while maintaining or improving service levels. So to answer your question, we feel the Companies which have addresed these causes have been able to keep DIO horizontal or even going down, while others have not been able to control rising DIO because of not addressing the root causes. Simon Eagle SCM Consultant, Camelot MC Posted on: Sep, 17 2017 You ask why turns are flat or declining despite lots of attention and technology. The answer is, I think, 2 fold: the supply chain environments VUCA (Volatliity, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity) is on a continuous upward curve and this means that forecast accuracy inevitably declines in parallel - and much of that inaccuracy is hidden by the statistics. For instance a company with, seemingy good, 80% mix accuracy will find that figure is skewed so high by the few high volume / low variability items. 80% of the items will be achieving considerably less than 60% error. So most item level forecasts used for driving replenishment through an MPS (be it ERP or APS) are simply leading to unbalanced stocks, service threats and continuous expediting / fire-fighting. These schedule interrutions are \"variability\" that is disrupting flow and, thereby, increasing lead-times, using unplanned capacity and generating excessive (and still unbalanced) inventories. The replacement in ex-stock supply chains is \"enterprise(s)-wide\" pull which also uses \"push\" for extreme/exceptional events. Its other key characteristics are that the supply chain is decoupled and is demand-driven. And now it can be implemented using SAP since they announced they they have co-developed an enhancement for IBP that supports this transformational way of working - up to 50% inventory reduction, requiring less capacity and shorter lead-times all while achieving planned service levels. See https://www.camelot-itlab.com/en/camelot-demand-driven-lean-planning-suite-for-sap/ and https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/supply-chain-flow-what-why-how-simon-eagle/ John Smith Research & Development, Octopus Tech Solutions Posted on: Sep, 18 2017 IoT is without a doubt starting to become a major factor in the profitability of various companies. In the manufacturing sector, we will see it come into the front by the end of 2020 completely. Various sectors have already adapted IoT solutions like the security industry or companies offering BPO Services India . Contact centers not just in India and China but across the world have adapted technology following the principles of IoT. The manufacturing sector is soon going to follow. Girish Maniyar Chief Manager Development Initiatives, Asian Paints Posted on: Sep, 28 2017 I can speak with some context. While efficiency and tools can reduce inventory, we also see the number of SKUs and new products increasing, and also the number of sales/depot points. This means the inventory in such cases, can start with very high number and with more customization and choices available to the consumer, so there is no end to the long tail of products available within a category. It is unlikely that the slow/dead goods are written off so easily to be not included here. A larger question, would it be purely an IO problem or also a Demand Planning (Forecast Error) problem? A higher cycle time of service but a better fill rate can improve inventory performance, by aggregation. But a bad forecast can do away all the good work you do in inventory planning. Do you have numbers for decorative coatings in the list? I did not see something there only for decorative coatings. Reo B Hatfield Chief Operating Executive , BestTransport Posted on: Oct, 20 2017 My opinion is that peaks and valley are just nice graphics to explain. Smooth responses save the day. 3PLs just adjust to the climate and the areas of movement of Logistics. One purpose of the 3PL movement was to adjust to an always changing market. They will never be fixed and will flex as the logistics changes. 3PL companies have vast knowledge of their business. Their success is their ability to move up and down as the market flows. They bring a level playing field to the transportation world that in the past was rigid but looked good on spreadsheets. Industry graphic personnel like to be able to answer all the changes because they can only see documents. 3PLs see the needs, the issues, the positive changes and the knowledge to know why and when to adjust. They (3PLs) have smoothed the waves of the past and everybody likes to see the spikes so they know something is there to clearly report on. Smooth sailing is boring but sure gets you where you want to go. Catherine Dennis Supply Chain Manager, Indak Mfg Corp Posted on: Oct, 26 2017 So the horrific and severe worldwide allocation of electronic components is not an issue? Don't tell that to the automotive buyers. It's HORRIBLE. Lead times out to up to 76 weeks. Why not write about that? It's killing us, our customers and the big automakers.

This transition zone has different definitions. We want to highlight different landmarks of the rectosigmoid junction (RSJ), to help the clinicians to adopt a consensual definition.\nMethod We reviewed anatomical, endoscopic, physiological and surgical points of view concerning the rectosigmoid junction (RSJ).\nResults The rectosigmoid junction has a different definition depending on who is studying it. Nevertheless, it is a high pressure location, a place connecting different muscles organizations, neurological systems or vascular anastomosis. The clear pathophysiology of the RSJ is not yet determined with certainty, but its resection is essential for the therapeutic care of patients and also for the improvement of surgical skills. From a surgical point of view, anatomical landmarks has to be chosen: easily reproducible and identifiable. The disappearance of taenia coli (belonging to the colon) and the peritoneal reflection (recto-genital pouch), located below the upper rectum, seem the most reliable. The level of rectal section must, in any case, be below the promontory.\nConclusion There is not a single definition, but rather several definitions of the RSJ. Each one of them reflects one appearance of this region: embryological and anatomical evolution or clinical entity. From a surgical point of view, the criterion which seems to be the most reliable is the disappearance of taenia coli and the peritoneal reflection (recto-genital pouch).\n\n\nfrom #MedicinebyAlexandrosSfakianakis via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2kt6r2H\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:41.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "73f231e3cb28133b5b5155592df849607f9b89ef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSAmvx_WDEnfs1jnu0gC2kn9ZDGzsbC4CyWmGXWH3uWOpRlT3A3C_9hqhShAC31m6V2aDmrjnUY.vO.FGDmcIQPnW9dPGst9nSbN5VWaoJX5IouJPt1y6c2g--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/r/DCcomics: A friendly community dedicated to the Greatest Superheroes in the World", "title": "I love callback covers like these [New 52 JL#1 and JL#24]", "title_full": "I love callback covers like these [New 52 JL#1 and JL#24] : DCcomics", "published": "2017-12-07T09:31:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6d57e2c80dac1d73ac0b856bab1c02a9110af45f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSAmvx_WDEnfs1jnu0gC2kn9ZDGzsbC4CyWmGXWH3uWOpRlT3A3C_9hqhShAC31m6V2aDmrjnUY.vO.FGDmcIQPnW9dPGst9nSbN5VWaoJX5Irwykvr4XxL.OhpcI_E_DLjBQLws._6Mo-", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Jakob535", "published": "2017-12-07T11:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I\u2019m not familiar with the evil lantern and the small women on the speedsters shoulder.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:41.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6651991326d141506ca0b04eb7723ab1ec2c7419", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtpCDjnFmEiixT7HxQq2aQH2DDiY0yF4S7VcSgZm6uupb97lEiHpUI3kjQ2TaLlRY-", "site_full": "victor-aspidov.livejournal.com", "site": "livejournal.com", "site_section": "http://victor-aspidov.livejournal.com/data/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "victor_aspidov", "title": "\u041c\u043e\u0438 \u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044b", "title_full": "\u041c\u043e\u0438 \u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044b", "published": "2017-12-07T11:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/sign.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6651991326d141506ca0b04eb7723ab1ec2c7419", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtpCDjnFmEiixT7HxQq2aQH2DDiY0yF4S7VcSgZm6uupb97lEiHpUI3kjQ2TaLlRY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "\u041c\u043e\u0438 \u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044b", "text": "Anonymous comments are disabled in this journal We will log you in after post We will log you in after post We will log you in after post We will log you in after post We will log you in after post Anonymously", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:41.030+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bf4582ed4ea9b6a42252e3fff4f29a4d64e64a73", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/umBmlSSxw9wzZ0Bty8rgSeiwoUTfUOU8CKmG8Rqbmji7kn8JiV1HC6_N3q00PMft13TEPT0fB1goF474eXJylAZy1t.a8AQpX14ie39R3i0Fj4Em9O5c3vDQuqVSnRaMoIsSGL3mTa8-", "site_full": "xtragfx.com", "site": "xtragfx.com", "site_section": "http://xtragfx.com/icons_vectors/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Icons Vectors -

Kamalomyces bambusicola and K. thailandicus spp. nov. are typical of the genus Kamalomyces (Tubeufiaceae, Tubeufiales) and are morphologically distinct from known species with respect to their size of ascomata, asci and ascospores, ascospore septation and peridium structure, including the subiculum comprising hyphae on the host surface. Morphological examination reveals that the asexual morph of K. bambusicola is associated with its sexual morph in a subiculum forming dictyochlamydosporous conidia, which are similar to the asexual morph of Chlamydotubeufia . Phylogenetic analyses of combined LSU, ITS and TEF1-\u03b1 sequence data also support these two species as distinct and confirm their phylogenetic affinities within the Tubeufiaceae. In particular, Kamalomyces shares a close phylogenetic relationship to Helicoma .\n\n\nfrom #MedicinebyAlexandrosSfakianakis via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2jmoFzk\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "kamalomyces", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lsu", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "helicoma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thailand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tubeufiales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chlamydotubeufia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:43.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "023b066aa55842bf643c650953eab4065029ed7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/umBmlSSxw9wzZ0Bty8rgSeiwoUTfUOU8CKmG8Rqbmji7kn8JiV1HC0IZ_eHsKaw5D.CTgf889nOqxaJCdojpfJEAj_eSiglRX1.ADbmTwu4WcTfdJsyFSQ--", "site_full": "xtragfx.com", "site": "xtragfx.com", "site_section": "http://xtragfx.com/icons_vectors/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Icons Vectors - xtraGFX Creating the Pixels GFX Sources for Graphic Designers", "title": "520 People Glyph Icons 2041531", "title_full": "520 People Glyph Icons 2041531", "published": "2017-12-07T11:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://xtragfx.com/uploads/posts/2017-12/1512640727_vtu2pnlfwuz04ox.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "023b066aa55842bf643c650953eab4065029ed7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/umBmlSSxw9wzZ0Bty8rgSeiwoUTfUOU8CKmG8Rqbmji7kn8JiV1HC0IZ_eHsKaw5D.CTgf889nOqxaJCdojpfJEAj_eSiglRX1.ADbmTwu4WcTfdJsyFSQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "stock220", "published": "2017-12-07T11:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "520 People Glyph Icons 2041531", "text": "520 People Glyph Icons 2041531   Human Anatomy, Humans, People, Personality traits, Women, Professionals, Avatars, Activities, Yoga Poses and Kids glyph icons.

It\u2019s just the process of making them I don\u2019t like. \nI\u2019ve never thought too much about it and have gamefully always participated when required in craft sessions with my children that necessitated loads of the stuff being fired at assorted cardboard tubes and plates and pieces of paper. \nBut now, like the rest of the planet, I have realised glitter is most definitely NOT good. When you think about it, of course it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s like nicotine-flavoured chewing gum and Artex on your living room walls \u2013 when you actually, properly think about it, it\u2019s blindingly obvious that it\u2019s such a bad idea. \nGlitter is made up of teeny tiny pieces of shiny plastic called microplastics. Microbeads, another form of microplastic, came under scrutiny recently when it was discovered that they were present in hundreds of thousands of beauty products like shower gels and toothpaste. \nThe problem with glitter and microbeads is that they are small enough to pass through water filtration systems, so they end up in the ocean and threaten aquatic life. The fear is they end up getting eaten by fish and other sealife, causing them harm, and then enter the human food chain. \nArt therapy charity The Teapot Trust, which was set up by Evening Times Scotswoman of the Year Laura Young, banned glitter from its projects a year ago, partly because of environmental concerns, and stories of nurseries and schools around the country following suit are becoming more common. \nPredictably, a few outraged moaners have called the banning of glitter another \u2018step too far\u2019 and the \u2018nanny state\u2019 taking over, but there\u2019s a bigger, more horrifying picture here. \nIf you have been watching the gobsmacking Blue Planet II series on TV just now, you may know the statistics - more than eight million tonnes of plastic reaches the sea every year; there will be more plastic than fish in the sea by 2050; 99 per cent of the planet\u2019s seabirds will have eaten some; the average person who eats seafood swallows up to 11,000 pieces of microplastic every year\u2026.. it makes truly awful reading. \nWe have all become so used to plastic, it\u2019s hard to imagine living without it. But there are biodegradable and environmentally friendly alternatives \u2013 in the case of glitter, for example, products made eucalyptus tree extract, or even lentils and rice. \nCouldn\u2019t the cash from the plastic bag charge imposed at check-outs be used to develop more of the same?

In the game, your job is to blow up the enemy base so that you may reign supreme. The game has gotten many updates, and today, a new one came to bring the game up to version 4.5. With it comes a new character, new starter pack, and more. \n\u201cQi\u2019Tara, the thirty-third character to join the Awesomenauts, is a cloaked assassin that applies a stacking poison effect to her enemies every time she hits them. Her individual hits don\u2019t deal too much damage, but the poison effect can quickly overwhelm her opponents because of her high attack speed. She\u2019s the fourth and final member of the Renegades, a team of elite mercenaries on the run from a corrupt emperor, and now that they\u2019ve reunited under the banner of the Awesomenauts they\u2019re ready to strike back!

Jill, Inc. (NYSE: JILL) shareholders who purchased shares pursuant and/or traceable to the Company\u2019s Initial Public Offering on or around October 9, 2017. \nClick here to learn about the case: http://docs.wongesq.com/JILL-Info-Request-Form-1727 . There is no cost or obligation to you. \nThe complaint alleges that the Registration Statement and Prospectus filed for the Company\u2019s IPO contained materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company\u2019s purportedly unique and superior sales and marketing approach had not insulated the Company from adverse trends affecting the overall retail industry; (2) the Company\u2019s historic gross margin growth was not sustainable and would not continue, as it relied on various short-term boosts to revenues; (3) the Company was carrying increasing amounts of slow moving inventory and would need to significantly markdown sales items and increase promotional efforts in an attempt to continue its sales growth; (4) the Company\u2019s brick-and-mortar stores were failing, as they were experiencing difficulty attracting customers and maintaining profitability, which would result in the Company shuttering up to eight stores in fiscal 2017, with the rate of store closures accelerating; and (5) as a result of the aforementioned, J.Jill\u2019s business, prospects and ability to service its long-term debt had been materially impaired. \nIf you suffered a loss in J.Jill, you have until December 12, 2017 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff.

Oncology information systems deal with various parts of cancer treatment, including treatment planning and patient information records. The global oncology information system market has exhibited steady growth over the last few years due to key drivers such as the rising prevalence of cancer across the world and the rising adoption of digital resources in the healthcare sector. The global oncology information system market is likely to exhibit a strong 7.6% CAGR over the 2017-2022 forecast period, with its valuation set to rise from US$2,285.6 mn in 2017 to US$3,293.8 mn in 2022. Read Report Overview @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/oncology-information-system-market.html Here are the key insights into the growth of the oncology information system market: The rising prevalence of cancer across the world, and especially in developed countries, is the key driver for the global oncology information system market. The oncology information system market has benefited from the steady growth of the cancer treatment research sector in countries such as the U.S., Canada, Germany, and the U.K. and is set to prosper in the coming years due to the growing investment being provided to cancer research in these regions. The growing incidence of cancer recurrence in these countries is likely to be a crucial driver for the oncology information system market in the coming years, as oncology information systems are most utile in long-term cases that require consistent coordination with the historical treatment patterns. Government support to cancer research has also been forthcoming in developed countries, while the growing adoption of unhealthy lifestyle choices such as sedentary lifestyles, excessive consumption of junk food, and preference to addictions such as smoking and alcohol is likely to be a key driver for the global oncology information system market in the coming years. Growing government support is crucial for widespread adoption of oncology information systems, as it helps enable universal adoption and eases the financial load of incorporating the systems into the operating mechanisms of smaller hospitals. Accordingly, North America is set to remain the dominant contributor to the global oncology information system market in the coming years. The North America oncology information system market is set to rise from a valuation of US$933.7 mn to US$1,411.5 mn over the 2017-2022 forecast period, making it the dominant geographical segment of the global oncology information system market. Europe is also likely to make a vital contribution to the global oncology information system market over the 2017-2022 forecast period, with the region expected to present an absolute opportunity of US$212.5 mn in the aforementioned period. Request Sample Report @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=18659 Developing regions such as Asia Pacific except Japan are likely to be major contributors to the global oncology information system market in the future, though their share in the global market is likely to be limited in the forecast period due to the lack of skilled workers and technological support required for advanced oncology information systems. However, the rising prevalence of cancer in leading economies such as China and India, where government support as well as private investment in the healthcare sector has grown rapidly in recent years, is likely to drive the oncology information system market in the region in the coming years. The APEJ oncology information system market is expected to gain 100 BPS over its 2017 valuation by 2022, demonstrating its role as a major future component of the global oncology information system market. Competitive Dynamics Leading players in the global oncology information system market include Accuray Inc., Koninklijke Philips N.V., Cerner Corporation, Mckesson Corporation, Flatiron Health Inc., Raysearch Laboratories, Epic Systems Corporation, Verian Medical Systems Inc., and Elekta AB. \nAbout Us \nTransparency Market Research (TMR) is a global market intelligence company providing business information reports and services.

Children going on Ramadas (Photo: SIPSE) \nThat establishes this season as the most important party time of the year, because right after the \u201cNovenas\u201d (religious celebration for the Virgin of Guadalupe, in which there are prayers, and lots of traditional food) held on December 12, everybody starts going to the traditional \u201cPosadas\u201d (parties with a religious origin that now days have become the best reason to meet, eat and drink with family and friends), then people attend the Christmas eve and Christmas day parties, later the New\u2019s Year celebration to finish with the Epiphany day eating \u201cRosca de Reyes\u201d and drinking a lot of Hot Chocolate along with the family. \nBut previous to all of that, from December 1 st till 11 th , children go through the streets of their own neighborhood, usually accompanied by parents and friends, in a tour that could recall a little bit to the American tradition \u201ctrick or treat\u201d at Halloween. But here they aren\u2019t asking for candy \u2014 they are asking for money to make their own posada, and the children don\u2019t go in costume, they go in their regular/winter clothes, depending on weather. There are no rules to sing the ramadas, just to carry a tree branch or decoration. (Photo: Youtube) \nBecause the \u201cRamadas\u201d is a tradition for the kids, there aren\u2019t strict rules to go on them. But what can\u2019t be missing is a Christmas decorated tree branch that kids must carry on through the whole tour, a Mar\u00eda Virgin image inside a decorated box or a representation of the nativity, something to keep the money safe and, of course, the traditional song that children must sing at each house they go to during the tour. \nKids don\u2019t have a minimum number of houses to visit or a schedule to accomplish, nor a fixed route to follow. They do it all the time they want and when they think having money enough they could stop the tour and save the earnings to keep on going the next night. (Photo: Yucatan a la Mano) \nThe lyrics have differences between the states where they are sung, but here TYT brings you the lyrics of the Yucatecan song in Spanish: Me paro en la puerta, me quito el sombrero porque en esta casa vive un caballero. Vive un caballero, vive un general y nos da permiso para comenzar. Naranjas y limas, limas y limones aqu\u00ed est\u00e1 la virgen de todas las flores. En un jacalito de cal y de arena naci\u00f3 Jesucristo para Nochebuena. A la media noche un gallo canto y en su canto dijo: \u201cYa Cristo naci\u00f3\u201d Zacatito verde, lleno de roci\u00f3 el que no se tape se muere de fr\u00edo. Se\u00f1ora Santana, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 llora el ni\u00f1o? Por una manzana que se la ha perdido. Que no llore por una, yo le dar\u00e9 dos una para el ni\u00f1o y otra para Dios. (x2) La calaca tiene un diente, tiene un diente. Topogigio tiene dos. Si nos dan nuestro aguinaldo, aguinaldo se lo pagara el se\u00f1or. (x2) If the kids receive their money they sing: Ya se va la rama muy agradecida porque en esta casa fue bien recibida Pasen buenas noches, as\u00ed les deseamos pasen buenas noches, nosotros nos vamos. But if the kids receive nothing, then\u2026 Ya se va la rama muy desconsolada porque en esta casa no le dieron nada. Pasen buenas noches, as\u00ed les deseamos pasen buenas noches, nosotros nos vamos. \n\nBy Jorge Andr\u00e9s Barrera Rojas for TYT \nWith an International Trade degree from the Autonomous University of Yucatan, Jorge is currently an Editor for The Yucatan Times, Business Adviser and Chinese language and culture student.

At the same time, if Satoshi were keeping the Bitcoin record and had any human power over it at all, government could imprison him, pass a law, create a cease-and-desist, or demand he tamper with the record, which they did with e-gold. But Satoshi does not have that power, and no one else does either.\nWhy? Precisely because Bitcoin DOESN\u2019T exist. It\u2019s not a real thing. Or rather, the only \u201creal\u201d thing is the ledger itself which is already public to everyone everywhere. You can\u2019t demand the secret keys to Bitcoin privacy because it\u2019s already completely, entirely public. What would a government demand? Suppose they ordered a miner to alter the record: the other miners would instantly reject it and it would fail. Suppose they confiscated the ledger: they now own what everyone already has. Suppose they unplugged it: they would have to unplug the entire internet, and everything else on it, or every Bitcoin node, one-by-one, worldwide. If any nodes were ever turned on, all Bitcoin would exist again.\nCan they track them down? Not really. In theory, Bitcoin can be written on paper without an Internet. In practice, any public or private keys certainly can be. So even chasing down the Internet it would be very difficult to stop it given sufficient motivation, like the Venezuelan hyperinflation where they are chasing down miners, wallets, and participants, and failing despite overwhelming force.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.theautomaticearth.com/2017/12/bitcoin-doesnt-exist-1/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:44.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3e50075bbe86fd87995514586cd7aa74aff8ffd1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT96GyASeBlRrKKLRPb_4joAp9BDZct0R0nAlvwvq0.BMoxN_yuzD2xPYUaljLLK1M-", "site_full": "www.kvraudio.com", "site": "kvraudio.com", "site_section": "http://www.kvraudio.com/rss/?rss=999999", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "KVR Forum: Latest Posts", "title": "sonar or samplitude?", "title_full": "sonar or samplitude?", "published": "2017-12-07T12:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://static.kvraudio.com/i/b/kvraudio-300x300-grey-eeeeee.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 29467, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3e50075bbe86fd87995514586cd7aa74aff8ffd1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT96GyASeBlRrKKLRPb_4joAp9BDZct0R0nAlvwvq0.BMoxN_yuzD2xPYUaljLLK1M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "sonar or samplitude?", "text": "4388 posts since 23 Mar, 2006, from pendeLondonmonium by himalaya ; Thu Dec 07, 2017 2:21 am Re: sonar or samplitude?

I miss Samplitude for mastering, it was such a complete package...years ago no DAW allowed object editing and I remember using it and loving it. I loved its workspace templates which at a button press allowed total reconfiguration of the tool-sets, so when recording the tools available were focused on recording, when mastering, the tools provided all that one needed for mastering, etc. So the workspace never felt cluttered. I wish Reaper had this approach. It would elevate it to a much more user friendly DAW. But I digress.Samplitude at this price...unbelievable.

Basically, the problem of money comes down to trust. Trust between individuals, between the system, but also partly trust in non-interference of governments or other powerful groups. Bitcoin is a trust machine.\nHow does it work? Well, the basic problem of cheating was one of not creating fake, hidden registers of value, as the U.S. Government, J.P. Morgan, and the Comex do every day. If they asked Yellen to type some extra zeros on the U.S. ledger, print a few pallets of $100 bills to send to Ukraine, who would know? Who could stop them? So with Bitcoin, the \u201cvalue\u201d, the register is created by essentially solving a math problem, akin to discovering prime numbers. Why do something so pointless? Simple: math doesn\u2019t lie. Unlike U.S. Dollars, there are only so many prime numbers. We can be certain you won\u2019t reach 11-digits and discover an unexpected trove of a thousand primes in the row. Can\u2019t happen. However useless, Math is certainty. In this case, math is also limited. It\u2019s also known and provable, unlike the U.S. budget or Federal Reserve accounting.\nThe second problem of cheating was someone simply claiming chits they did not own. This was solved by having the participants talk back and forth with each other, creating a public record or ledger. In fact, Bitcoin is nothing more than a very, very long accounting ledger of where every coin came from, and how every coin has moved since then, something computers do very well. These accounting lines register amongst all participants using a process of confirmed consensus.\nDouble-spending is when someone writes a check either against money they don\u2019t have (yet) and round-robin in the money for the one second of clearing, or else write a check against money they DO have, but then cancel the check before it clears, walking away with the goods. In a standard commerce, the bank backfills fraud and loss and the government arrests, tries, and imprisons people, but it\u2019s no small cost to do so. Although there is still a small possibility of double-spending, Satoshi\u2019s plan effectively closed the issue: the ledger is either written, or unwritten. There is no time in the middle to exploit.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.theautomaticearth.com/2017/12/bitcoin-doesnt-exist-1/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:44.030+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2fe474869d2ba5edcfb2d6ff2c79ea321859afe4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQHC9lNBU0VEBbdFF5t_l_PUN6Ewy49kmDuHRZACA1FgEepKNtgSigNyd8BrHgfPUzojA2bQEvvkEDWYOPxg_moo64MaFRDWvfHy6O6MwLEo9V_SaAk.dErhQETLgGElxXwQRPnKRsZx0p2ptNWncw2RAka17Fp70wr9ROEJxbPJmqLTDTjIG2AISu.vYWRXX_tG9m7kdWGXM7rFTKDnYpsrrQXFzlX9LfwdJgkcWh3x9oRKWjWC.xL", "site_full": "differentshapes.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://differentshapes.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "\u30d5\u30a1\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\uff3f\uff33\uff50\uff59 \uff33\uff48\uff49\uff50\uff1f \u2013 DIFFERENT SHAPES_LANUI", "title": "\u30d5\u30a1\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\uff3f\uff33\uff50\uff59 \uff33\uff48\uff49\uff50\uff1f", "title_full": "\u30d5\u30a1\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\uff3f\uff33\uff50\uff59 \uff33\uff48\uff49\uff50\uff1f", "published": "2017-12-07T12:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "JP", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2fe474869d2ba5edcfb2d6ff2c79ea321859afe4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQHC9lNBU0VEBbdFF5t_l_PUN6Ewy49kmDuHRZACA1FgEepKNtgSigNyd8BrHgfPUzojA2bQEvvkEDWYOPxg_moo64MaFRDWvfHy6O6MwLEo9V_SaAk.dErhQETLgGElxXwQRPnKRsZx0p2ptNWncw2RAka17Fp70wr9ROEJxbPJmqLTDTjIG2AISu.vYWRXX_tG9m7kdWGXM7rFTKDnYpsrrQXFzlX9LfwdJgkcWh3x9oRKWjWC.xL", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "differentshapes", "published": "2017-12-07T12:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "\u30d5\u30a1\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\uff3f\uff33\uff50\uff59 \uff33\uff48\uff49\uff50\uff1f", "text": "Two tone Orange \u00d7 fabric inlay\n\u6765\u305d\u3046\u306a\u4e88\u611f\u304c\u73fe\u5b9f\u306b\u2026\nNorth Korean Spy Ship.

This is his first major film. Not only that, his character is DC\u2019s first movie screen black hero. \nTo a lot of comic fans, Cyborg is not just a member of the Justice League. He represents not just a superhero but a role model for many children. \nFisher shares that his first interaction with the character was with the cartoon show Teen Titans in the early 2000s. He was a freshman in high school during that time. Fisher recalls growing up following all the characters in Justice League and Batman Superman Adventures to name a few. \nIn the movie, his character undergoes a healing process where bits and pieces of his human existence slowly come to him. To the relief of comic fans, Fisher gets to use Cyborg\u2019s famous catchphrase \u201cBoo-yah\u201d as part of his dialogue in the film. Fisher was really excited to say it because it felt right and wasn\u2019t forced. \nEven as he is hailed as DC\u2019s first cinematic black superhero, Fisher doesn\u2019t forget to pay homage to Shaquille O\u2019Neil\u2019s portrayal in the film Steel . Playing the role of a black superhero has encouraged a lot of young people of color to show their admiration for Cyborg\u2019s character. He says he\u2019s gone to a lot of conventions in different countries and there are colored kids coming up to him to say that Cyborg is their hero. \nEven disabled people are telling him how they respond to his character because of they are an amputee. Fisher looks at it as a great opportunity to be able to champion people who are underrepresented in the television and film industry. He also adds that he hopes he did justice to the role. \nWhen it comes to his costume, he says that whenever they shoot, he\u2019s the only character that looks out of place. Since his costume is made in CGI, he just wears a onesie quilt. On the other hand, since everyone was looking at him strangely, he actually felt like he was really Cyborg. \nWhen asked if there\u2019s a possibility of a solo movie, Fisher responds by saying that as long as people like what they do and continue to want to see more of his character, anything is a possibility. Looking at the success of Wonder Woman , the sequel was quickly moved to production. If the audience likes the character, it is possible to explore a deeper story apart from the team-up movie.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ray fisher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shaquille o\u2019neil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fisher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "batman superman adventures", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "justice league", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:45.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "57bfa1ccac1952ad19f56eef6d773e5d92fe1a89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSAmvx_WDEnfs1jnu0gC2kn53AWubD_a1_6Jvf2Lc11m6GvCJtykjsQpADxvXMIy16nTUvlR3WQjAVNpzudFfS6r_PxbRNcJdlUzVwBtDhQZvZ6gMpVwLqDQ--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/r/DCcomics: A friendly community dedicated to the Greatest Superheroes in the World", "title": "Showcase Your Collection!

When you do that, that\u2019s economic impact.\u201d \nThe Ohio Grape Industries Committee estimates in a new report that the state\u2019s wine and grape industry had a $1.3 billion economic impact on the Ohio economy last year \u2014 up from $786 million in a study completed five years ago. \nThe industry has seen explosive growth in the state over the last several years, with the number of wineries climbing from 175 in 2012 to 265 last year. \nOver that time, Ohio has become the sixth largest winemaker in the country, now producing 5.9 million gallons a year. Despite the high ranking, the Buckeye State made up a tiny portion, or just 0.74 percent, of the overall amount. \nNot surprisingly, California led the nation with 680 million gallons or 84 percent of the total. \nThe Ohio wine industry now provides 8,067 full-time jobs in the state, an increase of more than 2,700 from the previous report. \nAll that growth has helped generate $75 million in federal taxes and $72 million in state and local taxes, the study says. \n\u201cWe are part of a national trend and it\u2019s reflective of the position wine has taken in American culinary society,\u201d said Donniella Winchell, executive director of the Ohio Wine Producers Association in Geneva. \u201cWine has become an integral part of dining.\u201d \nA Gallup poll released this summer showed that 30 percent of people who consume alcohol consider wine their drink of choice \u2014 second to beer. \nThe authors of the new Ohio study, Frank, Rimerman + Co. from St. Helena, Calif., noted that the economic impact was much higher than the previous study because prior reports underestimated the average amount of money spent by tourists. \nWine-related tourism expenses were estimated at $321 million last year. \nOhio has become a tourism destination for wine drinkers, with an estimated 1.38 million people visiting wineries in the state last year. \nWinchell noted that there are numerous motor coach companies providing wine tours in Northeast Ohio and bed and breakfasts have popped up to serve the industry. \nThose visitors are much sought-after because of their pocketbooks. They have an annual household income of more than $75,000 and with that, plenty of disposable income, Winchell said. \n\u201cThe economic development guys used to look at wineries and tourism as fluff but increasingly they regard it as a serious economic tool,\u201d she said. \nShe also emphasized that the winery growth generally has been in rural areas. \n\u201cWe are a job creator in areas that otherwise have been dependent on less than ideal income opportunities,\u201d she said. \nThe Akron-Canton region boasts more than 20 wineries today, including Gervasi Vineyard in Canton, The Winery at Wolf Creek in Copley Township, Red Horse Winery in Barberton and Hi & Low Winery in Sharon Township. \nBakan, who is part of the Ohio Grape Industries Committee, is not a suit-wearing chief executive. \nHis hands are dirty and his jeans have a hole in them at the knee from kneeling on the ground so much. He talks about wearing out the toes of his boots from welding. \n\u201cI grew up busting my knuckles and burning my eyebrows off,\u201d he said. \nBakan can attest to the economic benefit of wine. \nMaize Valley had always struggled as a family farm. The winery was added in 2005, while the brewery opened in 2014. \nToday, thanks to the winery, brewery and other events, the 750-acre farm attracts more than 100,000 people a year. \n\u201cWhen we started entertaining people, we started paying the bills,\u201d Bakan said. \u201cWhen we got into the wine and beer business, we started actually making money versus the farm. \n\u201cWe joke we used to have an offseason. We don\u2019t anymore. We\u2019re blessed for that.\u201d \nThe winery is small, with only 3.5 acres of grapes. It produces about 20,000 gallons or nearly 8,500 cases a year. \nTonya Fields is the assistant winemaker and vineyard manager. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a cool way to make a living,\u201d she said while standing in the vineyard. \u201cI get to work outside and do what I really enjoy.\u201d \nMaize Valley hasn\u2019t abandoned traditional crop farming. It still produces about 40 different crops. \n\u201cBut the most important harvest is smiles,\u201d Bakan said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bill bakan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tonya fields", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gervasi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bakan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donniella winchell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "winchell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frank", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gallup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio grape industries committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio wine producers association", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "maize valley winery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edison street northwest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akron-canton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maize valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharon township", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geneva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barberton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. helena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wolf creek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northeast ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "copley township", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:46.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d784ce1bfe61142d97145aa65cce088f22f5629e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRaOz_gjtpUmMsya5mFvNmrUqAIPItUJ956NRcSdUQiMDqCfrXiP9VcptYWao4Wjbxqg01UwhTo9jrFLNtmLvMwM_mtIsHx4TeYtDRs1YqK1lI.yN6BZdzruwzBTyFIDsc-", "site_full": "www.flyertalk.com", "site": "flyertalk.com", "site_section": "https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/travel-products-639/", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Travel Products - FlyerTalk Forums", "title": "Discussion re Smart Luggage -- Raden, etc.", "title_full": "Discussion re Smart Luggage -- Raden, etc. - FlyerTalk Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T06:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5203, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7d57da0a172da48d82ec85b380161d93caa06369", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRaOz_gjtpUmMsya5mFvNmrUqAIPItUJ956NRcSdUQiMDqCfrXiP9VcptYWao4Wjbxqg01UwhTo9jrFLNtmLvMwM_mtIsHx4TeYtDRs1YqK1lI.yN6BZdzrxWMG8S31PjsBDD84YzZnAA--", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "GadgetFreak", "published": "2017-12-06T09:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I gave one brand brief consideration a few weeks ago when I was looking for a hard side spinner.
