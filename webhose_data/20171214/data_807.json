The status of the holy city is an extremely sensitive aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While Israel claims the whole city its capital - following the occupation of East Jerusalem in the 1967 war with Syria, Egypt and Jordan - Palestinians have long seen East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. Turkish protesters gather outside the US Consulate in Istanbul after Trump's announcement [Chris McGrath/Getty Images] \"Jerusalem was lost from the day Sadaat visited it and the day you all danced for Oslo,\" wrote Mourid Barghouti, a celebrated Palestinian poet and writer, referring to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and the Oslo Accords. \ufebf\ufe8e\ufecb\ufe96 \ufe8d\ufedf\ufed8\ufeaa\ufeb1 \ufef3\ufeee\ufee1 \ufeaf\ufe8d\ufead\ufeeb\ufe8e \ufe8d\ufedf\ufeb4\ufe8e\ufea9\ufe8d\ufe95 \ufeed\ufef3\ufeee\ufee1 \ufead\ufed7\ufebc\ufe98\ufee2 \ufef7\ufeed\ufeb3\ufee0\ufeee . # \ufe8d\ufedf\ufed8\ufeaa\ufeb1 # \ufe97\ufeae\ufe8d\ufee3\ufe90 # \ufee7\ufed8\ufede_ \ufe8d\ufedf\ufeb4\ufed4\ufe8e\ufead\ufe93 8:20 PM - Dec 5, 2017 52 394 660 \ufee3\ufeae\ufef3\ufeaa \ufe8d\ufedf\ufe92\ufeae\ufecf\ufeee\ufe9b\ufef2 @MouridBarghouti When Sadat took over the presidency in Egypt in 1970, he offered a peace settlement with Israel along the lines of UN Resolution 242, which, more or less, cemented Israel's military victory. As for the Oslo Accords, in 1993, the State of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) formally recognised one another for the first time, and committed to negotiate a solution to their decades-long conflict based on territorial compromise. The accords did not stipulate, but implied, the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. That two-state vision required Israel to abandon its negation of Palestinian claims to national sovereignty, and Palestinians accept that such claims would be limited to only a small part of the entire territory of historic Palestine for which the PLO had been fighting, recognising Israel\u2019s sovereignty over the remainder. \"Oh Arabs and Muslims, Bolivia will ask for an emergency security council meeting in the event that Trump recognises Jerusalem the capital of Israel. Where is the Arab representative in the security council to call for such a meeting?\" said Abdullah K.

It emphasised \"the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and the need to work for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East in which every State in the area can live in security\". While all parties ultimately accepted the resolution, it took two decades for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to do so. The PLO criticised the resolution for viewing Palestinians only as refugees, and not as a people with national rights. \"There is no way Trump could have undertaken this decision without studying and making sure that the Arabs will not really mind..and if they did, they won't be able to do anything about it!,\" said Mohamd Nashwan, a Gaza-based writer. \ufefb \ufef3\ufee4\ufedc\ufee6 \ufedd # \ufe97\ufeae\ufe8d\ufee3\ufe90 \ufe83\ufee5 \ufef3\ufe98\ufea8\ufeac \ufee3\ufe9c\ufede \ufeeb\ufeac\ufe8d \ufe8d\ufedf\ufed8\ufeae\ufe8d\ufead \ufe87\ufefb \ufe91\ufecc\ufeaa \ufea9\ufead\ufe8d\ufeb3\ufe94 \ufedb\ufe92\ufef4\ufeae\ufe93 \ufeed \ufe8d\ufedf\ufe98\ufe84\ufedb\ufeaa \ufe83\ufee5 \ufe8d\ufedf\ufecc\ufeae\ufe8f \ufedf\ufee6 \ufef3\ufee4\ufe8e\ufee7\ufecc\ufeee\ufe8d \ufee3\ufee4\ufe8e\ufee7\ufecc\ufe94 \ufea3\ufed8\ufef4\ufed8\ufef4\ufe94 .. \ufeed\ufe87\ufee5 \ufee3\ufe8e\ufee7\ufecc\ufeee\ufe8d\u060c \ufed3\ufee0\ufee6 \ufef3\ufeb4\ufe98\ufec4\ufef4\ufecc\ufeee\ufe8d \ufed3\ufecc\ufede \ufe83\ufef1 \ufeb7\ufef2\ufe80 ! # \ufe8d\ufedf\ufed8\ufeaa\ufeb1_ \ufecb\ufe8e\ufebb\ufee4\ufe94 _\ufed3\ufee0\ufeb4\ufec4\ufef4\ufee6 _ \ufe8d\ufef7\ufe91\ufeaa\ufef3\ufe94 7:32 PM - Dec 6, 2017 25 165 179 \ufee3\ufea4\ufee4\ufeaa \ufeb3\ufecc\ufef4\ufeaa \ufee7\ufeb8\ufeee\ufe8d\ufee5 # \ufecf\ufeb0\ufe93 @MohamdNashwan \"As the world rejects and condemns Trump's decision, we find the conspirators also riding this wave of condemnation,\" said user @BoMuhannd. \ufe91\ufef4\ufee8\ufee4\ufe8e \ufe8d\ufedf\ufecc\ufe8e\ufedf\ufee2 \ufef3\ufeae\ufed3\ufebe \ufeed\ufef3\ufeb4\ufe98\ufee8\ufedc\ufeae \ufe91\ufed8\ufeee\ufe93 \ufed7\ufeae\ufe8d\ufead # \ufe97\ufeae\ufe8d\ufee3\ufe90 \u060c \ufee7\ufea0\ufeaa \ufe8d\ufedf\ufee4\ufe98\ufe82\ufee3\ufeae\ufeed\ufee5 \ufef3\ufeae\ufedb\ufe92\ufeee\ufee5 \ufee3\ufeee\ufe9f\ufe94 \ufe8d\ufedf\ufeae\ufed3\ufebe \ufeed\ufe8d\ufefb\ufeb3\ufe98\ufee8\ufedc\ufe8e\ufead \ufeab\ufead\ufe8d \ufedf\ufee0\ufeae\ufee3\ufe8e\ufea9 \ufed3\ufef2 \ufe8d\ufedf\ufecc\ufef4\ufeee\ufee5 .# \ufe8d\ufedf\ufeb4\ufecc\ufeee\ufea9\ufef3\ufe94 # \ufee3\ufebc\ufeae#\ufe8d\ufefb\ufee3\ufe8e\ufead\ufe8d\ufe95 # \ufe8d\ufedf\ufe92\ufea4\ufeae\ufef3\ufee6 \ufeed\ufee7\ufed8\ufeee\ufedd \ufeed\ufee7\ufeae\ufea9\ufea9 # \ufe8d\ufedf\ufed8\ufeaa\ufeb1_ \ufecb\ufe8e\ufebb\ufee4\ufeea _\ufed3\ufee0\ufeb4\ufec4\ufef4\ufee6_ \ufe8d\ufefb\ufe91\ufeaa\ufef3\ufeea 6:29 AM - Dec 7, 2017 3 18 14 \ufe8d\ufedf\ufee4\ufe98 \ufe84\ufedf\ufed6 @BoMuhannd \"You see muslims in sheesha lounge, listen to nasheeds about Palestine and wearing scarfs around their clean shaven faces, women chanting slogans, singing songs, waving.

A double stranded RNA transfection is employed to stop the production of certain proteins by hindering the translation process. The process of transfection enables the study of gene functioning and expression, genetic mutations, and protein functioning. Transfection can be divided into two types: stable and transient. Stable transfection is a process in which the transfected genetic material remains in the genome, during which a marker gene is co-transfected that gives selective advantage to the cell. In transient transfection, the induced gene is transiently expressed and hence is not incorporated into the nuclear genome, which is further diluted or degraded during the course of mitosis.Report Overview and TOC @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/transfection-reagents-\u2026 \nThe transfection reagents and equipment market is driven by increased focus on the development of protein therapeutics, government initiatives to support health care, and increasing prevalence of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, increase in mass production of proteins is projected to propel the market in the near future. Similarly, advances in cell research, target validation and drug discovery, and technological advances such as synthetic genes, whose demand has been growing, are anticipated to contribute to the growth of the market. Furthermore, a number of patent expiries during the forecast period are expected to fuel the growth of the biosimilars market. Development of biosimilars is highly dependent on the combination of genomic, proteomic, and cytological analysis, which would involve a significant application of transfection procedures. However, risk associated with the process of inserting genetic material into the cell, high cost of the transfecting reagents and equipment, selective effectiveness of transfecting reagents, the cytotoxic effects associated with the process, and the growing applications of home brew reagents are likely to hamper the growth of the market. \nRequest brochure @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag\u2026 \nThe transfection reagents and equipment market can be segmented based on product, application, end-user, and region.

I than logged an enquiry with and to date have not have any response from them. 7. I than called the store again requesting to speak to the store manager only to be put through to Nicolas from Multimedia, he has still not been able to resolve. I have had to continuously call him with no resolve to date, 7 December 2017 If there is fraud going on at Makro, why is it being ignored and why is the consumer having to follow up with no resolve. I have purchased a television yet I have received no goods - this is fraud!!! My understanding is: 1. First of all any investigation of this sort needs to be dealt with by the store and has nothing to do with the client. 2. Second of all we have purchased / paid for a television from Makro, as clients we need to receive our item purchased.

An Irish cottage for $29.5k. REA Brady An Irish cottage for sale could be the Christmas present of your dreams. \nKillasanowel Cottage, located just outside of the Irish town of Carrick-on-Shannon, may need a bit of TLC, but this derelict cottage for sale in Ireland could also turn out to be your dream home, with a remarkably low price tag that would normally just about get you a family car in Ireland. \nYes, for only $29,500 this old Irish cottage is now on sale and is looking for its next owner to return it to its former glory. While you may never before have thought about a cottage as a Christmas present, this patch of Irish land is perfect if you\u2019re looking for a new passion project that would also bring you back to the home of your ancestors. 6 Derelict cottage for sale in Carrick on Shannon. Image: REA Brady. \nThe cottage as a Christmas present is the brainchild of auctioneer Joe Brady of REA Brady. Brady believes this cottage could turn out to be an absolute steal. The Killasanowel Cottage is extremely overgrown and not currently habitable but lies on 1.7 acres of farmland just over three miles from Carrick-on-Shannon in Co. Leitrim. \nThe two-bedroom Irish cottage is in a scenic, rural area and, Brady claims, also holds the potential to be extended to allow it to become a three-bedroom house, while retaining its authentic Irish cottage aesthetic. 6 The modern workshop in the land of this Irish cottage for sale next week. Image: REA Brady. \n\u201cFor those with hectic city lives, this could be the best present they could give their family,\u201d said auctioneer Brady. \n\u201cIt is a rural cottage in a tranquil setting that, with a lot of tender loving care, could be a family project and a home to make memories in. \n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear, this is a project, but underneath that rough exterior is a diamond,\u201d he continued. 6 The additional outhouses of the Irish cottage up for sale. Image: REA Brady. \n\u201cThis cottage is a traditional straight three-room cottage with rubble stone walls and a gabled roof, two chimneys and stone outbuildings. \n\u201cIt sits on a very large site, measuring over 1.7 acres, and to the rear is a large more modern concrete and galvanized building that with repair and completion could be a great workshop or storage building.

Elrond studies the swords that the party has collected from the troll cave , and tells Gandalf that they are ancient Elvish weapons, and also discovers Moon-letters written upon Gandalf's map. Synopsis Edit \nThe Company continues to travel towards the Lonely Mountain, but without story-telling nor songs. Bilbo notices a mountain and asks if it is the Lonely Mountain , but Balin replies otherwise, saying they are approaching the Misty Mountains . \nAs they travel, trees change to beech and oak, and Bilbo notices the scent of Elves . They hear a group singing among the trees. Some of the Elves recognize Bilbo and welcome the Company, but others tease Thorin, as Dwarves and elves don't always get along. Gandalf dismisses the laughing Elves and continue their way into Rivendell. \nThe Company arrives at the Last Homely House, where Elrond greets them. He tells Gandalf and Thorin about their swords found back in the trolls' cave. Orcrist was made in Gondolin and was called the Goblin-cleaver while Glamdring was called the Foe-hammer, and was used by the king of Gondolin . Elrond tells them that the trolls might have plundered the swords. Thorin decides to keep Orcrist, so that it may cleave Goblins once again. \nLord Elrond asks for the map and gazes long at it. He remarks that the letters in the map are moon-letters, letters that cannot be seen unless the light of the moon shines behind it. Elrond translates the message in the map as: \"Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks and the setting sun with the last light if Durin's Day will shine upon the keyhole.\" Durin's day is the first day of the Dwarves' new year (the first day of the last moon of Autumn on the threshold of Winter). \nWhen no more messages are found in the map, Elrond gives it back to Thorin. The next day, the Company leaves Rivendell and head towards the Misty Mountains.

It passed 231-198. \n\u201cAn overwhelming majority of Americans support concealed carry reciprocity. Momentum, common sense, and the facts are on our side,\u201d North Carolina Republican Rep. Richard Hudson said of his bill prior the vote in a statement. \nThe bill faces tougher odds of passing in the Senate, where it will require 60 votes to get through a procedural debate motion before a final simple majority vote. \nDemocrats slammed the bill, saying it was unfair to states with stricter gun laws to cede to states with looser gun laws. \nRanking member of the House Judiciary Committee Jerry Nadler said in a statement, \u201cThe obvious solution to the varying state laws is to continue to do what is currently done by many states, which is to choose which other state permits they will recognize. Some states, including my state of New York, have chosen not to recognize permits issued by any other state. Most states, however, have chosen to recognize permits from at least some other states \u2014 basing the choice on the strength of the standards employed by the other states. We should not disregard these determinations, which is what this bill would do.\u201d \nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn has authored the Senate version and has previously told reporters he did not feel comfortable with combining the Fix NIC\u2019s background check legislation with the concealed carry bill, saying it could torpedo the background check bill altogether. \nWhen asked by The Daily Caller about Cornyn\u2019s concerns, Hudson replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know what Senator Cornyn strategy is going to be for when he brings it forward. But I do I feel like we\u2019ve got the best chance we\u2019ve ever had to see this into law. If you look at Sen. Cornyn had an amendment in 2013 for constitutional carry and got seven Democrat yes votes that are still in the Senate.\u201d \nHe continued, \u201cAnd so it\u2019s just the mere math. We\u2019ve got to hold the Republicans and get eight more Democrats. And so you know the numbers are already pretty close starting out. So, you know, I feel good about it. Sen. Cornyn has long been a champion of Second Amendment, and I\u2019m glad to be partnering with him in this endeavor.\u201d \nDemocrats up for re-election in 2018 in states where Donald Trump won and where the Second Amendment remains popular face a tough decision on this vote. \nOne of those members is South Dakota Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp. TheDC asked Heitkamp about her thoughts on the matter after President Trump spoke to the National Rifle Association back in March and she replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know.

The Memphis signee recorded a triple-double against Benjamin Russell. Bob Crisp/The Daily Home/File Save Camille Buckhanon was selected as The Daily Home Player of the Week after leading the Talladega High School girls basketball team to a 1-1 record over the last seven days. \u201cIt came unexpectedly,\u201d Buckhanon said. \u201cI thought I started the season off right. We got the win, and I got a triple-double. Getting Player of the Week is shocking. Hopefully, I can I get Player of the Week more than twice this season and set a record for being Player of the Week. I want to thank God, my family, my teammates, my coach and the fans. I want to thank everyone that supports us.\u201d Buckhanon averaged 22 points in two games last week for the Lady Tigers. The Memphis signee recorded a triple-double with 27 points, 22 rebounds and 11 blocks in Talladega\u2019s 69-46 win over Ben Russell on Nov. 28. She also posted 17 points in a 57-46 loss to Anniston on Nov. 30. \u201cShe had an awesome game (against Ben Russell),\u201d Talladega head coach Jannie Keith said. \u201cI wish Camille could be Player of the Week every week. She is strong enough, she has the skills and there are some things that we still need to work on, but I am very proud of her. She did an outstanding job.\u201d The No. 9-ranked Lady Tigers are 2-1 on the season after defeating Handley 63-39 on Tuesday night. Buckhanon has taken on more of a leadership role this season and is pleased with the way the Lady Tigers have played so far. \u201cAs a team, we are doing well overall,\u201d Buckhanon said. \u201cWe are all sisters; it is like we are a family. The team chemistry is awesome; we just need a little bit more time together so we can grow together. Amaz (Carmichael) and Essence (Cunningham) are new to us, but overall, I think we are going to be a good team.\u201d For the past two seasons, Talladega has fallen short of accomplishing its goal of making it back to the Final Four in Birmingham. Buckhanon and the Lady Tigers have the same goal for 2017-18, but this season, Buckhanon believes they have what it takes to make it to Birmingham and leave with hardware. \u201cWe have a lot of goals set for us,\u201d Buckhanon said. \u201cWe are going to try our best to play for that ring. I expect big things from us -- the county tournament, the area tournament, we should make it back to Birmingham. That\u2019s our main goal -- to go back to Birmingham. We haven\u2019t been there since my freshman year, so hopefully, we can bring it back home with us and put Talladega on the map.\u201d Buckhanon has lofty personal goals for her senior season, including becoming the program\u2019s all-time scoring leader. That mark is held by former University of Alabama standout Jessica Merritt. Merritt scored 2,378 points for her career. \u201cI want to outscore Jessica Merritt and get a ring,\u201d Buckhanon said. \u201cI want to break a lot of records at Talladega High for boys and girls. I want to set the pace, so my younger teammates can be like, \u2018I want to outdo Camille.\u2019 I want to be that type of role model.\u201d Talladega travels to rival Sylacauga on Friday night at 6:30.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "camille buckhanon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben russell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jannie keith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "handley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "camille", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin russell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merritt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carmichael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amaz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buckhanon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cunningham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jessica merritt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "talladega", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "talladega high school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lady tigers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "talladega high", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of alabama", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sylacauga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anniston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "memphis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "birmingham", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:02.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "59df0c4fa794f7634e18928a9b4cc3ba9fd09664", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_I6WqyKS3KtmoKfb5Gu7Nd58obgBFplqQ9omG_3ULXYI0rdNc4Wuk", "site_full": "www.youtube.com", "site": "youtube.com", "site_section": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbO9bltbkYwa56nZFQx6XJg", "site_categories": ["television", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Manny Mua - YouTube", "title": "TESTING VIRAL INSTAGRAM MAKEUP WITH LAURA LEE!", "title_full": "TESTING VIRAL INSTAGRAM MAKEUP WITH LAURA LEE!", "published": "2017-09-13T23:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 97, "participants_count": 91, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.922, "main_image": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o8B9djdo8Yw/maxresdefault.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e79a85d4821ba5f5fa2db29b3756c337700f449b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_I6WqyKS3KtmoKfb5Gu7Nd58obgBFplqQ9omG_3ULXYKnnbRKNpcpAPd3UfvVT3I-", "ord_in_thread": 69, "author": "BriBri411 ManGlam", "published": "2017-11-23T01:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "You used the blotting powder as a blush", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:02.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d66d31d68f365a058830cbaf409ecba3e9d90bb2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4LzpA6zaqbAn2sJ.uKQ8GRHG2v2vtAGROg9sF413atFlqVA--", "site_full": "www.booking.com", "site": "booking.com", "site_section": "https://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/petershamhotel.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Petersham Hotel, Richmond upon Thames, UK - Booking.com ", "title": "893 Verified Hotel Reviews of Petersham Hotel | Booking.com", "title_full": "893 Verified Hotel Reviews of Petersham Hotel | Booking.com", "published": "2017-05-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 74, "participants_count": 58, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://t-ec.bstatic.com/static/img/facebook-image-else/566c7081f1deeaca39957e96365c3908f83b95af.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 105, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5d53e4854ef6ce27b670c5ef56e0764d244da7ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4LzpA6zaqbAn2sJ.uKQ8GRHG2v2vtAGROg9taemyTyDnJS6T1Vjq0UZOdHgmd84aKrP.4D42ghZqEuXqBWkcE1bjy", "ord_in_thread": 74, "author": "Mike", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "\"Enjoyable\"", "text": "\ub209 Breakfast service although satisfactory could have been more enthusiastic.\n\ub207 Well appointed classic looking hotel in a stunning location with good service & friendly staff.

At first, I\u0092ll be honest, I thought he was crazy. It sounded like a ridiculous idea.

Save Knock Iveagh A 5,000 year old royal tomb in Co Down is under threat from a broadband mast and wind turbine, locals say. \nThe neolithic burial cairn in Knock Iveagh is reputed to be the site where the ancient Irish conducted their most important rituals: not only is it where the dead are interred, but it\u2019s also where leaders were \u201cwed\u201d to the land and crowned King. \nAt ten feet tall the cairn is a well known part of the south Down landscape on the edge of the Mourne Mountains. \nNow a broadband mast has been installed close to the ancient tomb. \u2014 DagmaraShannonPhotog (@DagmaraShannon) November 25, 2017 \nThe construction of a wind turbine 300 feet away from the tomb was stopped in October for 28 day pending a review, but building recently started up again \u2013 to the fury of campaigners. \nThe Friends of Knock Iveagh group say the mast has been built illegally and have taken to fundraising for a legal challenge against Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council \u2013 which they say should have both installations removed. \nWriting on their GoFundMe page the group asserts: \u201cIf allowed to proceed, these developments will utterly destroy the setting and environment of this magical historical place. We cannot let our shared heritage be destroyed and we must ensure that the public bodies with the duty to protect it step up to the mark and do their jobs. If mistakes have been made, it is their job to put things right and we want to make sure they do.\u201d @megalithophile Are you familiar with Knock Iveagh in County Down? https://t.co/jWYxFEvR4s Currently under threat #saveknockiveagh \nThe organization has prominent backers, including local legislators and groups such as the Annaclone Historical Society. But so far it\u2019s only raised $2,500 of the estimated $26,000 it needs to launch a legal challenge. \nArmagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council were approached for comment but have yet to respond.

The first one passed the House, failed the Senate, this one, both tax bills have passed the House and the Senate, we're on track with that, and then next year we're going to have to get back at entitlement reform.\" \nRyan specifically mentioned Medicare as being the \"biggest entitlement that's got to have reform.\" \n\"Really, what it is is we need to convert our health care system to a patient-centered system, so that people have more choices, we have more competition,\" Ryan later said. \nRyan also noted that, in addition to health care, the GOP plans to work on reforming the US welfare system. \n\"We think it's important to get people from welfare to work,\" Ryan said. \"We have a welfare system that's basically trapping people in poverty and effectively paying people not to work, and we've got to work on that.\" \nIndependent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders responded to Ryan's comments critically on Twitter, arguing that the Republican Party planned to pay for its tax bill with cuts to entitlements. \n\"There it is. Paul Ryan just admitted that after providing $1 trillion in tax breaks to the top 1% and large corporations, Republicans will try to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and help for the most vulnerable Americans,\" Sanders wrote.

Die von Privatanlegern eingeworbenen qualifizierten Nachrangdarlehen sollen insgesamt mindestens 8.700.000 Euro betragen. Anleger, die noch in diesem Jahr zeichnen, erhalten einmalig einen Fr\u00fchzeichnerbonuszins in H\u00f6he von 1% des Anlagebetrages. \nAufgrund der guten Platzierung konnte das vierte Solarkraftwerk \u00fcbernommen werden. Die Anlage Beuna mit einer Leistung von 3,7 Megawatt und einem Kaufpreis von 1,2 Millionen Euro. Das Portfolio des SunAsset 7 umfasst aktuell 4 produzierende Solarkraftwerke mit einer Gesamtleistung von 10,1 Megawatt, die die Zinsen f\u00fcr die Anleger erwirtschaften. F\u00fcnf weitere Kraftwerke mit rund 34 Megawatt Leistung stehen ebenfalls zur \u00dcbernahme bereit. \nDie Verm\u00f6gensanlage Wattner SunAsset 7 ist sicherheitsorientiert ausgerichtet: 20 Jahre lang werden deutsche Solarkraftwerke mit gesetzlich garantierter Verg\u00fctung gehalten und betrieben. Es werden ausschlie\u00dflich bereits errichtete und produzierende Kraftwerke \u00fcbernommen - f\u00fcr SunAsset 7 gibt es daher keinerlei Risiken aus Planung und Errichtung. Dar\u00fcber hinaus hat Wattner Eigenkapital in H\u00f6he von 500.000 Euro eingezahlt, welches bis nach R\u00fcckzahlung der Darlehen an die Anleger in der Verm\u00f6gensanlage verbleibt und ebenfalls als Sicherheit dient. \nZeichnungen sind ab einem Darlehensbetrag von 3.000 Euro m\u00f6glich, ohne Agio. Die Zinsen beginnen mit 4,5% im Jahr 2017 und steigen in drei Stufen bis auf 6,0% j\u00e4hrlich. Insgesamt erhalten die Anleger 105% Zinsen.
