The growing spread of drug resistant strains of typhoid is a major threat, not just to individuals but also to our efforts to control the disease.

Scott Barbour / Getty Images Members of Parliament celebrate at Parliament House on Thursday in Canberra, Australia, after the approval of same-sex marriage. Michael Masters / Getty Images \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of registered voters and ensured that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\" Copyright 2017 NPR.

Whether it's those mate-attracting antlers or their ability to exist just about anywhere, these circumpolar caribou have inspired plenty of songs, books and film ( Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, 'Twas the night before Christmas ), and now they're inspiring an H-Town hike.\nBayou City Outdoors is back with its fourth annual Reindeer Romp , bringing a little bit of Christmas cheer to the holiday season. There's plenty to do this time of year, but most of it involves holiday weight gain, a drain on the checking account, or a chance to embarrass yourself at the company Christmas party. So it's refreshing to find something that actually is fun to do and also good for you.\nRelated Stories After Trekking 150 Miles Through Houston Parks, These Are the Coolest Views \"It really is.

It's the perfect event to do with a friend, for meeting a possible love interest, or as a great couples date. \"We attract the whole gamut.

The model and university student denies any intent to insult. \nTurkish media reported that the tweet, which has since been erased, said: \"I got my period on the morning of the July 15 martyrs' day. I'm marking the day by bleeding as a representation of the martyrs' blood.\" \nThe posting caused uproar on social media. \nA court must accept the indictment before a trial date is set. \nRunner-up Asli Sumen was given the title and represented Turkey at the Miss World competition in China.

He went into voluntary exile in 1854. Constance Garnett (1861-1946) was an English translator whose translations of 70 nineteenth century Russian classics introduced them to the English speaking public. John Reed (1887-1920) was an American journalist and activist who wrote Ten Days that Shook the World, and according to the excellent Wikipedia article on Smoke provided the Introduction. Smoke was published in Russia in 1867 during the emancipation of the serfs, and first published in English in 1906. The novel is set mostly in the Russian community in Baden-Baden, and is partly a scathing satire of the 'Slavophils' and the 'Young Russians', and partly a moving account of a young man's love for two women. The source text was taken from the University of Adelaide ebook library, and checked against The Modern Library 1919 edition published in New York.

The rally following the 1.7100 low does begin to look constructive, but only a clear break above resistance at 1.7342 will indicate a corrective low already could be in place.\n\nWe do think the correction from 1.7409 has been very short both in points and time and would expect a larger correction as wave (4), but it might be that the complexity just is rising.\n\nR3: 1.7342\n\nR2: 1.7319\n\nR1: 1.7264\n\nPivot: 1.7195\n\nS1: 1.7157\n\nS3: 1.7100\n\nTrading recommendation:\n\nOur short position from 1.7450 has been stopped at 1.7250 for a 200 pip profit. We will stay neutral for now. \nIchimoku indicator analysis of USDX for December 7, 2017 \n\nThe US dollar index has broken out of the bearish Kumo cloud resistance. Trend is changing to bullish as long as price is above 93-92.50. The index has started making higher highs and higher lows on the 4 hour chart.\n\n\n\nBlack lines - bullish channel \n\nThe Dollar index is trading above the Ichimoku cloud. Price is inside the bullish short-term channel. Support is found at 93.30 while the resistance lies at 93.80. Trend is bullish.\n\n\n\nOn a weekly basis, the US dollar index has started the bounce exactly as expected. Price is now approaching the Tenkan-sen resistance at 93.80-93.90. A weekly close above this level will be a bullish sign. Next important resistance is at 94.40. Weekly support that must hold now is at 93. A break below 93 will be a very bearish sign for the index.\n\nIchimoku indicator analysis of gold for December 7, 2017 \n\nGold price has reached our target area of $1,255-50. Price is showing bullish divergence signs in the 4 hour chart. Trend remains bearish as price is still below the Ichimoku cloud and both the Tenkan- and Kijun-sen.\n\n\n\nGold price is making lower lows and lower highs. Trend is bearish. I believe it is time for bears to take some profits or tighten their stops. I believe a strong bounce towards at least $1,270 is imminent. Support is at $1,255-50. Resistance lies at $1,262.

Therefore, I opted to try Infini RF Microneedling for 4 sessions over the course of a year because it was hard to take time off every 6-8 weeks. However, I only see little improvement (if any...) I think spreading out the treatments will not affect the results as Infini is supposed to help with collagen production for up to 6 months to 1 year. I have mixed scars and don't know what treatments I should try next... Too scared to try TCA peel/ cross at home even after reading the FAQ (again, Asian skin type...). Would I be a good candidates for TCA peel/ cross? Please help!\nI live in the Bay Area and there are not a lot of doctors to offer TCA peel/ cross and/or subcision... I read some forums here but feel like SoCal have more options and no one seem have to have found a good doctor who performs a wide range of treatments here. Can anyone recommend a good doctor in the Bay Area? I went to Dr. Ransom for Infini. He's nice and doesn't seem to be interested in checking the progress and just performs the procedure... don't really feel like going back to him. But, someone said he does offer TCA cross... Also wonder if I should try 2 more Infini for a total of 6 sessions to see the difference... Right now considering if I should give Dr. Emer a visit even though he's expensive. Does anyone know what is the price difference btw Dr. Emer in Beverly Hills and Dr. Rullan in SD?

Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box \" although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action. \n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" \nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. \nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" \nTrump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \n\"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\" About Us", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "catherine lucey", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron david miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilan goldenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill galston", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for a new american security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east security program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faith and freedom coalition", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:44.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d9774740e1a04105ed496ca002b8c79607963879", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWSUKtEk4sQ4venLwVj1tyMTmeRByl9YgK.MF3UtZS.4p12yG2JpMNSQB5q3lj4X9opLRVcKPFvgxGzDxCZrJtV99qh_SGMrNwQFkVVU4ncBIMI4mb3qvEuwElqDxPNGrQ7nCZdidFP8eT7W_BUrp5", "site_full": "www.investopedia.com", "site": "investopedia.com", "site_section": "http://www.investopedia.com/feedbuilder/feed/getFeed?feedName=rss_headline", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "rss_headline", "title": "Budgeting Tips for Essential Fixed Spending", "title_full": "Budgeting Tips for Essential Fixed Spending", "published": "2017-12-06T23:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.investopedia.com/image/jpeg/1511991719873/millennial_155785966.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 854, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d9774740e1a04105ed496ca002b8c79607963879", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWSUKtEk4sQ4venLwVj1tyMTmeRByl9YgK.MF3UtZS.4p12yG2JpMNSQB5q3lj4X9opLRVcKPFvgxGzDxCZrJtV99qh_SGMrNwQFkVVU4ncBIMI4mb3qvEuwElqDxPNGrQ7nCZdidFP8eT7W_BUrp5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Amy Fontinelle", "published": "2017-12-06T23:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "Budgeting Tips for Essential Fixed Spending", "text": "10 years \n$21,494 \nIf you have more than you need in your emergency fund, consider doing a cash-in refinance to lower your monthly payment and get your loan paid off faster. With any refinance, you\u2019ll pay closing costs, so your savings will need to be significant enough to make up for those costs. \nRenting out a spare room or basement to a housemate, or even renting out storage space in your garage or basement, could provide additional income to make your mortgage more affordable or pay it off faster. (See Ways To Be Mortgage-Free Faster , Tips For Renting Out Your Home and When And When Not To Refinance Your Mortgage .) Rent \nEach time your lease is up and your rent increases, shop around to see what the market looks like. Could you save money by moving (and come out ahead after the hassle and cleaning costs)? Could you get a nicer unit for the same price? Consider renting out a room in someone\u2019s home instead of renting an entire apartment, condo or house. Roommates can obviously help you reduce your rent payment. In addition, they can reduce your utility and grocery expenses by taking advantage of economies of scale. \nConsider ways that changing your rental location could cut other expenses in your life. For example, moving closer to work or moving near public transit could reduce your commuting costs; moving to an energy-efficient unit could reduce your heating and cooling bills. And working as a building manager could allow you to get free or reduced rent. (See 6 Tips For Renting An Apartment . ) Cell Phone \nInstead of buying a plan from one of the big four carriers and constantly upgrading to the latest and greatest phone, consider buying a less expensive plan from a smaller carrier and getting an older model of a phone that has proven to be well-liked and reliable, such as an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy. Discount carriers abound! There\u2019s Virgin Mobile, RedPocket, Consumer Cellular, Tracfone, Cricket, Republic Wireless, Total Wireless, Wirefly, Boost Mobile, MetroPCS, Ting, FreedomPop, H2O Wireless, Lyca Mobile, US Mobile, Xfinity Mobile, Twigby, GoSmart and more. \nThese carriers piggyback on the networks of the big four, meaning you can get similar service for much less. Call quality will be the same, but data speeds and coverage may be slightly lower. Many people find these to be minor inconveniences in exchange for huge savings. As going with an older, less expensive handset, keep in mind that today\u2019s latest technology can be yours for a drastically reduced price in two to three years. Vehicles \nIf you have an auto loan, look into refinancing it at a lower rate and decreasing your loan term to save money on interest. Look beyond the big banks; you may find better rates at credit unions. You could also save on interest by increasing your monthly payment above the required amount to pay off your loan faster. (See 5 Best Companies to Refinance Your Car and How Interest Rates Work on Car Loans .) If you can\u2019t afford your car, you\u2019re not stuck with it. (See Options for When You Can No Longer Afford Your Car .) \nCombine errands to save time, gas and wear and tear on your vehicle. Go to the grocery store on the way home from work, or do all your errands for the week on Saturday morning. Walk or ride your bike to do nearby errands or visit friends, if possible. (Also, check out Car Maintenance Tips That Help You Save Money .) Shop around for car insurance annually, and if you don\u2019t drive frequently, consider a pay-as-you-drive insurance company such as MetroMile or ditching your car altogether in favor of using a car-sharing service like ZipCar, if it\u2019s available in your area. Student Loans \nRefinancing your student loans may lower your interest rate, making your monthly payment smaller and reducing your long-term borrowing costs \u2013 unless you extend the loan term. Be aware that the only way to refinance federal student loans is with a private lender, which means losing federal student loan protections such as loan discharge upon the borrower\u2019s death (which may be important to you if you are married), income-based repayment, and federal deferment and forbearance that can help you through a layoff. (See Student Loans: Paying Off Your Debt Faster and Student Loan Refinancing: The Pros and Cons .) Life Insurance \nPerhaps the best way to save money on life insurance that not enough people know about \u2013 or take advantage of \u2013 is using an insurance broker. A life insurance broker who is licensed to sell policies with a dozen or more companies that are highly rated by A.M. Best, meaning that they have the financial stability to pay their customers\u2019 claims, may be able to find you a better rate for your age and health circumstances than you could find on your own. Each life insurer uses slightly different standards for evaluating applicants and deciding what to charge them. A broker might know which companies will offer you the best rates even if you\u2019ve had cancer in the past or used to be a regular smoker.

Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray \" and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat \" overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms \" known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" \" with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles \" not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death \" but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening \" that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens. \n___ \nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Hours later, another woman said Franken inappropriately squeezed \"a handful of flesh\" on her waist while posing for a photo with her in 2009. That brought the number of women alleging misconduct by Franken to at least eight. \nFranken, the former comedian who made his name on \"Saturday Night Live,\" faces a chorus of calls to step aside, and Democratic senators said they expected their liberal colleague to resign. \n\"Enough is enough,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. \"We need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is OK, none of it is acceptable, and we, as elected leaders, should absolutely be held to a higher standard.\" \nGillibrand was the first to call for Franken's resignation on Wednesday, but a torrent of Democrats quickly followed. \n\"I'm shocked and appalled by Sen. Franken's behavior,\" said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state. \"It's clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time. It's time for him to step aside.\" \nThough the writing appeared to be on the wall, Franken's departure was not certain. A tweet posted Wednesday evening on Franken's Twitter account said: \"Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate.\" \nLate in the day, Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York added his voice. \n\"I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately,\" Schumer said. \nThe resignation demands came in rapid succession even though Franken on Wednesday vehemently denied the new accusation that came from a former Democratic congressional aide, who said he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006. \nThe woman, who was not identified, told Politico that Franken pursued her after her boss had left and she was collecting her belongings. She said that she ducked to avoid his lips and that Franken told her: \"It's my right as an entertainer.\" \nFranken, in a statement, said the idea he would claim such conduct as a right was \"preposterous.\" \nBut it was soon clear that his position had become untenable. \nFellow Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who spoke to Franken, wrote on Twitter, \"I am confident he will make the right decision.\" \nThe pressure only mounted Tuesday, when Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., resigned after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. Rep Ruben Kihuen, D-Nev., faces pressure to resign as well over allegations reported by Buzzfeed that he repeatedly propositioned a former campaign worker. \nWhile Franken apparently is departing, Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore could be arriving, if he prevails in a Dec. 12 special election. Multiple women have accused the 70-year-old Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were teens and he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s. If Moore is elected, it could create a political nightmare for Republicans, who have promised an ethics probe. \nA national conversation about sexual harassment has intensified this fall after the heavily publicized case of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of many acts of sexual misconduct, including rape, by actresses and other women. Just on Wednesday, Time magazine named as its person of the year the \"silence breakers\" \" women who have come forward on sexual harassment. \nPunishment has been swift for leaders in entertainment, media and sports while members of Congress have tried to survive the onslaught of allegations. \nFranken already faced a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into previous claims by several other women that he groped them or sought to forcibly kiss them. \nThe allegations began in mid-November when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan. \nOther allegations followed, including a woman who says Franken put his hand on her buttocks as they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Two women told the Huffington Post that Franken squeezed their buttocks at political events during his first campaign for the Senate in 2008. A fourth woman, an Army veteran, alleged Franken cupped her breast during a photo on a USO tour in 2003. \nFranken has apologized for his behavior but has also disputed some of the allegations. \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Juliet Linderman in Washington and Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Alabama, contributed to this report.

But that's not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for   by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge. \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" \nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n\" Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n\" Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n\" Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C. \nFor the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point. For Medicaid recipients, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points.

This is a complex suggestion, very much open to discussion and feedback and further suggestions.\nAcquisition of veiled rivens remains unchanged. Veiled rivens are tied to one of primary, secondary or melee. Unveiling rivens has two options for the player to choose from: The current mechanic of completing the challenge for the riven to be assigned to a random weapon with a random number of random stats (see below for stat changes) Paying a set amount of kuva (10k?) to assign the riven to a specific weapon. The riven will initially have 1 random stat (positive only, see below). Stats of rivens are tied to weapon disposition in one additional way to the current one: The number of stats on a riven cannot be greater than its disposition (see alternatives). A riven mod can have up to 1 less negative than the number of positive stats (i.e. max 2 negative with 5 total) Re-rolling of rivens allows up to (disposition - 1) stats to be fixed (remain unchanged with this roll), at an additional cost of (roll cost x number of stats fixed / max number of stats). If a riven is unveiled by method 2, if its disposition is greater than 1, and if it currently has less stats than it is allowed, rolling it will add one further stat. Trading of rivens will always make the riven veiled again (this will probably get me murdered but the riven market is atrocious currently, see linked thread above). Although with the complete riven system overhaul perhaps the trade system may not need changing. Legacy rivens, not sure what to do there.. Make all existing rivens veiled? Obviously the value of all good rivens for good weapons will skyrocket even further with a system change like this one if they remain in the game. Is that necessarily a bad thing? Alternatives:\nNumber of stats is capped at 3 for disposition <3. Capped at 5 otherwise. Rolling allows only 1 or 2 stats to be fixed (at double cost) Rolling allows 1 additional stat to be fixed every 5 rolls with +100% cost per fixed stat.

He went into voluntary exile in 1854. Constance Garnett (1861-1946) was an English translator whose translations of 70 nineteenth century Russian classics introduced them to the English speaking public. John Reed (1887-1920) was an American journalist and activist who wrote Ten Days that Shook the World, and according to the excellent Wikipedia article on Smoke provided the Introduction. Smoke was published in Russia in 1867 during the emancipation of the serfs, and first published in English in 1906. The novel is set mostly in the Russian community in Baden-Baden, and is partly a scathing satire of the 'Slavophils' and the 'Young Russians', and partly a moving account of a young man's love for two women. The source text was taken from the University of Adelaide ebook library, and checked against The Modern Library 1919 edition published in New York. I have silently corrected typos, curled quotes, replaced italics, diacritics, and scene breaks, and made changes to spelling, punctuation, and hyphenation using the American version of oxforddictionaries.com.

I have so many reviews and looks I want to show you all. \nAgain the palette comes in this nice sturdy box very sleek and well protected and I\u2019m glad it does because whoever delivered it just shoved it through my letter box . They could have completely ruined the make up luckily it was ok but I\u2019m not impressed with the courier . \n\nOn one side of the card you get a brief intro to who Deck Of Scarlet are . \n\nThen on the reverse side of the card you get an introduction to the you tuber who helped collaborate that months palette and this months palette Is December/January I believe , \n\nThis is it how it comes in the packaging as you can see it is well protected which really did save all the powder products from crumbling . \n\nYou also get 2 liners products in this palette there is a eye liner which I\u2019m so glad about as I\u2019m nearly out of my cult favourite which is my Avon super shock gel eye liner I believe this is a brown eyeliner called twilight and a lovely nude lip liner called Belle. \nI do really love the packaging my only gripe well I have 2 really and one of them I have had to put in a complaint with to Deck Of Scarlet I\u2019ll talk about that first . For some reason they have changed the packaging and what I mean by that the 3 palettes I have had before this had a flap that went over the lip products so the powder products would not get into the lip creams and ruin them yet this month they haven\u2019t done that so the more you use the palette the more the fallout of the powders is going to get into the lip creams and they will become un-usable which is very disappointing. I\u2019m going to have to cut the plastic off that comes to protect the make up and make it so that no powders can leak in but it\u2019s a huge inconvenience and if this is going to be their regular packaging then as much as I love getting these palettes I won\u2019t buy anymore as half the product is wasted.  Anyway rant over I didn\u2019t mean to go on for as long as that . The other thing I dont really like is the palette is white I understand why it\u2019s been done because it looks pleasing to the eye but eventually it is just going to get covered in make up which is not so pleasing to the eye . That I can live with though the complete change of packaging although Deck Of Scarlet have put in a bigger mirror I much prefer the way the packaging was previously. \n\nThe palette looks amazing itself like i said earlier in the post I love that gold digga shade it really is unique and so festive. I definitely want to do a look with that soon . I love the fact that there is a nice cream base to put all over the lid and then you have a nice purple to smoke it out it\u2019s different to the typical grey or black that is put in a palette . The highlight is very pink I\u2019m not sure that will work for my skin tone but I\u2019ll certainly give it a try and the bronzer might be a bit dark but I believe that will make a great transition shade for me so will definitely get used . The lip products I definitively love the nude shade that will get used the most with the lip liner I\u2019m really not sure I will use the hot pink as they don\u2019t suit me at all . Maybe I can try and mix the 2 lipsticks and customise them see how that looks. \n\nThese are the 2 liners you can\u2019t really see them they are quite thin but I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how they perform . \n\nSo onto the good stuff I can\u2019t show you any looks as I\u2019ve not done any yet what I can do is show you how they swatch and what the pigmentation is like and my overall thoughts first impression wise then give you more a review later on . \n\nSwatches - \nThe first 2 swatches are of the lip liner in the shade Belle which is a gorgeous nude shade which will go beautifully with the lip cream then we have the brown eyeliner in twilight as you can probably see from the swatch it\u2019s very creamy so I\u2019m not sure how that will go onto the waterline and lash line whether it will smudge . \n\nEyeshadows - \nThe first shadow I thought was a cream as that is how it looks in the pan but it\u2019s more of a yellow toned cream which is nice I would only be using it to set my mac paint pot and make sure the rest of the eyeshadows go on seamlessly anyway and this is in the shade Dream. \nNext is my favourite that is the shade Gold Digger it just swatches beautifully I can see me wearing this a lot especially through Christmas with a nice red lip. \nFinally in the eyeshadows is Luna and I have to admit I didn\u2019t think I was going to like it because traditionally I avoid dark shadows like this but I can\u2019t wait to try this shadow out . \nHighlighter -\nAs I thought earlier I think this is way too dark for my skin tone I could mix it with one of my paler highlighters and get a customisable highlight but that defeats the purpose your supposed to be able to work from just the one palette . I will try it and see how it looks if I don\u2019t like the look of it I\u2019ll use it as an eyeshadow so it won\u2019t go wasted . I think it will look really nice as an eyeshadow. The highlighter is called prosecco . \nBronzer - \nThe bronzer is called dusk and originally I thought it might be too muddy for my skin tone as I\u2019m so fair but I think it will work . It\u2019s going to make a lovely transition eyeshadow also which is good as I like to have that in the palette and won\u2019t have to get that from another palette . \nLip products - \nPinky Promise  - I love this nude pink that is in the palette this will be definitely be worn the most . \nSass Queen - as I\u2019ve talked about in previous Deck Of Scarlet palettes I\u2019m not a fan of hot pinks this looks much darker in the pan so I might be able to mix Pinky Promise and Sass Queen just to make it a little bit lighter . \nOverall thoughts - \nAs I mentioned earlier I\u2019m really not happy with the packaging I only did the swatches and the fall out from the powder we\u2019re falling into the lip products until I covered it with the sheet of plastic so I\u2019m going to have to do this every time I use the palette which I\u2019m not happy about. \nSuggestions for further Deck Of Scarlet Palettes . \nI would like them to put that flap back in so the lip creams and powder products don\u2019t mix and I would love the next you tuber to be more adventurous with the lip creams it\u2019s been all nudes the last 4 palettes I would love a red and maybe a dark berry to be in the palette . We are in winter after all there are only so many nudes you can have in your collection . \nOther then the faults that I have pointed out and there is more this month then ever before I\u2019m really happy with the shadows there really creamy, the bronzer is really nice , the highlight is nice but it may be for darker skin tones then me as a highlight . The lip products as always are really nice and creamy and I love the liners . I do definitely think this is worth the money you get a lot of product I just think Deck Of Scarlet made a mistake by not sticking to the original packaging . \nThanks for reading as always ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "amy rose walker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scarlet", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sass queen", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "belle", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:47.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "568419ed727b938329f45b5be9966b272ce6d1f6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR4WbPvBJfyDdGuUkELafiDW0PQ6C9iUXw_UkdxW8YaWd_kD4UQf6yk1zodLxay8tk5oTSum21FVVaGRRRN7RrQLH8KA1WsgVU-", "site_full": "www.talkbass.com", "site": "talkbass.com", "site_section": "https://www.talkbass.com/forums/strings-bg.16/", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health"], "section_title": "Strings [BG] | TalkBass.com", "title": "Too many winds around the post? | Page 2", "title_full": "Too many winds around the post? | Page 2 | TalkBass.com", "published": "2017-12-03T14:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.talkbass.com/data/avatars/m/252/252285.jpg?1512125563", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31197, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "51a64e6ccd8b7bee40ebf0ed8290aa0329e98545", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR4WbPvBJfyDdGuUkELafiDW0PQ6C9iUXw_UkdxW8YaWd_kD4UQf6yk1zodLxay8tk5oTSum21FVVaGRRRN7RrQPSozvlPPXyDCaloEncYm6Q--", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "michael_t", "published": "2017-12-03T16:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "petrus61 said: \u2191 Any reason you're using more wraps on the higher strings?

The Apostle Peter is exhorting his readers, and us, in the sure and certain knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ\u2019s return, that we must be ready. He will return in glory and set everything as it should be in his final judgement in righteousness. As we prepare for his second advent, it is a time to take stock of ourselves and to be at peace with the Lord by being fully forgiven and reconciled to him. Are you morally spotless and living a blameless life without blemish? Are you thus growing \u201cin the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ\u201d (2 Pet 3:18a)? \nIn recent years, many folks have tried to shift away from the penitential side of Advent; however, today\u2019s lectionary readings certainly remind us that we must diligently examine ourselves, confess our sins, repent and return to the Lord, and engage in amendment of life. Sometimes he calls us to repentance very subtly, sometimes very directly, and sometimes with a sledgehammer approach. \nToday\u2019s reading from the Prophet Amos recounts God having taken horrific actions (e.g., lack of rain, lack of food, blight and mildew, locust, pestilence, death by the sword, overthrowing cities, and having been plucked out of the fire like a burning stick) to get his covenant people\u2019s attention. He reminds them that they are completely dependent upon him and must repent and return to him. Unfortunately, the sadly repeated refrain throughout the passage is, \u201cyet you did not return to me, declares the Lord\u201d (Amos 4:6b, 8b, 9c, 10c, 11b). We are called to no longer be a stiff necked people who won\u2019t submit to the Lord\u2019s sovereignty, but rather to repent and return to him without spot or blemish. \u201cPrepare to meet your God, O Israel!\u201d (Amos 4:12b). May the Lord Jesus Christ grant you a most holy Advent season fully reconciled to him, at peace with him, and joyfully awaiting his return to reign in glory, as you simultaneously prepare to celebrate his first advent at Christmas. Amen. \nRev.

MyTravelers for Injured Employees is a secure, web-based tool that provides injured employees with information needed to manage their claim from start to finish on their mobile device or computer. \nMyTravelers for Injured Employees provides a variety of resources in a centralized location to help guide an injured employee throughout the claim process, including: Customized content tailored to each injured employee\u2019s specific needs; Fast and easy search capabilities to find health care providers; Notifications of status updates; Easy-to-understand information related to reimbursement for lost wages and payments made to medical providers; and Real-time electronic communication between injured employees and claim professionals. \nThe tool can be accessed by visiting mytravelers.com. The Institutes Revamps MyPath Website to Connect More College Students to Career Opportunities \nCollege students can now learn more about careers in the risk management and insurance field and directly apply to job opportunities through the completely redesigned InsureMyPath.org website. \nGrounded in data-driven research and user feedback, the newly designed site is aimed at high school and college students, encouraging them to consider careers in risk management and insurance (RMI) and providing them with resources to navigate college, internship and career searches. The new website also features stories from RMI professionals and links to relevant internship and career postings on Indeed.com. \nThe site serves as an important education link, helping to close the critical talent gap expected in the United States insurance industry. This industry currently employs 2.6 million people, but will need to hire 100,000 people every year for the next decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So even if every one of the approximately 14,000 RMI students around the world joins the industry after graduating, there will still be many unfilled positions. \nBy revamping and relaunching the site, The Institutes, which have been dedicated to improving and advancing education in the RMI industry for more than a century, have signaled an ongoing commitment to the future of this industry. \nVisit the new InsureMyPath.org and please share your feedback through LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook. Capgemini Opens Global Delivery Center in South Carolina \nCapgemini announced it opened a new delivery center at The BullStreet District in Columbia, S.C., known as the largest urban redevelopment project east of the Mississippi River. Capgemini will service its insurance clients interested in implementations of Duck Creek Technologies software but will also provide services on other insurance and cross-industry implementations. The new Columbia delivery center is its first location in the state of South Carolina with 125 employees already assigned to the center. \nThe new delivery center is designed to operate in the new world of DevOps and the distributed Agile model. With the objective of fostering collaboration through technology and workplace design, it is a future-forward model for digital delivery. \nCapgemini acquired Columbia-based TCube Solutions in February 2017 due to its focus on Property and Casualty (P&C) insurance software and services to complement its alliance partnership with Duck Creek Technologies. TCube Solutions employees have been folded into Capgemini and as the delivery center\u2019s work expands, it is expected that additional IT resources will be hired. \nThe new office will be in the First Base Building, the largest private office building constructed in downtown Columbia since 2009, and adjacent to Spirit Communications Park stadium, home of Minor League Baseball\u2019s Columbia Fireflies.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "capgemini business news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capgemini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mytravelers for injured employees", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "insuremypath.org", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter and facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tcube solutions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bureau of labor statistics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connect more college students to career opportunities  college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "p&c", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rmi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia fireflies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "travelers companies, inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minor league baseball", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capgemini opens global delivery center in south carolina  capgemini", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "s.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bullstreet district", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mississippi river", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south carolina", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:47.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a744030677d19c90ca3957fe3abb3dbc5b3c2f03", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQBt.zJBM7pyqAnpFZ8mbo7DspoLXjBnUbcnGPXOeO9I_mP7RZ9ryE3Dd6ZmCR.qzTnaUUH8teB9b3LI0Bv3gpTe6hCCicNkV5kuV2fi9stAgniJljSKwdzNW.pV8TBlmxUS1RxAhLXNZ_u306Dup4w8R1bVgCdECUWouqOEgeTwF2PqG6yQue2JJnd1jG_wcg-", "site_full": "forums.macrumors.com", "site": "macrumors.com", "site_section": "http://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macrumors-com-news-discussion.4/", "site_categories": ["mac_support", "tech"], "section_title": "MacRumors.com News Discussion | MacRumors Forums", "title": "iPhone 8 and Apple Watch Series 3 Orders Now 'Preparing for Shipment' Ahead of September 22 Delivery 11", "title_full": "iPhone 8 and Apple Watch Series 3 Orders Now 'Preparing for Shipment' Ahead of September 22 Delivery | Page 11 | MacRumors Forums", "published": "2017-09-18T23:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forums.macrumors.com/data/avatars/m/0/3.jpg?1433105889", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1213, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "244976673823f1b5ee1eb87759bbcc0c105fe731", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQBt.zJBM7pyqAnpFZ8mbo7DspoLXjBnUbcnGPXOeO9I_mP7RZ9ryE3Dd6ZmCR.qzTnaUUH8teB9b3LI0Bv3gpTe6hCCicNkV5kuV2fi9stAgniJljSKwdzNW.pV8TBlmxUS1RxAhLXNZ_u306Dup4w8R1bVgCdECUWouqOEgeTwF2PqG6yQue2LOhmfMR5ws5sNkuGWptQcQrYlF1ZwZem", "ord_in_thread": 15, "author": "Relentless Power", "published": "2017-12-07T09:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "laudern said: \u2191 In what world does a large red dot look fitting on a watch????

categories of expenses you have to pay that aren\u2019t the same from month to month: groceries, utilities, pet care, healthcare and more. Groceries \nFind the least expensive stores in your area and make it a point do to the majority of your shopping there. Make a weekly meal plan based on what\u2019s on sale and shop with a list and a budget for that particular trip that keeps your monthly budget in mind. Add up the cost of each item as you put it in your cart; put nonessentials back before you check out if you\u2019ve exceeded your budget. Also, many of us have stockpiles of food in the freezer and pantry that we\u2019ve seen so many times, we\u2019ve forgotten they\u2019re there \u2013 items like canned beans, pasta, soups and sauces. Determine how to incorporate these items into your meals and you\u2019ll get a break on the cost of groceries. (For related reading, see Secrets You Should Know When Buying Groceries and Top 7 M oney-Saving Tips for Buying Groceries .) Electricity \nThe older and larger a device, the more savings you\u2019ll achieve by unplugging it \u2013 not merely turning it off \u2013 when you\u2019re not using it. Smart power strips and remote-controlled power strips can also help you save money. When replacing an appliance, choose an Energy Star model. Turn off your lights when you\u2019re not using them (like your dad taught you), especially if they\u2019re incandescent bulbs, and consider switching to compact fluorescent or LED bulbs in the light fixtures you use the most. Ask yourself if you really need that drink fridge in the garage that works 24/7 to cool the couple of drinks you consume each day. (For more ideas, see Best 7 Money Saving Tips for Your Electric Bill .) \nKeeping your thermostat slightly lower in the winter and slightly higher in the summer than you\u2019d optimally like will reduce your heating and cooling costs, and you\u2019ll probably get used to the temperature change after a few days. Using ceiling fans or blankets \u2013 and wearing warmer or cooler clothing \u2013 are a lot less expensive than using more energy. Change filters regularly to keep your heating and cooling system working efficiently and prolong its life. Pet Care \nPets can be incredibly inexpensive for the amount of comfort and joy they add to our lives \u2013 until they\u2019re not. While the pricing for veterinary procedures is much more transparent than the pricing for human medical procedures, if your pet gets cancer or develops kidney disease or a heart problem, the money you spend on treatment can quickly exceed $10,000. A good pet insurance policy and preventive care can cost a bit more up front but can save you thousands in the long run by ensuring your pet receives the best possible healthcare. For smaller costs like food and cat litter, stock up during sales. And if your vet occasionally has specials such as 20% off dental cleaning all month or 15% off bloodwork all month, try to schedule your pet\u2019s procedures during those times. (Learn more in How Does Pet Insurance Work? and What You Need To Know About Pet Wellness Plans .) Home Maintenance, Insurance and Property Taxes \nThe best way to save money on home maintenance is to actually do it and not put it off forever. If some shingles fly off your roof during a storm, reattach them as soon as possible to prevent a leak from damaging your attic and ceilings. If the gutters are stuffed full of leaves, clean them out so your gutters will carry water away from your home as intended. \nYou can sometimes cut your homeowners insurance bill by shopping around for the best value, raising your deductible or bundling your homeowners with other policies, such as your auto policy. Your insurance company may also offer discounts for an alarm system with central monitoring (a discount that could help offset the cost of monitoring you were going to pay for anyway), replacing your roof or upgrading electrical and plumbing systems. \nProperty taxes are based largely on the value of your property. Certain additions and improvements can increase your tax bill; so can an inaccurate assessment. Know the tax implications before undertaking a major home improvement project and make sure the assessed value of your property is reasonable on your tax bill; appeal if it isn\u2019t. (See Your Property Tax Assessment: What Does It Mean? and 5 Tricks For Lowering Your Property Tax .) Medical and Dental Care \nCarrying health insurance and sticking with in-network providers is generally the simplest way to cut your medical bills. (See 7 Mistakes to Avoid When Buying Health Insurance .) Beyond that, there\u2019s more you can do if you\u2019re willing to put in the effort. For example, even within your network, different providers can charge vastly different prices. Researching costs up front could show you that getting an MRI at an imaging center instead of the hospital will save you $300 in out-of-pocket costs. (Get more tips in 20 Ways To Save On Medical Bills .) You could also do the math to estimate whether a high-deductible health plan with a health savings account could help you come out ahead on medical costs. (Read Switch to a High-Deductible PPO to Get an HSA? ) \nPreventive dental care, in the form of twice-annual cleanings and X-rays when your dentist recommends them, can help prevent problems like tooth decay or at least stop cavities while they\u2019re small. Having a cavity and getting it filled is much less expensive \u2013 and much less painful \u2013 than winding up with an abscess that requires a root canal and a crown. Dental insurance may help you save money depending on its coverage and your typical dental expenses.
