CEO Mark Stogdill has been awarded the accolade of Best CEO- Telecommunications Industry, USA in this year's line-up. \nThe ever evolving world of tech and communications is hard for the average business leader to keep up with, but not so for Hammer Fiber's President. Mark Stogdill is firmly at the cutting edge of technology and launched the company himself in just 2014. Prior to taking the helm he'd already enjoyed a successful career in the telecoms industry, so was perfectly placed to set up a brand new and forward thinking organisation that would see him gaining worldwide recognition as an industry pioneer. \nIt's hard to remember a time when we weren't connected by the internet- it's become such an intrinsic part of our daily lives. Since the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) we've seen even more changes that have revolutionised the way businesses (and our personal lives) work, but there's still a significant part of the US where internet connections are far from perfect. Hammer Fiber was born out of Mark's desire to give everyone access to super-fast, reliable broadband no matter how remote their location- and he's achieved great success in just three years. \nThe company has recently joined forces with Go Long Wireless Ltd, a Florida based company that specialises in multichannel video distribution and data services. This meeting of two powerful and innovative organisations will target areas with lacklustre broadband, TV and internet phone services to bring enhanced communication and entertainment to residential and commercial customers. \nMark Stogdill puts his success down to his team of highly engaged employees, and team building and worker satisfaction is high on the company's agenda. \"The internet is a people business and delivering on our promises takes great people, from our esteemed Board of Directors down to our service technicians. Hammer's success is a team effort,\" he told our reporter. \nTo read more about Hammer Fiber visit http://www.hammerfiber.biz/ \nAn article on the company can also be found on BWM website \nhttps://www.bwmonline.com/2017/12/03/hammer-fiber-attack-the-digital-divide/ \nAbout Business Worldwide Magazine Business Worldwide Magazine is the leading source of business and dealmaker intelligence throughout the world.

A crowd mingles outside the entrance, catching some fresh air. Inside, there\u2019s barely room to move. The narrow space is filled to capacity. A DJ is rocking the crowd with a violin cover of an old Ne-Yo song. People are dancing, talking with friends old and new \u2026 and eating soup. Lots and lots of soup.\nIn fact, the line for soup winds around the room. Guest chefs Kristopher Edelen, Ora Wise, and Lukas Volger stand behind a row of massive pots, serving the hungry crowd. Volger has made a squash chowder with greens, quinoa, and whipped feta. Volger is the co-founder and editor-in-chief of Jarry Magazine , which explores the intersection between food and queer culture, and is a natural fit for what has become a monthly tradition in Brooklyn: Queer Soup Night .\nThe crowd at C\u2019mon Everybody. (Photo credit: Fernando Sandoval.)\nOne attendee, who has finally gotten her bowl and is happily squeezed into a corner table, heard about the party from her neighbor. \u201cIt feels like a really cozy queer community event. We\u2019re all connecting in a way that\u2019s about sustaining our bodies and our hearts,\u201d she said.\nQueer Soup Night is the creation of Liz Alpern, a Jewish lesbian living in Brooklyn and the author of The Gefilte Manifesto , an Ashkenazi Jewish cookbook. After Donald Trump was elected president, Alpern\u2014like many others in the food world and the nation as a whole\u2014felt immobilized. She sat in on organizing meetings, went to protests, and followed her friends to resistance-bent book groups. But she didn\u2019t feel comfortable in any of the organizing groups she joined.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re totally overwhelmed,\u201d Alpern said, \u201cand don\u2019t know what to do, you do what you do best.\u201d And what she has always done best is cook. So one day last winter, Alpern put a big pot of soup on the stove and headed off to a political rally in Manhattan. When she got home, she invited over some friends who had been protesting the just-instituted travel ban all day. They arrived at Alpern\u2019s apartment with a crowd of hungry strangers in tow.\n\u201cThey were at JFK protesting,\u201d Alpern recalled, \u201cand that was how random people heard about it\u2014they were out on the streets.\u201d At that moment, Alpern found her place in the resistance\u2013she was going to feed the troops. And Queer Soup Night was born.\nLiz Alpern speaks at Queer Soup Night. (Photo credit: Zachary Schulman. )\nIt\u2019s now a monthly event that features guest chefs and raises money for social justice organizations. The suggested donation for a hearty bowl of soup and a slice of bread is $10. Every dollar raised during the once-a-month party goes to an organization in need of support. \u201cWe want to give to causes that the queer community cares about and connects with,\u201d Alpern explains. \u201cBut we never thought we\u2019d only give money to queer causes.\u201d Since the first Soup Night, funds have been donated to a youth-run community garden, a bail fund, and immigration rights organizations.\nNovember\u2019s soup party raised funds for the New Sanctuary Coalition , an organization that pairs volunteers with immigrants who have been identified for possible deportation. These volunteers accompany the immigrants to court dates, provide emotional support, and keep families informed.\nSarah Gozalo, who runs the accompaniment program for the Coalition, taps on a microphone midway through the night to say a few words. It takes several minutes for the noise in the room to die down. \u201cWhat I want to say is this administration has directly targeted immigrants,\u201d says Gozalo. \u201cBut really, it\u2019s not only the immigrant community that has been attacked. And so it\u2019s time for all of us to stand tall\u2014not just for immigrants, but our LGBTQ community, women, people of color. Everyone.\u201d She raises her fist in the air. \u201cWe are all united and when we unite we are unstoppable.\u201d The room explodes in applause.\n\u201cOne of the connective threads with these supper clubs is that people want to do something,\u201d says Volger, who included stories of several queer supper clubs\u2014including Queer Soup Night\u2014in the latest issue of Jarry Magazine. \u201cLiz wants to raise money. Some of them are building community in rural areas. Others are just trying to connect across different divides. This has all happened since the election.\u201d\nThe chefs at November\u2019s Queer Soup Night. (Photo credit: Fernando Sandoval.)\nBy the end of the night, the cooks are exhausted and the pots are all empty. More than $1,500 has been raised for the Coalition and its work.\nOn these nights, friends and strangers break into political debate, react with outrage and disbelief to new and outrageous tweets, and plan for future organizing events\u2014all over warm bowls of soup. But as electronic music reverberates through the room, conversation also turn to lighter topics: The merit of freshly ground spices, the quickly approaching New York winter and how to properly layer sweaters, how to best navigate the subway system.\nTo Alpern, it\u2019s important that attendees can relax and decompress, regardless of the political climate outside this building. \u201cWe need to value taking care of ourselves and coming together,\u201d she says. \u201cNot just at meetings, but in spaces that feel fun and lively and inspiring. When you eat, that\u2019s what happens.\u201d\nQueer Soup Night has rapidly outgrown Alpern\u2019s apartment, and it takes a lot more soup to feed the hungry crowd now. Otherwise, the atmosphere has not changed much. It is still a family affair; still a freshly made, warm meal for hungry protesters and activists. Alpern, describing her event, always says, \u201cEveryone is welcome at this party.\u201d And as this message reaches more people, Alpern knows she\u2019ll have to rethink some elements of Queer Soup Night to accommodate a growing crowd.\n(Photo credit: Fernando Sandoval.)\nEven as the party grows, Queer Soup Night is about more than dancing and eating. This is a chance to organize, to plan, to resist.\n\u201cI wanted to create a space around food and around gathering that doesn\u2019t cost a lot of money,\u201d Alpern reflects as she heaves a huge soup pot into the back of her car. \u201cA space where we could organize, if that\u2019s what we needed to do. A space where we could run into each other, because that is one of the fundamental principals of community. You don\u2019t have to be like \u2018are you going to Queer Soup Night?\u2019 You just go to Queer Soup Night.\u201d\nTop photo credit: Fernando Sandoval. \nThe post The Queer Soup Party Fueling the Resistance appeared first on Civil Eats .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zachary schulman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah gozalo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liz alpern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lukas volger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fernando sandoval", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alpern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "volger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gozalo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "resistance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jarry magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "queer soup night", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new sanctuary coalition", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brooklyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jfk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:21.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e78e6d135730a493d53b76d941151c599e80fc48", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJRhQtONiMMbxKCbJa28G4uCYXZKH1BpWymbxkeAUTz15XVPYtBMHCAQPYMfLgAwbwej58HqYNGxA7ADeDrrjDcrImKQLp2pzfJ5nYdKMYPck-", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Bath-Bath-Accessories-Bathroom-Hardware-Towel-Bars/N-5yc1vZcfw6/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "KOHLER Purist 24 Polished Chrome-K-14436-CP", "title_full": "KOHLER Purist 24 in.

No other country has its embassy in Jerusalem . \nTrump \u2018s decision fulfills a campaign promise and will please Republican conservatives and evangelicals who make up a sizeable portion of his domestic support. \n\u201cI have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,\u201d Trump said in a speech at the White House. \u201cWhile previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering.\u201d \nTrump \u2018s decision risks further inflaming a region already grappling with conflict in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. \nProtests broke out in areas of Jordan\u2019s capital, Amman, inhabited by Palestinian refugees, and several hundred protesters gathered outside the U.S. consulate in Istanbul. \nThe United States is asking Israel to temper its response to Trump \u2018s announcement because Washington expects a backlash and is weighing the potential threat to U.S. facilities and people, according to a State Department document seen by Reuters. \nIsrael considers Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. Palestinians want the capital of an independent state of theirs to be in the city\u2019s eastern sector, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally. \nNetanyahu said any peace deal with Palestinians must include Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. That would be a non-starter for Palestinians in any negotiations if it meant the entire city would be under Israeli control. \nPALESTINIANS UPSET \nAbbas on Wednesday called the city \u201cthe eternal capital of the state of Palestine.\u201d He said Trump \u2019s decision was tantamount to the United States abdicating its peace mediator role. Jordan said Trump \u2018s decision was \u201clegally null.\u201d \n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty catastrophic, frankly,\u201d said Hussein Ibish at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, adding that \u201c Trump did not distinguish in any meaningful sense between West Jerusalem and occupied East Jerusalem .\u201d \nPalestinian Islamist group Hamas accused Trump of a \u201cflagrant aggression against the Palestinian people.\u201d \nPalestinians switched off Christmas lights at Jesus\u2019 traditional birthplace in Bethlehem on Wednesday night to protest Trump \u2018s move. \nTrump has tilted U.S. policy toward Israel since taking office in January. \n\u201cHe cannot expect to side entirely with Israel on the most sensitive and complex issues in the process, and yet expect the Palestinians to see the United States as an honest broker,\u201d said former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Daniel Kurtzer. \nPope Francis called for Jerusalem \u2018s status quo to be respected. China and Russia expressed concern the move could aggravate Middle East hostilities. \nA statement from the Saudi Royal Court said the Saudi government had expressed \u201ccondemnation and deep regret\u201d about the move. \nA spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May called the U.S. decision \u201cunhelpful in terms of prospects for peace in the region.\u201d \nThe United Nations Security Council is likely to meet on Friday over Trump \u2018s decision, diplomats said on Wednesday. \nTrump said his move was not intended to tip the scale in favor of Israel and that any deal involving the future of Jerusalem would have to be negotiated by the parties. \nHe insisted he was not taking a position on \u201cany final status issues, including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem , or the resolution of contested borders.\u201d \nREFUGEES, SETTLEMENTS AMONG DISPUTES \nOther key disputes between the two sides include the fate of Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements built on occupied land. Trump made no mention of settlements. \nHe said he remained committed to the two-state solution if the parties want one. The president called on the region to take his message calmly. \n\u201cThere will of course be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement but we are confident that ultimately, as we work through these disagreements, we will arrive at a place of greater understanding and cooperation,\u201d Trump said. \nU.S. Representative Eliot Engel, a pro-Israel Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee who is often critical of Trump \u2019s foreign policy, said: \u201cThis decision is long overdue and helps correct a decades-long indignity.\u201d \nTrump acted under a 1995 law that requires the United States to move its embassy to Jerusalem . His predecessors, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, consistently put off that decision. \nTrump ordered a delay to any embassy move from Tel Aviv since the United States does not have an embassy in Jerusalem to move into. A senior administration official said it could take three to four years to build one. \nThe Jerusalem decision has raised doubts about the Trump administration\u2019s ability to follow through on a peace effort that Trump \u2018s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, has led for months aimed at reviving long-stalled negotiations. \nThere was no indication Trump asked Netanyahu for anything in return when he notified the Israeli leader of his Jerusalem decision on Tuesday, a person familiar with the matter said. \nBut Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator for Republican and Democratic administrations, said Trump , who has long touted himself as a master negotiator, might be setting the stage for seeking Israeli concessions later. \n\u201cThis might be the case where Trump applies a little honey now to show the Israelis he\u2019s the most pro-Israel president ever, and then applies a little vinegar later,\u201d he said. \nReuters ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron david miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eliot engel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahmoud abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pope francis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george w. bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared kushner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hussein ibish", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel kurtzer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi royal court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arab gulf states institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house foreign affairs committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bethlehem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "istanbul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yemen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:24.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e6686d6776b9ce1db2f5592b2f5a751fab8684e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbQ2x5cAznFcvdpEgv6RveTB2aFaSzLThRMmSWJtp92x9klJ4H4t7C0uQSAXKPlCWJLUcNH1ZeWFS0tVwq9GORog-", "site_full": "www.expedia.ca", "site": "expedia.ca", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.ca/Peabody-Hotels.d9087.Travel-Guide-Hotels", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Top 10 Peabody Hotels: Cheap Hotel Deals from C$78 | Expedia.ca", "title": "Lakeside Inn:", "title_full": "Lakeside Inn: 2017 Pictures, Reviews, Prices & Deals | Expedia.ca", "published": "2017-10-20T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6618, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "57c11be043cde312cdd2f57bf3a513bc896d7b78", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbQ2x5cAznFcvdpEgv6RveTB2aFaSzLThRMmSWJtp92x9klJ4H4t7C0uQSAXKPlCWJLUcNH1ZeWFSK2KKyMPtKSwgbANxkzFxm9DpfIXq.d2GXt8sCgF8r.A-", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-06T18:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "This is the third time we've stayed here.

My endo wants me to do 30 grams of carbs a day. My dietitian is checking up on this because she does not believe it. I went to her to for help but came back confused. I ordered the book the art of low carb... and I think that will help. I wanted to find out what kinds of fats are good, how do I know if I am eating too much and how much of each fat, protein, and carbs are good. My head ia spinning with all confused info. I wanted to find out if eggs are good she said 1 egg yolk an day. I read here you all do several whole eggs. I told her I was going to get coconut flour to mix with my yogurt. She says it has saturated fat and my family history of heart attacks means not good. She said to eat 15 grams of saturated fats a day. I am sure if I am eating right and right amount. So who do I talk to to make sure I am eating right. Doctor says that is the dietian issue and she confuses me. So what to eat. Just follow your what did you eat section. Posts > 100 30 g carbs is reasonable if you\u0092re doing a ketogenic diet. I eat about 45 g most days (sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less). Examples of good fats = avocados, walnuts, almonds, olive oil, coconut oil. Saturated fats have been shown to not cause health problems. Thus people here love their eggs, butter, heavy cream - all of which add tons of flavor and no carbs. Bacon is kinda tasty too Bacon and eggs have zero carbs. They\u0092re tasty and fill you up. Meat and cheese are diet staples. Low carb yogurt is tasty and BG friendly. Nuts in moderation is good. Even a little dark chocolate fix can work. It\u0092s really not a difficult diet to follow, once you get it all figured out.

In the 2017 government budget, GDP growth was projected at 3.2%.

Warning, t his op-ed includes content about sexual abuse and violence.\nI had been waiting for many hours in that strange house when *Rodo finally came back.\nI was still sitting in the living room where he had left me. His Mom and the other people who lived there had already gone to bed, and Rodo asked why I hadn\u2019t done the same. I told him I wanted to leave, but he said he wasn\u2019t going anywhere because it was late and he was tired.\nHe was obviously drunk, but I again insisted he take me home. \u201cI already said no,\u201d he said, trying to make me stop worrying. \u201cIt\u2019s better if you stay here with me \u2013 you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d I said once again, and suddenly, that so-called \u201cgreat guy,\u201d who had promised he wouldn\u2019t hurt me, turned into a monster.\nHe grabbed me by the arms and shook me: \u201cI\u2019ve tried being nice, but you\u2019re going to stay with me one way or the other. You\u2019re not leaving \u2013 you\u2019ll never get out of here.\u201d\nMy trafficker sexually exploited me for several months in bars, streets, neighborhoods, and hotels in different towns in M\u00e9xico, until eventually, the trafficking networks brought me to the United States.\nI cried and screamed for help while he hit me and sexually abused me in that living room. His family was in an adjacent room that didn\u2019t even have a door, but no one came out or said anything. I felt completely alone, as it no one else existed in that place.\nHe was telling me, \u201cYou\u2019re mine now, and you can yell all you want, but no one will help you. After this, who do you think is going to care about you? You belong to me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat Would You Do?\u201d\nRodo woke up a few hours later. I was in a corner, wishing I could die in that moment. When he looked at me, I begged him to let me go, but he just said, \u201cYou still don\u2019t understand that you\u2019re mine now and you\u2019re never going home?\u201d\nHe locked me in that room again and took off, coming back later with some clothes and documents for me. He asked me to forgive him for everything he\u2019d done. He got down on his knees and said he was sorry. It had been an act of desperation, he said, because of the pressure he was feeling to help his family, who was in debt and facing foreclosure. He didn\u2019t want them to lose everything.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d he repeated. \u201cHow would you feel if you knew your mom was going to end up on the street? What would you do?\u201d\nI asked him why he was doing this to me. I didn\u2019t know him, or who he was. But he kept saying I could help his family, and that if I didn\u2019t, their suffering would be my fault.\nA Job I Didn\u2019t Want\nHe added in a hurry, \u201cThere\u2019s a good job at a bar that only you can do. That way we\u2019ll get the money together quickly \u2013 please take it.\u201d\nRodo left again, keeping me in that locked room. Everything he said seemed to be true. He\u2019d cried, and shown me the foreclosure papers. Later, he came back and asked me what I\u2019d decided. I said I couldn\u2019t help him and that he should let me go instead. I wasn\u2019t going to do that job.\nIn an instant, that man who was supposedly so remorseful transformed once again: \u201cI can see you don\u2019t understand things when I ask nicely, so we\u2019ll have to do this the hard way.\u201d\nHe hit me while he said, \u201cYou\u2019ll work where I tell you to work, and you\u2019ll do whatever I say \u2013 whether you want to or not.

Photo by AFP/Keren Bleier The cryptocurrency has made a dramatical surge from a 2017 low of $752 in mid-January. Bitcoin ploughed past $14,000 to a fresh record on Thursday as investors continued to pile in, triggering a warning the cryptocurrency was \"like a charging train with no brakes\" that would inevitably slip back. It touched a new high of $14,485 before slipping back to $14,398 in Asian afternoon trade, according to Bloomberg News . The rally came just a day after the virtual currency, which has been used to buy everything from an ice cream to a pint of beer, hit the $12,000 mark for the first time. Bitcoin -- which came into being in 2009 as a bit of encrypted software and has no central bank backing it -- has risen from a 2017 low of $752 in mid-January, and surged dramatically in the past month. The increased interest has been driven by growing acceptance among traditional investors of an innovation once considered the preserve of computer nerds and financial experts. U.S. regulators last week cleared the way for Bitcoin futures to trade on major exchanges, including the world's biggest futures centre the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). But some, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, have warned against dabbling in Bitcoin as it could threaten financial stability, and fears of a bubble have increased as the price has soared. \"Bitcoin now seems like a charging train with no brakes,\" said Shane Chanel, from Sydney-based ASR Wealth Advisers. \"There is an unfathomable amount of new participants piling into the cryptocurrency market.\" But he warned: \"Once the hype slows down, we will most certainly see some sort of correction.\" Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG, also predicted \"downside moves\" in future. \"When the price does turn and there is confusion, even panic.... then watch the short sellers come out in droves,\" he said. Transactions happen when heavily encrypted codes are passed across a computer network. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies use blockchain, which records transactions that are updated in real time on an online ledger and maintained by a network of computers. But it has also suffered controversies. In 2014 major Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange MtGox collapsed after admitting that 850,000 coins -- worth around $480 million at the time -- had disappeared from its vaults.

Lai Yew Thiam, 56, will start serving his sentence on Jan 15 next year as he has to settle some personal issues, the court heard on Thursday (Dec 7). The Singaporean had admitted to two counts of breaking into law firm Eugene Thuraisingam LLP\u2019s office with Ravi in June this year. An additional count of housebreaking was taken into consideration in his sentencing. The court heard that Lai and Ravi had broken into the office, located in the People\u2019s Park Centre, at least three times that month. This happened after the law firm terminated Ravi\u2019s employment on or about June 8, and told him to vacate the premises by June 16, Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Sarah Ong told the court. After the first break-in on June 17, the firm changed the lock on the metal shutter door. On June 23, around noon, the duo broke into the office again. Lai bypassed the new lock by using a screwdriver to remove the sides of the metal shutter door. Ravi shot a video and streamed the break-in \u201clive\u201d on Facebook. The duo left after staff members found out and called the police. Four days later, the two men were back at it again \u2014 breaking into the office by removing eight metal screws fastened to the metal shutter gate. DPP Ong urged the court to impose a four-week jail sentence per charge, noting that Ravi was the main perpertrator of the offences. For housebreaking, Lai could have been fined and jailed up to two years. The court heard that Lai had previous brushes with the law, including going behind bars for theft, drug and traffic-related offences. In his mitigation plea, defence lawyer Satwant Singh said his client was \u201cgenuinely remorseful\u201d for his actions. The housebreaking offences were not done with the intention to steal, but was a result of a \u201ccommercial dispute\u201d Ravi had with the law firm, Mr Satwant said. He added that Lai was \u201cacting on the instructions of Ravi\u201d. He had helped Ravi because \u201che felt pity for (Ravi) \u2026 (knowing that) Ravi was going through a difficult period\u201d.

I will briefly tell you my story. I was raised as a Jehovah's Witness. You can't get much more Bible thumping than that. I got baptized at at 10. At age 14 I met a man that exposed the history of the organization starting from Charles Taze Russell, all the changes that were made in doctrine, and that ultimately the JWs where false prophets that predicted the end of the world many times, but never came to fruition.\nI harbored that doubt for a long time and it ate away at me. In the mean time, I heard a lot of stories about the occult at work, from other JWs. One of my coworkers claimed that her husband had a mother that practiced Santeria and saw many a great feat that she accomplished because of it, nails that grew ridiculously fast and were strong, the strength to lift a small palm tree out of the ground and throw it, etc. I was skeptical, I needed to see to believe, but being a JW, I knew that was wrong. Still the curiosity eventually got to me.\nI recently had a chance to visit a woman shaman who works with egg cleansings. That's all she does. No candles, no incantations, no herbs, no sigils, just egg cleansings. I took a carton of eggs I had bought at the store, just as she asked me, and we performed the ritual. I would charge one egg at a time so as to absorb my aura, then she made me stand over a glass of water and rubbed the egg all over my body, from head to toe, with my arms extended outwards, to my sides.\nEgg 1 is cracked, and out comes a black ink surrounding the yolk. Egg 2, same ritual, and is cracked, this time the same thing, a black ink and also a perfectly domed bubble over the egg yolk. It look eerily similar to an eye and she said it was the stink eye.\nI asked her many other things, she said she cured a lady that had been wasting away for several years and weighed only 90 lbs. She had been a victim of a hex and she went and did the cleaning. The lady is doing well today.\nI will explain more.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:25.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "562d62d83a0490cf7aaebf2944f2e5e4b7c88008", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_zQ3emj6oqFkM4nZF1cvQzb", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/x/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/x/ - Paranormal - 4chan", "title": "Jesus is Lord", "title_full": "/x/ - Jesus is Lord - Paranormal - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T07:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 62, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5ac9d079c3da6ed8f5aa18a005d5286d17a482d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_zQ3emj6oqFkATOoyGVGgy4tK6niy.OCJU-", "ord_in_thread": 16, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T10:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>20000553\nBut you don't have to go there anon.

Every South African who has a pension fund or is invested in unit trusts will have been hit by the devastation on the JSE yesterday, which shed a staggering R183bn and ended the day about 1000 points down. \nSteinhoff, which saw its share price drop 9% on Monday and another 9% on Tuesday, shed 66% yesterday. The Government Employees Pension Fund is the biggest investor after chairperson Christo Wiese, but every other major asset manager in the country will also have been hurt. Steinhoff\u2019s price dropped to R17.55 late yesterday, from a high of R90 earlier this year. Shares in Brait, the South African investment heavyweight in which Wiese owns about a third, slumped 6%. Recently unbundled Steinhoff African Retail (Star) was down 20%, Shoprite lost 4% and PSG 8% by late afternoon yesterday. Wiese has temporarily taken over at Steinhoff after CEO Markus Jooste quit on Tuesday after 30 years with the company. \nThe CEO of recently unbundled Steinhoff African Retail (Star), Ben la Grange, quit yesterday. The JSE\u2019s director of issuer regulation John Burke said the bourse was in talks with Steinhoff to get answers on the investigation of possible accounting irregularities. Wayne McCurrie, a senior portfolio manager at Ashburton Investments, yesterday told The New Age that the situation must be \u201cenormous\u201d to have led to the exit of the founder of the company and such a selloff of shares. McCurrie said the market may have overreacted \u201cbut we don\u2019t know yet what is going on but it\u2019s big.\u201d \nHe said the furniture giant, which is based in SA but listed in Frankfurt and on the JSE, has been plagued with two issues that can be traced back years. \u201cThe first is a long-standing tax dispute with German authorities and the second relates to the claims of improper accounting methods used in a deal with a European company,\u201d he said. A German magazine in August said that senior Steinhoff officials were suspected of accounting fraud and \u201cexcessive revenues\u201d had been included in the balance sheets of companies belonging to the group. Steinhoff immediately denied the allegations saying they were false and dishonesty disseminated by a \u201cformer joint venture partner\u201d in litigation with Steinhoff. The group was due to release its results yesterday but postponed their release. The company said it may have to restate prior years\u2019 financial statements. \nThe group would not comment yesterday but released a statement saying it had asked auditors PwC to conduct an investigation into the irregularities. McCurrie said that it\u2019s now a matter of time before they divulge the true reason behind the CEOs resignations and the scandal they are embroiled in. \u2013 With Reuters SHARE ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steinhoff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "markus jooste", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john burke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wayne mccurrie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben la grange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christo wiese", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mccurrie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wiese", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "steinhoff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steinhoff international", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "government employees pension fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "psg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashburton investments", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shoprite", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "frankfurt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steinhoff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brait", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:25.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "562d62d83a0490cf7aaebf2944f2e5e4b7c88008", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_zQ3emj6oqFkM4nZF1cvQzb", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/x/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/x/ - Paranormal - 4chan", "title": "Jesus is Lord", "title_full": "/x/ - Jesus is Lord - Paranormal - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T07:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 62, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "af962c03c454f57db14e3c6ce1689e9c79fb4798", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_zQ3emj6oqFkATOoyGVGgy4GccAlQG.aQs-", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T10:56:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">Accept my lie", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:25.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5bca52fe6785c406d2eb642b7b2c1a23e232cacb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Rp_5vv9o81zfUkelyP4A4LRb_AXwVmogO_TC3i5znB8J.qT1sDsAIiHVFGPLh5FnIUtnfvarWO5hV3BCnT_Q3kswW2RfwC.w-", "site_full": "www.thenewstribune.com", "site": "thenewstribune.com", "site_section": "http://www.thenewstribune.com/sports/?widgetName=rssfeed&widgetContentId=712015&getXmlFeed=true", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "College & professional Sports news | TheNewsTribune.com &", "title": "Wednesday's Sports in Brief", "title_full": "Wednesday's Sports in Brief", "published": "2017-12-07T10:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//www.thenewstribune.com/static/images/thenewstribune/facebook.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40831, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5bca52fe6785c406d2eb642b7b2c1a23e232cacb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Rp_5vv9o81zfUkelyP4A4LRb_AXwVmogO_TC3i5znB8J.qT1sDsAIiHVFGPLh5FnIUtnfvarWO5hV3BCnT_Q3kswW2RfwC.w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The Associated Press", "published": "2017-12-07T10:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "Wednesday's Sports in Brief", "text": "December 07, 2017 12:11 AM UPDATED 3 MINUTES AGO \nOLYMPICS \nMOSCOW (AP) \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin won't boycott the Pyeongchang Olympics. \nPutin said his government will allow Russians to compete as neutral athletes at the upcoming games in South Korea. \nThe International Olympic Committee has banned the Russian team from games as punishment for doping violations at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. The IOC, however, plans to invite individual Russians to compete under the Olympic flag. Never miss a local story.

That itself was in response to the U.S.-led boycott of the Moscow Olympics four years earlier. \nPutin also said Russia still did not accept accusations that it ran a state-backed doping system around the Sochi Olympics. He called the IOC ruling \"politically motivated\" and unfair \"collective punishment.\" \nPRO FOOTBALL \nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Roger Goodell has signed a five-year contract extension to remain commissioner of the NFL through 2024. \nA memo from the NFL's compensation committee to team owners and obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press confirms that Goodell and committee chairman Arthur Blank, owner of the Atlanta Falcons, have signed the extension. \nThat extension has been a source of controversy because Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones objected to the process. \nAll 32 owners approved in May the compensation committee's power to negotiate and sign a deal with Goodell, who replaced Paul Tagliabue in 2006. \nSince then, the league's total revenues have more than doubled to $14 billion. \nA person familiar with the contract told The Associated Press it is worth almost $200 million, with a base of $40 million. But the deal is incentive-laden, the person added, speaking on condition of anonymity because the contract numbers are not made public. \nHall of Fame quarterback Warren Moon has been accused of sexual harassment by an assistant for his sports marketing firm, according to a lawsuit filed in California. \nThe civil lawsuit was filed Monday in Orange County Superior Court. According to court documents, Wendy Haskell alleges Moon made \"unwanted and unsolicited\" sexual advances as part of her role as his assistant working for Sports 1 Marketing. Moon is the co-founder and president of the company. \nThe Washington Post first reported on the lawsuit Wednesday. The 61-year-old Moon has been working as a radio commentator for the Seattle Seahawks. The team announced later Wednesday that \"We have accepted Warren Moon's request for a leave of absence as the club's radio analyst.\" \nMoon played parts of 17 seasons in the NFL with Houston, Minnesota, Seattle and Kansas City. He threw for 49,325 yards and 291 touchdowns in the regular season and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2006. The former University of Washington star led Edmonton to five Canadian Football League titles before playing in the NFL. \nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier has been transferred from a Cincinnati hospital to Pittsburgh to continue treatment for a spinal injury suffered during Monday night's game against the Bengals. \nThe Steelers say Shazier will continue to undergo tests before offering an update on his status. \nShazier left Paul Brown Stadium on a stretcher less than four minutes into his team's 23-20 victory over Cincinnati following a tackle that left the 25-year-old writhing on the turf, his legs motionless. He underwent extensive testing at University of Cincinnati Medical Center under the care of neurosurgeons David Okonwko and Joseph Cheng. \nRICHMOND, Va. (AP) \u2014 A former University of Virginia and pro football player has been sentenced to 40 years for running a $10 million fraud scheme that victimized more than 50 investors. \nFederal prosecutors say in a news release that 37-year-old Merrill Robertson Jr. of Chesterfield was sentenced Wednesday. He was convicted in August on 15 offenses, including mail and wire fraud and money laundering. \nProsecutors say Robertson and a co-conspirator operated Cavalier Union Investments in Richmond. Authorities say Robertson targeted former coaches, donors, alumni and employees of schools he had attended. \nAccording to the documents, Robertson sold promissory notes that he claimed would pay an annual return of up to 20 percent. \nInstead, prosecutors charged, Robertson used the invested money for cars, vacations and a luxury suite at a football stadium. \nPRO BASKETBALL \nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Hornets coach Steve Clifford will be away from the team for an undetermined period of time to deal with a \"health issue.\" \nThe team made the announcement Wednesday in a release. \nThe 56-year-old Clifford missed Monday night's game against Orlando because he was not feeling well. Associate head coach Stephen Silas filled in for Clifford against the Magic. \nClifford has battled heart problems in the past, but a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press the issue was not a heart-related.

But our terms with the Marlins are clear.\" \nMarlins CEO Derek Jeter said Tuesday that Miami has not decided whether to trade Stanton, still owed $295 million over the final decade of his record $325 million, 13-year contract. When asked specifically about absorbing the majority of that contract, Evans didn't address it. \nStanton is due to make $25 million in 2018 after he led the majors with 59 home runs and 132 RBIs this season.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vladimir", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "paul brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph cheng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shazier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bobby evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goodell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul tagliabue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen silas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merrill robertson jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clifford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david okonwko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giancarlo stanton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arthur blank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren moon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan shazier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger goodell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wendy haskell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robertson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve clifford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derek jeter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerry jones", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "orange county superior court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cavalier union investments", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle seahawks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canadian football league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of cincinnati medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "knbr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hall of fame", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta falcons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steelers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international olympic committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas cowboys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ioc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nl mvp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bengals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marlins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richmond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "va.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cincinnati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pittsburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pittsburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kansas city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pyeongchang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sochi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orlando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edmonton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "soviet union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chesterfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richmond", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:25.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eeae5eff5da50d73b701371a047c3afc6de6cdb7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQEDNGaiSMgSf7Rphei1RNWf6lXtqCv5SmZhnMH_nAPsYTyHCdCagVdDoj7zV1eRLS6RPuKApVEwA--", "site_full": "hijobs.net", "site": "hijobs.net", "site_section": "https://hijobs.net/rss2", "site_categories": ["job_search", "jobs"], "section_title": "HIJOBS Job Feed \u00bb All", "title": "Hostel Assistant -

The cause of the commotion? Cats. While the runaway success of Crypto Kitties has prompted widespread amusement, it highlights the vulnerabilities built into ethereum smart contracts. When one ERC20-based project goes viral, it risks taking the entire network down with it. \nAlso read: Blockchain-Based Digital Art \u2013 Passing Fad or the Next Big Thing? \nCybersquatting Kitties Cause Carnage As news.Bitcoin.com recently reported , Crypto Kitties \u2013 a sort of Beanie Babies for the blockchain generation \u2013 has proved an unexpected smash hit. Unfortunately, the project seems in danger of becoming a victim of its own success, having risen in a matter of days from just 4% of the total network traffic to 14%. This has resulted in a transaction backlog, with hundreds of kitty lovers waiting for their new pets to be issued on the blockchain, prompting Crypto Kitties to tweet : \nDue to network congestion, we are increasing the birthing fee from 0.001 ETH to 0.002 ETH. This will ensure your kittens are born on time! The extra is needed to incentivize miners to add birthing txs to the chain. Long-term solution will be explored very soon! \nFor impatient virtual pet-owners waiting in line, Crypto Kitties has promised to absorb some of the costs for gas used to send transactions through the ethereum network. The number of unconfirmed transactions in the ethereum mempool soared to 15,000 today, with Crypto Kitties bearing the brunt of the blame. \n\nBad Kitties Bloat the Blockchain Crypto Kitties: cute but deadly. This isn't the first time the ethereum network has come under strain due to the success of ERC20-based projects. In June, for example, Bancor's oversubscribed ICO caused the blockchain to crawl to a halt. This is the first time a live Dapp has had a similar effect though and it doesn't bode well for the network's scalability. While most ethereum-based projects are unlikely to attain the critical mass necessary to impact transaction times, Crypto Kitties shows that it only takes one viral hit to drag everyone's projects down. \nA casual endorsement from Vitalik Buterin earlier today probably hasn't helped ease demand for the network's newfound killer app. \n\nWhile ethereum developers debate the best way to scale around the problem, bitcoin devs have been enjoying a moment of schadenfreude, having endured similar jibes for months. Both bitcoin and ethereum are still at the early adopter stage, when problems caused by virtual kitty birthing induce more laughs than groans.
