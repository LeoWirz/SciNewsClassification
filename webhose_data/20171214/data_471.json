Everyone on the 68 that does not show. The 68 looks like it was just uncrated. The 72 is too far from stock to matter. Reuseable, your wires don't get shorter because you don't have to cut them off and you do not need to keep buying new connectors. No special tools needed except a wire stripper and everyone should have one of those anyway. Easy to disconnect and reconnect. And most important, not one has ever failed.\nPS\nI can only report my conclusions and opinions based on my own experiences.

Bob doesn't need to replace all his stuff, just when needed I'm sure that he will find it easier to make new joins with the Jap stuff.\nI'm curious why \"soldered or hex squashed bullets\" should be viewed as a \"struggle\"? Is it a \"struggle\" when a Britbike has a mixture of Unified and British Standard fasteners? Not when you have spanners and sockets to fit both? So, if you have a crimper for spades and a crimper for hex. bullets, how would you \"struggle\"?\nWith respect, there are myriad places in this hobby where we have different tools for different ways of achieving the same thing; I'm puzzled why electrical terminals alone should be viewed with different logic?\nWith just two different crimping tools, it's possible to choose the right terminal for a particular job from a vast array - e.g. Japanese bullets on an e.i. trigger plate in a Triumph timing cover.\nLikewise, I bolt a modern accessory to a Britbike with metric fasteners because I have spanners and sockets to fit both Imperial AF and metric AF fasteners.\nWhy would I convert all the Britbike fasteners to metric so I can have just one set of spanners and sockets?\nOriginally Posted by koan58 In the rare occasions when a 4-way connector does not provide enough connections (most commonly either lights wires or returns in the headlamp shell) I simply crimp another wire into the connector for another 4-way socket, rather like the way it's done in pc's for power supply.\nWell, yeah ... if the wires have \"hex squashed bullets\" already, if you have a hex. crimper, you can also make up a short wire with two bullets, one in one 4-way snap connector, one in another 4-way snap connector ... Lucas did this on Britbikes as standard instead of fitting 6- and 8-way snap connectors ...\nHowever, bear in mind we (or at least I) have different priorities from motorcycle and computer electrical harness makers - their logic behind decisions is minimum cost, my primary logic and advice is how something can be done better , cost is secondary.\nBob's earlier posted problem is \"multiple ...returns to pilot, instrument, tail lamps\", and lack of snap connector holes for another wire because Lucas connected multiple 4-way snap connectors with short lengths of wire. If Bob pays for the expensive hex. crimper, he can repeat ad infinitum . However, if he pays just for much cheaper snap connectors with more holes, he can achieve the same result better (imho).\nHth.\nRegards,\n#717406 - 12/01/17 5:33 pm Re: How close can alternator wire run to EI harness?

[ Re: btour ] Joined: Jun 2002\nPosts: 9,370 Stuart\nBritBike Forum member Stuart\nBritBike Forum member\nJoined: Jun 2002\nPosts: 9,370\nScotland Hi Bob,\nOriginally Posted by btour It looks like the W-crimp bullets and crimper I got are the way to go.\nBut, as I posted for you already, bear in mind that afaik you're then relying on one single retailer in the whole world, on an island off a continent several thousand miles from the US ...\nOriginally Posted by btour Is there an insulator for that?\nOriginally Posted by btour do you use heat shrink with them?\nNope. Like the Lucas bullets and the modern ones that look like 'em, when you push the bullet into a snap connector, that snap connectors' insulation is longer than the steel sleeves inside insulates the bullets pushed into a given connector.\nDigressing slightly, you remember the Closing Tool ? That makes pushing bullets into snap connectors much easier, so the latter's insulation better covers any type of bullet.\nOriginally Posted by btour \"I've one for 'flag' terminals that don't have the same wire crimps as spades,\" They don't? What crimper works for them?\nGerman one\nIt will work for the spades, but now you tell me not the flag spades,\nOriginally Posted by btour I see the flag connector but no suggested crimp tool for it.\n<sigh> You have an uncanny ability to draw the wrong conclusion from the simplest statement ... and then develop a whole, but completely illogical, train of thought from the wrong conclusion.\nLook at the image of the \"flag\" terminal. Does the image show any different method of attaching the wire from any other spade (or W-crimp or Japanese bullet) terminal? So why wouldn't you use the same crimp tool?\nThe correct translation of \"I've one for 'flag' terminals that don't have the same wire crimps as spades,\" is \"I\" (me, the writer of the Quote: d phrase) have been doing this for nearly forty years and, in that time, I have acquired myriad different electrical terminals.\nNowhere in the Quote: d phrase is there any suggestion, implication, advice, etc. that you should acquire any of those myriad different electrical terminals, or even look for them. Unless you want to.\nOriginally Posted by btour \"the three different-size M-shaped cutouts in one jaw.\" Yes but what you are referring to does not work with lucas bullets?\nCorrect. But I never said it did. I did say that I have a crimper with both M-shaped and hex. cutouts but I also said I bought it 35 years ago ... here implying that new ones might not be still available.\nOriginally Posted by btour I just went to see the Matco tool dealer. He has never seen or heard of the crimper for lucas bullets.\nIme, not unusual. Being a \"dealer\" does not automatically make anyone an expert. Forums like this would be redundant if all (more of?) the Meriden Triumph parts \"dealers\" were also experts ...\nOriginally Posted by btour Also looking at http:/ / www.vehicle-wiring-products.eu/ product.php/ 36/ female-blade/ f7864bd39cde20818ed5a3d8cbc5963b They look different than the naked ones\nDon't try and draw conclusions from images. Ime, any widely-used terminal is made by several (many?) manufacturers. The standard is how it attaches to another corresponding terminal (in this case a male spade), not how it attaches to the wire. Remember when you asked about crimping two wires in one spade terminal? And I posted about the spade terminals I have with the wire attachment arranged slightly differently, that allows me to use them for crimping two wires in one terminal? Those terminals don't look like VWP's image either ...\nOriginally Posted by btour I see the limit for od wire size is 1mm for these? Is that correct?\nNope, in two ways:-\n. the \"1mm\" is the conductor cross-section area (e.g. common 14/0.30 metric wire, the spades'd also work on 17AWG and 18AWG);\n. the \"6.3mm takes 0.5-1mm cable\" has (should have) a 'down arrow' immediately to the right of it; click on the arrow and a dropdown box with other options should appear; fwiw, I have \"6.3mm takes 1-3mm cable\" for general use and a few \"9.5mm takes 3-5.5mm cable\" for Zeners.\nOriginally Posted by btour This would be the upper amp limit for these terminations? http:/ / www.vehicle-wiring-products.eu/ product.php/ 973/ 16-5-amp-1mm-sq-32-0-20\nNope. The upper Amps limit is a function of the areas of the male and female spades in contact with each other. Which is considerably-greater than 1 sq.mm. ...\nThe linked wire is 'thinwall'. From using it on one rewire for someone else (he bought the wire) and spectacular failure keeping crimped bullets on it, I recommend against using it.\nOriginally Posted by btour What is a tracer wire. multi color like brown blue?\nThe \"tracer\" is normally the second colour in a combination - e.g. the \"Blue\" in \"Brown/Blue\". How the tracer is defined varies:-\n. Lucas normally put two thin lines of the \"tracer\" colour in the wire's insulation, such that the \"tracer\" lines were thinner than the other colour between 'em. Many modern wire makers do this also.\n. The \"tracer\" colour can spiral around the wire's insulation; again, the \"tracer\" colour will be obviously-thinner than the other colour between 'em.\n. But not all wire makers follow these standards. Wherever possible, I avoid wire that isn't at least similar to the Lucas standard; there's enough around that is similar that I don't have to use shonky.\nOriginally Posted by btour I have to buy 100m of the stuff?\nFrom where? The VWP page clearly shows, \"Pack Size:\" with \"Metre\" in the dropdown underneath.\nOriginally Posted by btour It looks like the lucas multi bullet connectors could be replaced with the mini's plugs?\nNope. Mini Connectors do not make common connections, look at the plugs in the image - each male-female connection is insulated from the others.\nOriginally Posted by btour What do I use to connect different gauge wires together?\nWhy not two terminals?\nOriginally Posted by btour replace the brown blue\nwhite, w/y perhaps.\nBrown/Blue I use 28/0.30 (2 sq.mm. conductor cross-section area):-\n. If you order from VWP, I use http:/ / www.vehicle-wiring-products.eu/ product.php/ 975/ 25-amp-2mm-sq-28-0-30 ; note , the comments I made about 1 sq.mm. thinwall don't apply to this, bullets for 2 sq.mm. conductor (and W-crimps) work well.\n. Otoh, if you order from British Wiring, while they do sell 25-Amp, 2 sq.mm. ( http:/ / www.britishwiring.com/ 25-Amp-Thin-Wall-Cable-p/ c628.htm ), the dropdown doesn't specifically list Brown/Blue.\n. If BW really don't and won't, http:/ / www.britishwiring.com/ 28-Strand-PVC-Wire-14-ga-AWG-p/ c128.htm .\nWhite , depends:-\n. Between the ignition switch and the junction of individual component White wires, I use 28/0.30, 2 sq.mm. again, 25A thinwall for preference.\n. Individual components' White wires from the junction, I leave or replace with 9/0.30 (rated for 5.75A), depending on the maximum consumption of the component (to derive Amps from Watts, divide Watts by Volts (12)).\nWhite/Yellow , whether from VWP or BW, 14/0.30, 1 sq.mm. 8.75A.\nBtw, you should also change the Red wire(s) attached to battery +ve:-\n. If there is only one Red wire attached to battery +ve, replace it with 25A, 2 sq.mm. 28/0.30.\n. If there is more than one Red wire attached to battery +ve, cut off the ring terminal, attach a bullet to the end of each existing Red wire and connect them into a 'common' snap connnector, leaving at least one connection unused. Then make up a length of 25A, 2 sq.mm. 28/0.030 with a ring terminal at one end, a bullet at the other and connect it into the aforementioned snap connector.\n. In either case, include a fuse holder for a standard automotive blade fuse in the new Red wire and put a 15A fuse in it.\nReasons you do the Red are:-\n. Like the Brown/Blue, it's common to all DC circuits, so Red to battery +ve needs to be rated at least as high as Brown/Blue.\n. The standard fuse in the Brown/Blue cannot protect against a short-circuit between the -ve battery terminal and any part of the bike - e.g. broken seat pan, loose tool touching battery -ve, seat pan falling on battery-charger terminal attached to battery -ve, etc. Otoh, when only a single Red wire is attached to battery +ve, a fuse in it can and will. Btw, if you're also changing the Brown/Blue wire, with the main fuse in the Red wire, one isn't required in the Brown/Blue.\nOriginally Posted by btour two wires to one female spade.

Stuart,\nI have not read what you posted yet. I am tired. I will read it when I can concentrate.\nI went to this place today. Hollingsworth.com ... Long long talk and walk through the factory. I was thinking small at the time. Just looking for some terminations. Now I am thinking much bigger. They can make any termination you want. They will attach wires to whatever termination you want. They will make whatever die you want to crimp with. They have a tool that accepts by magnet, the dies for quick changes.\nAnd it is an employee owned business.\nI am going back Mon. or Tues.\nWhat I found out:\nUS military uses a four sided crimper, which results in two flats = six sides. Not available yet for small hand dies. The small sizes done by batch with machinery.\nI don't have one of the W-crimp bullets to show him. I bet they could make em up. I showed him one from the website. Cost was 2 something pounds. How much American. He looked at the picture and said it was standard size bullet they make, but I think that is wrong. Is it perfect as is or could be better?\nWhat are the dimensions?\nAll flags need a special tool to crimp.,if you want to do it right. Cost of the tool he showed me is $200.00 They had a thousand flags with wire made up, but the wire look too small for me. They just test them for pull out etc. and toss them. People try to do the crimp by hand but he said it splits the barrel.\nWe spoke about the battery ring terminal I want. One that you could disconnect the wires from with spade. He said they could make it up, out of what exists and it would not break from vibration.\nIf you look at the website they can make these terminations out of copper, and coat them with whatever you like or not.\nThe only spades they had with the metal to crimp the insulation as well as the core.,were with piggy back. There seemed to be some confusion about finding that clear PVC insulation I want. It seems to have gone the way of the extinct.\nSo what I would like from you is to design the perfect terminations for our bikes.\nHe really did not know much about motorcycles.\nIt was late Fri. afternoon, so I did not get as much accomplished as I wanted. Crew goes home at 4:00.\nSo ideas and measurements so that I can send him and e-mail.\nWhat size are our battery screws? 10?\nI would need ideal dimensions of everything. Wires sizes, colors, lengths of wire, etc.\nThere is nothing wrong with your company, but as I understand it, they are the sole supplier. And with VAT and shipping we get killed over here. Maybe we can get some competition going. This company is just transitioning from warehouse to manufacturing.\nBob, Lifetime bike: '71 T120R, bought in '71 at Ken Heanes, England. #717534 - 12/03/17 5:24 am Re: How close can alternator wire run to EI harness?

You find the cost of buying the correct tools prohibitive, yet you are considering paying a manufacturing firm with no motorcycle experience to re invent the wheel? The perfect electrical terminals are already available and easily obtained. I know this because I sat down with the Autosparks website for an hour, made up a list of cables, terminals and crimp tools and pressed buy.

I don't know about Boyer etc., But I know my Sparx has a multi connector, in which there are multiple standard size spades with a little pin on the back to hold them in the connector. (Most do). How about proper factory made quality UL approved and pullout tested termination with the proper color wire, example, male spade to females flag spade for first coil connection? Pop it correct end in the multi. and flag to coil, flag (red wire) to flag for coil to coil connection, etc.\nI should have taken a picture. But first coil connection looked a lot like this picture, except it had a female straight spade, improperly formed like the first (on top) in this picture. http:/ / vintagebikemagazine.com/ wp-content/ uploads/ 2014/ 04/ 12_terminals-256x266.jpg\nNot only that but it was made with a \"pre insulated\" female spade. Everytime the seat went up and down that improper connection was flexed resulting in broken strands.\nIMHO, those pre insulated termination may have a use sometimes, and are down and dirty quick, but but they are terrible in being rigid, so crimp on the wire insulator must hold and heat shrink must be applied and that heat shrink has precious little to grip to on the termination side. I don't like them in the coil connections with a straight, (standard, most common, female spade.)\nBob, Lifetime bike: '71 T120R, bought in '71 at Ken Heanes, England. #717712 - 12/04/17 7:47 pm Re: How close can alternator wire run to EI harness?

If you chose to close, fair dinkum to you. I think that you may have been interested.\nI found the few posts about humidity/temperature interesting (I am one of these fellows who likes the details).\nA general law is that any chemical reaction will proceed more slowly as the temperature is lowered. I am of course thinking of oxidative corrosion (rusting on ferrous metals our concern here).\nWere you to put your metal in an atmosphere of dry air (even pure oxygen), alloy will rapidly tarnish and go no further, nothing will happen to chrome & nickel, iron and steel will very slowly produce a fine oxide surface (nothing like rust).\nAll of the nasty corrosion we experience is due to even the slightest presence of water on the metal surface. The water acts like the electrolyte in a battery, facilitating electron transfer, which is the foodstuff of chemical reactions. Even on the most perfect looking chrome there are \"pits\" which will be the targets for this to happen.\nThe best defence is the oily rag on a regular basis, when the bike is in daily use.\nGetting back to your storage ideas, temperature variations, humidifiers etc.\nHumidity figures are relative humidity, which is the % water of what the air is capable of holding at that temperature. Warm air can hold vastly more water than cold air, eg the dryest place on earth is Antarctica.\nWhen warm moist air is cooled, it can get to the \"dew point\" where it can no longer maintain the level of water vapour as a gas. This happens when a cold surface (eg the ground in winter) drops to a lower temp than the saturated vapour above it.\nThis will also happen when a cold bike is brought into a warmer environment. A wet bike and you're on a hiding to nothing, if you don't oily rag those spots of water off, they are really having a good time as the spots dry, it is clear to see!\nStorage wise, dehumidifier won't hurt other than your electric bill, and will help if the environment is reasonably sealed. Just warm the bike in the garage say, for a day, then oily rag it. And pay the bill.\nI think the worst to do is to confine, many have done this with covers and garages on cars, if they had free ventilation?\nDave\n#717981 - Yesterday at 12:18 AM Re: How close can alternator wire run to EI harness?

So I just have to answer.\nFirstly, I did not close the post. I don't have the capability to do that. John must have. I myself had just spent an hour and a half trying to summarize things. This I did instead of going to have pizza with my congressman. And that post I wrote is gone to the ether also.\nWe risk having a conversation, because I am sure some will come in with insulting remarks, which I don't tolerate well. And that is my flaw. I can't just shrug it off. I have a too high expectation for personal conduct.\nAnyway, I am not so concerned about the outside metal stuff. I am more concerned about what is happening inside the bike. I have seen the bike sweat on the outside, so It must be sweating on the inside too. I mean dew by sweat. Condensation. We have days here when everything outside is covered with water. Days of high humidity and rapidly changing temperatures. Doesn't happen inside the house because it is warmer. But most people's houses have higher humidity. Showers, dishes, cooking, laundry, etc...So in a normal household, if you stored the bike, and there was a inconstant heat source, (sun light), radiator heat, etc, and the temp dropped and rose, then the bike would have condensation forming inside you might not see. If it were in season you could just ride it and drive off the moisture, but if this process would go on for the six months of our off season, you might have a problem. So it was suggested that I store the bike in the garage instead of the house. There is not enough room in the garage, so it is going next to the same interior wall as the garage. There is really not much of a difference between my garage and my porch.\nI am just adding the dehumidifier. I would add that to the garage too. I have two recording digital temp and humidity things and am now monitoring them. I might change my mind. Right now the bike is in the garage, not in the best place for it, in front of the garage door, where chilly air can enter upon it, but now I can still start it and drive that off, but soon the gas tank comes off. That I have stored in a closet with no ill effect. Empty of course.\nAs I mentioned, I have that pic of the pits in the barrels which I will post again if I can find it. And those were rotten metal 40 thousandth in. Maybe I just got crap metal when I bought the bike. But if you think about it. Rings are cast, barrels are cast, and bearing do not sit in oil. All at risk.\nAw for a nicosil lined barrel. I suppose I could fill the entire thing with oil. I wonder how much it would leak.\nBob, Lifetime bike: '71 T120R, bought in '71 at Ken Heanes, England. #717988 - Yesterday at 01:27 AM Re: How close can alternator wire run to EI harness?

If it's a time capsule that's a different kettle of preservatives!\nSo get the engine/oil up nice and hot, drain, and replace. Restart for a couple of minutes just to splash it around. Take the plugs out, put the engine at TDC, put a squirt of oil down each plug hole, replace plugs. Turn it over each month, leaving it at TDC. Put a good squirt of WD40 down each valve port.\nThe areas most vulnerable to corrosion are the barrels/rings and the main bearings, particularly the left main, so keep it on the main stand.\n#717995 - Yesterday at 04:29 AM Re: How close can alternator wire run to EI harness?

I wonder about the WD 40. It is good for removing oil but not leaving anything behind for protection. I usually use oil when putting it to sleep.\nOne wonder knows what will happen, and how long before you can wake it up.\nI am wondering why you think leaving it at TDC is best.\nAlso wondering why the center stand is better for the left main.\nPerhaps you start a thread on storage. I am big about leaving useful information with key words so that some one can find it.\nYou could also start one on slipping clutches and starting. I never did get around to saying how I found one, and what are the indications, and my thread is closed.\nI prefer that you start the threads. I made the mistake of telling people that a lot of bad things happened to me, and as a result, though I have recovered a lot, I still struggle. They seemed to have taken that as a signal that they could pounce on me the way they did DPO. So...If I start the thread...\nPerhaps you and I could reforge the spirit of discussion which used to exist here, in great measure, and has been replaced by something other.

The Herdius system aims to lower entry barriers into the world of crypto assets and to make a lasting, positive impression on the blockchain market. \u201c Herdius is not just another competitor in the cryptocurrency market. We see ourselves as a catalyst for Blockchain technology broadly, looking to improve transaction times, security and the user friendliness of existing cryptocurrencies, while also enabling the immediate exchange of data between different blockchains ,\u201d explained Balazs Deme, Founder and CEO of Herdius. \u201c Our vision is to create an innovative infrastructure that will exist as an independent new layer in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The network will act as a decentralised exchange that operates between the user and underlying blockchains of established cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin or Ethereum .\u201d More transactions per second The Herdius Blockchain is designed to scale more effectively than established blockchains. With a combination of the latest blockchain technology and Herdius\u2019 technical innovations, users will be able to transfer their own cryptocurrencies into the Herdius network and trade with much improved transaction times. Scalability is a major issue for many established blockchains. The Bitcoin Blockchain has the capacity to complete three to four transactions per second on average, Ethereum currently supports about 15 per second. These transaction rates lag significantly behind established payment solutions. For instance, Visa can process 1,667 transactions per second, on average. Secure and user-friendly private keys Herdius also presents a new solution for handling private keys (which users require to access their crypto token wallets). With the current solutions, users are essentially choosing between security or convenience. They can either store their crypto assets offline \u2013 in hardware wallets or on paper \u2013 or in convenient online wallets which, however, are prone to hacks or bugs. Founder, Mr. Deme noted, \u201c From a user-experience point of view, the handling of private keys continues to be a weak point for cryptocurrencies. The Herdius infrastructure has been designed to provide users with a third option that delivers more user-friendly \u2013 distributed virtual wallets. Put simply, the idea is to break up private keys into multiple encrypted pieces and store these across the network until they are needed. Through this process, users have the convenience of an online wallet, but with significantly increased security .\u201d To fully realize the project\u2019s potential, the Berlin-based company will be undertaking an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). A private presale of the Herdius token will start on December 11, 2017 with the public ICO following in early 2018. During the ICO, users can purchase the Herdius token until the hard cap of 30 million Euro in Ether is reached. The Herdius team has also set a \u201cfloor\u201d of five million Euro. If this threshold is not met, token-buyers will receive a full refund. The Herdius token will be issued in exchange for Ether, and gives buyers the opportunity to validate transactions on the Herdius blockchain, which allows them to earn transaction fees. The token will also provide users with the opportunity to provide input into the ongoing development of the network. Commitment to transparency and compliance with German law In the face of growing international criticism of the ICO model, the Herdius team is committed to carrying out the project in a manner that provides maximum transparency. \u201c From the beginning, we placed a lot of value on being clear about who we are and what we\u2019re doing, not just from an operational standpoint, but also from a legal perspective. We want our token-buyers to feel positive about their decision to work with us, \u201d stated Deme.

Losing weight can seem like an uphill task and it seemed like that to me too. I was still 19 and weighed 97 kg. The tipping point came when I was at a store and fell in love with a shirt; I was three sizes too big for it. I bought it anyway; that was my goal. I wanted to fit into it one day. And that was the beginning of my weight loss journey. My name is Jitesh Magnani and this is how I lost 27 kg by doing three things: playing sports, hitting the gym and having balanced meals. How to lose weight just by playing sports \nFor a good part of my teens, I led a sedentary lifestyle. I would binge on fried foods \u2014 samosas were my favourite \u2014 at least 2-3 times a day, have burgers, packaged foods aerated drinks and cookies and sweets like there was no tomorrow. There was no balance of vitamins, proteins, carbs and fat in my meals. As a result my waist ballooned to 44 inches and soon I began to find myself in the XXL aisle of some of my favorite fashion stores. Initially, I thought it would be impossible for me to get in shape and that I would have to live with my weight my entire life\u2026 till that day when I found that shirt which I loved but couldn\u2019t fit into. That was the day I decided to start losing weight. I did not research how to lose weight or seek any advice from people who\u2019ve lost weight nor did I consult any fitness trainer. As I was to realise later, this was a mistake. \nI simply began running and playing cricket; And I started doing what I thought was the best way to lose weight: give up carbs altogether and reduce protein in my diet. It didn\u2019t take me long to realise the blunder I had made. Sure I lost a lot of weight but I also lost a lot of muscle and energy. To be precise I lost 12 kg in about 18 months and brought my weight down from 97 kg to 85 kg just by playing sports and doing cardio. But along with fat, I had also lost a lot of muscle. That\u2019s when I realised it is essential to do weight training to maintain muscle mass. I have made a lot of mistakes on my way but that\u2019s how I have learnt and now I know my body absolutely well. How to lose weight by making the most of your gym \nMy research on how to lose weight the healthy way started from there. I realised how critical a role weight lifting plays. And so decided to join the gym, but I was intimidated by people around me with ripped physiques and lean muscles. This shook my confidence at first, but I kept going. \nOnce I joined the gym, I ensured that I trained for at least 5-6 times a week, for one hour per day. I did not opt for fancy workouts and complex diet plans, I stuck to the basics and introduced new variations at regular intervals so that the body doesn\u2019t get used to only one particular set of exercises. I would target 1 muscle group per day and do five different variations for the same. I would generally keep two days of gap between back and legs exercises, so as not to strain those muscles. Coming down from 85 kg to 70 kg my gym workouts helped me put on muscle while losing those extra inches/fat. I brought down my waist size to 31 inches and, for a change, I was feeling healthy and not malnourished.

He said \"my view is a dead terrorist can't cause any harm to Britain.\" At least 800 people have left the UK to join ISIS in Iraq or Syria. Other terror experts have said they should instead be reintegrated. \nBritain's new Defence Secretary has unequivocally threatened to kill Britons who leave the country to fight for ISIS.\nGavin Williamson  told the Daily Mail on Wednesday evening :\n\"I do not believe that any terrorist, whether they come from this country or any other, should ever be allowed back into this country. [...]\n\"Quite simply my view is a dead terrorist can't cause any harm to Britain.\"\nWilliamson added that British fighters who flee the UK for other countries would be hunted down and prevented from returning home or finding havens in other countries. \nHe said: \"Make sure there is no safe space for them, that they can\u2019t go to other countries preaching their hate, preaching their cult of death.\"\nThis could mean seizing their passports if they try to cross international borders, the Daily Mail said.\nWilliamson's threat was harsher than that of his predecessor, Michael Fallon, who resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations last month .\nIn October, Fallon said British nationals who have chosen to fight for ISIS in Iraq or Syria have made themselves \"a legitimate target\" and \"run the risk every hour of every day of being on the wrong end of an RAF or a United States missile,\" according to The Telegraph .\nWilliamson's Wednesday remarks echoed those of Rory Stewart, an international development minister, who said last month : \"The only way of dealing with them [foreign fighters] will be, in almost every case, to kill them.\"\nMeanwhile, Max Hill QC, the UK's official anti-terror watchdog, has said that teenagers who joined ISIS \"out of a sense of naivety\" should be reintegrated into British society so as to avoid \"losing a generation.\"\nAt least 800 Britons have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight for ISIS, according to the BBC .

The new program includes the only free assessment of its kind to evaluate website workloads and performance data to develop an optimal cloud architecture. The assessment helps prioritize requirements to optimize performance, realize continuous operation, and leverage automated testing for e-commerce and high-traffic websites.\u201d \nThe release goes on, \u201cSuccessfully migrating a business-critical website to Azure has many advantages, but also potential challenges that can be resolved by architecting a solution that does not under-size or over-build an environment. However, the course of action one takes to plan for current and future requirements of web infrastructure is often a determining factor in future performance and costs. With a detailed assessment of the site\u2019s operating environment, organizations are provided the intelligence to ensure business flexibility, geographic reach, real-time monitoring, and performance that scales based on website demands that are factored into the design of an Azure-powered environment.\u201d \nIt continues, \u201cThe Atmosera Azure Website Migration Assessment Program informs businesses by providing a clear roadmap with technology options to make better decisions. The analysis is conducted by Atmosera certified architects in a thorough review of data points from all areas of the existing website. The process requires approximately two weeks to complete and is used to validate whether Azure can deliver for the business. The organization benefits from the intelligence gathered from existing workloads over the two-week assessment period.\u201d \nRead more at PR Web . \nPhoto credit: Atmosera By: A.R.

All he knew was that he was disgusted by the prevalence of police brutality and the systematic racism in the US, and had to do something to raise awareness. \nAs a result of his protest \u2014 which technically hasn\u2019t ended, Kaepernick became an icon. His fame came with death threats, of course, but he brushed most off to continue protesting what he perceives as injustice. He said at the time, \u201cWhen there\u2019s significant change and I feel like the flag represents what it\u2019s supposed to represent in this country, I\u2019ll stand.\u201d \nBecause his actions have influenced millions of people, it was recently announced that the athlete is one of the 10 candidates for TIME\u2019s \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d for 2017. Kaepernick is in the running along with President Donald Trump, special counsel Robert Mueller, and the #MeToo movement, among others. \nAs USA Today reports , the magazine strives to identify \u201cthe person or group of people who most influenced the news during the past year, for better or for worse.\u201d In 2016, President Trump was recognized by the magazine. And in 2015, German Chancellor Angela Merkel was recognized as the \u201cPerson of the Year.\u201d \nKaepernick made the list not only because he caused a ripple effect by kneeling during the National Anthem, but because he refused to back down when others challenged his beliefs. As a result of his determination and bravery, dozens of NFL players have since taken a knee, sat on the bench, or raised a fist to protest before games this season. According to the Associated Press , 18 players demonstrated in some form last Sunday while The Star-Spangled Banner was played. \nThe simple form of protest has drawn the ire of many, including US President Donald Trump. He called the effort unpatriotic and disrespectful to the military. On Twitter, he also called the NFL \u201cweak and out of control.\u201d \nResponses such as this reveal weakness, rather than strength. For the United States of America to become the safe haven it was once portrayed to be \u2014 and to an extent, still is, leaders need to work with all factions of the populace to create a system steeped equality and understanding. Until President Trump recognizes this, protests such as the one Kaepernick incited will only become more prevalent. \nWhat are your thoughts? Please comment below and share this news!

Photo: Arctic Circle \nWith global interest in the Arctic growing, Scotland is the latest non-Arctic nation to claim it has exceptional interests in the region. At the recent Arctic Circle conference in Edinburgh, the Scottish Government took this claim a step further by announcing it intended to develop its own Arctic Strategy, distinct from the broader Arctic Policy Framework established by the UK Government in Westminster in 2013. This presents complications for the UK, but it also raises questions about how regional actors from beyond the Arctic are contesting state-centric interpretations of what constitutes a legitimate Arctic stakeholder. Arctic Re-enchantment \nDespite important historical and contemporary connections to the Arctic, the United Kingdom (UK) is not seen to be an \u2018Arctic state\u2019 by Arctic Council states and Permanent Participants. But it is proximate to the Arctic, and, as Duncan Depledge sets out in Britain and the Arctic , over the past decade, Britain\u2019s scientific, commercial, and environmental connections and interests in and to the Arctic have expanded since the end of the Cold War. \nIn the past five years alone there have been five separate parliamentary inquiries into the UK\u2019s interests in Arctic affairs cutting across environmental protection, defense, and strategy. The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) has invested more than \u00a330 million in British Arctic science and established an \u2018Arctic Office\u2019 in Cambridge to better coordinate the UK\u2019s scientific output. In 2013, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office\u2019s Polar Regions Department (PRD) published the UK Government\u2019s first (and so far only) white paper on the Arctic, making the UK the first non-Arctic state to do so. \nFar less noticeable, though, has been the parallel emergence of a constituency of Scottish society claiming that Scotland has an even stronger claim to be recognized as an Arctic stakeholder than the rest of the UK. The first real sign of this was an article published in 2011 by Angus Robertson, who at the time was the Scottish National Party\u2019s (SNP) leader in Westminster. In it, he claimed that \u201cThe UK has opted out of taking a serious approach to the economic and military changes the melting ice cap will bring\u201d, apparently in response to the failure of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) to mention the Arctic even once, and, specifically, the Ministry of Defence\u2019s decision to scrap the UK\u2019s Maritime Patrol Aircraft. \nThat was followed in 2012 with a paper published by the Scottish law professor, Rachael Lorna Johnstone in the Arctic Yearbook . In it, she claimed that \u201cScotland has quite distinct [from the rest of the UK] historical, social, economic and political interests in the Arctic\u201d, and that the UK Government\u2019s apparent disinterest in the Arctic put at risk Scotland\u2019s ability to pursue those interests. \nThe timing of these expressions of Scottish \u2018Arctic-ness\u2019 cannot be ignored, coming as they did in the run-up to the Scottish independence referendum in 2014. Indeed, it is worth noting that claims about Scotland\u2019s distinct interests in the Arctic have come almost exclusively from the SNP. This was evident in the hearing held by the Scottish Affairs Committee in Westminster earlier this year, where it was not clear whether non-SNP members of the Committee were as enchanted about Scotland independently renewing its own distinct connections to the Arctic. \nThe SNP\u2019s interest is therefore perhaps best understood as an expression of independence, and a desire to envision and build a distinctly \u2018northern\u2019 (as suggested by the the Scottish Government\u2019s recent Nordic Baltic Policy Statement ) future for Scotland, girded by the claim that the UK Government in Westminster is not only holding them back from the Arctic, but is also ignoring Scotland\u2019s distinct interests in, and historical connections to, the region. In the nineteenth century, for example, Scotland was a world leader in Arctic whaling and the industry was based out of Aberdeen and Dundee. Today, John MacDonald of the Scottish Global Forum argues that Scotland is more exposed to changes in the Arctic (potentially impacting fisheries, search and rescue, pollution levels, and port developments) than the rest of the UK. \nOne might reasonably ask, then, whether the SNP has a point? After all, a report surfaced in 2014 that the Scottish Government was not consulted by Westminster during the drafting of the UK\u2019s Arctic Policy Framework. Indeed, the word \u2018Scotland\u2019 does not appear once in the entire forty page document. Lorna Johnstone, meanwhile, has argued that because the UK has a very wide-angled strategic gaze (one that will soon underpin \u2018Global Britain\u2019), the Arctic is not afforded enough priority, and that Scotland may bear the brunt of any missed commercial and political opportunities. \nThe failure to involve the Scottish Government in consultations was a misstep in a post-devolution context. Yet the absence of specific references to Scotland, in a paper that presented the UK\u2019s interests in the broadest possible terms, might not be that surprising. The direction of political travel in Westminster has been to emphasize the value of the UK Arctic science community per se, coordinated through NERC\u2019s Arctic Office, which works closely with other bodies including the Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS). \nMore widely, SAMS has played a substantial role in the development of UK Arctic policy over the last decade, having conducted a major review of Arctic science in 2008, and hosted a UK Arctic Stakeholder\u2019s Workshop in Oban that same year. SAMS also worked in partnership with the Royal Geographical Society and the British Antarctic Survey to jointly develop the educational website discoveringthearctic.org .uk. Scottish actors, commercial and scientific, have enriched and enabled the UK\u2019s approach to the Arctic, most recently by hosting NERC\u2019s annual Arctic Science Conference Edinburgh and the Arctic Circle \nThe Arctic Circle came to Edinburgh in November 2017 after meetings in Quebec, Singapore, Nuuk, and Anchorage. With the exception of the Asian city-state of Singapore, the other places are all major Arctic centers located in the Arctic states of Canada, Denmark, and the United States. So, Edinburgh is arguably a hybrid location\u2014the capital city of a northern country with a long history of Arctic commercial endeavor, exploration, and scientific research, but also a constituent part of the UK. \nThe global showcasing of Arctic Circle as a \u2018bazaar\u2019 has been the project of \u00d3lafur Ragnar Gr\u00edmsson, who served as Iceland\u2019s President from 1996 to 2016. In April 2013, Gr\u00edmsson announced that Iceland would, later that year, begin hosting a new annual assembly of international Arctic stakeholders, named \u2018 Arctic Circle \u2019. The aim of the assembly would be to \u201cstrengthen the policymaking process [in/for the Arctic] by bringing together as many Arctic and international players as possible under one large tent\u201d because \u201cthe Arctic has suffered from a lack of global awareness and, as a result, a lack of effective governance\u201d (emphasis added by authors). \nThe timing of the announcement was not innocent, coming as it did shortly before the Arctic Council was due to decide whether to open itself up to more observers, predominantly from South- and South-East Asian states. As the authors have written elsewhere, \u201cthere was palpable feeling at the time that Gr\u00edmmson was challenging the Arctic Council to take on a more global profile, with a view that should the Arctic Council reject the observer applications, then the Arctic Circle would be prepared to provide an alternative platform for global interest to be expressed in the Arctic\u201d. Implicit within this was a question about whether\u2014or at least, the extent to which\u2014the eight Arctic States (A8) should retain their political, economic, and even ideational dominance in Arctic affairs. The latter being rooted in what Depledge has termed the \u2018principle of circumpolarity\u2019 (that states with territory north of the Arctic Circle have primacy in the region). \nJust a few weeks after the inaugural Arctic Circle , Gr\u00edmmson arrived in London to speak at the Poles Apart conference in London, organized by James Gray MP (who now chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group for the Polar Regions in Westminster). There, Grimsson challenged the UK Government to be more explicit about its interests in the Arctic. A year later, Gray led a sizeable (and very visible) British delegation to take part in the second Arctic Circle assembly. However, significantly, the delegation was not led by the British Government (although it did carry with it a video message from the then-Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond), and although the UK has had a presence at every Arctic Circle meeting since, it has been low key. \nSeemingly unable to get a high-profile member of the British Government to give a major speech at Arctic Circle , in 2016, Gr\u00edmsson turned to Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the SNP, who accepted his invitation. Afterwards, their relationship strengthened and over lunch the two agreed that Edinburgh should host one of Arctic Circle \u2019s satellite forums. A further one is planned for the Faroe Islands in 2018. What arguably unites these disparate locations is that they represent a \u2018network of the marginalized\u2019\u2014nations that feel that their voices are not being heard in the Arctic (and with the exception of Singapore, all nations that are constituent parts of larger Arctic states). \nSensing, perhaps, that these nations are being failed by a state-centric Arctic that principally revolves around the eight Arctic states and various observer states, Gr\u00edmsson has managed to create new venues wherein their interests can be exhibited and pursued. The UK does not appear to have pursued the opportunity to host a forum meeting in London. Scotland, though, seized it, and with the announcement that it will publish a Scottish Arctic Strategy the Scottish Government appears keen to follow Gr\u00edmsson in testing out far it can go by operating in the margins in the formal geopolitical architecture of the Arctic region. \nThe UK Government now has to consider what that means for its own public approach to the Arctic. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has repeatedly stated on the public record that it does not like the term \u2018strategy\u2019, and that when it published the Arctic Policy Framework in 2013 it had to be very careful not to provoke a \u2018backlash\u2019 from the Arctic states\u2014who were coming to terms with the admittance of new Asian observer states such as China, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore. \nThat raises several interesting questions that remain to be answered. First, is Scotland about to show that the UK been too cautious in its approach? Second, how will the UK Government respond given that the UK Arctic Policy Framework is due for revision? Is the UK Government content for Scotland to lead the way or will it have to \u2018trump\u2019 the Scottish position with its own Arctic strategy, or even by appointing an Arctic/Polar special representative (perhaps before the Scottish Government does\u2014the SNP recently called a Westminster Hall Debate on whether the UK should appoint an Arctic ambassador)? And if Scotland does escape \u2018censure\u2019 from the A8 for daring to publish an Arctic strategy, what does that mean for the principle of circumpolarity and the formal geopolitical architecture of the Arctic, which has traditionally revolved around a clear division about who can and cannot strategize about the Arctic and who can and does \u2018observe\u2019 regional governance? \nDuncan Depledge is the author of Britain and the Arctic .

I expect the man in the thick of this imbroglio to be on edge, angsty, frustrated. Instead, Kapoor, dressed in white shorts and a grey jersey top, as if he\u2019s just about to step out for an evening run, greets me with a benign smile. \nYou often post images of you and Misha together. You seem to be particularly delighted to be the father of a daughter. \nIt\u2019s special; I don\u2019t think anyone else can make you feel like a daughter can. I don\u2019t know how long it lasts, how it changes and evolves. But I often catch the expression on other women\u2019s faces when I\u2019m with my daughter, and I can feel they\u2019re seeing themselves with their fathers. That\u2019s beautiful to me, because it reassures me that when I\u2019m old, Misha won\u2019t forget these moments we\u2019ve spent together. There are times when I think, I\u2019m doing all this, but she won\u2019t remember this. Later, she might wonder why I\u2019m so involved in her life, without understanding that she\u2019s so much a part of my reality\u2026 I don\u2019t know, in general, even as babies I think girls are better than boys. They seem more sensible, more sorted. They\u2019re not as cranky or dumb. \nHas your way of looking at the world changed since you became a father? \nI worry about the future much more. Of course, this is because I know my daughter\u2019s growing up in this atmosphere. I want to protect her. But I do think that the times to come are going to be more about women than men. Change is coming \u2013 and it\u2019s already palpable. In fact, sometimes I fear for men because we\u2019re vulnerable too. Now they\u2019ll be even more on the back foot. But I\u2019m happy that Misha\u2019s going to grow up in a world where women have come into their own. \nTo read the complete interview, grab your copy of GQ India\u2019s December 2017 issue, out on stands soon.

Photo: Corrimal High School, north of Wollongong NSW. (ABC Illawarra: Chloe Hart) \nRumours of the student-teacher relations spread around the school but both denied the allegations. \nThe girl then reported the incident to her mother and police, which led to Majoor's arrest at his parents' house where he lived. \nThe Department of Education immediately terminated Majoor's employment as a teacher upon his arrest. Victims say their lives have been ruined \nBoth girls submitted victim impact statements where they said the encounters ruined their lives. \nThe 16-year-old told the court she had been traumatised and was being treated for depression, anxiety and anger management. \nShe said she had not been able to eat, had lost a significant amount of weight and had to change schools. \nBoth victims endured severe bullying from fellow students. \nThey said their relations with the former teacher were wrong and wished it had never happened. \nBoth victims attended the sentencing with their families, as well as a large cohort of Majoor's family and friends. Court hears of 'huge mistake' by 'outstanding member of society' \nThe court heard Majoor described as an outstanding member of the community, having received a bravery award for saving an elderly woman from a house fire. \nIt heard he was held in high esteem for his contributions as a lifesaver and sportsman. \nThe judge considered positive personal references detailing how he had helped fellow inmates with literacy and health programs during his time in custody since February. \nHowever the judge said taking into account his good character, he breached the trust of two vulnerable girls in his care who both required support from their offender. \nA psychological report found an average risk of re-offending and average risk of sexual recidivism. Eligible for release in October \nOn sentencing, the judge said Majoor showed little remorse or understanding of the harm he had caused his victims. \nHe was sentenced to three years and four months in prison with a non-parole period of one year and eight months. \nHe would be eligible for release in October 2018. \nBoth victims appeared visibly upset by the sentencing outcome.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "majoor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chloe hart", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "illawarra", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "corrimal high school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of education", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abc illawarra", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wollongong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wollongong district", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "snapchat", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:16.024+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f70391a32216b3d593705c8641fe7d7447456ef8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMo2LPKeCGKh_hggVeWqk60LHHDdvIbJQOYrAMsEcmc5UAOhyVo2kJzLMtrzTn3F2shamtxaheaA7W_TkKeGPdDyHJ9yMLWItUo-", "site_full": "thefarmingforum.co.uk", "site": "thefarmingforum.co.uk", "site_section": "http://thefarmingforum.co.uk/index.php?forums/dairy-farming/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Dairy Farming | The Farming Forum", "title": "Milk price drop! | Page 4", "title_full": "Milk price drop! | Page 4 | The Farming Forum", "published": "2017-12-07T09:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 26, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.156, "main_image": "https://thefarmingforum.co.uk/styles/farmingforum/xenforo/avatars/avatar_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34787, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "941363c60519717ce0908977f7eb6dc37b70f307", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMo2LPKeCGKh_hggVeWqk60LHHDdvIbJQOYrAMsEcmc5UAOhyVo2kJzLMtrzTn3F2shamtxaheaA7W_TkKeGPdDyF4D8QOyRMCwADR.XVCpWJcZeseFaLLHR", "ord_in_thread": 20, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T21:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Headless chicken said: \u2191 If they drop it too low there shall be no wheat to be trying to sort chaff from Click to expand...

I've been seeing a lot of my European blogger friends raved about certain makeup items from this brand, so the fact that I can now freely picking them up at the store makes me happy. As excited as I could be, I visited their Avenue K outlet on its first day of opening. \nH&M Beauty Department is currently available in four stores: \n(1) Lot 10 \n(2) Avenue K \n(3) 1 Utama \n(4) Sunway Pyramid \n\nThere are over 1000 beauty products to choose from so I won't blame you if you have a hard time to decide on just a few. I swatched few of their blushes, highlighters, bronzers and foundations. I've also tested out their lipsticks and spritzes. There were a lot of things and choices, I got overwhelmed but I did somehow not being super crazy on that day because I was separating my budget for things I wanted to get from Sephora. \n\n\n\nBefore getting into haul and recommendations, let me show you some pictures I took on the day of the official launch. \n\n\n\n\u2764 Price list \u2764 \n- not complete, will update soon. \n\nFACE (BASE) \n1) Natural Satin Foundation (RM74.00) \n2) All-Day Liquid Foundation (RM74.00) \n3) Cover Up Concealer (RM39.90) \n4) Custom Concealer Trio (RM49.90) \n5) Loose Powder (RM59.90) \n6) Custom Color Drops Darkening (RM74.90) \n7) Custom Color Drops Lightening (RM74.90) \n\nFACE (BLUSH, HIGHLIGHT AND CONTOUR) \n1)  Pure Radiance Powder Blusher (RM44.90) \n2) Solar Flair Bronzing Powder (RM49.90) \n3) Light and Shade Contour Duo (RM49.90) \n4) All Over Highlighter (RM74.90) \n5) Illuminating Luster Powder (RM59.90) \n6) Illuminating Drops (RM49.90) \n\nEYES \n1) Infinite Impact Eye Color (RM29.90) \n2) Soft Kajal Eye Pencil (RM29.90) \n3) Color Essence Eye Pencil (RM29.90) \n4) Superfine Brownliner (RM39.90) \n5) Tuscan Escape Eye Palette (RM99.90) \n\nLIPS \n1) Lip Color To Go (RM29.90) \n2) Lush Lip Vinyl (RM44.90) \n3) Vivid Lip Lacquer Summer 2017 (RM44.90) \n4) Matte Lip Color (RM49.90) \n5) Cream Lip Color Cream (RM49.90) \n\nTOOLS & ETC \n1) Nail Polish (RM24.90) \n2) Oil Fusion Nail Color (RM24.90) \n3) Precision 4 Mini Sponges (RM39.90) \n4) Precision Lash Curler (RM44.90) \n5) Contour And Glow Brush Kit (RM74.90 ) \n6) Essential Brush Kit (RM99.90) \n\nHAIR & BODY CARE \n1) Capsule Face Mask (RM12.90) \n2) Hand Cream (RM39.90) \n3) Hand Wash (RM39.90) \n4) Vitalising Body Scrub (RM49.90) \n5) Pre-Shampoo Oil (RM44.90) \n6) Texture Styler For Hair (RM44.90) \n7) Refreshing Mist with Aloe Vera (RM24) \n- Mimosa and Honey \n- Bergamot and Lime \n- Coconut and Vanilla \n- Goji and Watermelon \n\n\nIf you only wanting to pick up ONE thing, then personally, I feel like you need to get any of their single eyeshadows , or blusher. I can't actually choose. Both are really good. Not only they have amazing pigmentation and buttery consistency, the range of colours are also versatile and pretty. Plus, most of them are soft to the touch and it's nothing like cheapo feeling eyeshadows.  \n\nI noticed that these shadows are made in Italy, and everyone knows that they generally produce good products especially when it comes to powders containing pigments. Some brands like Hourglass, Milani and Kiko has products originated from that country. It's nothing new that I love burnt orange shade for my crease, so it's no surprise I gravitated towards \" CANYON CLAY \" from the Infinite single eyeshadow collection. It has burnt orange shade to it and you can never go wrong with a warm shade like this. Meanwhile, \" BACI DI DAMA \", \" ORANGE OCHRE \" and \" BROWNIE POINTS \" are the shade recommended by Kathleen Lights. Go for single eyeshadow and skipped the palette \ud83d\ude06. \n\nBlushers and bronzing powders are also pigmented and blend well. I didn't pick up the blush (I will the next time I'm in H&M) but I swatched them in store and some of the shade were long-lasting, considering that they were still there by the time I went home at night o_o. I've been hearing a lot of good things too about them especially the \" Pure Radiance Powder Blusher in Golden Peach\" - it's a near dupe to NARS Orgasm. I also like their hexagonal, black and gold packaging, making everything looks sleek, luxurious and Instagram worthy. \n\nYou want another recommendation? well, you can go a little mental with the nail polishes  (and lipsticks, I guess). The nail polish selection was insane! and everything below RM25. I didn't buy any because I no longer have time and interest with nail polishes, but god, so many shades to choose from!!! \n\n\n\nThings I'd skip - foundation, custom colour drops (as I'm not sure if it's a silicone or water-based), eyeshadow palettes (again), brushes and sponges. From my experience, most of the brushes are scratchy and the single, Precision Black & White sponges are disappointing. Well just buy the original Beauty Blender or Breena Beauty Blending Pearl instead. I wished I didn't get any of these. \n\nOkay enough with my little rundown. Now, onto my haul. I saved quite a lot for my purchase because I was using the opening discount promotion. Let me know if you want me to review any of these in a separate blog post.  \n\n\n\n\nHave you tried anything from H&M Beauty Department?  or what are you interested in getting?
