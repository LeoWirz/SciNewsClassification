This is not the case, why is Telstra not Informing competitors or consumers about Pair-Gain  phone lines that inhibit ADSL2+ installations, I believe this is misleading the consumer.

Photo: PLA \nDate and exact location of exercise isn\u2019t revealed but announcement said to be aimed at sending a message to Washington and Seoul \nChina\u2019s air force recently staged drills involving various aircraft through \u201croutes and areas it has never flown before\u201d over the Yellow and East seas near the Korean peninsula. \nAir force spokesman Shen Jinke made the announcement at an airport in northern China on Monday \u2013 the same day the United States and South Korea began their biggest joint air force exercise, and days after Pyongyang launched its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile to date. Without specifying the date or exact location of the drills, Shen said warplanes had ventured into unknown areas, adding that this kind of training would become a regular feature as the air force worked to strengthen its capabilities so that it was ready to safeguard China\u2019s strategic interests. The exercise involved aircraft including reconnaissance planes, fighter jets, an early warning and control aircraft, and a joint operation with surface-to-air missile units, he said. Beijing-based military expert Li Jie said the drills were intended to show that the People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force was making strides in joint operations, which are an important part of modern warfare. He added that Monday\u2019s announcement was also aimed at sending a message to the United States and South Korea. \u201c The timing of this high-profile announcement by the PLA is also a warning to Washington and Seoul not to provoke Pyongyang any further, \u201d Li said. Although the specific location of the drills was not revealed, military affairs specialist Song Zhongping said the air force may have flown over sensitive areas of China\u2019s air defence identification zone (ADIZ) over the East China Sea that overlaps with Japanese and South Korean airspace.

Then she was like oh let me look under expedia reservations and found it and said it would be no issue to reserved a crib. Then when we arrived at the hotel they told me they hadn\u2019t saved one for us but they could bring it right over. Three hours later they still hadn\u2019t brought it over. So I called and they said oh we have to make sure we have one. They got lucky they did because I would have become one angry momma. Finally when they brought the crib over we were setting it up and we found TWO scary black spiders in it. Like are you kidding me my baby has to sleep in that!! As for the rest of the hotel the blankets on the bed don\u2019t seem like they were actually clean. They have terrible cheap complimentary soap on the wall in the a dispenser which the conditioner seemed like they added a lot of water to make it last longer.

However, there is much more to the story than ascertaining that Rutgers isn't good enough to beat really good teams yet. The key word is yet, because the gap is certainly closing. After playing the worst non-conference schedule in the country through its first six games of the season, Rutgers just played three teams ranked in the top 30 of the KenPom rankings. It's the toughest three game stretch that the program has faced in the Steve Pikiell era and actually, statistically the most challenging in many seasons. It was a true test to gauge where this team is less than a third into Pikiell\u2019s second season. While Rutgers does have to play Michigan State and Purdue on the road in a three game stretch in early January, the rest of the Big Ten schedule is much less daunting. For those hoping for some type of offensive awakening, you will surely be disappointed. Rutgers continues to struggle shooting the basketball from any distance from the rim. They shot a combined 53 of 154 from two-point range for a putrid 34.4% in the three losses. In addition, Rutgers made just 14 of 50 three-point attempts for 28%. Give them credit for making major improvement from the free throw line though, as they made 44 of 56 attempts for 78.6%, after shooting just 57.7% through the first six games this season. However, basketball is a simple game in the sense that if you can't score in an efficient enough of a manner, a loss is likely, especially against top competition. Rutgers struggling to the shoot the basketball efficiently should be no surprise. The biggest takeaway is how they performed in every other area, which should leave fans encouraged and hopeful for the rest of this season. This team plays very hard, plays together, and are fully committed on the defensive end. Last week, Rutgers hosted Florida State, a very deep and athletic team that would have left the RAC 30+ point winners in any other season in recent memory. Instead, Rutgers battled them all night and even scored well enough to give Florida State a major challenge. It wasn't enough, but a 5 point loss and holding the high scoring Seminoles to 13 points below its season average were obvious signs that Rutgers was improving. Watching that same Florida State team blow out #5 Florida in Gainesville by 17 points on Monday night made the effort of Rutgers in that game even more impressive. The first road game of the season was about as challenging as it gets in the Big Ten, as Minnesota is clearly one of the three best teams in the conference. The Gophers starting five is very good and extremely balanced. Rutgers was not nearly as good in that game on the defensive end and the veteran core of Deshawn Freeman , Corey Sanders , and Mike Williams struggled, making just 9 of 37 shots and combining to score only 23 points. And yet, there were the Scarlet Knights, battling on the road and keeping the game between 8-12 points with under five minutes to play, before a 15-5 run by Minnesota turned a competitive game into a 22 point loss. Corey Sanders sat on the bench the final seven minutes of the game because Pikiell continues to choose culture over convenience, something I'll get back to in a bit. That brings us to last night. Michigan State has been murdering teams lately and not just against average competition either. In its last five games, the Spartans beat #9 Notre Dame and #13 North Carolina by 18 points each. They also beat UConn by 20 and Nebraska in the Big Ten opener by 29 points. Enter its trip to the RAC and a far different result occurred. Rutgers came out focused and even made some shots early, jumping out to an 8-0 lead. It wasn't surprising that Rutgers couldn't sustain the lead and when they fell behind 21-14 behind an 11-0 Spartans run, a familiar feeling crept in. As a Rutgers fan, if you weren\u2019t thinking \u201cwell, that was nice while it lasted, here comes a 30 point shellacking\u201d, something that Michigan State has routinely done against Rutgers since joining the Big Ten, then you are certainly a rarity. Instead, behind the best defensive performance in a game that we've probably seen since Pikiell took over the program, Rutgers clawed its way back into the contest behind a 7-0 run and went into the locker room at the half tied with the #3 ranked Spartans. The least surprising thing should be the fact that Rutgers shot just 27% from the field against the #1 team in the country in field goal percentage defense. Yes, Rutgers missed about a dozen shots within 5 feet of the rim, but that\u2019s also something the Spartans defend well against everyone, as opponents are only making 32% of their two-point attempts against them, the best mark in the country. What is a major surprise is that Rutgers held Michigan State to 38.6% shooting, a season worst (MSU shot 50.8% from the floor in its lone loss to Duke). It was also 19 points below its season scoring average. One person that wasn't surprised about that was Spartans head coach and college basketball legend Tom Izzo. Here is what he had to say after the game: \u201cTheir defense on us was pretty good and they executed well. That\u2019s a good basketball team. When I watched Florida State beat the daylights out of Florida last night, then watch Rutgers playing Florida State, I was concerned. I love the way these kids play. They play hard. I love Freeman, he plays hard. The freshman Geo Baker is going to be good. I liked Eugene Omoruyi . I liked their effort and Steve\u2019s doing a good job.\u201d The good news is that this challenging three game stretch is now complete. Aside from Seton Hall and Purdue, ranked 19th and 9th at the moment per KenPom, every other team that visits the RAC this season is much closer talent wise to this Rutgers team. The reality is that aside from the top three teams in the conference (Michigan State, Minnesota, Purdue), the rest of the competition is much tighter, as the talent separation between fourth through fourteen is much smaller than in years past. Rutgers actually rose six spots from #116 to #110 in the KenPom rankings, based on how they played against top 30 competition, despite losing all three games. Here is what coach Pikiell had to say about the state of the team after the loss to Michigan State: \u201cWe\u2019re close. I said that to them. It\u2019s a couple of possessions. Again, playing a great team, you\u2019ve got to play great. I thought on the defensive end we certainly did some good things. We were even on the backboards. They\u2019ve been kind of manhandling teams on the backboards. They\u2019re a terrific program, I said that to our guys, but we\u2019ve got to continue the climb. It\u2019s a process. Again, I loved our crowd here today. I love the students. I want to thank them for coming out and making this a tough place to play. Hopefully they\u2019ll continue to do that for us.\u201d If this team can continue to defend at or near the level they did last night, they can be competitive in every conference game this season and win more in league play than ever before. Other keys include getting the veteran core of Sanders, Freeman and Williams going offensively, continuing to make free throws, as well as keeping everyone healthy. If they can do all of those things, regardless of the shooting struggles from the field that we know will be a constant this season, Rutgers can make some noise in the Big Ten. The fact that the RAC is becoming a true home court advantage once again is a factor and real weapon that this team can tap into and benefit from. The Big Ten is an ugly league and Rutgers knows how to win that way. Through defense, rebounding, and playing together, they can have some success in conference play. Don\u2019t lose patience, as this team is on schedule to do two things this season that would mark undeniable progress, finish better than last place for the first time in four tries and finish with a winning record for the first time in over a decade. The culture that Pikiell has established and has never sacrificed over anything else has made this possible. As coach said, this team is close and last night it was clear a real transformation is happening with this program. Better days are most certainly ahead.
