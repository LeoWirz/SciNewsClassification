The impact on prices has been more pronounced in the Western Cape due to the culling of layer hens and the subsequent supply shortages on the region\u2019s shelves.\u201d \nAccording to the latest data from Statistics South Africa (StatsSA), the price of eggs increased by 8.5% year-on-year (y/y) during October 2017. This trend is likely to continue in the short to medium term as supply shortages could last up to a year. \nThe impact on South Africa\u2019s consumer is likely to see egg prices increase in the range of 15% to 20% in the next few months. The industry has already recorded a 12% y/y decrease in the average weekly egg production during September 2017, according to the SA Poultry Association (SAPA). The cost of egg distribution is also likely to increase following the recent fuel hike which will eventually be passed on to the consumer. \nDemand will however not change very dramatically with per capita consumption remaining around 7.9kg per person per year. \nMakube says the downstream impact is that retailers will be selling eggs at higher prices this festive season, therefore consumers will pay more for a tray of eggs. \n\u201cThe upside is that the price increase will help producers to recoup losses as they are still servicing debt incurred during the last drought. It will further place them in a better position to repopulate and increase their production which will eventually benefit the consumer in terms of an affordable source of protein,\u201d adds Makube. \nThe relatively lower maize prices will continue to improve the profitability of the sector in terms of low feeding costs. Maize prices have fallen by 53% and 38% from last year to R1,879 / ton and R1,827 / ton respectively for white and yellow maize. \nMakube says there is limited upside for maize prices given the favourable weather outlook in the season ahead. \u201cHopefully, they will pass on the benefit to the consumer towards the end of 2018 given that recovery may take up to a year, and staples such as eggs will start decreasing in price.\u201d \u2013 Press release Related Posts", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul makube", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "makube", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sa poultry association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sapa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fnb business", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "statistics south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western cape", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:39.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d5a28834bf1f7aea6fe0ea7986d45851dc51c06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0_Qq5FiTtq367ZVEB9pAxRdF4JvcnlenchpqtiVR6t2Qvj8MlXge.g11R7ehjW0LUT8U6UlcVNKDbw3kp7xhTnCU5nU.zKc8.lWwlG8YyM9Z6zMzSnZ2uJwcLaeGs.9MNQ--", "site_full": "www.lazada.sg", "site": "lazada.sg", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.sg/shop-camera-memory-cards/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Buy Camera Memory Cards Online Singapore | Lazada", "title": "SanDisk Extreme microSDXC 64GB A1 UHS-I Cards", "title_full": "SanDisk Extreme microSDXC 64GB A1 UHS-I Cards | Lazada Singapore", "published": "2017-08-30T12:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.026, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8973, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e85fc66cf1fbee4d0a2b89d627b99c5aba0e000c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0_Qq5FiTtq367ZVEB9pAxRdF4JvcnlenchpqtiVR6t2Qvj8MlXge.g11R7ehjW0LUT8U6UlcVNKDbw3kp7xhTnCU5nU.zKc8.lWwlG8YyM9Z6zMzSnZ2uJyFeSTba7aU9haroUPdf7qI", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Leo N.", "published": "2017-11-15T05:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "Product as descripted", "text": "Fast delivery and good product", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:39.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f6959c31fc1d5f6fe42e67fe2930f8dffef1c7c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRBdoLyYHfYkiuzpBncuhp4e1GXYHoskwt8Pw9CMUFCjtJtkXFMNUQIBIn.M.evje1PxU_u5OKlw--", "site_full": "www.adverts.ie", "site": "adverts.ie", "site_section": "http://www.adverts.ie/for-sale/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Adverts.ie - Recent Ads All 827,243 listings", "title": "Barely twist chairs", "title_full": "Barely twist chairs", "published": "2017-12-07T11:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://c3.adverts.ie/i/icons/notification-icon.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f6959c31fc1d5f6fe42e67fe2930f8dffef1c7c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRBdoLyYHfYkiuzpBncuhp4e1GXYHoskwt8Pw9CMUFCjtJtkXFMNUQIBIn.M.evje1PxU_u5OKlw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "Barely twist chairs", "text": "You must be logged in to contact advertiser.

It doesn't require reading comprehension, so their is a chance you crayon eaters might actually learn something. It's 20 minutes long and it's only audio so not many will make it to the end.

There is so much infamy in these latter days of republican (lower-case \u201cr\u201d) democracy that there\u2019s little point in reviving an enormity from 1941. Best leave it, In Benj\u2019s gnomic phrase, \u201cto the time of its knowing.\u201d\u2014Sometime this morning the Navy will play taps for the 948 dead sailors aboard U.S.S. Arizona. That is enough, now for then. \nToday\u2019s normalized >> infamy is the wholly Republican-owned, Congressional gift of ordinary taxpayers\u2019 money to Citizen Trump (I\u2019ll assert that as fact until his tax returns show otherwise), to his heirs, to his cronies and to their fellow-travellers\u2014who are every single American who voted for him (excluding his overt believers, who attract more strenuous phrases than fellow traveller).\u2014One of my failures of empathy is not understanding how an ordinary decent person, man or woman, could have voted for the Republican candidate, knowing what we all did know by 8 November 2016.\u2014Doing my best, and not getting very far. I\u2019ll add to the explanation salad (= misogyny, dressed with greed, with Comey & a zest of WikiLeaks) & a certain . . . a bi-partisan, \u00e9lite belief that no one so boorish could actually be elected President of the Good Ol\u2019. \nSo, >> secure in the belief that Clinton would win, Independents could sport with their votes, or not vote, while Republicans could vote as habitual, with no fear of electoral victory.\u2014As though they\u2019d never sat in the bleachers at W.C.

Be dedicated and determined to meet your goals. This article will give you some proven advice to help you successfully build muscles. Incorporate the expert tips into your fitness program and you can see solid results.\nYou will be able to build muscle faster if you take breaks between workout, days in contrast to working out every day. The reason for this is that muscles heal and grow while you are resting, and not while you are exercising. Create a workout routine that alternates between workout and rest days.\nTrain at least three times per week. You need at least three training sessions every week if you want to see significant muscle growth. If you are really new at weight training, this can be reduced to two at the start; however, you should increase the number of sessions per week as soon as you are able. If you already have some experience with strength training, you can add more sessions as well.\nIt is important to workout until you have reached muscle failure with your muscles. quero emagrecer com saude e rapido stop working out when they begin to feel the weights getting a bit hard to lift. Containing to push until your body cannot push anymore will give you the lean, strong muscles you really want.\nCalculate your consumption of protein daily. You need to consume about one gram of protein for every pound of body weight each day. Consuming the right amount of protein will increase the muscle growth you get from the weight training that you are doing. Varying the consumption by a little here and there is not going to make much of a difference, but you should strive for the same amount daily.\nMake sure to get an ample amount of sleep each night. Your muscles need time to repair themselves after you strain them during weight lifting sessions. If you do not allow the muscles to rest enough, it can lessen the results that you see from your weight lifting efforts dramatically.\nKnowing the number of sets that work for your body is vital for building muscle mass. Learn Even more Here recommend you do around twelve to sixteen sets for your large muscle groups, such as your back, chest, and legs, and about nine to twelve sets for your smaller muscle groups, such as your calves, shoulders, and arms. Although this might work for some people, this can cause others to overtrain or undertrain. This is why you must understand the way your body responds to workouts.\n\nTry doing plyometric exercises. These types of muscles develop fast-twitch muscle fibers in your body, which assist you in stimulating muscle growth. Since acceleration is required, plyometric exercises are not unlike ballistic moves. The plyometric push-up, for instance, involves launching yourself up as high as possible, removing your hands from the floor.\nTry training just one side of your body. By doing this, you are able to utilize an additional amount of your body\u2019s muscle fibers, which can cause you to increase your strength and muscle size a lot more effectively. Examples of this type of training include single-leg presses, single-arm overhead presses, and one-arm pulldowns.\nLearn to find your limit, but do not stop an exercise until you have used all your resources. With every set that you do, try to push your body until you can not lift even one more pound. You can shorten your sets when you start to get tired, but do not stop until you have no energy left to continue.\nPush yourself hard while you are working out, to the point where you feel like you could not lift one more pound. You want to always be giving your maximum effort if you want to see a payoff. Hard work will equal the results that you are looking for.\nLike any other strength training exercise, squats require good form. Keep the bar low on the back at a point near the traps center. Doing this puts more pressure on your glutes, hamstrings and hips, which means you can squat with weight amounts superior to what you might have done otherwise.\nTry to develop a better bicep curl. Most people don\u2019t move the barbell past the point where it is parallel to your body, thereby not getting the full results of the exercise. However, the strongest portion of curls is the upper part. This problem can be solved by simply performing barbell curls while sitting.\nWhat you\u2019ve read here is a collection of tips and tricks which can help you to build muscle simply, effectively and with as little effort as possible. The knowledge you\u2019ve gained will help you to change your body for the better, leading to a better quality of life, so get down to work!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "best", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:40.041+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "80272a1520b6a936a047c4657c6c2686d5b0ab54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.mAKMZfTdIfT4ZhsQIUznJa80AAxys2.34..8JfkhbuEylxfay77wY3wL7LBaxUmJ0t1eBWfGaMaPt6qcU0h6DrfuFVsXMAG4y2dOzo.rx6wQrEm4npa9MvCYOJyhnD3I-", "site_full": "www.bigsoccer.com", "site": "bigsoccer.com", "site_section": "http://www.bigsoccer.com/forums/san-diego.1480/", "site_categories": ["world_soccer", "sports"], "section_title": "San Diego | BigSoccer Forum", "title": "Gamechanger.... looks like our SD MLS messiah has arrived!! | Page 52", "title_full": "Gamechanger.... looks like our SD MLS messiah has arrived!! | Page 52 | BigSoccer Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T09:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.992, "main_image": "http://www.bigsoccer.com/data/avatars/m/102/102602.jpg?1335900768", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45672, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "80272a1520b6a936a047c4657c6c2686d5b0ab54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.mAKMZfTdIfT4ZhsQIUznJa80AAxys2.34..8JfkhbuEylxfay77wY3wL7LBaxUmJ0t1eBWfGaMaPt6qcU0h6DrfuFVsXMAG4y2dOzo.rx6wQrEm4npa9MvCYOJyhnD3I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mike4066", "published": "2017-12-06T09:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "Gamechanger.... looks like our SD MLS messiah has arrived!! | Page 52", "text": "This is pure speculation on my part but we should know more about the SDSU plan the week of the Dec. 20\nThat was the week mentioned by the AD of SDSU.\nThe next teams to be announced for expansion will happen sometime after Dec 14.\nThe dates could be coincidence or it could be related.

First of all, I must admit, I have never been a part of a deal near the size Trump made regularly and don\u2019t even know who would be in the room during one of those negotiations. But I do know that the more people you have on your side of the table the weaker you are. Bring lawyers, insurance men, structural inspectors, and the lone agent on the other side will beat you if he knows what he is doing. He might appear stubborn but he will know more and get his price. So let us assume Trump is in the room with his guys, for I don\u2019t think he would be alone. On the other side is me, alone. And assume my guy, my client, not at the table, is the seller, the tougher side in a commercial deal. After all, if you want to sell there must be something wrong. \nThe first thing a real estate agent must learn is that nobody is going to hit anybody in a negotiating room. Being tough is all mental. There\u2019s no real danger of getting slugged or shot. It is all theater. So there\u2019s never a need to be intimidated. You can do anything except lie. Let it rip! \nThe most important invisible factor in any deal is the desires of seller and buyer to make the deal. If the building is hemorrhaging money the seller might be willing to take a loss just to get rid of it. On the other hand, if the buyer needs the building to complete some plan he has already committed to, he might be willing to pay more than the property is worth. There are, or course, many other factors that might affect the desires of buyer and seller. I assume my seller is willing to allow me to play my risky game. For Trump could walk. \nI recognize that Trump does have an extraordinary talent, an eye for and a belief in glitz. He did an incredible job in popularizing and selling the ostentatious vulgarity he specializes in. I could never have done it. It would not be wise to underestimate him. It might be fair to say that he created a certain genre of \u201cprestige\u201d residence. He\u2019s good at what he does. Secondly, we must realize that much of this value is in bullshit, \u201cprestige\u201d. Trump is now able to make a good living by selling the use of his name on buildings with which he has nothing else to do. Since he lives this way himself we must conclude that this is not hucksterism in the sense that Trump is a real part of the customer base he is appealing to and not just a carnival barker selling snake oil to the rubes. The best bullshitters believe. \nI would be lost in this market since I pay attention to the numbers. Prestige value is not the result of doing the numbers. For we are dealing with, primarily, location, and secondarily, up to the minute vulgarity. The value is in the herd instinct of a herd that imagines itself elite. They want what others they admire want. It\u2019s all a matter of perception, perception that can be molded. In the evaluation of such a thing the numbers are all worthless. Trump is a vision guy. We all know Trump will tear down or extensively renovate whatever he buys to realize his vision. He is thinking about what he will build when he gets rid of my client\u2019s building. He hardly cares about what the income and expenses are now. Everything else I know about him confirms this. \nI know of other deals he has made in which he has overpaid considerably, at least as far as the numbers tell the story. For example, of the Plaza Hotel in New York Trump wrote. \u201c\u201dI haven\u2019t purchased a building, I have purchased a masterpiece \u2013 the Mona Lisa. For the first time in my life, I have knowingly made a deal that was not economic \u2013 for I can never justify the price I paid, no matter how successful the Plaza becomes.\u201d You can say that again. He lost a bundle on it. I suspect it was not the first time. So he has a weakness for \u201cprestige\u201d buildings, which the one I am selling isn\u2019t, but can be made into because of its location which is not great but could be made so with the right kind of bullshit. Otherwise Trump wouldn\u2019t want it. Even with his weakness for prestige he has often come out on top because of the demand for his renovated properties. Trump knows how to add \u201cvalue\u201d. He knows how to sell prestige and has an eye for what he can turn into prestige. But all this value is in his head and the heads of the nouveau rich. \nI would also expect his out-sized ego to be present and on full display. His large entourage will be trained to feed it, not think. I will be cast to play the patsy in his show. I will bungle and fumble and \u201caccidentally\u201d bring another bogus offer with me that somehow accidentally got into the folder of the property. The longer I can drag this deal out the more Trump will want the building. The more incompetent I look and irritating I am the more he will want to beat me and hate to lose to me. I will try to be the guy he would have fired right away on his show. I will try to get under his thin skin and shake his fragile ego. Think Paul Newman on the train in The Sting. \nAlthough I have none of Trump\u2019s strengths, I am good with numbers. I am also completely unimpressed with all that Trump admires. Prestige means nothing to me. I\u2019m not in awe of any human now on the planet except for Andrew Wiles. Trump could bring Bill Gates, Vladimir Putin, and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir with him and it wouldn\u2019t impress me at all. I look only at the numbers and don\u2019t really care how I look to him. If I were negotiating with another agent like me the whole thing would be a question of numbers. By the time it got down to intangibles such as location we would measure that too. Everybody would know everything they had a right to know. There would be a fairly close agreement about what a good price is. Of course a good part of it would be measured by the pressures to buy and sell. We would both be feeling one another out about this. But we both would know that the other would walk if the price was too out of line. I would never engage in such theatrics with a normal intelligent real estate agent. \nIn a commercial deal the seller has no obligation to disclose defects. It is strictly caveat emptor . For this reason the buyer\u2019s agent usually carries out extensive inspections of whatever seems relevant. The seller can refuse to allow these inspections. Since I am pretty sure Trump plans to tear down or renovate the building I would refuse to allow them. I would try to make any information as vague as possible. The numbers can only hurt me in this instance and would count on Trump\u2019s desire for the property to keep him in. His plan is to tear down or renovate, and therefore he is ultimately indifferent to the numbers in the deal except as a tool to attack my price, \nTrump would also want to look at the rent rolls and expenses, again for the sole purpose of beating me down. This is routine, but I would refuse. His banker would complain, but since he knew Trump\u2019s plan ahead of time he will not back out, and Trump might threaten to pull out, but he wouldn\u2019t because he would not want to lose to me that irritating little idiot, and hopefully, because I had made the location seem better with my boundless admiration for it. I would do everything I could to express my belief that he is no match for me. I would subtlety disrespect him, ask him if he understands what I am talking about. I would piss him off with delays, lost documents, whatever I could. At the same time, I would make it clear that I, like Trump think of the negotiation as a war. I would talk about the world being made up of winners and losers. How could he lose to this asshole! Pulling out would be losing, and Trump does not like to lose, especially to a fool. I will count on his competitive nature and fragile ego to hook him. With innuendo and body language I would express my skepticism over his ability to perform in the deal. I would suggest that perhaps he is financially unsound. I would joke about his whole way of doing things. I would challenge his real estate manhood and at the same time come on as an incompetent fool. I would make it personal, suggest, though not directly, that he was small potatoes. He would want to beat me in the worst way. \nHad Trump seen the numbers he would know that my asking price was ridiculously high, outrageously high, absurdly high. Or course he will still think and say that it is outrageously high even though I will insist that I am offering him a bargain. Any other buyer would have walked away from the deal when I refused to disclose information, assuming that my client didn\u2019t really want to sell. But Trump is mad and in a war and does not want to retreat. All Trump cares about is how much he thinks that particular location is worth and beating me. But the value of a location depends only upon what others think it is worth. However I could, I would hint that others had been interested, without of course, saying so. Every now and then I would say, \u201clocation, location, location\u201d in as stupid and naive way as I could if I couldn\u2019t counter some argument of one of his minions. I would toss his evidence back across the table with contempt, not even looking at it. \nMeanwhile, I would carefully monitor the mood at the other side of the table. I wouldn\u2019t budge until I saw they were at the edge of exasperation. Then, when they were practically out of their chairs, I would give in a bit, but just a bit. Maybe I would make some apology, some excuse for myself. I might even butter Trump up a bit about his toughness, for I know how susceptible he is to flattery. I would offer a slightly lower price. As soon as they were back in their chairs I would return to my intransigence. Painfully, interminably, modeling myself on the Israelis in the Israeli-Palestinian \u201cpeace process\u201d, I would let them slowly wear me down. Drawing it out, perhaps making a few telephone calls before yielding a little more, I would allow myself to get beaten down to a price that was still far above what I thought the property was worth. From that point I would not budge, and I would threaten to walk out the door. Finally, admitting defeat I would go down a tiny bit more and make the deal at a price far below my asking but well above the property\u2019s value. I would praise Trump on his negotiating skill and his toughness. \nTrump would think he won and I would think I won.

This is the first dire warning issued from a mainstream research center. Some researchers feel both the timing and the odds to be optimistic. \nThe fourth National Climate Assessment, a compilation of research results from over 15 Federal agencies, was recently released, stating that humans are causing global climate change. No other explanation can account for what is occurring worldwide. \nThe 23rd Conference Of The Parties, a global discussion about climate change, met last month in Bohn, Germany. Climate change is a global problem, and global cooperation is required to deal with the changes. Every country on the planet is working to avert a global threat to all of humanity. Every country but one, the United States, which thinks climate change is just a Chinese hoax. This is American exceptionalism in the 21st century. \nClimate denial in the United States is a disinformation campaign, well funded over many decades by fossil fuel industries, the morbidly rich, and some evangelical organizations. \nThere is documentary evidence that all major oil companies knew about the adverse effect of atmospheric CO2 starting in the 80\u2019s, but made the decision to hide the evidence and fund denial and confusion, thus protecting their annual profits of hundreds of billions of dollars. But oil discoveries have not kept up with the depletion rates of established fields and new oil is too expensive in a weak global economy. As affordable oil and gas are getting scarce and profits are declining, some of the majors, like Shell and BP, have abandoned climate denial and begun investing in renewable energy. \nThe morbidly rich are those who have more wealth than they know what to do with, but are devoted to gaining even more, which requires the death of people all over the planet. They tend to be heavily invested in fossil fuels. \nSome evangelicals are still fighting the old war between science and their particular interpretation of God. This anti-science bias is a hold over from the time when the Catholic Church could burn people for disagreeing with doctrine. In an age of smart phones and nuclear weapons, a time of massive changes in human life, they claim climate change cannot be caused by man. Only God has that kind of power. Younger people, who will be alive when the consequences of this denial will be lethal, are questioning the wisdom of current leadership. Advertisement \nClimate deniers have currently taken over the Republican Party, with their cheerleader being President Trump. Fossil fuel executives are now in positions of power, and climate change scientists are being purged. Despite traditional Republican dogma about the power of the free market, obsolete 19th century coal technology, and bankrupt, toxic, 20th century nuclear technology, are given special taxpayer subsidies. Rather than investing in 21st century renewable technology, American consumers and businesses will be paying more for electrical power, and be less competitive in the global economy. \nRather than subsidizing renewables, which are surging elsewhere on the planet, climate deniers are attacking solar regulations at state levels, to prevent American development. Stiff tariffs are being placed on solar cells from China. Domestic solar production faces an uphill battle and won\u2019t fill the gap, blocking thousands of good paying jobs in the renewable power industry. \nThe federal electric car subsidy is being eliminated at a time when the world is shifting to electric transportation. American auto companies, discouraged in producing electric vehicles, will find limited markets for gas engines as the rest of the world moves to renewable energy. The Chinese have made serious commitments to renewable and electric car innovations. China already produces more cars than any other country, and while their economy is second to the US, they are growing faster than we are. Instead of American industry competing economically and leading in a rapidly changing global technology, we are being left behind with obsolete technology. \nThe loss of political leadership is already happening on the global climate stage. As the US removed itself from the discussion, China has stepped in and taken the lead. The American economic empire began to decline in 1972. Being the only country to deny man made climate change will not make America great again: it will make America irrelevant faster, and the Republican Party is responsible. \nCrispin B.

South African National Parks (SANParks) would like to remind day visitors to the Kruger National Park that daily quotas will once again apply at the entrance gates. Visitors are urged to make pre-bookings for their visits prior to their arrival. They can choose from the following three time slots: \nTime slot 1: 05:30 to 07:30 \nTime slot 2: 07:30 to 09:30 \nTime slot 3: 09:30 onwards \n\u201cFor busy periods such as the school holidays and the festive season, we aim to better manage the volumes that we expect, as well as our visitors\u2019 expectations. The three different time slots are aimed at improving the spread of vehicles and, as far as possible prevent unnecessary waiting periods at gates\u201d, said the KNP\u2019s GM: Communications and Marketing, William Mabasa. \nThe Day Visitor Quota for the park is a management tool to maintain the carrying capacity of the park and is in place throughout the year. We do, however, emphasize the use of this tool during long weekends and holidays because of the volume of visitors we usually get during those times. Visitors will be able to book up to 80% of the Day Visitor Quota per gate via SANParks Reservations offices and online at www.sanparks.org. \nPre-booked day visitors will get preference over non-booked day visitors at the gate but they must ensure that they arrive within the time slots, as per their reservation. Arriving outside the booked time slot will be regarded as non-booked and they will therefore not receive preference. These bookings can also be changed through SANParks Reservations offices if necessary. \nMabasa also reminded Visitors to read the permits which they receive at the gates as all the rules and regulations of the park are clearly stipulated on these documents. \u201cPlease do not bring liquor with you because the alcohol ban on public areas in the Park is a permanent rule which is enforced at all times; visitors must please also refrain from committing other infringements such as littering and speeding in the Park. These and other Park rules are emphasized to ensure visitors have a safe and enjoyable experience and hence must be adhered to at all times whilst in the Park,\u201d he advised. \u2013 Press release Related Posts \nAll stakeholders in the agricultural sector must work together to combat the level of crime\u2026 TAGS ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "william mabasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mabasa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kruger national park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "knp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kruger national park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "park", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:42.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4681fcb1413dd60945b6699d92cd53bfdbb436be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Nhbeo6JE6BK5msD2Ok0EvUDupHHfRlSJNWBo3og9riwtBwduKv4WyJJNqJirA2c4-", "site_full": "www.koreaherald.com", "site": "koreaherald.com", "site_section": "http://koreaherald.com/rss_xml.php", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Korea Heald", "title": "KT&G donates food truck, hot meals for needy", "title_full": "KT&G donates food truck, hot meals for needy", "published": "2017-12-07T19:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "KR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://res.heraldm.com/content/image/2017/12/07/20171207000901_0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 28582, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4681fcb1413dd60945b6699d92cd53bfdbb436be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Nhbeo6JE6BK5msD2Ok0EvUDupHHfRlSJNWBo3og9riwtBwduKv4WyJJNqJirA2c4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "2015009", "published": "2017-12-07T19:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "KT&G donates food truck, hot meals for needy", "text": "  17:58   17:58 Cigarette maker KT&G said Thursday it donated a food truck to the city-run soup kitchen Warm Chaeumteo, and that KT&G employees will be volunteering at soup kitchens over the next two years.According to the company, KT&G will donate 500 servings of food each week to soup kitchens, including Warm Chaeumteo and the House of Sungmo Lady in Daejeon, and volunteering at the facilities once a month over the next two years.

This photo, taken on Jan. 23, 2017, shows Lee Sung-ho, the chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission of Korea, presiding over a meeting in Seoul. (Yonhap) \"President Moon said the rights commission must actively make new suggestions to implement international standards on human rights in the country and to bring the level of local standards to that of international standards,\" Moon's chief press secretary Yoon Young-chan told a press briefing.\"He also expressed hope the HRC would propose new standards and alternative measures for conscientious objectors and the possible abolition of capital punishment based on international standards,\" he added.Conscientious objectors refer to those who refuse to serve the mandatory military service due to their religious or other beliefs. Many have noted a need to allow such persons to serve in other public sectors instead, but most are currently prosecuted under the law.Thursday's meeting included a special report from the HRC officials that marked the first of its kind in nearly six years, according to the Cheong Wa Dae official.\"President Moon asked for efforts to turn the Republic of Korea into a human rights nation, citing the need for the HRC to enhance its own status to become a national symbol of human rights,\" Yoon said.Lee, the HRC chief, stressed a need to set up a new, improved system to protect human rights under a new environment, noting the related laws have not been modified over the past three decades.In particular, he noted the need for legal revisions to allow or require education on human rights and increased government support for protection, Yoon said.The president expressed support for a new system and asked the rights commission to spearhead the move to create a new legal basis for better protection of human rights, he added.The president also called for efforts to better protect human rights in the military, including the establishment of a new organization within the rights commission to specifically deal with abuses of service members.Human rights violations against conscripts often make headlines in the country where all able-bodied males are required to serve 21 months in the military.Moon's call follows a high-profile case where a four-star Army general was accused of bullying and harassing service members assigned to his official residence. The general, Park Chan-ju, has been indicted on corruption charges.

UN Undersecretary-General for Political Affairs Jeffrey Feltman (left) meets North Korean Foreign MinisterRi Yong-ho in Pyongyang on Thursday. (Yonhap) White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster said Saturday the possibility of war with North Korea was \u201cincreasing every day\u201d.US Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham urged the Pentagon on Sunday to start moving US military dependents, such as spouses and children of military personnel, out of South Korea, saying conflict with North Korea was nearing.\u201cThese confrontational war-mongering remarks cannot be interpreted in any other way but as a warning to us to be prepared for a war on the Korean peninsula,\u201d the KCNA reported in English.\u201cWe do not wish for a war but shall not hide from it, and should the US miscalculate our patience and light the fuse for a nuclear war, we will surely make the US dearly pay the consequences with our mighty nuclear force which we have consistently strengthened.\u201d The spokesman also slammed US Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo for saying that \u201cKim Jong-un doesn\u2019t have a good idea about how tenuous his situation is domestically and internationally.\u201d Tensions have escalated on the Korean Peninsula as the North last week fired an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching Washington, claiming it has completed \u201cstate nuclear force.\u201dThe US State Department made it clear the US would not negotiate with North Korea on recognizing it as a nuclear state. \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t,\u201d US State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said in response to a question as to whether the US plans to hold such negotiations during a press briefing Tuesday.\u201cWe believe in the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. That is something that the Republic of Korea believes in firmly and also Japan. So we\u2019re not changing our view. We\u2019re not going to backtrack on this.\u201dShe noted that the North\u2019s latest missile launch shows that the country is not willing to have a dialogue with the US.\u201cWe remain open to talks if they are serious about denuclearization.

Former NTU lecturer and journalist Cherian George, who teaches at Hong Kong Baptist University, says in his book debate is good training for Singaporeans for the real competition - the outside world.PHOTOS: CHERIAN GEORGE Published Dec 4, 2017, 5:00 am SGT HK-based academic to launch book of essays on politics here Elgin Toh Insight Editor Winter has come - to the sunny isle of Singapore. This is how journalism academic and political observer and, yes, fan of the HBO series Game Of Thrones Cherian George characterises the state of political debate here. In a new book of essays on Singapore politics, titled Singapore, Incomplete, he argues that after the 2011 general election, \"a chill... descended\" here, affecting domains such as civil society, the media, the Internet, academia and the arts. Not everyone will agree with his thesis but the author of best-seller Singapore: The Air-conditioned Nation (2000) notes that while the Government has loosened up on the opposition - for instance, in reducing the number and size of group representation constituencies - it has \"hobbled\" the other groups. The post-GE2011 playbook included \"significant humanising of social and economic policy, but also a hardening of its posture in political and civic space\", writes Professor George, 52. Speaking to The Straits Times ahead of the book's launch here on Dec 9, he points to developments such as new laws that constrain websites on public affairs, legal action against netizens, tighter control of the mainstream media, and academics dabbling in activism who say it is now tougher to get jobs. One example he cites: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong suing blogger Roy Ngerng for defamation in 2014. Mr Lee won and the courts awarded him $150,000 in damages. Former NTU lecturer and journalist Cherian George, who teaches at Hong Kong Baptist University, says in his book debate is good training for Singaporeans for the real competition - the outside world. Doesn't somebody whose reputation is sullied have the right to sue, as a matter of longstanding principle in Singapore politics? He does, Prof George says - but adds that settling such debates through suits alienates some Singaporeans. He notes: \"This weapon used to be reserved for professional politicians and big influential media.\"What has changed is the lowering of the threshold, the feeling that even relatively unknown individuals need to be given this treatment.\" The new 216-page paperback contains 28 essays on topics such as the presidential election, xenophobia and a \"fog of fear\". The book also contains personal anecdotes, including an accounting of his own taste of \"fear\", causing him to withdraw as an academic expert in 2014 from a trial blogger Alex Au was facing for contempt of court. Prof George frankly admits he feared jeopardising his appeal of a decision by his employer Nanyang Technological University (NTU) not to award him tenure. Over the phone from Hong Kong, where he and his wife, former Straits Times deputy editor Zuraidah Ibrahim, now live, Prof George declines to say more about leaving NTU, where he taught journalism from 2004 to 2014. The former Straits Times journalist failed to get tenure twice due to what he calls political pressure. NTU president Bertil Andersson later disputed this. The case is perceived by some to stem from Prof George's comments over the years criticising the Government. In the book, he hazards a guess on why he was blocked: \"I was heading the only undergraduate journalism department in Singapore and was therefore in a position to influence future journalists.\" When asked, NTU said it has nothing to add to previous statements. After what he termed \"a forced exit\" from NTU in 2014, Prof George joined the journalism department at Hong Kong Baptist University. This year, he received tenure and was made full professor. Asked what his longer-term plans are and whether he intends to return to Singapore for good some day, he replies wryly: \"I have felt no need to make plans for the future.\" He now flies back to Singapore, where his family remains, at least once every two months. This - and his meetings with Singaporeans who pass through Hong Kong - helps him maintain a good sense of developments here and the pulse of Singaporeans. Prof George acknowledges many Singaporeans \"aren't bothered by strictures on civil society, journalism or other democratic institutions, as long as you look after their basic needs\", but that gave him even more motivation to write the book - so as to persuade them. But if Singaporeans aren't concerned, why should the ruling People's Action Party change? Prof George's larger argument in the book is that it is in the long-term interest of both Singapore and the PAP for political debate to become more vibrant. First, it reduces the chances of government leaders developing blind spots like the ones that, he argues, led to policy missteps - and voter unhappiness - in the run-up to the 2011 election. Second, he adds, debate is good training for the real competition - which Singapore is grappling with out there in the world.\"Learning to adapt to freewheeling domestic political contention isn't something our leaders cannot afford to do,\" he avers.\"Top football clubs in the European Champions League wouldn't be half as good if they didn't face strong opponents in their domestic competitions. Every wannabe Real Madrid needs a Barcelona.\" He says he is not holding his breath on the message getting through in the short run to the PAP - which is needed to turn winter into spring. But he also believes that in the long run \"an internally-reformed PAP is still one of the best-case scenarios for Singapore\". He adds: \"The PAP is not just another party, a potted plant that can easily be substituted with another.\"It's a movement intimately tied to state and society, like a banyan that grew out of a crack in a building and has now spread so much that it's hard to rip it out without damaging its host.\" A version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on December 04, 2017, with the headline 'Vibrant political debate good for S'pore, says don '.

The GOP\u2019s reckless tax bill By E.J. Dionne, Jr., Washington Post Writers Group Posted: # Comments \nWASHINGTON \u2014 Students often leave term papers to the last minute, but even college freshmen would never submit as finished work an essay with changes illegibly scrawled along the side. \nRepublican senators hold themselves to a much lower standard. They voted in the early morning hours on Saturday to reorder large parts of the American economy on the basis of a bill that those freshmen would be ashamed of. It was a thrown-together reactionary mess forced through with little forethought and virtually no debate. Key, supposedly \u201cmoderate\u201d Republican senators endorsed the massive piece of legislation even before they knew what was in it, and voted down a motion to put off a vote at least long enough so they might actually understand what they were doing. Legislating has routinely been compared with sausage-making, but this time, Republican leaders wanted to keep citizens from knowing what poisons they were injecting into this particular sausage. \nWhen Congress did truly big things in the past \u2014 the Affordable Care Act, the major tax cuts of the Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush eras, the tax increases under Bill Clinton and Barack Obama \u2014 there was serious discussion over an extended time. \nDebate and careful negotiation over trade-offs in a genuinely bipartisan context were at the heart of the success of the last comprehensive tax reform in 1986. By contrast, the GOP\u2019s extravaganza this year is entirely partisan, full of breaks for favored interests and punishments for those the party regards as its political enemies. To call it \u201creform\u201d is an affront to generations of good-government advocates in both parties. \nMoreover, this tax monstrosity is so filled with gimmicks, carve-outs and penalties for various sectors of our economy that its impact will be far greater than the Republican tax cuts of the 1980s and early 2000s. Those voting for it gave little thought to how it will affect many sectors of American life. This is exactly what its sponsors wanted. Scrutiny was this bill\u2019s greatest foe. \nBesides pumping up already dangerous levels of economic inequality, the bill will add at least $1?trillion (and probably much more) to the debt at a moment when adding to deficits serves no useful economic purpose. This, in turn, could lead to interest-rate increases that will dampen whatever positive effects the tax cuts in the bill will have on growth. Oh yes, and Republicans will soon be using the new red ink they manufactured on behalf of the privileged to justify sharp cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and programs for the needy. \nThe bill will undermine our system of higher education, which is one of the great prides of our country. What sense does it make to provide relief to heirs who did nothing to earn their inheritances other than be born \u2014 while increasing taxes on graduate students, whose incomes are already modest? Isn\u2019t there a near-universal consensus that investing in the skills of our people and in research is the way to foster growth and future well-being? \nBy tearing away the deductibility of state income and sales taxes, this legislative concoction could plunge some of our largest states \u2014 California, New York and New Jersey among them \u2014 into fiscal crises or force them to slash the help they give their lower-income citizens. Does anyone of right mind believe this will be good for our economy, let alone for social justice? Advertisement \nAh, but these states are Democratic, so Republicans are happy to abuse their power to take a shot at their partisan opponents. \nAnd isn\u2019t it funny, as former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Alan Blinder pointed out in The Wall Street Journal, that so many of the provisions \u2014 keeping intact \u201cegregious loopholes for real estate developers,\u201d generously treating \u201cpass-through\u201d income, killing the alternative minimum tax and being kind to heirs \u2014 just happen to be particularly good for a certain president of the United States who claimed he was fighting for the little guy and his family? \nBetween now and Election Day, 2018, not only Democrats but anyone who claims to believe in responsible and responsive government must hold up this scandalous abuse of power for all Americans to see. Republicans imposed an artificial deadline on their work and used craven, unconscionable and anti-democratic tactics solely to escape accountability. They did not want citizens to know how they were transferring piles of money to the wealthiest and the best-connected. \nAll senators who voted for this bill should be regularly reminded that they are now part of a government for the few imposed by the reckless. \nE.J.

China\u2019s export volume of all refined oil products such as gasoline to North Korea were marked \u201c0\u201d in October in the KITA data on trade between the two countries, down from $166,106 in September, the US broadcaster said.

Russia, however, was not disclosing its October data on oil exports to North Korea, according to the VOA.

However,the thought of letting septuagenarians loose with power tools does not fill me with excitement so I intend to build the framework/ boards myself to create the blank canvas if you like.\nI'm not sure about people just turning up,there is a security issue there,but I like the idea of maybe one or two evenings a week to help the build along.

The previous two decreases were followed by major increases. The prices of raw milk in the major raw milk producing countries of the world followed the abovementioned downward trend of the prices of dairy products in the international market. \nThe downward trends were the result of global supply which outstripped demand. The downward trends were triggered by high supply (production) globally, and the trends continued due to weaker demand and continuous high production. \nReturning from the bottom \nThe downward trend of the FAO price index for dairy products ended in April 2016 and from April 2016 to September 2017, it increased with 76.3%, to a level which is 18.5%lower than the record high level achieved in February 2014. The prices of raw milk in major dairy countries followed the upward trend of the prices of dairy products in the international market. \nThe upward trend in the FAO price index is the result of the lower production of the two biggest suppliers of dairy products to the international market, namely the European Union (EU) and New Zealand, and stronger demand. Production increased, and it is expected that the production in 2017 and 2018 in major dairy countries will be higher than in 2016. \nDown again \nFrom September 2017 to October 2017, the FAO price index for dairy products decreased with 4.9%. This decrease does not necessarily mean the end of the upward trend, but it is noteworthy that the upward trend from May 2016 to September 2017 covered a period of 17 months and that the durations of the three previous upward trends were 15, 25 and 20 months respectively. \nThe extent to which the prices of the different dairy products in the international market increased differs. The increase in the price of butter from the middle of 2016 to August 2017, was much higher than that of other types of dairy products, while the price of skimmed milk powder, a co-product of the manufacture of butter, remained much lower than that of other dairy products. \u2013 SAMPRO Related Posts", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "fao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:44.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bc0329c2b150f9a372ed36abc10573fca57be6bd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMvtHzfzR3T4thOUI6sQ7AJDVsFVejH24ZsVyev_sqhmTZelhcQvaTWII07r3.JNOJu5JRbrNh8WAw--", "site_full": "vegancrunk.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://vegancrunk.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Vegan Crunk", "title": "More Stuff I Ate", "title_full": "More Stuff I Ate", "published": "2017-12-07T05:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b1c08e43491f29ae3177833c5df9d121befc4417", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMvtHzfzR3T4thOUI6sQ7AJDVsFVejH24ZsVyev_sqhmTZelhcQvaTWII07r3.JNOJsAFgFQpwst6lu8wIPqVbuN", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "vegan peace", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Avocado and vegemite actually sounds pretty tasty!

Daily Mail Share on Reddit reddit The new owners of a luxury home in the UK will have to pass an interview with their multi-millionaire neighbours before they can buy it. Businessman Ashley Faull is building two seafront homes on one large plot on the exclusive Dorset peninsula of Sandbanks; one for him and his wife and the other which he intends to sell for \u00a34 million ($7.8m), the MailOnline reports But just meeting the hefty asking price won't be enough for prospective buyers as Faull, 51, has made it a condition of the sale that he will hold an informal interview with them first. He and his wife Heather want to make sure the couple will get along with their new neighbours. Advertisement And he said he is even prepared to sell the brand new three bedroom property called 'Sunshine' for less than the asking price if it means selling to the right buyer. Faull, a former ITV executive and founding director of a TV shopping group, said: \"Having good neighbours is very important to my wife and I. We are still good friends with our previous neighbours from Primrose Hill in London over ten years ago and are also very friendly with the neighbours we have in Dorset where we have lived since. \"We would rather sell this stunning new house for a bit less money to people we think we will get along with and would refuse to sell it to anyone where we thought the opposite, frankly regardless of the amount offered. \"We are insisting on meeting anyone who wants to purchase 'Sunshine' so we can have a mutual informal interview over a coffee with them. \"Sometimes just having money is not enough.\" The couple moved to Dorset when he sold his stake in his previous business for \u00a3194m in 2006. He then set up a successful jewellery and pawnbroker business. Faull said he and his wife were looking for 'fairly normal' new neighbours who preferably would have an entrepreneurial background and be a dog owner as they are \"unselfish\". They don't intend to sell the property to anyone who will use it for holiday lets. Businessman Ashley Faull wants to make sure he will get along with his new neighbours. Share on Reddit reddit He ruled out selling the house to a \"party animal\" Premier League footballer and suggested he would even seek references from the new owner's former neighbours. Faull said: 'We're not being too prescriptive, really we're just looking for someone fairly normal who would like to live a relatively relaxed life in Sandbanks. \"It would be nice if they had kids, of any age, and a dog - mainly because I find dog owners are generally fairly unselfish people. \"I guess we're looking for someone as close to us as possible so we have things in common. A self-made entrepreneur rather than having inherited wealth as we're likely to have more in common. \"Those things would be preferable but it's not necessary. For us it's important that we get neighbours that will become friends over time, do neighbourly things like take in packages from Amazon. \"Our old neighbours in London actually stopped a burglary at our house mid-way through by shouting at the burglar. \"It's probably more about who we would not accept. I wouldn't want a Premier League footballer with no kids, someone we thought would be a party animal. \"And we might try to check on them to see how they got on with their previous neighbours. \"The last people who showed an interest we went to visit them in their current home, we did ask first and only stayed about half an hour. It's more to get a quick view of them. They seemed very credible and nice. \"We wouldn't want someone who would be renting the house out, then we'd have no control over who was there. \"It's a unique opportunity to set who our neighbours are going to be and it's a mutual thing as they will get to see us too.\" He bought a pair of semi-detached houses on the \"pan handle\" of Sandbanks for \u00a34m and won planning permission to demolish them and build one large lavish home a decade ago. The plot sat empty for years until Faull changed his mind and decided to split the land in two and build two four storey properties side-by-side. The Faulls will have a 45ft x 38ft luxury home that will have four bedrooms, two studies, a large open plan kitchen/living/dining area, a snug, cinema room, gymnasium and garage for two cars. The smaller house next door will be 45ft x 20ft and have three bedrooms, a study, open plan kitchen/living/dining area, a snug and either a cinema room or a gymnasium. Both properties, which are about 2ft apart, are situated on the narrow strip of land on Sandbanks and will have two-way views of the beach and Poole Bay on one side and Poole Harbour on the other. The views mean the Faulls and their new neighbours will enjoy spectacular sunrises in the east in the mornings and sunsets in the west in the evenings. Adrian Dunford from estate agents Tailor Made is handling the sale. Dunford said: \"The plot has been split so that the house for them is two thirds of the site and they are selling the house on the other third for \u00a34m. It's their dream home. \"That stretch of Sandbanks has always been the most popular because you have a two-way view - looking out on Sandbanks beach and the sea in one direction and Poole Harbour the other way. \"A house a few doors down holds the record for the most expensive per square foot. It's 4,000 sq ft and sold for \u00a35m, which works out as \u00a31,250 per square foot. \"It's all about the view, without the view that house would only have sold for about \u00a32m. \"When you have that sort of view which is so fantastic, you're buying with your heart not your head. It isn't about how much it is. \"You wouldn't go into a Ferrari show room and ask what it does to the gallon. \"These two houses have been designed to make the most of that view. It's a very funky design, ultra-modern and lots of glass. \"When it's finished people will walk in and fall in love with it, price is almost secondary. \"Although it will be for sale for \u00a34m they will have to pass an informal interview. Mr Faull wants to know his neighbours are people he can get on with.\" Sandbanks homeowners include former football managers Harry Redknapp and Graeme Souness, computer magnate Sir Peter Ogden and celebrity interior designer Celia Sawyer.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "faull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heather", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harry redknapp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dunford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "graeme souness", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter ogden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adrian dunford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "celia sawyer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashley faull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new zealand herald luxury", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "itv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "premier league", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "dorset", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poole bay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poole harbour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "primrose hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:45.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8fa01014bf98f7e176a119bbb346a04040852d7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWZ5Qwe35OYZIMOsW6fut9dFEfao0KOtyO9vz_rSNN2QDJFPZDIyYnsUVIz0g7JF0-", "site_full": "www.blowoutforums.com", "site": "blowoutforums.com", "site_section": "https://www.blowoutforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=88", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "COINS &amp; CURRENCY BUY/SELL/TRADE - Blowout Cards Forums", "title": "10 walking liberty 1/2 oz copper coins $10 dlvd", "title_full": "10 walking liberty 1/2 oz copper coins $10 dlvd - Blowout Cards Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T13:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8fa01014bf98f7e176a119bbb346a04040852d7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWZ5Qwe35OYZIMOsW6fut9dFEfao0KOtyO9vz_rSNN2QDJFPZDIyYnsUVIz0g7JF0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "meandsharon11", "published": "2017-12-06T13:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "10 walking liberty 1/2 oz copper coins $10 dlvd", "text": "Priced lowered to $7.50 dlvd", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:45.005+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15106419, "moreResultsAvailable": 15106319, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512640305005&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 430}
