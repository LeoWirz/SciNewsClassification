The other base metals are down by an average of 0.6%. Precious metals are generally firmer this morning - prices are up an average of 0.2%, with spot gold prices at $1,268.50 per oz. Prices were down across the board on Tuesday with gold prices off by 0.8% and the rest down between 1.1% for palladium and 1.4% on platinum. The low gold price on Tuesday was $1,260.95 per oz, the previous low from October was $1,260.70 per oz. On the Shanghai Futures Exchange today, all the base metals prices are lower by an average of 2.3% as they follow the weakness seen on the LME on Tuesday. Nickel prices are off the most with a 3.9% decline, followed by a 3.2% drop in zinc prices and a 3.1% fall in copper prices to 51,410 yuan ($7,771) per tonne. Aluminium is off by 2%, lead prices are down by 1.5% and tin prices are off by 0.3%. Spot copper prices in Changjiang are down by 3.4% at 51,160-51,540   firmed to 7.85, compared with 7.81 on Tuesday, suggesting LME prices have fallen slightly more than SHFE prices. The weakness has spread to the steel market too with iron ore prices in China falling by 4% to 523   3.3%, with gold and silver prices down by 0.6% and 1.2% respectively. In international markets, spot Brent crude oil prices are up by 0.3% at $62.81 per barrel. The yield on US 10-year treasuries are weaker at 2.34% and the German 10-year bund yield has fallen to 0.30%. Equities in Asia this morning are under pressure with the Hang Seng down by 2.04%, the Nikkei is off by 1.97%, the Kospi is down by 1.42%, the CSI 300 is down by 0.6% and the ASX 200 is 0.21% lower. This follows weakness in western markets on Tuesday where in the United States the Dow Jones closed down by 0.45% at 24,180.64 and in Europe where the Euro Stoxx 50 closed down by 0.16% at 3,570.57. The dollar index, at 93.32, is little changed as it consolidates around the 20 day moving average. The jury is still out as to whether the September to November strength in the dollar is a counter-trend move within this year\u0092s downward trend, or whether it is the start of a longer-term uptrend. For now, the dollar remains vulnerable, but we are still on the side of expecting the dollar to rise given the likelihood of interest rate differentials. The euro at 1.1828 is slightly weaker, as are sterling at 1.3402 and the Australian dollar at 0.76578, while the yen is firmer at 112.14, suggesting the yen may be picking up some haven interest. The yuan remains flat at 6.6140,   gains \u0096 which may be them showing some nervousness with the corrections going on in the metals and equities. Today\u0092s economic agenda shows German factory orders climbed 0.5%, after a 1.2% fall previously. Later there is data out on EU retail PMI, with US data including ADP non-farm employment change, revised non-farm productivity, revised unit labor costs, IBD/TIPP economic optimism and crude oil inventories. The base metals are selling off. This suggests stale long liquidation has emerged after prices failed to extend the October rallies, and with the year-end approaching it is not surprising some profit-taking is being seen. Tin and lead, the two smallest markets in terms of liquidity/fund interest, are the ones holding up the best, so we   from the broad sell-off in metals, but we note that gold prices have held above support and are getting some lift. With the yen also bucking the trend in the currencies, it may be there is some haven buying around as investors rotate out of those markets that are correcting, which could lead to some inflows into gold. That said, with the Federal Open Market Committee meeting a week away and with the market expecting an interest rate rise, the weakness we have been seeing in gold may well be the market anticipating the rate rise \u0096 this could be the opposite of a \u0093buy the rumor, sell the fact\u0094 set-up.

Example : A $5 booster will give the network a *1.25 exp multiplier as compared to a $20 which nets a *2 exp multiplier\nMystery dust booster that for a set amount of time, allows individual games to reward the player mystery dust. So alongside EXP, coins and guild coins, you also get a sum of mystery dust, depending on your rank.\n3.A jukebox function of some sorts in lobbies\nAllow players to buy tunes to play in lobbies with a cooldown to prevent spamming. The songs can be submitted by fans or made by a hired person, but it adds some form of atmosphere to lobbies.\nPhysical items\n1. Clothes and Apparels\nClothes with the logo/sign of Hypixel games can be an easy design for shirts and all, the inclusion of Hypixel memes like 'soonTM' , 'Watchdog' ect can be included as well.\nA special type of clothing/apparel can be reserved for guilds, similar to Destiny's Age of Triumph's shirt, where there is a set logo for guilds( designed by someone on hypixel or something) and includes the ability to add personalisation to the clothe, like including the IGN, Guild name, Guild Tag and some stats that one is proud of, like 11k AP or Netowrk level 250 ect. Personalisation of shirts will of course cost more than a regular shirt.\n2.Decor\nHypixel branded cups, badges, miniatures of Mega Walls/Warlords classes, soft toys of Companions. Stickers and vinyls for cars and walls could also do fine.\n3.Toy-like merch\nThis can include, railguns from Quakecraft, some of the weapons from Warlords, real life versions of in-game gadgets to name a few. The railguns and Warlord weapon toys will be made out of foam to prevent any possible injuries.\n4. Miscellaneous items\nBooks about the server's rise to fame, becoming the largest server in Minecraft, noting some of the most remarkable achievements the people had gotten on the server, like : First level 250, Technoblade's 1000 win streak ect.\nGeneral Changes\nSwapping VIP+ and MVP around.

Sometimes, people like to gain more xp and more coins from one booster, so it might be a good idea to make a 2 hours booster with a more expensive price. However, this might make the queue a lot longer since every individual boosters take 2 hours.\nGenerosity\nThe only way for you to radiate with generosity ig now is for someone to gift you. Therefore, I think that instead of just gifts, people can buy generosity from the store and they can activate them, eg \"1 game of generosity\" \"5 games of generosity\" \"10 games of generosity\". This, however, might devalue the gifts.\nPlain donation\nYou never know, sometimes people just want to donate a small amount of money without getting anything in return\nVehicles\nPretty same concept as companions, except they are vehicles.\nExpand Friend list\nThe friend limit now is 5000, Which, some players like to have even more friends than that. Therefore, if its possible, allow player who needs more friends to expand their limit (although I dont think many players will need this/buy this)\nHypixel maps for housing\nWhile there are a lot of themes for housing, but they are mostly quite similar to each other in some ways, and after you play housing for sometime it just isn't special anymore. Since housing didn't get an update for a long time, this is also an idea for update, for some better themes that could be bought from the store.

The best example I could think of is a boss battle.\nThe event must be summoned in a lobby with at least 40 people.\nWhen the event is completed via collaboration of people in the lobby, everyone who's done at least something to aid the battle gets a special item/cosmetic only obtainable by playing that event. An example of this with boss battles is at least doing some damage. The more you help the event being completed, the higher your reward is (E.G. more coins, more exp, etc).\n\u2581 \u2582 \u2584 \u2585 \u2586 \u2587 \u2588 Event examples \u2588 \u2587 \u2586 \u2585 \u2584 \u2582 \u2581\nBoss Battle: Albi\nExplanation: This boss is an Enderdragon, with some special abilities.\nAbilities: Fireballs, Flame Breath, Enderman Spawning.\nStore cost: $10\nBoss Battle: Exodus\nExplanation: This boss is a 2 stage boss fight, with the first stage being an objective based fight, and the second stage being a fight against a wither.\nStage 1: Tons of skeletons with bows and witherskeletson are spawned. They defend 4 beacons which must be destroyed by shifting near it for 30 seconds (the only way to do this is by having other players defend you while doing this).\nStage 2: A wither boss is spawned.\nAbilities of boss: Explosion shockwave, Meteor Rain (hide to survive), Wither Skeleton spawning.\nStore cost: $15\nTournament\nExplanation: The event makes a lobby wide announcement that a tournament is starting. 16 people have to accept this. If the 16 is reached, the tournament is starting. If the 16 is not reached, the tournament will be canceled and the event is returned to the player who attempted to host it.\nGameplay: Arena's with glass are summoned (so people can spectate). The 16 people are unleashed on 1v1 battles. After 8 survive, they are unleashed on 1v1 battles against each other again, then 4, then 2, with the finals. The winner gets the cosmetic + the highest reward.\nStore cost: $5\nDefend the beacon\nExplanation: A beacon is summoned in the middle of a lobby. Players must protect this beacon against hordes of zombies. If the beacon has been reached by a monster 4 times, the event is lost. The players must survive 25 waves. Choosing the right lobby is very important, as one lobby has completely different and possibly better gameplay than other lobbies.\nStore cost: $10\n\u2581 \u2582 \u2584 \u2585 \u2586 \u2587 \u2588 FAQ \u2588 \u2587 \u2586 \u2585 \u2584 \u2582 \u2581\nQ: Is this against the EULA?\nA: I'm not an expert on this, from my knowledge, it is not against the EULA as everyone can participate, and rewards are not based on if you bought it, but on how much you help.\u200b", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:54.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "73732afe1edb49bfe0c69d4f34dd7395c9dcebf0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSu2pBmyvyP_UVfznq.FEr9NiMldM3j_nHwD.HVM9HBw8LG.yWNRad_ajb06Ct3GbGoOyqxzjWWgfWbrjF48EPF9q_9AD8KO3Bp7U6Y04b9jQ--", "site_full": "hypixel.net", "site": "hypixel.net", "site_section": "https://hypixel.net/forums/official-hypixel-minecraft-server/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Hypixel Server Discussion | Hypixel - Minecraft Server and Maps", "title": "Looking for store suggestion!

New joinees are no longer required to file separate EPF transfer claims using Form-13 after changing jobs. The new composite form, Form 11, helps it to be done automatically. Form 11 replaces Form 13 in all cases of auto transfer. This was stated by EPFO in a circular dated September 20, 2017. Earlier, employees were required to file Form-13 for PF account transfer on changing jobs.\nPF Balance Auto-Transfer\n1) The new joinee has to fill in personal details and other details like UAN (Universal Account Number) and previous provident fund number in Form 11.\n2) UAN, which is a unique number assigned to an employee, acts as an umbrella for the multiple Member Ids allotted to an individual by different establishments.\n3) The idea is to link multiple Member Identification Numbers (Member Id) allotted to a single employee under single Universal Account Number, which is allotted by Employees' Fund Organization (EPFO).\n4) The employer then enters the information as given in Form 11 in the employer's portal.\n5) The data submitted by the employee in Form 11 is then validated with the information available against the UAN.\nALSO SEE: The 100 Coolest Tech Gadgets of 2017\nThe 100 Coolest Tech Gadgets of 2017 (Slideshow provided by Bestproducts.com)\n6) In case, the UAN is Aadhaar seeded and verified, the declaration by the employer of transfer request made by the employee in Form-11 will trigger an auto-transfer process which will transfer the accumulations against his previous provident fund account (PF ID) to the new provident fund account.\n7) An SMS informing the subscriber about the proposed auto-transfer will be sent on his/her registered mobile number.\n8) Auto transfer will be completed only after the member does not request to stop the proposed auto-transfer (either online, or through employer or at the nearest EPFO office) within 10 days of the SMS, and the first contribution by the present employer is deposited and reconciled.\nALSO WATCH: Unboxing - OnePlus 5T\nReplay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO (Video provided by Times of India)\n9) On transfer of the account, the new employee will be communicated by SMS on his mobile number seeded against the UAN and by e-mail, if registered.\n\u00a9 Provided by NDTV 24x7 pf form 650 \u00a9 Provided by NDTV 24x7 pf form 2 650\n(Composite Declaration Form 11 issued by EPFO for auto-transfer of PF money)\n10) Auto-transfer of previous PF account would be possible in respect of Aaadhar verified employees only.

Michael Balsamo, File AP Photo FBI director heads to Hill after Trump's attacks on agency By SADIE GURMAN Associated Press December 07, 2017 03:45 AM WASHINGTON \nChristopher Wray faces a tough test four months into his leadership of the FBI: He must defend America's top law enforcement agency against blistering attacks from President Donald Trump without putting his own job at risk. \nThe competing pressures Wray faces will be on display Thursday when he testifies before the House Judiciary Committee. Democrats may push him to respond forcefully to Trump's weekend tweets calling the FBI a biased agency whose reputation is \"in Tatters \u2014 worst in History!\" and urging Wray to \"clean house.\" \nSome Republicans will likely echo Trump's concerns about what they see as political bias in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of possible coordination between Trump's campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election. Like Trump, they have seized on revelations that an FBI agent was removed from Mueller's team because of anti-Trump text messages. \nWray's start as FBI head would have been difficult enough, even without the intense scrutiny of the Russia investigation. Since he was sworn-in Aug. 2, the U.S. has had two of the deadliest shootings in its modern history and a terror attack in Manhattan. \nTrump's weekend tweets created a fresh dilemma for Wray. With his bosses, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy Rod Rosenstein, staying publicly silent, it fell to Wray to defend the agency. But FBI directors traditionally have been low-key and stoic \u2014 with Wray's predecessor, James Comey, a notable exception. And Trump's firing of Comey while he led the Russia probe shows the risk of antagonizing the president. \nWray's defense, in an email to FBI employees this week, didn't directly mention Trump's comments, leaving some current and former officials wishing he had pushed back more forcefully. \nWray said he was \"inspired by example after example of professionalism and dedication to justice demonstrated around the bureau\" and urged agents to \"keep focused on our critical mission\" while constantly under a microscope. \nFor some agents still reeling from Trump's firing of the popular Comey, the episode cut to the heart of their deepest concern: whether a Trump-appointed FBI director would be able to stand up to a president who routinely lashes out at law enforcement and has publicly lamented his inability to directly influence the agency's affairs. \nWray repeatedly promised during his confirmation hearing that he could be independent, but \"the jury is still out\" on whether he has demonstrated that, said Frank Montoya Jr., a former senior FBI official who keeps in contact with agents still on the job. \n\"The absence of comment from the top, to us, has been really frustrating,\" Montoya said. \"On the inside, it's like, why are we still a punching bag and nobody is counter-punching? A word of comfort or of calm or a sign of leadership would be appreciated at this time.\" \nWray has stayed mostly under the radar in his first months on the job and has subtly tried to distance himself from Comey, who was widely criticized for publicly announcing that Hillary Clinton shouldn't face criminal charges for her use of a private email server. Wray, for example, said he couldn't imagine holding a news conference about someone who had not been charged, noting Justice Department policies against doing so. \nThose close to Wray, a former high-ranking Justice Department official in the Bush administration, describe him as a steady hand whose low-key demeanor makes him well-suited to lead the FBI during a tumultuous time. He has seemed relaxed but reserved in his few public appearances. His memo Monday to employees ended with his favorite work-ethic maxim: \"Keep calm and tackle hard.\" \n\"In a society sometimes fixated to a fault on results, I am somebody who is a big believer in the importance of the integrity of process,\" Wray said at the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in October. \"That's part of how I am hoping to sort of steady the ship. By staying laser-focused on the mission and the work itself, day in and day out, left foot right foot, grinding away. Following the rules. Following the law. Trying to make sure we are doing the right thing, but in the right way.\" \nTom O'Connor, president of the FBI Agents Association, said Wray has been supportive of agents' concerns so far, meeting with the organization shortly after his confirmation. \n\"He has said that, in the four months since becoming director, he has learned more about, and is even more impressed with, agents' work ethic and commitment to the bureau's mission,\" said O'Connor, who issued his own impassioned defense of the FBI after Trump's attacks. \nOthers defended the agency as well, including Eric Holder, attorney general under President Barack Obama, who urged Justice Department leadership to speak out. Comey himself tweeted, \"The FBI is honest. The FBI is strong. And the FBI is, and always will be, independent.\" \nBut a retired FBI official said the bureau's head needs to keep praise and support quiet and internal. \n\"If you've been there for 20-some years, you might not see attacks this high-profile, but you're going to see attacks over and over and over on the organization,\" said Robert Anderson, a former FBI executive assistant director. \"The way to really beat that stuff is to dig in and do what you do best, and the agency is really going to shine.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hill", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "christopher wray", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sadie gurman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montoya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff sessions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rod rosenstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james comey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert anderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom o'connor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "comey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frank montoya jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o'connor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric holder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael balsamo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wray", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house judiciary committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hill after trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi agents association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international association of chiefs of police", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:54.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f97d4a4be68ccbf6a7065f79d5911965dcb61df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Sq8tQ9t9EXkEcMv.KViGHzYjiTHBu8cCt9VdH97LgZXEinKwHl5QIPUNnwvzsuf8cm_ibsAfis79kJ_BTQUjTR7ofuAwLfII-", "site_full": "websbiggestever.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://websbiggestever.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Webs Biggest Ever", "title": "Google Alert - biggest", "title_full": "Google Alert - biggest", "published": "2017-12-07T11:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f97d4a4be68ccbf6a7065f79d5911965dcb61df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Sq8tQ9t9EXkEcMv.KViGHzYjiTHBu8cCt9VdH97LgZXEinKwHl5QIPUNnwvzsuf8cm_ibsAfis79kJ_BTQUjTR7ofuAwLfII-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gandaillon (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "Google Alert - biggest", "text": "biggest As-it-happens update \u22c5 December 7, 2017 NEWS NYC Rise in Homeless is One of the Biggest in the US Wall Street Journal Homelessness in New York City rose by 4.1% in 2017 overall, one of the bigger increases in the U.S., according to a federal report released Wednesday. \"New York City is one of the most expensive and constrained housing markets in the nation, and the numbers released today reflect that reality,\" said ...

Ayurveda texts have reference of amla as a wonder drug. \nI have always been a great fan of this fruit but in our household the only way mom will use it is in chutneys and curries, and my quest for intersting way to consume went on till I saw my dad in law making this pickle throughout the winter as a regime. He would make a batch of fresh amlas every week and it would be polished off in no time. I even indulge in it like a kid will do with candies and eat it every now an d then to tickle my taste buds. \nThis pickle has a very refreshing sour taste and it lingers on in your mouth leaving it refreshed and is very appetising too. This can be served as a side for porridge/rice/chapati. I like to use it little more daringly in my stuffing of paranthas also. You know how a taste freak would use anything so tasteful to its best. \nI have written this in the most comprehensive form to allow you to try it without any doubts as it took me quite sometime to start cooking it myself as dad would always keep it ready without keeping us waiting and I would lose my opportunity to coo some. \nNow that I have started making it myself, regularly , I can vouch for the simplicity and excellence of this Recipe. \nIndian gooseberry and garlic Pickle Prepration Time 20 min Cooking Time Two sets of about 6-7 min Equipments Iron Skillet, ladle, and knife Ingredients Amla ( gooseberry) 10-12 medium \nGarlic cloves 10-15\nMustrad oil 1/4 Cup\nFennel Seeds( saunf) 3 Tsp\nNigella Seeds( Kalounjee) 1Tsp \nFenugreek Seeds(methi) 3Tsp \nTurmeric powder 1/2 Tsp \nRed chili powder 1&1/2 Tsp \nAsafoetida 1/4 Tsp \nSalt 2Tsp \nMethod Boil water in a pan, enough to cover all the berries. Once the water boils add amla and keep it for 6-7 minutes. Do not overcook. Strain and allow to cool. Cut in wedges releasing the seed. Meanwhile heat oil in an iron skillet. Pound the fennel and nigella seeds in hand pestle to coarse bits. Add asafoetida and fenugreek to hot oil, allow to brown a bit.( one can swith off the flame in case the fenugreek starts to cook dark. Add garlic and berries and coarse nigella and fennel along with other spices like turmeric, chilli and salt.

Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio, left, and Keith Gregg, the county's Chief Information Technology Officer, right, speak at a press conference Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, at the Government Center about t... \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .
