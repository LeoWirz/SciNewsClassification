It is essential that the coverage that you purchase is adequate. Falling sick is not in our control but we can make ourselves ready beforehand so that we can have the arrangement to pay for our hospitalization bills and other medical costs. Nevertheless, in order to ensure this, you have to explore the various options that are available around you. For getting a cheap health insurance cover, you should start looking for an online health insurance quote which would contain every necessary detail you wished to know as far as your health insurance requirement is concerned. To get free health insurance quotes online, you need to do only a few simple things.\n\nFirst, you need to browse a number of websites where you can get health insurance quotes and carry out comparison between them and you don\u2019t need to spend a single penny for doing this. There are tools that will enable you to compare quotes simultaneously. The reason behind exploring a number of health insurance carriers is that each of them assesses you in a distinct manner. You can get the same amount of coverage with different premium rates from different carriers. Some may assume you to be a high-risk customer while the others may not.\nFor obtaining the best family health insurance coverage , collecting quotes and comparing premium rates of different insurers is crucial. At the same time, you should remember that the cheapest quote would not bring you the best coverage. Look for the coverage that is compatible with your needs. You can choose a coverage without anybody\u2019s help and you don\u2019t have to seek the assistance of an insurance broker. An insurance broker may not help you get the most suitable coverage all the time. Instead, he might mislead you for his own financial gains. So, it is always better to act independently. Researching a few insurers can help you save a lot of money and time. With the help of the Internet, shopping around and getting the most affordable coverage is simple like never before.\n\nFor obtaining further information about getting free health insurance quotes online, one can log on to ProHealthInsuranceQuote.

What makes it even worse is that he (the guy I was dating) said he still wanted to talk to me as a friend and still wanted to go with me to the anime convention next spring (we were supposed to go as him as Link and me as Sheik so it was a couple kind of thing) and he even said that he hopes i don't play the victim when I shouldn't be, well I am not playing anything when I AM THE FREAKING victim! I will surely pm you if I need more words, I cannot even begin to describe how much my heart hurts I feel like dying\n1", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:12.086+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dffe8dc085c3b954d1cc256b9366aafd58d7f540", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpMfouZbcTsqM3wju51VzJK.OqmcBVpFwT5RGi0yLpQXMwqQGLrsmYCvvL44jtW9ybgmQgvvW2LumW_ryryuCQRKKovEPlq6k-", "site_full": "onehallyu.com", "site": "onehallyu.com", "site_section": "https://onehallyu.com/forum/14-love-relationships/", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Love &amp; Relationships - OneHallyu", "title": "When You Lose A Friend & A Love Interest...", "title_full": "When You Lose A Friend & A Love Interest... - Love & Relationships - OneHallyu", "published": "2017-12-04T07:44:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://onehallyu.com//public/style_images/master/meta_image.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 15761, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ad40fbf00fb9275cfd05f8d2f5cc33e9b5fd08ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpMfouZbcTsqM3wju51VzJK.OqmcBVpFwT5RGi0yLpQXMwqQGLrsmYCvvL44jtW9ybgmQgvvW2LumW_ryryuCQwj0RSiTnqlMaGw1xK1ZRIQ--", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "Gloupipoo", "published": "2017-12-04T20:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "CUT THAT SNAKE OFF SHE AINT A FRIEND SHE A FRAUD\n0", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:12.087+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dffe8dc085c3b954d1cc256b9366aafd58d7f540", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpMfouZbcTsqM3wju51VzJK.OqmcBVpFwT5RGi0yLpQXMwqQGLrsmYCvvL44jtW9ybgmQgvvW2LumW_ryryuCQRKKovEPlq6k-", "site_full": "onehallyu.com", "site": "onehallyu.com", "site_section": "https://onehallyu.com/forum/14-love-relationships/", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Love &amp; Relationships - OneHallyu", "title": "When You Lose A Friend & A Love Interest...", "title_full": "When You Lose A Friend & A Love Interest... - Love & Relationships - OneHallyu", "published": "2017-12-04T07:44:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://onehallyu.com//public/style_images/master/meta_image.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 15761, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9cabe12da07ae2f9ce0053a31ae75f05b02ada62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpMfouZbcTsqM3wju51VzJK.OqmcBVpFwT5RGi0yLpQXMwqQGLrsmYCvvL44jtW9ybgmQgvvW2LumW_ryryuCQwj0RSiTnqlNpGgoelhCefg--", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "mitsuhoney", "published": "2017-12-04T09:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "O you\u2019re savage lmfao.

Filipino boxing icon Manny Pacquaio during a training session at the Elorde Boxing Gym at the Mall of Asia in Pasay City in preparation for his coming fight against Jeff Horn in Brisbane, Australia on July 2. PHOTO BY RUSSELL PALMA \nHe and Chinese sports-development firm Dancing Sports held a signing ceremony that included plans to build a Manny Pacquiao International Boxing Academy in the capital, the company said. \nZhou Wenxin, chairman of Dancing Sports, said their tie-up would deepen Chinese-Philippine relations in boxing and beyond. \nThe academy will draft in coaches from abroad to help develop Chinese boxing, which has never had a truly world-class fighter. There is no public timeline for when it will be built. \nChina\u2019s most famous boxer, Zou Shiming, lost his WBO flyweight belt when he was knocked out by Japan\u2019s unfancied Sho Kimura in his first defence in July. \nWhen Pacquiao\u2019s plans for China were first announced in 2014, he said that he believed the partnership could help thaw frosty ties between the Philippines and China, who were engaged in a territorial maritime dispute in the South China Sea. \nRelations have since improved considerably under current Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. \nAt the time, Pacquiao defended the decision to open a boxing academy in China instead of his own country. \n\u201cIn the Philippines we don\u2019t have a problem [producing good boxers],\u201d said Pacquiao, a hero in his home country and also a senator.

One of my housemates (who was the one who introduced me to Tuan, the one I was involved with) feels guilty about the whole thing and I have told him that it was not his fault at all. He even yelled at him for doing what he did and said that it was not like him to do this (the both of them have been friends for six years). What makes it worse is Chris (the friend) still managed to reach out to me and said that he was busy at work but would like to explain himself to me and that he is sure I will feel a lot better when I tell him. How? How in the world would you say ANYTHING to make me feel better about what has happened? What makes me so angry is that he said to me, \"I know it is hard but please try to stay positive and get through the day.\" Like how dare you have the audacity to tell me how I should feel when you were one of the two people who caused me to feel what I am feeling?\nI really cannot even believe that they would think I would take a \"pity date\" and go as Sheik with him (Tuan) as Link just because it was a promise he made me that he did not want to break. Really? Because you broke my heart so how is this going to make the situation any better? I am going to look so stupid standing next to someone who left me for someone else, while that other person is right there probably happy because he thinks doing this will make him feel better about what he did.\nSorry for my sudden burst of anger, not taking it out on you at all. I just feel so shitty right now. I really feel like they think what I am going through is selfish, worthless and unnecessary.

L\u2019album in questione si intitola \u201c Landfall \u201d ed uscir\u00e0 il prossimo 16 febbraio per Nonesuch . \nLa musicista d\u2019avanguardia, nonch\u00e9 ex moglie di Lou Reed, ha cos\u00ec commentato in un comunicato stampa: \n\u201cThese are stories with tempos. I\u2019ve always been fascinated by the complex relationship of words and music whether in song lyrics, supertitles or voice over. In Landfall, instruments initiate language through our new text software, erst. The blend of electronic and acoustic strings is the dominant sound of Landfall. Much of the music in this work is generated from the harmonies and delays of unique software designed for the solo viola and reinterpreted for the quartet. In addition, there were elements of the optigan, a keyboard that uses information stored on optical discs.\u201d \nDi seguito trovate il primo singolo estratto \u201cWe Learn To Speak Yet Another Language\u201d e la copertina del disco.

Some member states, including France, support two days of verification every five years. \nGermany, however, opposes inspections by the Commission, arguing \"any kind of audit means extra bureaucracy without being beneficial,\" in a position paper dated Nov. 30, seen by Reuters. Italy and seven other nations are asking for conditions that would weaken the Commission's oversight power, the sources said. \n\"It boils down to: do we want the Commission to put its nose in the affairs of the national type-approval authorities?\" one diplomat said. \"After Dieselgate, it's hard to say no.\" \nAnother point of contention is the number of on-road emissions tests a country is obliged to carry out - after such checks in the U.S. helped uncover the VW scandal in 2015. \nA draft compromise text seen by Reuters proposes that member states carry out checks on at least one in every 40,000 new vehicles registered there, and 20 percent of those checks must include emissions tests. \nThe number is less than the European Parliament asked for. It also means far fewer checks than in the U.S., climate campaigners say. \n\"Regular controls of national authorities is key to changing the culture,\" said Julia Poliscanova, an expert with Brussels-based campaign group Transport and Environment. \"Many member states continue to act as if Dieselgate didn't happen.\" \nEU negotiators early on abandoned the Commission's plan to break cozy relations between automakers and the laboratories they hire to test vehicles by introducing a system whereby manufacturers do not pay laboratories directly for such tests. \nBut many other changes intended to avoid a repeat of the scandal, such as allowing EU-wide recalls of vehicles, are set to become law. Under current rules, national bodies, such as Germany's KBA authority, approve new cars and alone have the power to revoke those licenses.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "julia poliscanova", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dieselgate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elzbieta bienkowska", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "volkswagen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:14.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "22c43b6497920b342e943aa568eea954a71f015f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrersk20g92Ik50wchZ0ppzd2noApq11HTr93Ie3G5vVMAyUusyjeXo0kMPXAfV6xjZmsNh0G7XkiwtITrW.bz4", "site_full": "texashuntingforum.com", "site": "texashuntingforum.com", "site_section": "http://texashuntingforum.com/forum/ubbthreads.php/forums/47/1/", "site_categories": ["hunting_shooting", "sports"], "section_title": "Wild Hog &amp; Javelina Hunting | Texas Hunting Forum", "title": "Public Bacon Questions - Caddo Grasslands Ladonia Unit", "title_full": "Public Bacon Questions - Caddo Grasslands Ladonia Unit | Wild Hog & Javelina Hunting | Texas Hunting Forum", "published": "2017-12-04T17:31:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "22c43b6497920b342e943aa568eea954a71f015f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrersk20g92Ik50wchZ0ppzd2noApq11HTr93Ie3G5vVMAyUusyjeXo0kMPXAfV6xjZmsNh0G7XkiwtITrW.bz4", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mp88", "published": "2017-12-04T17:31:00.000+02:00", "title": "Public Bacon Questions - Caddo Grasslands Ladonia Unit", "text": "I'm a new hunter and I've recently been scouting and hunting the Ladonia unit of Caddo Grasslands.\nI see tons of hog sign and have even seen one spook off at a watering hole in the afternoon.\nAnytime I see hog hunts in Texas it's almost all at night.\nMy question is have hogs in this area become almost exclusively nocturnal?

The donation comes in the wake of this year\u2019s Ecobank theme dubbed, \u2018 Safe Water, Healthy Living.\u2019 In addition to the donation, the  Ecobank Tanzania staff have also participated  in a number of cleanliness activities including unclogging the school\u2019s drainage system and treating water in the school\u2019s borehole to ensure the pupils get clean water. On the academic side, the bank has also donated text books to the school and awarded the best performing pupils from standard one to six. Ecobank Tanzania Ltd Managing Director Ms. Mwanahiba Mzee said Ecobank marks this day annually with the aim of giving back and supporting the community. \u2018We were informed that Hananasif Primary School has a total of 728 pupils but their water pipes were blocked and only had one tap that served the whole school. Their toilets had no running water hence posing a great health risk to pupils, teachers and workers,\u201d said Ms. Mzee. According to the MD, the text books donation and awarding best pupils was aimed at encouraging the pupils to work even harder and aim higher. \u201cEcobank realizes the need to improve education and infrastructure in schools as a way of supporting the Government\u2019s initiative in improving education,\u201d said the MD.  On her part, the Hananasif Primary School Head teacher  Mrs Uisso commended the bank\u2019s efforts in supporting the school to get clean water. \u201cI take this opportunity to thank Ecobank Tanzania management for selecting our school. She said their biggest challenge was water considering the number of pupils at the school. \u201cWith the poly tank donation we are now sure of clean and reliable water for our pupils and staff,\u201d She also thanked the bank for the text books donation and for motivating the best students. \u201cWe have been performing well in national examinations but what you have done today will play a major boost to our performance and it will encourage other pupils to also work hard.

LUKAS COCH / EPA The Australian Parliament voted on Thursday to allow same-sex marriage across the nation, following a bitter and divisive debate settled by the government polling voters in a much-criticized ballot survey that strongly endorsed change. The public gallery of the House of Representatives erupted with applause when the bill passed to change the definition of marriage from solely between a man and a woman to \"a union of two people\" excluding all others. The legislation passed with a majority that wasn't challenged, although five lawmakers registered their opposition to the bill. The Senate passed the same legislation last week 43 votes to 12. After formalities the law will likely take effect in about a month, with the first weddings expected about a month later. Gay marriage was endorsed by 62 percent of Australian voters who responded to the government-commissioned postal ballot . Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SIGN UP Emotional Australian lawmakers react to passage of historic same-sex marriage law 00:33 Most gay rights advocates believed the government should have allowed marriages years ago and saw various ideas for a public survey as a delaying tactic. The U.N. Human Rights Committee had called the ballot survey \"an unnecessary and divisive public opinion poll.\" Amendments meant to safeguard freedoms of speech and religion for gay-marriage opponents were all rejected, though those issues may be considered later. The government has appointed a panel to examine how to safeguard religious freedoms once gay marriage is a reality in Australia. Lawmakers advocating marriage equality had argued that the national postal survey in November mandated a change of the marriage definition alone, so changing the law should not be delayed by other considerations. \"It's an historic day for Australia today and I think the celebrations around the country when we finally ... achieve marriage equality are going to be immense,\" Janet Rice said before the vote. Rice is a minor Greens party senator who was only able to remain married to her transgender wife of 31 years, Penny, because Penny remained listed as male on her birth certificate. Penny Wong, an opposition Labor Party senator who has two children with her lesbian partner, said: \"I am feeling happy.\" Liberal lawmaker Warren Entsch lifts up Labor lawmaker Linda Burney as they celebrate the passing of the Marriage Amendment Bill on Thursday. LUKAS COCH / EPA The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. One of the rejected amendments would have ensured Australians could speak freely about their traditional views of marriage without fear of legal action. Veteran gay rights campaigner Rodney Croome said he expected the first same-sex weddings in Australia would not take place until February.

But that's not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge. \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" \nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n\u2014 Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n\u2014 Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n\u2014 Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C. \nFor the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point.
