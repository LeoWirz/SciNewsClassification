I do, I do, I do. \nAbout 2.5 years ago, right after my first (and only) breakup , my friend Sam came to visit me in Minneapolis. Sam is from Boise, ID, but we met in the Design School at the University of Minnesota. We were h-core besties for about a year and a half before she moved back to Boise to finish school. I bring Sam up because she\u2019s one of those friends that comes to the rescue when you have a breakup. I needed her and she was there for about 5 minutes. Not only did she bring herself to Minnesota, but she\u2019s also the one who introduced me to the glory of plants. I remember furniture shopping with Sam (she\u2019s a bad ass interior designer) and making a pit stop at Ikea where she told me \u201cwe\u2019re going to get you some plants.\u201d Then, we left with 10. \nI am happy to say that I still have 2 of those same plants. Let\u2019s not talk about the other 8. MY OTHER VIDEOS \nSince then, I\u2019ve acquired at least 20 additional plants in all different shapes and sizes. Today I want to talk to you about all the different reasons why I love plants and why you should do. I am not trying to sell you anything other than the fact that plants are the fucking bomb. Chair // Table (handmade by Lin\u2019s BF) // Wall Hanging (similar) // Media Stand (similar) Reasons Why I Love Plants Plants make me happy. Plain and simple, this is the number one reasons why I love plants. They make me happy. Oxygen. I could bore you with how photosynthesis works, but all of the plants in my house are like a little micro-ecosystem. I give them C02 and they give me oxygen. Plants give me something to take care of other than myself. Keeping plants alive is a challenge and I\u2019m constantly learning things to do and not to do. It\u2019s been such a fun new hobby. Plants are a talking point. I\u2019ve noticed on Instagram that a lot of you could care less about what I\u2019m making in the kitchen or doing in the gym and just want to talk about plants. Plants bring people together and that is just wonderful. Plants make the best gifts. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to feel good about spending money on ourselves, but spending money on others- sure why not! I am a total plant giver for all seasons, holidays, and life events. Plants inspire me. As weird as this sounds, just being in the same room as a bunch of beautiful plants makes me feel inspired. Try it sometime. Plants are alive. Sometimes I forgot that plants are living things. They need food and water to survive and a specific type of climate, just like us! Greenery is Pantone\u2019s color of the year! Not that I\u2019m trying to be trendy or anything, but kind of cool that Pantone recognized greenery! Plants make my home look like a home. If you removed all of the plants from my house, it would just look off. Plants are the sign of love and life and I think that\u2019s why I have so damn many. My Current Plant Babies \nFig Newton the Fiddle Fig: This is my newest plant addition to Fit Foodie HQ. He\u2019s actually a replacement plant (SHHHH) because I killed the first Fiddle Fig I had due to turning my air off mid-summer when I went on vacation. It went from a steady 68\u00baF to 98\u00baF + high humidity. Poor guy. In case you\u2019re local to Minneapolis, I got him for $99 at Bachman\u2019s . The planter is from West Elm! Anyways, here\u2019s some GREAT information on how to keep a Fiddle Fig alive. Once you get the hang of it, they\u2019re beautiful plants! Chair (similar) // Planter \nCactus: I love cacti! They are so easy to take care of and really hard to kill. I am eventually going to replant this guy so that he grows taller. Ali from Inspiralized inspired me to do this because she has a massive cactus named Bart \ud83d\ude00 \nAloe Vera Plant: There\u2019s a lot of really great health/wellness uses for aloe plants, but I like mine for the looks. It kind of reminds me of Edward Scissor Hands. Desk // Picture Frame \nAlgerian Ivy Plant: This is another new plant that I\u2019ve gotten within in the last month. Linley and I made a pit stop at Brown in Green in Linden Hills and couldn\u2019t walk out empty handed. I love him for the way he drapes and kind of want 10 more. Here\u2019s more info on Algerian Ivy Plants ! \nSucculent (I think): I have small succulents scattered everywhere in my house. Whether they are in homemade planters (by me!) or cute little store bought ones, they really do complete every tabletop! \nUNKNOWN: I can\u2019t for the life of me figure out what this plant is called. I also can\u2019t remember where I purchased him from. Sad thing is, I have 2 of them! Anyways, I\u2019ve had both of these for over a year, so good news is, they aren\u2019t hard to keep alive either! If anyone out there knows the name of this plant, please do let me know! \nMother in Law\u2019s Tongue AKA Snake Plant: This plant came highly recommended by Monique and a lot of other people. I LOVE HIM. They are super hard to kill, which is just wonderful, and a great piece of greenery to add to any room. I just picked up this adorable woven basket from Target for $19\u2026score! \nMaidenhair (I think): I\u2019m not 100% sure what kind of plant this is, but it\u2019s another small guy I got from Brown and Greene .

The agency had started the investigation in February last year. \nThe agency has written a letter to Rajnish Tingal, the joint secretary of Department of Pharmaceutical and Ministry of Chemicals who is also looking after NIPERs, demanding that registrar Wing Commander (retd) P J P Singh Waraich, who is also holding charge of Chief Vigilance Officer (CVO). The letter was sent so that the investigation could not be influenced. \nThe letter, accessed by Chandigarh Newsline, read, \u201cP J P Singh Waraich, registrar, is an accused in case related to various allegations including misappropriation and diversion of plan funds allocated under 11th five year plan. He is also holding the charge of CVO, NIPER, Mohali. It is therefore recommended that he may either be posted out of some other NIPER institute or may be posted to a non-sensitive post.\u201d \nThe letter was sent by a local CBI branch to the department on October 30 this year but the department is yet to take any action. Sources in NIPER said that the decision could be taken on Waraich by the Board of Governors (BoG) in their next meeting. \nWaraich was among the nine NIPER officials who were booked by the agency on February 12, 2016. The other accused included former director of NIPER P Ramarao, the then officiating director K K Bhutani, registrar and chief vigilance officer Wing Commander (retd) P J P Singh Waraich, former deputy registrar Rakesh Mauja, and Professor Sharanjeet Singh. Besides, a private firm at Thorat colony, Erandwane, Pune, and other unknown persons were also booked for cheating, criminal conspiracy, forgery, criminal breach of trust and corruption by the agency. \nTingal was not available for comment. His staff told Chandigarh Newsline that he was attending an important meeting. \nNIPER director Dr Raghuram Rao Akkinepally said that the BoG is the supreme body which takes all the important decisions.

This would make their disposal safer. The study was recently published in Environmental Science and Pollution Research. \nWith every Indian household today possessing an average of at least three chargers, the item has increased the huge burden of e-waste in the country by several folds. Their disposal, experts said, is trickier, due to the inclusion of a wide range of metals, some of which are toxic. For instance: a mobile charger, when disintegrated, can typically come across as a Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), a plastic body, heat sink, condensers and transistors. As part of the study, researchers visited various scrap markets in Aurangabad. They bought at least 12 chargers \u2014 one of every make and manufactured under the same batch \u2014 each at the cost of Rs 10. \nLead researcher Nitin Adhapure from the Department of Biotechnology and Microbiology at Vivekanand Arts, Sardar Dalipsingh Commerce and Science College, Aurangabad, said, \u201cOver a 1,000 chargers were found at these markets\u2026 It took us about a fortnight and several visits to the markets to find the chargers.\u201d \nThe team then cleaned and tested the PCBs by immersing them into a liquid enriched with the potential microbes \u2014 Acidiphilium, Leptospirillum, Sulfobacillus, T caldus and A ferrooxidans, among others, which are believed to extract the metals. Some of the common metals polished on circuit boards include copper, nickel, zinc, iron, silver and lead, with copper being highest in proportion. Experiments to extract the metals were conducted on both pulverised (fine particles) and non-pulverised boards, to test their feasibility. Metal extraction from the pulverised boards was found to be higher, said a team member. \nArvind Deshmukh, former head of Microbiology Department at Dr B A M University, Osmanabad, said, \u201c\u2026within 144 hours of chemical processing and electrolysis, we managed to extract up to 92 per cent of the actual copper composed on the board\u201d. Maximum amounts of both zinc and lead were extracted within the first 48 hours of the processing, the team added. \nPrashant Dhakephalkar, senior microbiologist with Agharkar Research Institute (ARI), said, \u201cThe advantage of the microbial solution is that these microbes are autotrophic \u2014 they are self-sufficient and can grown on their own,helping cap the cost of the solution.\u201d \u201cNature has provided us with numerous microbes, possessing unique characteristics to address our problems. We just need to identify them and put them to the best of use in an most eco-friendly manner,\u201d he added. He said, \u201cCalculation for the metal extraction using this method suggests that from one litre of the solution, the extraction cost would be less than a rupee. These metals can later be reused or sold.\u201d   Related News", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "prashant dhakephalkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arvind deshmukh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nitin adhapure", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ut", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of biotechnology and microbiology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microbiology department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "agharkar research institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sardar dalipsingh commerce and science college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pune news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "environmental science and pollution research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vivekanand arts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "printed circuit boards", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chandigarh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "osmanabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maharashtra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aurangabad", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:08.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "05fa3fee46e4e5729a89a78c2031336a19fcc5d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qMusYjKb8WCK7Y0HUdGTnEKsyLM3.nbPL49iNVrL.mRQ0ts6FCFa1yibZWNMuROC.sYTm1bIgX4Wm_NKOydUhaBg4OHURpkPbDW69HqDlPCZJ59eA51cIDfFMYeD.PUxFA-", "site_full": "indianexpress.com", "site": "indianexpress.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Babri demolition 25 years later: Protests held in Pune | The Indian Express", "title_full": "Babri demolition 25 years later: Protests held in Pune | The Indian Express", "published": "2017-12-07T07:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.237, "main_image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/12/babri-protest.jpg?w=759", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 598, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "05fa3fee46e4e5729a89a78c2031336a19fcc5d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qMusYjKb8WCK7Y0HUdGTnEKsyLM3.nbPL49iNVrL.mRQ0ts6FCFa1yibZWNMuROC.sYTm1bIgX4Wm_NKOydUhaBg4OHURpkPbDW69HqDlPCZJ59eA51cIDfFMYeD.PUxFA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Express News Service", "published": "2017-12-07T07:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "Babri demolition 25 years later: Protests held in Pune | The Indian Express", "text": "Dr Ambedkar death anniversary: Traffic restriction on major roads in Shivaji Park, Dadar \nMembers OF the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), the Popular Front of India (PFI), the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM), the Masjid Action Committee, the Ulema council, the Jamiyat Ulema Hind, the Republican Yuva Morcha, the Lokshashan Andolan, the Desh Bachao Aghadi, among others, gathered near the Pune District Collectorate on Wednesday to protest against the demolition of Babri Masjid. \nWhile December 6 is marked as Ambedkar\u2019s Mahaparinirvan Divas (death anniversary), the day is also remembered for the demolition of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya by karsevaks in 1992.The Supreme Court began hearing in the title suit in the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute on Tuesday.

By passing off malicious actions as benign, legitimate processes, Kogan and Liberman found a potent way for even relatively less-sophisticated attackers to give new life to malicious code threats well-known to security vendors. Once cloaked with \"Process Doppelg\u00e4nging,\" these threats can impact the latest versions of Windows protected with fully-updated AV and NGAV security products, where malware payloads can proceed to ransom files, capture keystrokes or steal priceless data. \nenSilo's Black Hat Europe research is available for download here . Additionally, interested viewers can register to attend a free, public webinar on Process Doppelg\u00e4nging with Liberman, where he will provide a walk-through of threats and defenses. \nIn addition to blinding Windows' embedded defense mechanisms and third-party AV and NGAV security products to incoming threats, Process Doppelg\u00e4nging gives attackers the further advantage of leaving no traceable evidence behind - making this type of intrusion extremely difficult to detect after the fact with the latest forensic techniques. \nenSilo customers are already protected from Process Doppelg\u00e4nging in the wild, via enSilo's proven pre and post infection endpoint security platform combining automated, blocking-enabled Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) capabilities with Threat Hunting, Incident Response, and Virtual Patching features. enSilo's integrated approach sees and arrests attacks impersonating legitimate Windows processes, affording users additional peace of mind - instead of the uncertainty and management burdens of relying on multiple, piecemeal endpoint protection tools. \n\"The 'Process Doppelg\u00e4nging' attack method we discovered leverages several complex mechanisms in Windows operating systems and intimate knowledge of the inner-workings of AVs' file scanning engines. Putting all this together allows masquerading a malicious executable as legitimate, bypassing all tested security products,\" Liberman explained. \"This is another example of how a few subtle manipulations of code, based on deep insight into the operating system internals, are all that is required to upend many layered detection and traditional prevention defenses,\" Kogan added. \"Our research shows that even the latest protections can be negated by an attacker's creative bid to skip a malicious file payload altogether and infiltrate dangerous content through Windows' intricacies.\" \nKogan and Liberman's selection to present at Black Hat Europe is the latest recognition given to enSilo's renowned team of security researchers working tirelessly to defend customers and the wider security community from evolving threats. enSilo has earned recognition for high-profile work uncovering security risks with major operating systems and novel attack methods. This includes offering an independent patch for Windows' ESTEEMAUDIT remote desktop protocol vulnerability, detailing \"AtomBombing\" attacks that inject malicious code through Windows atom tables and revealing how attackers can hijack anti-virus products' own features to defeat security measures. \nAbout enSilo enSilo comprehensively secures the endpoint pre- and post-infection. enSilo automates and orchestrates detection, prevention and real-time response against advanced malware and ransomware without burdening cybersecurity staff. enSilo's single lightweight agent includes next generation antivirus (NGAV), application communication control, automated endpoint detection and response (EDR) with real-time blocking, threat hunting, incident response and virtual patching capabilities.

Bricks and stones were hurled by both groups, and shots reportedly fired in the air during the clash. \nSAD candidates did not file nomination papers from any seat in Mallanwala Nagar Panchayat and Makhu Nagar Panchayat as party leaders alleged that they were attacked by Congress workers at the behest of Zira MLA Kulbir Singh Zira. \nBoth the Nagar Panchyats fall in Zira constituency of Ferozepur and have 13 seats each. \nThe video footage, which went viral, purportedly showed Congress workers blocking vehicles of SAD leaders Avtar Singh Minna, Vardev Singh Mann and Joginder Singh Jindu and not letting them pass from that area. Police was a mute spectator to this in the video. However, Congress alleged that it was done in retaliation to firing done in air by SAD workers and it started from the house of SAD leader Balwinder Singh. While Congress alleged two of their workers got injured, SAD\u2019s district president Avtar Singh Minna suffered a minor injury when his car was attacked by Congress workers. Avtar Singh\u2019s vehicle also got damaged. \nLater, clash occurred at a petrol pump which belonged to one Satwant Chawla, whose mother is contesting polls from one of the ward of Mallanwala Nagar Panchayat. The incident occurred at around 2 pm, while 3 pm was the deadline for filing nomination papers. Joginder Singh Jindu, former MLA of Ferozepur (Rural), while talking with The Indian Express, said, \u201cReturning officers of Mallanwala as well as Makhu were not giving no objection certificate(NoC) to SAD candidates. We were having a meeting at Gurdwara Jamni Sahib in Ferozepur district where Avtar Singh Minna, district president of SAD, was also present. We got a call from former SAD MLA Hari Singh Zira (father of Avtar Singh Minna) that candidates were not being given NOC and hence all of us went to Mallanwala to meet the concerned officer. But close to the office of the executive officer (EO) of Nagar Panchayat, our vehicles were attacked, firing was done in air and police remained a mute spectator.\u201d A damaged vehicle after the clash in Mulwala village. \nAvtar Singh alleged that due to the actions of Congress workers at the behest of area MLA Kulbir Singh Zira, their candidates could not file nomination papers. He said,\u201dIt was plotted by Kulbir Zira and the videos are the proof of the same.\u201d \nJindu, meanwhile, said that they had given a complaint to SSP for lodging a case against Zira and his workers while a complaint was also being sent to Election Commission to tell that our candidates were deliberately not given NOCs. \nKulbir Singh Zira, however, said,\u201dThis drama was created by SAD as they never wanted to contest, but wanted to create a scene in order to run away from polls. I was sitting within the office of the petrol pump when firing occurred on our workers from the side of SAD. There was an election meeting at that pump. However, when more than 15 rounds were fired by SAD, our workers got angry. Stones and bricks were thrown from both sides and our two workers have also been injured. I will sit on a dharna if police refuse to register a case against them.\u201d \nJindu claimed,\u201dVideos are proof of who was attacked by whom. We have given a complaint to the police and we want action against the Congress workers and even area MLA.\u201d \nAsked about the complaint of not giving NOC to the candidates, Ramvir Singh, DC, Ferozepur, said,\u201dI have given 32 NOCs in Mallanwala while 43 in Makhu Municipal Committee polls, I had asked the complainants to take NOCs from me, in case they were finding any problem. Two of them came, I told them to take NoCs right away, however, they did not take and went away by saying that they were just inquiring.\u201d \nBhupinder Singh Sidhu, SSP Ferozepur, said that he is investigating the matter and an FIR was yet to be lodged. \nDuring the last Nagar Panchayat polls from Mallanwala and Makhu, no Congress candidate could file his nomination papers as Congress MLA Kulbir Zira alleged that candidates were threatened not to file nomination papers and all seats were thus won by SAD. \nInterestingly, this time, SAD candidates could not file nomination papers from both Nagar Panchayats following the clash.

No passenger was injured in any of the incidents, said PMPML officials. According to commuters\u2019 organisations, the incidents have \u201chighlighted that something is wrong with the state of PMPML buses, and have shaken the confidence of passengers\u201d. As many as 11 lakh commuters travel every day on 1,300 PMPML buses in the city. \nThe first incident took place at the Chinchwadgaon bus stop, where a fire broke out in an empty bus on Wednesday afternoon, said officials. By the time the fire brigade brought the blaze under control, the bus was gutted. In the second incident, a fire broke out in a PMPML bus at the RTO Chowk, burning it partially. Both buses were CNG-operated and belonged to the PMPML, not to a private contractor. \nPMPML Chairman and Managing Director Tukaram Mundhe didn\u2019t respond to repeated calls. Subhash Gaikwad, spokesperson of the transport body, blamed \u201cmechanical fault\u201d for the two fire incidents. \u201cIn both cases, prima facie, it seems a short-circuit caused the fire. It seems to be a mechanical fault, but it could also be because of CNG operations. The matter will be investigated thoroughly,\u201d he said. The other took place at the RTO Chowk. \nPrashant Inamdar of Pedestrians First, an organisation working for the rights of commuters, said, \u201cDespite the first two fire incidents, it seems PMPML officials did not check the fitness of the buses\u2026\u201d. \u201cIn the first incident, the entire bus was burnt\u2026 imagine what would have happened had the bus been occupied by passengers\u2026,\u201d he said. \nThe Regional Transport Office (RTO) and traffic police had to play important roles in the matter, said Inamdar. \u201c\u2026 RTO has to conduct sudden raids to check the fitness of PMPML buses to ensure they are safe,\u201d he said. Regional Transport Officer Balasaheb Ajri said, \u201cWe do conduct fitness checks on buses\u2026 we will investigate what caused the fire and submit our report to the PMPML for corrective action.\u201d \nTraffic police officials pointed out that frequent breakdowns, accidents and fire incidents on roads led to traffic snarls, inconveniencing hundreds of commuters. \u201cThe PMPML should ensure that its buses do not inconvenience other commuters,\u201d said a traffic official.

BREAKING DOWN 'Sub-Advised Fund' \nSub-advised funds can be found across a range of strategies in the investable market. They are the product of relationships formed across the investment management business. They allow an investment manager to contract with other investment managers to offer funds with specific investment objectives. \nSub-advisory relationships allow for one alternative in launching new funds for investors. In some cases, investment managers can launch new fund offerings more efficiently with lower costs and better operational processing through a sub-advisory relationship. Many investment managers partner with sub advisors for lower costs and broader fund offering diversification. \nSome of the investment market\u2019s largest and most experienced investment managers build a sub-advisory platform that allows them greater access to sub-advisory relationships in the market. Wellington Asset Management and State Street Global Advisors are two investment managers that actively seek to offer their services through sub-advisory relationships. Sub-Advised Fund Considerations \nSub-advisory fee structure agreements vary across the investment market. Fees for sub-advised funds are typically higher due to the multi-layered relationships involved with offering a sub-advised fund. In general, investors should more closely examine the fee structures of sub-advised funds because they are often higher and more complex than traditional fund offerings. \nDespite potentially higher fees, other aspects of a sub-advised fund can be advantageous for investors. Specifically, sub-advised funds are typically managed by fund managers with in-depth experience and expertise in managing a certain strategy. Fund managers for sub-advised funds are often sought out for their strategy expertise, offering investors the best strategy option in the market. Sub-Advised Fund Investments \nSub-advisory relationships span across the entire investment universe. Any type of fund can be sub-advised. Mutual funds and variable annuities are some of the most common sub-advised offerings. \nIn a 2016 report from Pensions and Investments , Wellington is identified as the investment industry\u2019s largest sub advisor by assets with $499.1 billion in sub-advised assets under management. \nWellington has a well-established sub-advisory relationship with Hartford Funds and serves as a sub advisor for the firm. The Hartford International Equity Fund is one fund sub advised by Wellington. The Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation through investment in international equities. The Fund offers four share classes: A, F, I and Y. Expenses vary for each of the share classes with the gross expense ratio ranging from 1.89% to 1.40%.

They sank or submerged 19 ships (including eight battleships destroyed or disabled) and damaged or destroyed more than 300 planes.\nIn an amazing feat of seamanship, the huge Japanese carrier fleet had steamed nearly 3,500 miles in midwinter high seas. The armada had refueled more than 20 major ships while observing radio silence before arriving undetected about 220 miles from Hawaii.\nThe surprise attack started the Pacific War. It was followed a few hours later by a Japanese assault on the Philippines.\nMore importantly, Pearl Harbor ushered in a new phase of World War II, as the conflict expanded to the Pacific. It became truly a global war when, four days later, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States. Carl Vinson \nThe Japanese fleet had missed the three absent American carriers of the Pacific Fleet. Nonetheless, Japanese admirals were certain that the United States was so crippled after the attack that it would not be able to go on the offensive against the Japanese Pacific empire for years, if at all. Surely the wounded Americans would sue for peace, or at least concentrate on Europe and keep out of the Japanese-held Pacific.\nThat was a fatal miscalculation.\nThe Japanese warlords had known little of the tireless efforts of one Democratic congressman from Georgia, Carl Vinson.\nFor nearly a decade before Pearl Harbor, Vinson had schemed and politicked in brilliant fashion to ensure that America was building a two-ocean navy larger than all the major navies of the world combined.\nVinson had assumed in the mid-1930s that fascist Japan and Germany posed existential threats to the United States. For America to survive, he saw that the U.S. would need mastery of the seas to transport its armies across the Pacific and Atlantic.\nFrom 1934 to 1940, Vinson pushed through Congress four major naval appropriations bills. The result was that the U.S. Pacific Fleet, which Japan thought it had almost destroyed in December 1941, was already slated to be replaced by a far larger and updated armada.\nA little more than seven months after Pearl Harbor, the USS Essex \u2014 the finest carrier in the world \u2014 was launched. Essex was the first of 24 state-of-the-art fleet carriers of its class to be built during the war.\nVinson\u2019s various prewar naval construction bills also ensured the launching of hundreds of modern battleships, cruisers, destroyers and submarines. As bombs fell at Pearl Harbor, ships of the new American fleet were soon to be deployed, under construction or already authorized.\nVinson\u2019s foresight would save thousands of American lives in the Atlantic and Pacific. American naval power quickly allowed the U.S. to fight a two-front war against Japan, Germany and Italy.\nVinson, a rural Georgian, was an unlikely advocate of global naval supremacy.\nBefore World War II, the battleship was still thought to be queen of the seas. Yet Vinson emphasized aircraft carriers over battleships. That decision would result in absolute American naval supremacy of the oceans within two years of the Pearl Harbor attack.\nStranger still, Vinson had fought for naval expansion in the middle of the Great Depression, at a time when the U.S. government was already deeply in debt and poor Americans had no desire for large peacetime defense spending.\nVinson lived in the heart of impoverished rural Georgia, not on the east or west coasts, the traditional homes of U.S. warships. He was elected for 26 straight congressional terms. For 50 years, Vinson insisted on military preparedness, especially through naval power, to ensure deterrence and thereby keep the peace.\nVinson\u2019s remarkable congressional career began in 1914, before the American entry into World War I. He championed a strong Navy during the Depression, World War II, the Korean War, the start of the Vietnam War and the Cold War before retiring in 1965 at the age of 81.\nBefore Vinson, the U.S. Navy was basically a small coastal patrol force fueled by coal. But as the chairman of House Naval Affairs Committee and later the House Armed Services Committee, Vinson ensured that American sea power \u2014 eventually led by behemoth nuclear-powered aircraft carriers (including the USS Carl Vinson) \u2014 would win wars and keep the peace through its global reach.\nVinson would live 16 years beyond retirement, dying at the age of 97 in 1981.\nToday, most Americans do not recognize Vinson\u2019s contributions to American security. But the real strategic story of the Dec. 7 attack on Pearl Harbor was that Japan foolishly bombed a mostly obsolete fleet, soon guaranteeing terrible revenge from America\u2019s far greater and more modern replacement armada \u2014 thanks largely to the global visions of a rural Georgia congressman.\nVictor Davis Hanson is a classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University and the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Father of Us All: War and History, Ancient and Modern\u201d (authorvictorhanson.com).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_151260470338487.jpg?w=263", "http://1871.tm.zedo.com/v1/de0b1340-9167-4a0d-8f46-f1a0d7761ce3/atm.js", "http://1871.tm.zedo.com/v1/de0b1340-9167-4a0d-8f46-f1a0d7761ce3/tm.js?data="], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "carl vinson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "essex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vinson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victor davis hanson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. pacific fleet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hoover institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "navy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanford university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific fleet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house armed services committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. navy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house naval affairs committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pearl harbor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:09.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a1963a2661559152cb9316e411b9491c7247c49c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLtqIRN5I38I0JNlmYe7ScSaUAJEEIGSpLQLeB7FcdLbWFzeUU30RWkBsXNsBeKntOqrcWA46Cihaf", "site_full": "floridastate.forums.rivals.com", "site": "rivals.com", "site_section": "https://floridastate.forums.rivals.com/forums/the-tribal-council.32/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "The Tribal Council | Warchant.com", "title": "Got a good caption for this photo?", "title_full": "Got a good caption for this photo?

As the term implies, credit quality informs investors of a bond or bond portfolio's credit worthiness or risk of default. A company or security\u2019s credit quality may also be known as its \u201cbond rating.\" BREAKING DOWN 'Credit Quality' \nCredit quality is an important aspect of the credit markets. An individual bond or bond mutual fund's credit quality is determined by private independent rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. Each rating agency has its own credit quality designations which typically range from high ('AAA' to 'AA') to medium ('A' to 'BBB') to low ('BB', 'B', 'CCC', 'CC' to 'C'). \nCredit rating agencies issue credit quality ratings for all types of issuers in the credit market. Factors influencing a corporate credit rating include the company\u2019s capital structure, credit payment history, revenue and earnings. (See also What Is a Corporate Credit Rating?) \nCredit quality ratings for developed market countries, such as the U.S., are typically on the higher end of the credit quality spectrum and offer investors investments with low risk of default. In the credit market, investment-grade ratings are typically perceived as high quality. Non investment-grade bonds, also called high-yield or junk bonds, have lower credit quality and higher risk. Investment-grade bonds often have lower yields while non-investment grade bonds require higher yields for the greater potential risk. \nInvestors interested in the safety of their bond investments should stick to investment grade bonds ('AAA', 'AA', 'A', and 'BBB'), while other investors willing and able to accept a higher level of risk could consider lower credit-quality bonds with higher yields. Credit Quality Investing \nIn the investable market, investors have a wide range of mutual funds to choose from with varying credit qualities. Mutual funds offer investors the opportunity to invest in a diversified portfolio of bonds with targeted credit quality exposure. Below are examples of some of the top bond funds in the government and high yield credit quality categories. \nEaton Vance Short Duration Government Income Fund \nThis fund focuses on short-term U.S. government debt. The Fund offers A, C and I share classes. It invests in high-quality, short-term U.S. government and U.S. government agency bonds. The Fund\u2019s average duration is less than three years which gives it limited interest rate risk. As of December 4, 2017, the Fund had a one year return of 2.17%. Its expense ratio is 0.90%. \nHighland Opportunistic Credit Fund \nThe Highland Opportunistic Credit Fund is one of the top performing funds in the high yield category. Its one year return as of December 4, 2017 was 15.28%. The Fund has an expense ratio of 1.30%. The Fund invests for total return. As of September 30, 2017, 28% of the Fund was invested in CCC securities.

All prisoners were Nepali nationals. \nTwo night duty guards have been placed under suspension and an internal inquiry has also been ordered into the jail break. \nAccording to jail staff, the prisoners scaled the jail\u2019s 16-ft outer wall taking support of some construction material, which included some pipes and iron bars lying in the compound. The construction material was dumped in the jail premises for an under-construction block for the prisoners. \n\u201cThe incident is really unfortunate and serious. We have sounded an alert in the adjoining districts of Solan, Sirmaur to nab the accused. Their photographs have been released and whosoever provides us information about their locations will be rewarded. A case has also been registered at Boileu Ganj police station,\u201d said DGP Somesh Goyal, who is also DG (Prisons). \nHe admitted that it was a case of sheer negligence on the part of the night duty staff. \nShimla SP Soumya Sambasivan said separate teams have been set-up by police and search was being done in the areas around the jail and also possible spots. \u201cThe police is on the job. However, there is no major breakthrough yet,\u201d she said on Wednesday evening. \nThe list of the prisoners who escaped included Leela Dhar, 22, accused under sections 302, 201 and 34 IPC under FIR no 199/2015 registered in Kullu; Pratap Singh, 27, arrested under sections 376, 377 and 4 of POSCO Act under FIR 13/2016 at Mahila Thana, New Shimla and Prem Bahadur, 22, arrested under sections 363,366 and 376 under FIR no 119/2014 at Rampur (Shimla). Prem Bahadur was taken to Ranpur in connection with hearing of his case on December 1 and later brought back.Barrack no 4, where three prisoners were lodged, has nearly 15 other prisoners. None of them ,however, had any clue at what time exactly these persons escaped. Jail officials said the escape took place between 4 to 4.30 am. \nThis is the first jail break case from Kanda jail, while earlier on April 17 ,2014 two persons had escaped from Kullu. One prisoner, lodged at Kanda jail, had fled away from Shimla as he was working outside the jail as part of the reforms process. He was later arrested from Goa. \nBefore this ,there were two other jail break cases at Hamirpur and Mandi in 2017 .Six prisoners had escaped . All eight police persons,who were members of the police SIT in Kotkhai rape case, are also lodged in Kanda jail. \nJail authorities said that it will be difficult to arrest them if they escape to Nepal. \u201cOur teams in Shimla and Solan are on high alert. Let\u2019s hope we nab them soon,\u201d said the DGP. \nWhat police know so far \nAll prisoners were in the barrack till 10 pm, when last roll call was taken . They left their footwear inside the jail compound while scaling the wall. A steel blade was used by the prisoners to cut-iron bars of the inner gates. Only two duty guards were on night petrol, while a three-layer security is mandated during night.

BREAKING DOWN 'Commingling (Commingled)' \nCommingling combines assets contributed by investors into a single fund or investment vehicle. Commingling is a primary feature of most investment funds. It may also be used to combine various types of contributions for various purposes. Below are some examples of investment commingling. \n1. If you deposit a paycheck into an inheritance fund, the paycheck would not be considered separate funds but part of the inheritance fund. Thus, the paycheck is no longer considered separate property from the inheritance. \n2. In investment management, it is the pooling of individual customer contributions into a single fund, a portion of which is owned by each contributing customer. Commingled funds are managed to a specified objective. A commingled fund structure is used for mutual funds . It is also used to manage institutional investment funds. Benefits of Commingling \nCommingling investors contributions into a single fund is a structure that has been used in investment management since the first mutual funds were launched. Commingling allows a portfolio manager to comprehensively manage the investment contributions into the portfolio to a specific strategy. Using pooled funds allows fund managers to keep trading costs down since trades can be executed in larger blocks. The commingling of investor contributions does require fund managers to maintain certain positions in cash in order to account for the transactions of the commingled shareholders. \nMutual funds and institutional commingled funds are two of the most popular commingled funds in the investment market. Any vehicle that commingles investor contributions for a specified investment goal can be considered a commingled fund. Other types of commingled funds include exchange-traded funds , commingled trust funds, collective investment trusts and real estate investment trusts. \nStandard record keeping allows operational teams to monitor and regularly report fund positions to investors. For mutual fund investors, daily price quotes allow an investor to know their exact position in a mutual fund as a percentage of the fund\u2019s total managed assets. Illegal Commingling \nIn some cases, the commingling of funds may be illegal. Details of an asset management agreement are typically outlined in an investment management contract. An investment manager has a fiduciary responsibility to manage assets according to certain specifications and standards. Assets agreed to be managed as separate cannot be commingled by the investment advisor. \nOther situations may also arise where contributions provided by an individual or client must be managed with special care. This can occur in legal cases, corporate client accounts and real estate transactions.

The trade date is when an order to purchase, sell or otherwise acquire a security is performed. A trade date is determined for all types of investment security transactions in the market. BREAKING DOWN 'Trade Date' \nA trade date can apply to the purchase, sale or transfer of any type of security including bonds, equities, foreign exchange instruments, commodities, and futures . The exact timing of the trade influences the trade date of a transaction. Most trades occur during market trading hours and are recorded with the day\u2019s trade date. Trades occurring outside standard market hours may have alternative trade reporting. Trades executed after the market\u2019s close are typically recorded with a trade date on the following day. Trade and Settlement \nThe trade date is one of two important dates involved in a transaction. The trade date records and initiates the transaction. The settlement date is the next step in the transaction. The settlement date usually differs from the trade date. The settlement date is the date in which the transfer between two parties is executed. \nThe amount of time that passes between the trade date and the settlement date differs depending on the trading instrument and is known as the settlement period. The settlement timeframe is noted as T+ the number of days to settlement. Some instruments, like certificates of deposit (CDs), have settlement dates that are the same as the trade date. Mutual funds may settle one day after the trade date. In September 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission enacted T+2 settlement for most securities. T+2 settlement pertains to stocks, bonds, municipal securities, exchange-traded funds, certain mutual funds and limited partnerships that trade on an exchange. \nTo better understand the trading process, consider the following example. An investor buys 10 shares of a stock from their brokerage trading platform on Tuesday, December 5, 2017 during standard market trading hours. The investor\u2019s purchase initiates the trade and receives a trade date of December 5. The processing time to settlement for stocks is two days so the buyer would officially receive the shares of stock in their trading account in T+2 which equates to Thursday, December 7, 2017.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:11.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a1963a2661559152cb9316e411b9491c7247c49c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLtqIRN5I38I0JNlmYe7ScSaUAJEEIGSpLQLeB7FcdLbWFzeUU30RWkBsXNsBeKntOqrcWA46Cihaf", "site_full": "floridastate.forums.rivals.com", "site": "rivals.com", "site_section": "https://floridastate.forums.rivals.com/forums/the-tribal-council.32/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "The Tribal Council | Warchant.com", "title": "Got a good caption for this photo?", "title_full": "Got a good caption for this photo?
