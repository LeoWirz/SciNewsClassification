Print \nBRUSSELS : Hundreds of Catalan protesters began gathering in Brussels on Thursday to show support for deposed president Carles Puigdemont and urge the EU to support their drive for independence from Spain. \nChanting \"Wake up Europe!\" and waving Catalonia's red, yellow and blue Estelada separatist flag, demonstrators gathered in a park near the headquarters of the European Union ahead of a march through the Belgian capital. \n\"We cannot abandon our president, who is in exile here,\" Antoni Llenas, 59, a protester wearing a flag over his shoulders, told AFP . \"We are here to continue the struggle for our independence and to ask for the freedom of our political prisoners\". \nBelgian police were on hand but the early stages of the protest were peaceful, AFP reporters said. \nPuigdemont and four former ministers fled to Brussels in Nov, saying they wanted to take their cause to a European level after Spain charged them with sedition and rebellion over Catalonia's independence referendum in Oct. \nMadrid dropped a European arrest warrant for the five on Monday but Puigdemont said he would stay put for now as they still face arrest in Spain if they return for snap regional polls in Catalonia on Dec 21. \nOrganisers said they expected around 20,000 people to attend Thursday's march. \nProtesters arrived in a stream of coaches and camper vans with Spanish registration plates and gathered in the Cinquantenaire Park in Brussels' European quarter before the start of the march at 1030 GMT, (6:30pm Malaysia time). \nTheir route will take them past the headquarters of the European Commission and end up in a square between the European Council and European Parliament, the three main EU institutions. \nThe EU has strongly backed the Spanish government over the Catalan issue, saying that it is an internal matter for Madrid. \u2014 AFP Related articles", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

I took her, with me, to the States and filed for her (married her on paper) with the hope to someday get married officially, but things took the wrong turn.

December 7, 2017 \nFor people with multiple sclerosis (MS), eating a healthy diet of fruits, vegetables and whole grains may be linked to having less disability and fewer symptoms than people whose diet is less healthy, according to a study published in the December 6, 2017, online issue of Neurology \u00ae , the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. \n\"People with MS often ask if there is anything they can do to delay or avoid disability, and many people want to know if their diet can play a role, but there have been few studies investigating this,\" said study author Kathryn C. Fitzgerald, ScD, of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Md., and a member of the American Academy of Neurology. \"While this study does not determine whether a healthy lifestyle reduces MS symptoms or whether having severe symptoms makes it harder for people to engage in a healthy lifestyle, it provides evidence for the link between the two.\" \nThe study involved 6,989 people with all types of MS who completed questionnaires about their diet as part of the North American Research Committee (NARCOMS) registry. The definition of a healthy diet focused on eating more fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains and less sugar from desserts and sweetened beverages and less red meat and processed meat. The participants were divided into five groups based on how healthy their diet was. \nResearchers also assessed whether participants had an overall healthy lifestyle, which was defined as having a healthy weight, getting regular physical activity, eating a better than average diet and not smoking. \nThe participants were also asked whether they had a relapse of MS symptoms or a gradual worsening of symptoms in the past six months and reported their level of disability and how severe their symptoms were in areas such as fatigue, mobility, pain and depression. \nPeople in the group with the healthiest diet were 20 percent less likely to have more severe physical disability than people in the group with the least healthy diet. The results were true even after researchers adjusted for other factors that could affect disability, such as age and how long they had MS.

The competition is also open to students, and Mets\u00e4 Board will offer as an additional prize the opportunity of an internship for one student with its packaging services team in Shanghai. \nBillions of consumer packages are consumed globally every day, and as the population continues to grow, so will the number of packages. The high amount of plastic used in packaging is an international concern, in part because globally the plastic waste inputs into the oceans amount annually to almost nine million tonnes. \nPackages will continue to have an important role in protecting and promoting products in the future, but as consumption grows, it\u2019s becoming ever more important to develop packaging solutions that enable the use of renewable, non-fossil based materials and a wiser use of resources. Mets\u00e4 Board recognises that packaging designers play a decisive role in this and that environmental impacts can be reduced, for example, by making packaging lighter, using renewable materials and making recycling easier. \nThe competition will be judged by an international jury, including a number of renowned packaging design experts: Terri Goldstein , branding and packaging design professional. Peter D\u00e9silets , strategist and specialist in packaging sustainability aspects. Marianne R. Klimchuk , packaging design expert and Chair at Communication Design Pathways Department of Fashion Institute of Technology. Lars G. Wallentin , packaging designer who\u2019s worked with worldwide known brands and John B. Mahaffie , futurist with primary expertise in future packaging solutions. \nFinalists and winners will be announced during Spring 2018 .

If code is like a recipe, methods are small parts of the process that always perform the same, though might have different inputs - for example, you can beat an egg, beat cream, stir soup, stir sauce, stir flour - methods are typically named with something that sounds like an action (a verb) so if you hired a new young chef, who'd never seen cream before but knew how to beat things, you could hand him your cream and your eggs and tell him to beat them.. that's the idea of a method, that you take a small part of code that always does the same thing, though the inputs and outputs change, and make it a method. Input.nextLine() is a method of scanner. It always reads from the console (when the console is attached to the scanner) and gives a line of text, whatever text was typed.\nHere's an example from your code:\nprivate Student getStudentFromInput(Scanner input){ System.out.println(\"Enter student full name \"); String sName = input.nextLine(); System.out.println(\"Enter student age \"); int sAge = input.nextInt(); System.out.println(\"Enter student id \"); int sID = input.nextInt(); input.nextLine(); // ... blah blah and so on right the way to the bit where you make the student Student studentInfo = new Student(sName, sAge, sID, sAddress, sCityStateZip, sGender); return studentInfo; }\nThat's a Method. It takes input parameters, does something with them, gives something back\nYou can now tidy up your switch statement to:\ncase 1: Student studentInfo = getStudentFromInput(input); studentData.add(studentInfo); for (Student testClass : studentData) { System.out.println(testClass); } break;\n\"But it's not really any different to before\" you mit say - no it's not, because your code only ever calls the method from one place. The good part is, you could call that method from another place, to read in a student, without have to repeat all the lines of code again. It also stops our main (which is also a method) ending up ten thousand lines long by the time we've extended our program to handle entire towns of kinds of people and organisations. Try to always follow a rule that a method shouldn't be more than a couple of screens long.

By passing off malicious actions as benign, legitimate processes, Kogan and Liberman found a potent way for even relatively less-sophisticated attackers to give new life to malicious code threats well-known to security vendors. Once cloaked with \"Process Doppelg\u00e4nging,\" these threats can impact the latest versions of Windows protected with fully-updated AV and NGAV security products, where malware payloads can proceed to ransom files, capture keystrokes or steal priceless data. \nenSilo's Black Hat Europe research is available for download here . Additionally, interested viewers can register to attend a free, public webinar on Process Doppelg\u00e4nging with Liberman, where he will provide a walk-through of threats and defenses. \nIn addition to blinding Windows' embedded defense mechanisms and third-party AV and NGAV security products to incoming threats, Process Doppelg\u00e4nging gives attackers the further advantage of leaving no traceable evidence behind - making this type of intrusion extremely difficult to detect after the fact with the latest forensic techniques. \nenSilo customers are already protected from Process Doppelg\u00e4nging in the wild, via enSilo's proven pre and post infection endpoint security platform combining automated, blocking-enabled Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) capabilities with Threat Hunting, Incident Response, and Virtual Patching features. enSilo's integrated approach sees and arrests attacks impersonating legitimate Windows processes, affording users additional peace of mind - instead of the uncertainty and management burdens of relying on multiple, piecemeal endpoint protection tools. \n\"The 'Process Doppelg\u00e4nging' attack method we discovered leverages several complex mechanisms in Windows operating systems and intimate knowledge of the inner-workings of AVs' file scanning engines. Putting all this together allows masquerading a malicious executable as legitimate, bypassing all tested security products,\" Liberman explained. \"This is another example of how a few subtle manipulations of code, based on deep insight into the operating system internals, are all that is required to upend many layered detection and traditional prevention defenses,\" Kogan added. \"Our research shows that even the latest protections can be negated by an attacker's creative bid to skip a malicious file payload altogether and infiltrate dangerous content through Windows' intricacies.\" \nKogan and Liberman's selection to present at Black Hat Europe is the latest recognition given to enSilo's renowned team of security researchers working tirelessly to defend customers and the wider security community from evolving threats. enSilo has earned recognition for high-profile work uncovering security risks with major operating systems and novel attack methods. This includes offering an independent patch for Windows' ESTEEMAUDIT remote desktop protocol vulnerability, detailing \"AtomBombing\" attacks that inject malicious code through Windows atom tables and revealing how attackers can hijack anti-virus products' own features to defeat security measures. \nAbout enSilo enSilo comprehensively secures the endpoint pre- and post-infection. enSilo automates and orchestrates detection, prevention and real-time response against advanced malware and ransomware without burdening cybersecurity staff. enSilo's single lightweight agent includes next generation antivirus (NGAV), application communication control, automated endpoint detection and response (EDR) with real-time blocking, threat hunting, incident response and virtual patching capabilities. Coupled with a patented approach that has full system visibility, enSilo's endpoint security solution stops modern malware with a high degree of precision and intuitive user interface. Cybersecurity staff with enSilo can effectively manage malware threats without alert fatigue, excessive dwell time or breach anxiety. enSilo's cloud management platform is flexible and extensible to meet operational needs that stop malware impact.

As an industry-leading multi-ECU over-the-air (OTA) solution, the new OTAmatic release further strengthens an already robust offering to reliably and securely automate and orchestrate automotive OTA software update and data management campaigns for connected vehicles. \nAs the number of connected vehicles produced accelerates, it is imperative that automakers enable those vehicles to receive OTA software updates and transfer data. With a reliable and secure OTA solution in place, billions of dollars in software-related recalls and cybersecurity expenses can be mitigated, vehicle performance and feature enhancements can be delivered post-consumer purchase, automaker supply chain and operations can be optimized, and new opportunities for expanding and monetizing connected vehicle ecosystems can be realized. However, OTA also presents an unprecedented challenge for automakers: managing the increasing complexity of planning and executing OTA software update and data management campaigns for millions of vehicles around the world. \nAirbiquity's market-leading OTAmatic software and data management offering addresses this challenge with a sophisticated back-end service delivery management capability that allows automakers and suppliers to efficiently plan and execute multi-ECU software update and data campaigns\u2014at scale\u2014 with highly refined vehicle and device targeting, discrete policy and privacy controls, fully customizable consumer communications, and solution deployment flexibility. In addition to the previous release features, the strengthened OTAmatic solution now includes: Edge Data Analytics Framework: OTAmatic supports upgradable analytic modules from data analytics providers, and the anonymization and normalization of vehicle data for automaker and third-party value generation. Consumer Purchasing: OTAmatic on-demand software updates enable consumer purchase of new features and services post-vehicle sale, and customizable consumer interactions via infotainment system and smartphone applications. \"Defense In-Depth\" Security: OTAmatic's end-to-end security approach spans confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and availability leveraging standards-based certification, authentication, encryption, and the compromise-resilient Uptane software update security system for automotive (initiated and funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security). \n\"Airbiquity has an unrivaled track record of developing innovative software technology, cloud-based services, and successfully deploying connected vehicle programs,\" said Kamyar Moinzadeh , President and CEO of Airbiquity. \"We're committed to continually improving our OTAmatic offering so our automotive customers can better manage their vehicles over the entire vehicle lifecycle, offer new vehicle features and services to consumers post-purchase, and ultimately leverage a data exchange platform for data management, analytics, and monetization in the future.\" \nTo learn more about Airbiquity's OTAmatic offering, visit here .

Fantastic food, a French influence, unique buildings, shopping, rivers, beaches and gentle rice paddies. What is not to love here?\nHere are some things I found in a recent visit, beyond those listed in the guidebooks.\n\nA river runs through it \n\nThe Thu Bon River runs through the centre of Hoi An dividing the Old Town from newer developments. Yet the countryside itself is full of rivers and waterways - they are life blood of this area, which has for centuries used them for trading.\n\nBasket boats near China Beach \nChina Beach was a popular retreat for Allied soldiers during the Vietnam War. These large baskets are traditional fishing boats - the shape meant they were not classified as boats, and so the owners avoid paying tax. (As a side note, I found the beaches a bit boring. But then I'm Australian, and incredibly spoilt in that way.)\n\nCross me if you dare! \n\nEscape to the countryside, away from the crowds of tourists. Rice paddies stretch in all directions, fed by the many rivers. Remarkably, our Vespas made it safely across.\n\nDon't forget to look at the buildings \n\nThe colours may seem faded, but the buildings in  Hoi An have a charm all their own, with their cross between traditional styles and the influence of many visitors - the Japanese, Dutch and French, to name a few. When walking through Hoi An , don't forget to look around you.\n\nVenture out before sunrise \n\nDo the unexpected. Head out before dawn with the fisherman and watch how hard these men and women work. Visit a market, buy something fresh for breakfast, and enjoy it back on the boat (our captain cooked it for us - spring rolls, fresh baby tuna, morning glory, squid. Delicious.\n\nHow breakfast began \n\nThis was how our breakfast began - in the markets. We didn't have the baby crab, but there's always next time.\n\nA vegetable plot near Hoi An \nThe surrounding countryside is filled with communal vegetable plots. Lush and green, incredibly fertile, they are an inspiration to go back home and start gardening.\n\nThe lanterns of Hoi An \n\nDon't forget to explore Hoi An at night - the town is famous for her lanterns. I dare you to try and leave without buying a few!\n\nBusy repairing my husbands pants \n\nThe clothes and fabric can be a tad overwhelming - the hawkers are remarkably aggressive - but if you're brave enough to venture inside, look out for this lady who does repairs.\n\nVietnamese coffee \n\nFinally, don't forget the coffee. The best coffee I had was sitting at a roadside stall, watching the world go by. It is strong but sweet, for it is laced with condensed milk.\n\n\nLike my photos? - if you feel like contributing to my coffers, please click the link to buy either my  photos  from the micro-stock site  123RF , or products from my store,  EnsoCreations.
