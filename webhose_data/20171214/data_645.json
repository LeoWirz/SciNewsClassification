Here he reflects on his time in Lebanon where almost 40 per cent of the population are Syrian and Palestinian refugees. Richard visited one of Lebanon\u2019s twelve Palestinian refugee camps \u2013 home to 450,000 people, one in ten of the country\u2019s population. \nBourj el Barajneh in Beirut, Lebanon is one of the world\u2019s oldest refugee camps. Established in 1948, it\u2019s home to more than 31,000 people. These women, men and children live in just one square kilometre of land. That\u2019s roughly 31 people for every square metre of earth. \nPlease give to CAFOD\u2019s Advent appeal to help people living in poverty \nI made my way through its streets lined with precariously built homes. Some were so tall and tightly packed together that I could just see small amounts of sunlight trickle down to the streets and alleyways below. \nBut it wasn\u2019t the sheer density of people that first struck me as I walked in, it was all the Palestinian flags hanging from the buildings. \nThe people in the camp \u2013 many of whom were born here in Beirut \u2013 are proud of their Palestinian heritage. Omar from Association Najdeh, one of CAFOD\u2019s partners in Lebanon \u201cWhen they heard my Palestinian accent, they didn\u2019t call back\u201d \nI was in Bourj el Barajneh to visit CAFOD\u2019s long-term partner, Association Najdeh \u2013 an inspirational Palestinian women\u2019s organisation who work with refugees, especially women, to help them achieve equal rights as well as participate in their communities at an economic, social and political level. \nOmar is 22 years old and volunteers with Association Najdeh. Like so many people here in the camp, he is highly qualified \u2013 an IT graduate. He said to me: \u201cAfter graduation I submitted my CV to a number of organisations and received some calls to discuss job opportunities. When they heard my accent, and found out that I was Palestinian, they never called back.\u201d \nPlease give to our Advent appeal \nDespite being born in Lebanon, Omar is classed as a foreigner. Discrimination against Palestinians continues to be commonplace. Omar told me that his Lebanese university friends refuse to come to his house in the camp as they were either frightened, wrongly associating refugees in the camp as dangerous, or forbidden by their parents to go there. \nThe great majority of refugees live in poverty, with inadequate housing conditions, limited access to services such as health care and are subject to discriminatory laws that don\u2019t allow them to get jobs. This situation is closely linked to their employment status which is characterised by low pay, poor conditions and lack of opportunities. Fighting for justice \nAs part of the Right to Work Campaign run by our partner, Omar and his friend Hanin have been running university campus talks to call for a change in Lebanese employment. They also run an active social media campaign which has over 52,000 followers online. The campaign helps to train young Palestinian refugees on Lebanese employment laws and lobbies a variety of people including government officials to change the law. \nCampaigns like this one work: in 2010, campaigns, and the work of Association Najdeh, helped to bring about change in the Lebanese employment law, meaning some Palestinians could register for work permits in specific sectors such as nursing and gave access for Palestinians to the government\u2019s Social Security Fund. Despite this success, work permits are still very limited, and it is illegal in many sectors for Palestinians to work at all. Amina and Omar are hopeful that this latest campaign, as well as challenging negative stereotypes, will lead to similar changes in the law. Refugee women learning about beauty treatments with Association Najdeh, Lebanon Refugees can now get jobs \nIn some vocations, with the right skills, young Palestinians can find work and Association Najdeh, with support from CAFOD, provides young women with vocational skills including hairdressing and make up classes. At the centre, the women also discuss their rights and problems they face in the community such as violence. They are also offered career guidance and psychological support if they need it. \nAnd there has been so much progress in a short space of time. This year, over 230 young people have completed vocational training, more than 500 received career counselling and over 130 people have found employment as a result. With CAFOD\u2019s support, these young refugees now have the skills to contribute to the family income in the future. Integration is about welcoming difference \nAs I left the bustling camp with the Palestinian flags fluttering proudly from the roof tops, I was reminded that integration is not about suppressing one\u2019s own identity, but it is about knowing each other better and welcoming differences as well as similarities. \nFollow our 2017 online Advent calendar to reflect, pray and take global justice actions throughout this holy season.

Former Brazil international centre back Rever gave the visitors the lead at Estadio Libertadores in Greater Buenos Aires with a bullet header after a curling Miguel Trauco free-kick on Wednesday, reports Xinhua news agency. The hosts equalized through Emanuel Gigliotti, who combined with Martin Benitez before lashing a first time shot into the bottom corner. Meza gave the hosts the lead just after halftime with a goal of the highest quality. The 24-year-old latched on to an Ezequiel Barco cross with a sublime left-footed volley from the edge of the penalty area that left goalkeeper Cesar with no chance. Flamengo coach Reinaldo Rueda introduced Real Madrid-bound teenager Vinicius Junior with 20 minutes left in pursuit of an equalizer. But despite dominating the latter stages, the visitors were unable to breach Independiente\u2019s defence for a second time. The decisive second leg will be played at the Maracana stadium in Rio de Janeiro.

It's very important that coaches need to be looked at, it's high time we looked at it because we should have looked at it in the past 10 years and we haven t. And it s not only badminton but across all sports; this is for me the most important thing which is there,\" Gopichand said in Mumbai on Wednesday. \"Coaches need to be respected, coaches need to be rewarded, coaches need to be awarded and people should be motivated to take up coaching,\" said Gopichand on the sidelines of the function to announce a grass-roots talent hunt plan by his academy with IDBI Federal Life Insurance. A few days ago Prakash said that it was high time the badminton-governing body in the country, BAI, Sports Authority of India and the sports ministry looked at coaching the coaches by inviting top foreign coaches to do the job. \"We treat Indian coaches differently, foreign coaches differently. I ll have to say this openly, but there s not a single rupee of remuneration which any of the coaches in the past have got from either the federation or the SAI. It's time they start looking at coaches differently, start looking at coaching differently. And unless we do that we can t sustain the ecosystem of sports,\" he explained. \"I think this is an aspect which, for the last few years, has been a challenge of the entire ecosystem which brings the best players back into the sport. And creating good coaches doesn't end with giving them good training. It is the entire ecosystem which is important. A coach needs to be respected. \"I m sure everyone has these challenges in the teaching profession as well. The best mind doesn't get into teaching. Likewise, we also face the same challenges with coaching. Coaches need to be trained, need to be motivated, need to be recognised, need to be rewarded. All these are important. \"In the entire ecosystem of the sport, how many coaches do we know from various fields? Even sportspersons, reporters, and myself, we would not know so many of them. Also, how much of pay we give them is also important,\" he remarked. \"The best models in the world are where they re coached at and athlete-centric and system-driven and unfortunately we re far away from that model,\" he added. Gopichand also expressed concerns over the cramped international calendar of the Badminton World Federation. \"I think they've cramped the calendar too much. It s unfortunate the kind of thinking that the BWF has. And I don t agree to what they have in terms of getting players to play so many tournaments. \"And there are players who re already getting injured, performances have not been consistent at all and it doesn't help the players' cause when they have to continue to push themselves to play so many tournaments. There re so many ways of ensuring that the sport is promoted and cramping up the calendar and forcing the players to play is not a very good idea,\" he added.

According to a PIB report, at a recent conference in New Delhi, Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister of Road Transport & Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, said that 44 economic corridors and 24 multi-modal logistics parks have been planned under the Bharatmala programme. These are being planned on the hub and spoke model to facilitate efficient movement of freight, along routes of economic importance. \nThe multi-modal logistics parks are being planned as centres of freight aggregation with warehousing, cold storage and other facilities. These parks will be built on the National Highway outside cities, as this will help reduce traffic congestion as well as pollution. Work has already begun for setting up logistics parks at Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Vijaywada, Surat and Guwahati. \nFurthermore, under the Sagarmala programme, 14 coastal economic zones have been planned. \nThis is in addition to the 111 waterways that are being developed as National Waterways; river Ganga, Brahmaputra and Barak are already under development. Further, the efficiency of the 12 major ports has been growing rapidly, and dry ports are being developed at Jalna, Vidarbha and Nasik to begin with. Also, apart from the development of road and water transport infrastructure, the government is prioritising development of micro or drip irrigation in the water deficient regions of the country. Thirteen river linking projects are on the anvil, of which, three will be achieved within three months.

Bitcoin has gained more than $5,000 in just the past two days.\nAt the same time, there are fresh concerns about the security of bitcoin and other virtual currencies after NiceHash, a company that mines bitcoins on behalf of customers, said it is investigating a breach that may have resulted in the theft of about $70 million worth of bitcoin.\nResearch company Coindesk said that a wallet address referred to by NiceHash users indicates that about 4,700 bitcoins had been stolen. NiceHash said it will stop operating for 24 hours while it verifies how many bitcoins were taken. Wallet is a nickname for an online account.\nAs of 11:15 a.m. EST, bitcoin was valued at $17,482, according to Coinbase, the largest bitcoin exchange. At the start of the year, one bitcoin was worth less than $1,000.\nNow Playing: Bitcoin\u2019s extraordinary price surge means its market capitalization now exceeds the annual output of whole economies, and the estimated worth of some of the world\u2019s top billionaires.\nMedia: Time The surge in the price and the hack of NiceHash occurred just as the trading community prepares for bitcoin to start trading on two established U.S. exchanges. Futures for bitcoin will start trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange on Sunday evening and on crosstown rival CME Group's platforms later in the month.\nThat has increased the sense among some investors that bitcoin is gaining in mainstream legitimacy after several countries, like China, tried to stifle the virtual currency.\nRelated Stories Q&A: How is a bitcoin mined? A look at the virtual currency One of the world's biggest video game services, Steam, has stopped accepting bitcoin because it's so volatile Bitcoin is the world's most popular virtual currency. Such currencies are not tied to a bank or government and allow users to spend money anonymously. They are basically lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they are traded.\nA debate is raging on the merits of such currencies. Some say they serve merely to facilitate money laundering and illicit, anonymous payments. Others say they can be helpful methods of payment, such as in crisis situations where national currencies have collapsed.\nMiners of bitcoins and other virtual currencies help keep the systems honest by having their computers keep a global running tally of transactions. That prevents cheaters from spending the same digital coin twice.\nOnline security is a vital concern for such dealings.\nIn Japan, following the failure of a bitcoin exchange called Mt. Gox, new laws were enacted to regulate bitcoin and other virtual currencies. Mt. Gox shut down in February 2014, saying it lost about 850,000 bitcoins, possibly to hackers.\nNiceHash did not respond to an emailed request for more details about the breach.\n\"The incident has been reported to the relevant authorities and law enforcement and we are cooperating with them as a matter of urgency,\" it said in a statement, where it also urged users to change their online passwords.\nSlovenian police are investigating the case together with authorities in other states, spokesman Bostjan Lindav said, without providing details.\n___\nAli Zerdin in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and Carlo Piovano in London contributed to this story.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/iG2ZVLmb-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/ZTXE6kHa-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/cnmXegNF-720.jpg)", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/wz2pEv9L-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/SZ53Ihv2-720.jpg)", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/UWhGR1bW-720.jpg)", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/06/14664103/3/920x920.jpg", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/PmlyZoV3-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/ge6Cf1gZ-720.jpg)", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/67/74/06/14664103/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/sZS0QHzO-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/1xuoUrLy-720.jpg)"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:28.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "68ba942414cdb4b239e76417445130d14ea453fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_YxMZS96Uj43IgBlrEvujYHyjntptf5EFU7CmfGmvOODW97iJxMUeu39mAE3x9arevUf37hyhkNGEnC6RACoOm15AndK7DqZuKQgqDQZBdW00Wpem_RVpI", "site_full": "www.funnyjunk.com", "site": "funnyjunk.com", "site_section": "http://funnyjunk.com/rss/latest_funny_pictures.rss", "site_categories": ["entertainment"], "section_title": "FunnyJunk Latest Pictures", "title": "Waiting for Hillary to contradict herself", "title_full": "Waiting for Hillary to contradict herself", "published": "2017-12-07T07:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3997, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "68ba942414cdb4b239e76417445130d14ea453fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_YxMZS96Uj43IgBlrEvujYHyjntptf5EFU7CmfGmvOODW97iJxMUeu39mAE3x9arevUf37hyhkNGEnC6RACoOm15AndK7DqZuKQgqDQZBdW00Wpem_RVpI", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T07:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "Waiting for Hillary to contradict herself", "text": "Waiting for Hillary to contradict herself Adjust content blocking Web posted at: 4: 48 pm.

\nMomentum to be investigated over general election spending by Electoral Commission. The watchdog announced it will examine whether the pro-Corbyn group spent more than it was legally allowed and failed to submit accurate donation information. \nLONDON \u2013 Momentum, the group set up to support Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership of the Labour Party, is being investigated by the Electoral Commission for its expenditure during the general election campaign. \nThe Commission announced on Thursday that it will be investigating whether the left-wing national campaign group breached campaign finance rules in the run-up to the June general election. \nThe investigation is set to look at: \nwhether or not Momentum spent in excess of the spending limits for an unauthorised non-party campaigner in the UK Parliamentary general election. \nwhether or not Momentum submitted a return that did not include accurate donation information and/or the required declaration stating that the donation return was complete and accurate. \nwhether or not Momentum submitted a return that was not a complete statement of payments made in respect of controlled expenditure. \nwhether or not Momentum submitted a return that did not include all invoices for payments of more than \u00a3200. \nMomentum was set up in 2015 following Corbyn\u2019s shock victory in the leadership contest following the resignation of former Labour leader Ed Miliband. \nThe group currently boasts over 30,000 paying members across nearly 200 branches across the country and has added at least 1,500 since the Labour Party\u2019s Autumn conference in September. \nMomentum played a major role in supporting the Labour Party in the June 8 general election, especially online, where it social media posts reached millions of people on Facebook and Twitter. \nBob Posner, the Electoral Commission\u2019s Director of Political Finance and Regulation and Legal Counsel, said: \u201cMomentum are a high profile active campaigning body. Questions over their compliance with the campaign finance rules at June\u2019s general election risks causing harm to voters\u2019 confidence in elections. \n\u201cThere is significant public interest in us investigating Momentum to establish the facts in this matter and whether there have been any offences. \n\u201cOnce complete, the Commission will decide whether any breaches have occurred and, if so, what further action may be appropriate, in line with its enforcement policy.\u201d TAGS", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeremy corbyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ed miliband", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corbyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob posner", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "electoral commission", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:28.024+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "58c999e8c8a3841774a0293dcc6f85e0708077d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFe1OaLOOf4NIaGe7sbGjt_IvvW4gIK1H1DLA4Hru5Kqrfa3vXnQ2zp2zRZTPeUB45Vye8r91SgWjeD9VGVU3IECp9WMu6dywVxzXDFs1q9vYdi_.PoEwkLTSojOf8adEP7A6eYUDNtHsM-", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/shop-women-dresses/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Women Dresses Online Store With Best Price In Malaysia", "title": "Hequ Collar Sleeveless Floral Print Chiffon (Apricot)", "title_full": "Hequ Collar Sleeveless Floral Print Chiffon Dress (Apricot) | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2015-12-19T07:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6af6ef0dbad6745a8a4b938986c385e579928958", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFe1OaLOOf4NIaGe7sbGjt_IvvW4gIK1H1DLA4Hru5Kqrfa3vXnQ2zp2zRZTPeUB45Vye8r91SgWjeD9VGVU3IECp9WMu6dywVxzXDFs1q9vYdi_.PoEwkLTSojOf8adEP7K3_qESwILOqcfmr4dIvvmg--", "ord_in_thread": 14, "author": "Leong Kah Heng", "published": "2017-11-27T17:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "Quality abit thin", "text": "Material too thin....", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:28.038+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cf0d44038f7a0909ba81ba5ee63e04a83d0af5c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqb2fOxsoDj4KOC6wnpYD0iOMzyU.rWeBBlS86E8VUiQeo9sUsCr6y1aWgNWB5Z60xsq64DMdn0tyMlJ8mhsQiv7Ui1UPk0gMoC9tJLNf7uBypFcHdKu6VBuZmSKbB1TzQ-", "site_full": "bostonherald.com", "site": "bostonherald.com", "site_section": "http://bostonherald.com/sports", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Sports | Boston Herald", "title": "Simmonds has goal and assist, Flyers beat Oilers 4-2", "title_full": "Simmonds has goal and assist, Flyers beat Oilers 4-2 | Boston Herald", "published": "2017-12-07T14:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.bostonherald.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/media/ap/2017/12/07/028514167b0041299da235bee8dca223.jpg?itok=9HtY_SfP", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8876, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cf0d44038f7a0909ba81ba5ee63e04a83d0af5c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqb2fOxsoDj4KOC6wnpYD0iOMzyU.rWeBBlS86E8VUiQeo9sUsCr6y1aWgNWB5Z60xsq64DMdn0tyMlJ8mhsQiv7Ui1UPk0gMoC9tJLNf7uBypFcHdKu6VBuZmSKbB1TzQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Associated Press", "published": "2017-12-07T14:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "Simmonds has goal and assist, Flyers beat Oilers 4-2", "text": "Simmonds has goal and assist, Flyers beat Oilers 4-2 Associated Press Thursday, December 07, 2017 Credit: The Associated Press Philadelphia Flyers' Michael Raffl (12) and Jakub Voracek (93) celebrate a goal against the Edmonton Oilers during the third period of an NHL hockey game Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, in Edmonton, Alberta.

(Jason Franson/The Canadian Press via AP) prev next comments EDMONTON, Alberta \u2014 The Philadelphia Flyers hope it's the start of an impressive turnaround.\nWayne Simmonds had a goal and an assist, and the Flyers beat the Edmonton Oilers 4-2 on Wednesday night for their second straight victory after losing 10 in a row.\nJordan Weal, Dale Weise and Michael Raffl also scored for the Flyers (10-11-7), who won consecutive games for only the second time this season. Claude Giroux added two assists, and Brian Elliott made 24 saves.\n\"We went through a tough stretch and got a win the other night in Calgary and this one tonight was big to keep us going on the right track,\" Elliott said.\nWeise said it is nice to be back in the win column.\n\"It definitely feels good, definitely the way we played too, it's a pretty complete effort from our team,\" he said. \"Getting contributions from everyone, it's going to be huge if we want to keep stringing some wins together.\n\"I really liked the way we played the last two games.\"\nLeon Draisaitl and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins scored for the Oilers (11-15-2), who have lost two of three.\n\"We can't seem to start two good games in a row,\" Draisaitl said. \"It is setting us back. We always have to come back in games and it takes a lot of energy to do that. I thought we had some good looks in the third, but couldn't capitalize.\"\nPhiladelphia took a 2-1 lead on a soft goal with five minutes left in the second period when Weise sent a shot through goalie Laurent Brossoit's legs. Raffl made it 3-1 four minutes into the third period.\nNugent-Hopkins had a rebound goal with 6:40 remaining, but Simmonds put it away with an empty-netter with 39 seconds left.\nEdmonton opened the scoring four minutes into the second period when Connor McDavid got a backhand pass through to Draisaitl, who beat Elliott for his eighth of the season. Weal tied it five minutes later on a power play.\nNOTES: Oilers defenseman Adam Larsson remained out with an injury. ... The Flyers recently placed goalie Michal Neuvirth and defenseman Brandon Manning on injured reserve. Neuvirth is expected to be out a week, while Manning is likely to miss three to four weeks. ... It was the second and final meeting between the two teams. The first was a 2-1 comeback win for the Flyers in Philadelphia in October.\nUP NEXT\nFlyers: At Vancouver on Thursday night.\nOilers: At Montreal on Saturday night.\n___\nFor more AP NHL coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/NHLhockey", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://embed.sendtonews.com/player3/embedcode.js?fk=KG5SCeOG&cid=4407&offsetx=0&offsety=0&floatwidth=400&floatposition=bottom-right", "https://apnews.com/tag/NHLhockey"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "simmonds", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "draisaitl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam larsson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan nugent-hopkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark alt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connor mcdavid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jakub voracek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brandon manning", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darnell nurse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manning", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raffl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michal neuvirth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesse puljujarvi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wayne simmonds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sean couturier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "claude giroux", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elliott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leon draisaitl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael raffl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dale weise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laurent brossoit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian elliott", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "oilers", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "flyers", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "philadelphia flyers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap nhl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason franson/the canadian press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edmonton oilers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press philadelphia flyers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alberta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edmonton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calgary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valtteri filppula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edmonton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neuvirth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montreal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:28.041+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bec6433d52f55d813d8ce32ed4ddb4340204daa9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwpfpRw.8wzF9ehGIH9IrJvqxgmIeBD_U3UOVUzPYLjtOJn.y0uGHnTAhPmCEK9VxbyC4wMbfx_kA--", "site_full": "forums.moneysavingexpert.com", "site": "moneysavingexpert.com", "site_section": "http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/forumdisplay.php?f=163", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Parking Tickets, Fines &amp; Parking - MoneySavingExpert.com Forums", "title": "ParkingEye - Hotel Parking", "title_full": "ParkingEye - Hotel Parking - MoneySavingExpert.com Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T10:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2270, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b8af8dabe581d2e69cbf588f106dc06feace6ed0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwpfpRw.8wzF9ehGIH9IrJvqxgmIeBD_U3UOVUzPYLjtOJn.y0uGHnTAhPmCEK9VxbrWILpDY3gCPtHaiidxD8dYXNo7HrMJUw-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Guys Dad", "published": "2017-12-07T10:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Get on to hotel to get them to check their records and cancel charge.\nIs it a hotel where the receptionist keys in regards no or do you.\nBut as a regular user of hotel, they should get it cancelled.

Business Insider got the answer from the man making her lunch on Thursday. The menu includes salmon, lamb and orange tart, and was approved by the palace.

base in Portsmouth, southern England.\nOn board we spoke to Petty Officer Dean Allen, who works as a chef on board and will be in charge of preparing the meal for the monarch when she visits.\nBusiness Insider.\nHere are the dishes chosen for the three-course menu: Starter: Salmon tian with fennel and apple salad\nMain course: Double rib of lamb with broad bean cassoulet and lemon jus\nShutterstock\nDessert: Burnt orange tart with poached meringue and blackberry compote\nGetty Images\nAllen told us that his team submitted several menu ideas ahead of the event, then sent them to officials at Buckingham Palace who made the final call on what should be served.\nThe lunch, which is for the Queen and 31 other dignitaries, is part of a ceremony in which Her Majesty will formally accept HMS Queen Elizabeth as part of the Royal Navy, a process called \"commissioning.\"\nThe ceremony will see the Queen visit the ship, inspect a naval guard of honour, and celebrate the beginning

"I should have seen the trouble coming when the only media request form I could find was on an old campaign website, with nothing else turning up over a two-and-a-half hour search.\nNonetheless, I sent an email there, and no reply came.\nI was among other reporters who were given the cold shoulder by the Donald Trump presidential administration for his brief visit to Utah, where he rescinded most of two national monuments.\nA member of the Secret Service was at the northwest corner of the Utah capitol, as identified by Salt Lake City police, who directed me to that side of the building from the opposite side but then told me I needed to get off the side of the road closest to the building. So then I found myself talking across the street at the individual to whom the officer had gestured. But she then said that press needed to be there by 11 a.m. That differed from the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance\u2019s report that 12:30 p.m. was the time. I said that to the Secret Service.\nOnly then did she say that I would need to go all the way around to the other side of the capitol, seeming to be both an acknowledgement that she was dishonest about the 11 a.m. time (Trump didn\u2019t even start speaking until perhaps 12:50 p.m.) and that she wanted me to go away. But then and only then, upon getting to that side before 12:30, where these officers said nothing about a needed time of arrival, was I told no.\nAnother reporter was there, too. And guess what? He, too, said that he was told to go to the west side of the capitol, only there to be told that he needed to go clear to the opposite side.\nAnd we both write for non-mainstream media. This is startling given that Trump has embraced mainstream media, letting outlets into White House press briefings who have never been there before. There\u2019s also his routine blasting of mainstream media and even being so critical that he made\u2026 ahem\u2026 mainstream the usage of a phrase by some about mainstream media stories.\nOr should this be frightening?\nWe should all agree (in a non-fake quote of Trump), \u201csad!\u201d\n1,500 rally \nMormon and non-Mormon, men and women, the able and disabled and white and non-white all stood up to Trump at least two hours and 15 minutes before he even spoke, amid snowy weather.\nIt happened after 5,000 rallied at the same place two days earlier.\nGerald Lazar, a psychiatrist in Salt Lake, held up a sign that said \u201cIf anything it\u2019s fake, it\u2019s you!\u201d He said that Trump lies daily.\n\u201cSometimes people make the distinction between lying and bullshit; people lie when they know the truth. Well, I don\u2019t think he really knows that the truth is\u2026 He makes it up as he goes along because he doesn\u2019t know,\u201d Lazar said. \u201cHe\u2019s not smart enough to keep up with the news. And what he listens to isn\u2019t news; it\u2019s fake news.\u201d\nRachel Taylor of Salt Lake said it was \u201cawesome\u201d to be at the rally \u2018because Trump respects nothing and nobody except for him, what benefits him, and we\u2019ve got to take a stand,\u201d she said.\nWhy was she there?\n\u201cIt\u2019s public lands, it\u2019s Orrin Hatch, it\u2019s everything,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe need to be heard, that Hatch isn\u2019t representing us,\u201d she then said. \u201cUtah isn\u2019t getting represented; there are so many of us who do not feel the same way that he (does).\u201d\nRegina Anderson of Tooele spoke of Hatch and Rep. Rob Bishop, who led in the public-land fight before Trump\u2019s executive action.\n\u201cI want them to go down with (Trump),\u201d she said. \u201c(Bishop\u2019s) there trying to get laws changed.\u201d\nSpeaking to Bishop\u2019s Public Lands Initiative, she said \u201cthey make it possible for these things.\u201d\nLazar also said \u201cI was trying to think of an expression that would cover it\u2026 thinking of the three r\u2019s of reading, writing and arithmetic\u2026 it\u2019s Russia, the rich, rape the country.\u201d\nTaylor remarked that Trump is doing \u201canything to keep Mitt Romney out of there\u201d after being asked about Trump using the event to help Hatch be re-elected. Three-quarters of Utahns do not want him to run again.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for him to go,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe need to be heard; that\u2019s why we are all here.\u201d\nAnderson said \u201cit\u2019s worth it\u201d when asked about making a relatively long drive from Tooele. Of the size of the crowd, she said \u201cit\u2019s hard to see them all.\u201d\nOf Hatch, \u201che just doesn\u2019t care,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cEvery single person in Utah could be right here and I still don\u2019t think he would care.\u201d\n\u2014\nIf you believe in the work we are doing here at The Good Men Project, please join like-minded individuals in The Good Men Project Premium Community. \u25ca \u25ca\n\n\u25ca \u25ca\nGet the best stories from The Good Men Project delivered straight to your inbox, here. \n\u25ca \u25ca\n\n\u25ca \u25ca\nSign up for our Writing Prompts email to receive writing inspiration in your inbox twice per week. \n\u25ca \nWe have pioneered the largest worldwide conversation about what it means to be a good man in the 21st century.

Modi's decision to take action on black money has ushered a new era for the real estate industry in India. The rolling out of major policy reforms such as RERA and GST compounded the aftermath effects of demonetisation. \nFor Ravish Kapoor, Director, Elan Group, 'The purpose of the entire demonetisation exercise was to clean up the system. In the long term, its impact on the real estate segment was neutral. According to PTI, the leasing of commercial sector remains unaffected in accordance with the effect. \nWith the introduction of RERA and GST, the major share of investors across the globe will take India globally raising confidence of customers in the realty sector.\u00f6 The primary residential market and projects embraced by reputed builders were not affected significantly by demonetisation; only in projects where the component of cash was involved and those in the secondary market have been influenced. Also, the transparency and accountability in the sector has enhanced significantly for institutional investors. The ongoing transformation is already witnessing a massive rise in investment inflow from both foreign and domestic investors. \n'One of the segments that benefitted most from the demonetisation drive is the affordable housing segment,' says Ssumit Berry, Managing Director, BDI Group. He adds, 'Affordable housing came with lower EMIs due to various subsidies and became even cheaper after demonetisation. The Indian real estate sector attracted an all time high foreign investment of US$ 5.7 billion in 2016, despite demonetisation.' \nOn his part, Vineet Relia, Managing Director, SARE Homes, says, 'The real estate industry is presently facing many challenges due to demonetisation, implementation of RERA and GST. However, in the long run, both the residential as well as commercial sector, is expected to witness a boost due to the increased transparency and elimination of black money.' \nThe real estate sector will regain a speedier development direction and is estimated to contribute around 13 per cent to India's GDP by 2028. This forecast is achievable in the light of the fact that the reforms now redefining the realty landscape in India will not only incrementally boost consumer sentiment, but also additionally enhance investment inflows from foreign and domestic institutional investors proceeding. Having come a long way, this ripple effect has started to fade with time. \nTo share your perspective on current industry happenings, write in at feedback@ConstructionWorld.in Tags Cloud", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ravish kapoor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ssumit berry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vineet relia", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "elan group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bdi group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gst", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:30.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b3fada9fa1475e385968a58e9c0321a2456aeb79", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm3NRNaRMlf6Jhqcde7PlXZv", "site_full": "www.ooyuz.com", "site": "ooyuz.com", "site_section": "http://www.ooyuz.com/newsanalysis?term=rod smith", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "rod%20smith News Results and Analysis |OOYUZ", "title": "Dak Prescott and a stalled Cowboys offense: \u2019You just have to believe in yourself.\u2019 - San Antonio Express-News", "title_full": "Dak Prescott and a stalled Cowboys offense: \u2019You just have to believe in yourself.\u2019 - San Antonio Express-News : Related Articles | OOYUZ", "published": "2017-11-29T18:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53324, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b3fada9fa1475e385968a58e9c0321a2456aeb79", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm3NRNaRMlf6Jhqcde7PlXZv", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mySanAntonio.com", "published": "2017-11-29T18:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "Dak Prescott and a stalled Cowboys offense: \u2019You just have to believe in yourself.\u2019 - San Antonio Express-News", "text": "Photo: Ron Jenkins /AP Photo FRISCO, Texas \u2014 In the sheer glare of The Star, the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 many-mirrored and galactically lit new headquarters, it can be hard to make out anyone very clearly.

I respect the change that did take place.\u201d\nFarrell pointed out that new manager Alex Cora has a head start.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a stacked team as it stands today. Alex Cora is inheriting a very good team with a lot of expectations. That\u2019s the norm there,\u201d Farrell said.\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see how things unfold.\u201d\nFarrell addressed the attention and intense coverage that all managers in baseball receive.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no doubt going to be the scrutiny and that\u2019s going to have varying degrees depending on the city,\u201d he said. \u201cComing out of five years in which there might have been the most scrutiny on a team, on an individual player or a manager, and that\u2019s Boston. But that\u2019s also what draws people to those places. The expectation is high and the ability to win is there every single year.\n\u201cAnd if that\u2019s not in your DNA, if that\u2019s not what you aspire to do, and that\u2019s to win, then maybe those places aren\u2019t for you.\u201d\nFarrell spoke less than two hours before new Yankees manager Aaron Boone was introduced in New York.\n\u201cThe talk certainly of Aaron Boone going to New York, I don\u2019t know if he managed anywhere else (Boone hasn\u2019t coached or managed), would he be ready for the job that he is walking into?\u201d Farrell said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that you can prepare for those positions until you\u2019re in them. I think it\u2019s great to see a great hire in Aaron Boone.\u201d\nBoone welcomes rivalry\nIn his introduction, Boone said the Red Sox\u2019 success since 2003 has softened the memory of his walkoff home run in Game 7 of the AL Championship Series that sent the Yankees to the World Series. But that won\u2019t last long, no matter how much Boone looks forward to rejoining the rivalry.\n\u201cI am looking forward to Boston .\u2009.\u2009. I don\u2019t think it will be warm anymore,\u201d Boone said at Yankee Stadium. \u201cI tell you what, since the Red Sox have had success and won their championships (in 2004, \u201907, \u201913), I feel like that since I\u2019ve been back there, it\u2019s been a little more good-natured if you will. I don\u2019t think if they had not won championships it would be so good-natured, but at least my experience has been that it\u2019s been good-natured ribbing.\n\u201cI would say now that I\u2019m actually trying to take food off their table or wins off their board, I would say it won\u2019t be as good-natured anymore, but one of the things I loved about my time here .\u2009.\u2009. is just how special of a rivalry it is between the two clubs. I look forward to being a part of that.\u201d\nBoone is also looking forward to friendly-enough relations with a fellow new manager in Cora.\n\u201cNow the manager of that team happens to be someone I\u2019ve known a long time and been very friendly with and very fond of, and I\u2019m looking forward to now striking up that rivalry with him,\u201d Boone said.\nBettis to be honored\nThe Colorado Rockies\u2019 Chad Bettis will accept the 2017 Tony Conigliaro Award next month at the Boston Baseball Writers Awards Dinner.\nBettis was diagnosed with testicular cancer in November 2016 and underwent surgery. Then, after reporting to spring training in February, the pitcher learned the cancer had spread to his lymph nodes. After nine weeks of chemotherapy, Bettis slowly made his way back to pitching shape and returned to the majors in mid-August, throwing seven scoreless innings in his first start in Denver.\n\u201cI think being able to be the recipient of this year\u2019s award is nothing short of an honor,\u201d Bettis said. \u201cAnd I feel like the award goes beyond just myself to the help and encouragement of my family and teammates and the entire Colorado Rockies organization.\u201d\nThe dinner is Jan. 18 at the Marriott Copley Place.

Nun gilt es, neue und noch ambitioniertere Wegmarken zu setzen\", erkl\u00e4rt David Muggli, Vorstandsvorsitzender des Z\u00fclpicher Energiedienstleisters PRIOGO AG. Zehn Jahre nach der Gr\u00fcndung haben die Anteilseigner einen ersten Wechsel im Aufsichtsrat beschlossen: Dr. Philip M\u00fcller als Aufsichtsratsvorsitzender sowie Kai Eimermacher und Peter Rochel sollen die Technologieexperten f\u00fcr umweltfreundlichen Strom in das n\u00e4chste Jahrzehnt f\u00fchren. Sie \u00fcbernehmen die Mandate des bisherigen Aufsichtsratsvorsitzenden Prof. Dr. Gerd Wassenberg und der Aufsichtsratsmitglieder Philipp Spitz sowie Martin Beinlich. \"F\u00fcr die erfolgreiche Begleitung im ersten Jahrzehnt und die kontinuierliche Aufbauarbeit sind wir Herrn Professor Wassenberg, Herrn Spitz und Herrn Beinlich sehr dankbar\", so Muggli. In den vergangenen zehn Jahren habe Wassenberg und sein Team ma\u00dfgeblich den Strukturwandel im Photovoltaikmarkt begleitet und mit neuen Ideen den Grundstein f\u00fcr die Bew\u00e4ltigung der kommenden Herausforderungen gelegt. Nun gelte es als n\u00e4chsten Schritt der unternehmerischen Erfolgsgeschichte, die Schl\u00fcsselthemen Digitalisierung und Elektromobilit\u00e4t \"anzupacken\". Im Sinne der Sektorkopplung wird der selbst erzeugte Strom durch Photovoltaikanlagen um die W\u00e4rmeerzeugung durch W\u00e4rmepumpen und die Speicherung von Strom erg\u00e4nzt. \"Nun kommt auch das Elektroauto als entscheidender Mosaikstein f\u00fcr unsere Kunden hinzu.\" Erst vor wenigen Monaten hatte das Unternehmen die Zusammenarbeit mit der Aachener Elektrofahrzeugschmiede e.GO mobile AG verk\u00fcndet. Der neue Aufsichtsrat \"brennt darauf, uns in diesen entscheidenden Bereichen mit seinem Spezialwissen voranzubringen\", so Muggli. Der neue Aufsichtsratsvorsitzer Dr. Philip M\u00fcller (31) ist hauptberuflich Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrung des Eschweiler Familienunternehmens Uwe M\u00fcller GmbH. Im Aufsichtsrat steht er besonders f\u00fcr das Schl\u00fcsselthema Elektromobilit\u00e4t: W\u00e4hrend seiner Zeit am Werkzeugmaschinenlabor (WZL) der RWTH Aachen promovierte er dort Anfang 2015 \u00fcber die Fahrzeugentwicklung in einem gleichberechtigten Zulieferernetzwerk. Als Fallbeispiel diente ihm das von seinen Professoren gegr\u00fcndete Unternehmen StreetScooter, das heute zur Deutschen Post geh\u00f6rt. Bislang seien solche Entwicklungsprozesse von etablierten Fahrzeugherstellern gepr\u00e4gt gewesen, denen vergleichsweise kleine Zulieferer und Partnerfirmen gegen\u00fcberstanden. \"Bei StreetScooter arbeiten die Akteure auf Augenh\u00f6he zusammen und setzen so starke innovative Potenziale frei\", erkl\u00e4rt M\u00fcller den Unterschied. Aus dieser Zeit stammt der intensive Kontakt zu Professor G\u00fcnther Schuh, der mit dem Elektroflitzer e.GO life aus Aachen f\u00fcr Schlagzeilen sorgt. M\u00fcller ist in Schuhs Unternehmen e.GO Mobile AG bis heute im Vertrieb aktiv. So wuchs die Verbindung von PRIOGO AG, Dr. M\u00fcller und der Aachener Elektrofahrzeugschmiede. \"Wir haben uns gefragt: Wie schaffen wir es, dass ein umweltfreundliches Auto erneuerbare Energie tankt?\" Diejenige Kundschaft, die das Elektroauto ungerne mit Kohlestrom versorgen m\u00f6chte, \"kann die PRIOGO AG prima bedienen.\" M\u00fcller freut sich ausdr\u00fccklich auf die \"wechselseitigen positiven Effekte\" und die Kooperationen mit anderen Unternehmen, die er als Aufsichtsratsvorsitzender besonders im Bereich der Elektromobilit\u00e4t vorantreiben m\u00f6chte. \"In der Branche ist noch viel Entwicklungspotential\". Rechtsanwalt Kai Eimermacher (47) soll als zweites neues Gesicht im PRIOGO-Aufsichtsrat die rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen f\u00fcr die Erweiterungspl\u00e4ne \"in den H\u00e4nden halten\". Seine Euskirchener Anwaltskanzlei \"Schmitz - Wershoven, Eimermacher, Klein\" hat sich unter anderem auf das Bau- und Architektenrecht sowie Internetrecht spezialisiert. Bereits seit Anfang 1999 besitzt der geb\u00fcrtige Bonner seine Anwaltszulassung und ist mittlerweile Fachanwalt f\u00fcr Arbeitsrecht und Verkehrsrecht. Ebenfalls deutlich breiter aufstellen m\u00f6chte sich die PRIOGO AG als Technologiezentrum f\u00fcr Energie und als digitaler Handwerksbetrieb. Diesen Bereich m\u00f6chte Peter Rochel (44) ma\u00dfgeblich ausbauen. Der K\u00f6lner Unternehmensberater hat sich auf mittelst\u00e4ndische Unternehmen und Vertriebsdigitalisierung spezialisiert. In der internationalen Photovoltaik- und Energiebranche ist der passionierte Segler heimisch: Viele Jahre hat er mit einer eigenen Firma den spanischen Markt mit Solartechnologie versorgt. \"So kreuzten sich schlie\u00dflich unsere Wege\", erz\u00e4hlt Peter Rochel \u00fcber Vorstand David Muggli.\"Mit diesen ausgewiesenen Experten gehen wir zuversichtlich in die Zukunft\", ist sich Muggli sicher.\u00b9", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tobias schenk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kai eimermacher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "g\u00fcnther schuh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philip m\u00fcller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jahren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "photovoltaikanlagen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erweiterungspl\u00e4ne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herrn beinlich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "m\u00fcller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diejenige kundschaft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "viele jahre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin beinlich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philipp spitz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter rochel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digitalisierung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schmitz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "w\u00e4rmepumpen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gerd wassenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muggli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "segler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zehn jahre nach der gr\u00fcndung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wassenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "strom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kooperationen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seine euskirchener anwaltskanzlei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "der k\u00f6lner unternehmensberater", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eimermacher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bonner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rechtsanwalt kai eimermacher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david muggli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zeit am werkzeugmaschinenlabor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schl\u00fcsselthemen digitalisierung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herrn spitz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "klein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anwaltszulassung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diesen bereich", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "priogo ag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elektromobilit\u00e4t und digitalisierung 07.12.2017 | umwelt & energie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutschen post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eschweiler familienunternehmens uwe m\u00fcller gmbh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "priogo ag als technologiezentrum f\u00fcr energie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elektromobilit\u00e4t", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "speicherung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "w\u00e4rmeerzeugung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fahrzeugentwicklung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aachen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:31.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dab1c0f05f7c6def18c51fde4e00e28b8fde2d85", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRu_5f5nYIAte7xno_kFmQph9jeID2F4Pk46jlfDfk4_j6miHgXpmdVNl3My7G4XwtQPd8K4dvy5y3aLREe0_a7X3y5A8teKGyunhERpl7fXA--", "site_full": "forums.ea.com", "site": "ea.com", "site_section": "https://forums.ea.com/en/the-simpsons-tapped-out/categories/bugs-issues", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bugs &amp; Issues \u2014 EA Forums", "title": "Recent issues - Page 7", "title_full": "Recent issues - Page 7 \u2014 EA Forums", "published": "2017-11-22T22:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1289, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "270803950f051adcf35247aa0ea00e18c85a19b6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRu_5f5nYIAte7xno_kFmQph9jeID2F4Pk46jlfDfk4_j6miHgXpmdVNl3My7G4XwtQPd8K4dvy5y3aLREe0_a7X3y5A8teKGx421SeuzTlMmqAm96GoUVX1NcrfmlZhOE-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "hyphen_ena", "published": "2017-11-29T23:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I'm experiencing a bug where every time I open the game I have to log in and it appears to be re-downloading the entire game as if I just downloaded the app onto my device (iPhone).

So geht es auch Livia. Vor dem Abitur singt sie in einer Band und liebt Musik und Technik mehr als alles andere. Zudem hat sie eine leidenschaftliche Beziehung mit Gordon. Doch nach dem Abitur entscheidet sie sich gegen ihre Passion und konzentriert sich auf den Wunsch der Eltern lieber auf einen sicheren Arbeitsplatz. Livia beginnt mit dem Maschinenbaustudium und arbeitet in der Firma ihres Vaters. Sie gibt in dieser Zeit nicht nur ihre Tr\u00e4ume auf, auch die Beziehung zu Gordon wird immer wieder unterbrochen - mal durch r\u00e4umliche Entfernung, mal durch zweckbestimmte Partnerschaften. Die Leser folgen Livia in dem Roman \"Livia, brenne f\u00fcr deine Musik!\" von Claus Zander auf ihrer Entwicklungsreise vom Teenager zur jungen Frau. Wie so viele andere junge Frauen gibt sie dem Dr\u00e4ngen der Eltern und der Gesellschaft nach - doch ihre wahre Leidenschaften finden immer wieder einen Weg an die Oberfl\u00e4che. Wird sie sich f\u00fcr die Technik oder die Musik entscheiden und was wird aus ihrer Beziehung zu Gordon?

An acting veteran gathered the group to expose them to the stage and uncover new talents. (Photo: Chris LaChall/Staff Photographer) Something goes wrong as revenge seeps into the atmosphere and it will be brought to the public on Dec. 15 in a murder mystery spoof written and acted by a senior citizens group culled from borough residents under a program supported by the Haddon Heights Neighbors. Is there poison in the glass of wine deliberately handed to Fontaine, a feisty white-haired glamour babe with an affinity for large, sparking jewelry, portrayed by Renie Cervino? Or is the lipstick handed over by the super-sweet Maureen DeFuria, her best friend from high school and the real brains behind the bestseller, tainted with an evil substance? And what's with DeFuria's stage-husband, Bob Marshall, and the peanuts? The community will have a chance to eavesdrop on the conversations of the party hosts and call out clues as the Haddon Neighbors group gives a free performance of the show they've been working on for eight weeks. \"Murder in the Heights'' will be staged in the Haddon Heights Community Center off Lippincott Avenue, beginning at 6:30 p.m. on Dec. 15. Admission is free and so are the laughs. Most of them may be planned, as the group of theater newbies strive to create intrigue. The cast is all of retirement age, and the classes have been a stimulation and an opportunity to meet new friends. All bets are off about whether they will follow their own scripts. Buy Photo \nThe cast of the murder mystery 'Murder in the Heights,' includes (front row, from left): Maureen DeFuria, Irene Cervino, Gladys Rodriguez, Judy Buecker, (back row, from left): Bob Marshall, Craig Huber, acting teacher and director Karen Scioli, Ken Shuttleworth, Fran Marshall, Roselyn Clark and Kathy Miller. They are shown here in their rehearsal space. (Photo: Chris LaChall/Staff Photographer) The theater program, free to the dozen participants, was the concept of Karen Scioli, a character actress and comic, who wanted to expose seniors in her town to the joy of acting. Scioli is a co-writer and producer for Lighten Up Productions, which delivers comedies and murder mysteries and roasts for corporate events. She also has a cult following from her years as Stella, the maneater from Manayunk, the host of a horror film series that was broadcast on KYW-TV 3 from 1984 to 1990. The series, \"Saturday Night Dead,'' followed the national show \"Saturday Night Live.'' Scioli also was a frequent contributor to some of Philadelphia's morning drive-time call-in shows, most frequently as Rere DiNucci, \u201cthe hairdresser from South Philly.\u201d (The name \u201cRere\u201d is worth an explanation because, as everyone has come to know, every third female in South Philadelphia is named Marie and Rere is but one way to differentiate them.) Scioli coaches private students who want to find themselves on deck for commercial voice-overs or performances or for stand-up comedy. She's channeled her talent and enthusiasm to help some seniors forge friendships in an arena they never considered, live theater.

(Photo: Chris LaChall/Staff Photographer) \u201cShe's tough on you,\u201d said Ken Shuttleworth, a member of the class who has found his dream role, a crusty homicide detective, in the Haddon Heights show. \u201cShe's merciless when you go to her for coaching,\u201d says Shuttleworth, whose previous experience of prancing on a local stage was in a summertime production of \"Midsummer Night's Dream'' with the Ignoble Shakespeare Company, a group associated with Rutgers-Camden. Once assigned roles in the production, cast members had to write their own lines for the contemporary show, weaving in potential motives for the foul deed. Scioli said she's worked with programs at Rowan University and other places and been holding acting classes in Haddon Heights for about two years. She realized a lot of seniors had an interest in theater work. \u201cWhy not tap into it and find the artist within yourself?\u201d she asks. \u201cPortraying a character who isn't you opens up your heart and sometimes it colors your world,\u201d she said.\u201d \u201cI would give an 80-year-old woman a monologue from a Tennessee Williams play. She would perform it differently than a younger woman, an 18-year-old. I wouldn't cast an 80-year-old in the role, but in a workshop it's an unveiling of potential,\u201d said Scioli. Scioli described her prot\u00e9ges as \u201cvery colorful, even when they're not in a role.\u201d \u201cThere are programs to keep seniors mobile, to push them to exercise. But this keeps their brains mobile, and there's not enough of that out there for them,\u201d she said. In the real world of acting, Scioli said, there are roles for every age. She'd like to expand the program to other municipalities but hasn't found another sponsor. \nHaddon Heights Neighbors will sponsor 'Murder in the Heights.' (Photo: Courier-Post file) If you go Haddon Heights Neighbors will present an all-senior cast performance of \"Murder in the Heights'' on Dec. 15 from 6:30 to 8 p.m. in the Haddon Heights Community Center on Lippincott Avenue. Admission is free and the audience will be encouraged to join in solving the crime.

Yesterday, however, Valve suddenly revealed that Bitcoin support has officially ceased on Steam, citing high fees and volatility in the value as the main reasons. You can read the whole blog post below.\nIn related Bitcoin news, NiceHash, the crypto-mining marketplace, was hacked and the Bitcoin wallets of its customers were emptied.\nAs of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method on our platform due to high fees and volatility in the value of Bitcoin.\nIn the past few months we\u2019ve seen an increase in the volatility in the value of Bitcoin and a significant increase in the fees to process transactions on the Bitcoin network. For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled Bitcoin). Unfortunately, Valve has no control over the amount of the fee. These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with Bitcoin. The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of Bitcoin itself drops dramatically.\nHistorically, the value of Bitcoin has been volatile, but the degree of volatility has become extreme in the last few months, losing as much as 25% in value over a period of days. This creates a problem for customers trying to purchase games with Bitcoin. When checking out on Steam, a customer will transfer x amount of Bitcoin for the cost of the game, plus y amount of Bitcoin to cover the transaction fee charged by the Bitcoin network. The value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction doesn\u2019t complete within that window of time, then the amount of Bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change. The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different.\nThe normal resolution for this is to either refund the original payment to the user, or ask the user to transfer additional funds to cover the remaining balance. In both these cases, the user is hit with the Bitcoin network transaction fee again. This year, we\u2019ve seen increasing number of customers get into this state. With the transaction fee being so high right now, it is not feasible to refund or ask the customer to transfer the missing balance (which itself runs the risk of underpayment again, depending on how much the value of Bitcoin changes while the Bitcoin network processes the additional transfer).\nAt this point, it has become untenable to support Bitcoin as a payment option. We may re-evaluate whether Bitcoin makes sense for us and for the Steam community at a later date.\nWe will continue working to resolve any pending issues for customers who are impacted by existing underpayments or transaction fees.\nThe post Valve Ceases Bitcoin Support on Steam Due To High Fees and Volatility in the Value by Alessio Palumbo appeared first on Wccftech .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alessio palumbo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitpay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:32.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e23234c5e070f6e418140ebd054be096ebb28b75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS9ng2tTAOtxCSXRNea_KEqY-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e23234c5e070f6e418140ebd054be096ebb28b75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS9ng2tTAOtxCSXRNea_KEqY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Thopu", "published": "2017-12-07T11:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "http://yoineer.com/6FD5\r\nLatest photos wallpapers", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:32.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "afefd3f477439aa3f27c8c20e1fbd698de0e2c80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94ovzWkJ_LjctYs04iYtNO5wYh.iwcMXVzEmXShWybI8R333p7X7vxFIN78g5b0.wFkP6Y6LbPbdAG.KuyvqROP7rYRTUQiaaeMi.VPO9r8h4H", "site_full": "www.amazonforum.com", "site": "amazonforum.com", "site_section": "https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Fire Tablets - Devices - Amazon Digital and Device Forum ", "title": "Massive battery drain", "title_full": "Massive battery drain - Fire Tablets - Devices - Amazon Digital and Device Forum", "published": "2017-12-07T07:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7c115526ff8ba5fe58173afe6d966657ca75f1e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94ovzWkJ_LjctYs04iYtNO5wYh.iwcMXVzEmXShWybI8R333p7X7vxFIN78g5b0.wFkP6Y6LbPbdAG.KuyvqROP7rYRTUQiaaeMoC9V0b9xaoCrbzU8AyJfL8-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "jumptherope", "published": "2017-12-07T15:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: from uscpsycho >> jumptherope - Please stop advising people to turn off their device to prevent the battery drain problem. This is an obvious way to stop the battery from draining. Nobody needs to be told that turning the device off will stop battery depletion. Even a child knows this, we aren't morons.\nBut more importantly, people buy these devices with the expectation that they will be left on 24/7 so that they are available instantly, and only charged every few days as necessary. Perhaps you are OK with continuously power cycling your tablets but that is not the normal expectation or use case. Not only does it take time to wait for it to boot up but every time you you shut down you lose the state of every app you had open. People want to be able to pick up exactly where they left off when they set the tablet down.\nWe appreciate your trying to help but stating the obvious is not much help.\n \"WE APPRECIATE (You Are ) YOU'RE trying to help....\" Ahhh...g ....you're welcome. Believe it OR NOT, there are plenty of non-tech-type folks who are NOT morons, but who may think airplane mode or sleep mode does stop battery drain.

I\u2019m going to share some ideas, to help you understand how marketing gimmicks work and how you can use them, to massively increase the reach of your marketing. How a marketing gimmick went viral \nSome years ago, I discovered a business blog. The thing about this blog, was that the author cussed and swore. She didn\u2019t just drop the occasional f-bomb. No. She took every opportunity to swear. It was a marketing gimmick , done for effect. \nAnd it worked. It worked really, really well! \nAt the time, she attracted a lot of attention and interest. People were talking about her. Back then, it was rare for a business blogger to cuss in their posts. Many people emailed me links to her latest posts, dazzled by her profanity. \nShe gained a lot of visibility. Visibility that had the potential to help her attract a huge (and extremely valuable) audience. \nAnd then\u2026 she vanished! \nNo, she didn\u2019t literally disappear. But she did soon vanish from the radar of public attention. \nWhy? \nWell, it turned out that all she had to offer her readership was her cussing. At her core, she was just \u2018yet another\u2019 business blogger. So although her marketing gimmick drew people in, once the initial shock value wore off, there was nothing to return for. It was a missed opportunity. Marketing gimmicks: making them work \nMake no mistake, marketing gimmicks work . That\u2019s to say, they can help you to get noticed\u2026 and noticed fast, by a huge slice of your marketplace. Plus, if you use a little creativity, it can cost you pennies. \nHowever, there\u2019s a limit to what we can achieve with gimmicks alone. That\u2019s because while a good gimmick can open a door for you, you then need to deliver something useful . \nHere\u2019s an example of what I mean. \nImagine you wanted to massively increase the audience for your newsletter, podcast, vlog or blog. You could use a marketing gimmick to get people talking about you, sharing your content and subscribing.

The while-loop walks through the optstring, which contains the flags that can be used to pass arguments, and assigns the argument value provided for that flag to the variable \"option\". The case-statement then assigns the value of the variable \"option\" to a global variable that can used after all the arguments have been read.\nThe colons in the optstring mean that values are required for the corresponding flags. In the above example all flags are followed by a colon: \"u:d:p:f:\".\nThis means, all flags need a value. If, for example, the \"d\" and \"f\" flags were not expected to have a value, the optstring would be \"u:dp:f\".\nA colon at the beginning of the optstring, for example \":u:d:p:f:\", has a completely different meaning. It allows you to handle flags that are not represented in the optstring. In that case the value of the \"option\" variable is set to \"?\" and the value of \"OPTARG\" is set to the unexpected flag.
