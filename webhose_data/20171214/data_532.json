Despite I realised that our pathways crossover only for a short time, but the influence you brought to my life was a major one. I couldn\u2019t deny the fact that we were once friends, but drifted apart after that. \nI always remember how we not talk to each other in class or wherever we meet even when we started to know each other better (yeap I told you I am a very introverted person) . I think the main reason I kept a distance with you was because college only lasted for 8 months, I didn\u2019t want myself to struggle in things that I had been struggling in throughout my high school years. I don\u2019t have that much time and energy to drain. Everyone is going to leave anyway. \nYou were the one out of thousand who had 3 same classes with me, I didn\u2019t notice this until you told me. I remember I just thought to myself why was I bumping into you constantly (me being the one not making the first move again) around in college, not noticing that we were classmates. You were the one who kick started the conversation with me during one of the Economics classes on Thursday, that was kind of unexpected actually. \nEndless. \nTimes when we always sit down together to discuss those Maths questions that burnt our brain cells down (clearly you knew the questions better than me) from time to time, I always remember how we took pictures of the questions and started spamming each other\u2019s WhatsApp, teasing one another when we did silly mistakes (like how we forgot to reciprocal the fractions or change the signs after shifting it to the other side of the equations) . Thanks for sacrificing your last-minute of studying time to teach me Maths (while I explained Economics to you) and not minding to take the extra effort to teach me the same thing again and again. \nTimes when we always tell jokes that only both of us understand (like the cockroach one) , although it wasn\u2019t a good one but I am pretty pretty sure this was an unforgettable one. Thanks for always encouraging me not to hold myself back when I was devastated and lost while making my own decisions; thanks for being my listener (the not so responsible one, just kidding) constantly, not wanting me to bottle my own emotions up despite you were clueless of what to say all the times. College was tough , but same goes to both of us , thanks for putting your trust on me and allowing me to be your listener, but still sorry as I didn\u2019t manage to do a great job as we drifted apart. \nTimes when we treated each other ice cream (and I remember I still owe you 10) , from McDonald\u2019s to Family Mart, from rainy day to sunny day. Honestly speaking, ice cream was probably the most symbolic sign of our friendship (one more meaningful than Maths) , we always plan for ice creams treats no matter after test or birthday celebrations (and helping you out) . Perhaps, I will always think of college when I come across the ice cream vendors on street at places I end up in the future (and of course, not forgetting that rainy day is the best weather for ice cream) . \nAll the best and hope you will fit yourself in into the new places you are going to be. \nEpilogue. \nI kept my promise to write one for you although it had been a long time since I promised you. It was absolutely not an easy job to be my friend and mentor (sifu) simultaneously while busy defining yourself in this new place, but undoubtedly you did a great job. Thanks for all you\u2019ve did . I know there are going to be times when you lose your hope and feel discouraging, I am sure that you will find your own way out and do remember to take a rest if you are exhausted. Pretty sure your life will be much easier without me.\n8 months of moulding and sculpting was like an acidic puddle that corrodes the negative behaviour in me, leaving the good ones behind. As I mentioned earlier, college will always be my hardest goodbye after going through so much with so many people who refused to give up on me even when I gave up on myself. Even for this blog, it wasn\u2019t only just my effort, but a collaborative effort of all my friends who looked forward for and who barked me around for my weekly updates. \nAnd people, here comes the last post for 2017 (my 21st post at the same time, 21 is a meaningful number to me if you wonder) . Sorry for the very sudden decision but I looked through my planner and I realised that I won\u2019t have any time for this until next February (perhaps I will start updating earlier for 2018 depends on the situation ahead) . \nK thanks bye. \nPS: Sorry if this didn\u2019t meet your expectations because it was a tough job to dedicate the post only for one person.

Alex Wong / Getty Images \nFour months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in \"tatters\" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics. \nIt's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray. \nOn Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch. 1. Russia, Russia, Russia \nWray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, \"a witch hunt.\" \nWray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied to the Trump campaign, including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nDoes that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Stzrok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation , suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case? \nShould there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him? \nLook for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this. \n\"The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,\" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing. \n\"We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,\" Goodlatte added. 2. Independence \nThe job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was \"the Russia thing.\" \nFor his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees , who have faced criticism from the president this year. \nThis week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to \"keep calm and tackle hard\" amid the current adverse climate. And, at his confirmation hearing, Wray pledged his loyalty was to the Constitution, not a political regime. \"I will never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice, period, full stop,\" he said at the time. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee will no doubt want to ask Wray about his contacts with President Trump and others in the White House this year. 3. Oh, yeah \u2014 FBI business \nIn a matter of weeks, an important electronic surveillance tool will expire if Congress does not reauthorize it.

The company is a global leader in international transfers to mobile money accounts \u2013 an emerging market technology where a customer\u2019s phone numbers acts like a bank account to hold funds. \nLeapFrog is the largest dedicated equity investor in financial services and healthcare for emerging market consumers, supporting fast-growth firms that deliver social impact alongside commercial returns by empowering low-income customers. LeapFrog\u2019s existing portfolio reaches 111 million people. \nIsmail Ahmed, founder and CEO at WorldRemit, comments: \u201cThis new funding will fuel our growth, and help bring our service to millions more customers across the globe. We are pleased to attract LeapFrog Investments, a strategic investor whose profit with a purpose mission is aligned with ours\u201d. \nStewart Langdon, Partner at LeapFrog Investments, adds: \u201cThis investment is an opportunity to bring a global leader in digital remittances into the LeapFrog portfolio. WorldRemit\u2019s model is uniquely suited to scale and offers a best in class service that is vital to the livelihood of millions of consumers in LeapFrog\u2019s core markets. The company also has a huge potential to expand globally \u2013 a combination that puts it at the heart of our profit with purpose philosophy. I\u2019m delighted that a world-class fintech company like WorldRemit is choosing LeapFrog as its partner for growth in the emerging markets.\u201d \nSince its last funding round in 2015, WorldRemit has launched 206 new services across the globe and has grown its transaction volume by 400%.

The model and university student denies any intent to insult. \nTurkish media reported that the tweet, which has since been erased, said: \"I got my period on the morning of the July 15 martyrs' day. I'm marking the day by bleeding as a representation of the martyrs' blood.\" \nThe posting caused uproar on social media. \nA court must accept the indictment before a trial date is set. \nRunner-up Asli Sumen was given the title and represented Turkey at the Miss World competition in China.

Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades.

Scott Barbour / Getty Images Members of Parliament celebrate at Parliament House on Thursday in Canberra, Australia, after the approval of same-sex marriage. Michael Masters / Getty Images \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of registered voters and ensured that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\"  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scott barbour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george brandis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "parliament approves same-sex marriage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images members of parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the sydney morning herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "federation square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images  australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:53:46.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0024e3b33375de84df8328241dfdbf0eee668601", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3LkTccX4DqkDigIG_fugw0tp16EzD3L3nwtsYoAO2qMMg--", "site_full": "en.portnews.ru", "site": "portnews.ru", "site_section": "http://en.portnews.ru/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "PortNews IAA", "title": "Throughput of port Murmansk expected to make 51 mln t in 201", "title_full": "Throughput of port Murmansk expected to make 51 mln t in 201", "published": "2017-12-07T07:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "RU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://en.portnews.ru/img/pn_logo_200.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0024e3b33375de84df8328241dfdbf0eee668601", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3LkTccX4DqkDigIG_fugw0tp16EzD3L3nwtsYoAO2qMMg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "en.portnews.ru", "published": "2017-12-07T07:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "Throughput of port Murmansk expected to make 51 mln t in 201", "text": "Throughput of port Murmansk expected to make 51 mln t in 2017, 71 mln t in 2020 The port of Murmansk is forecasted to handle 51 mln t this year with its throughput expected to reach 71 mln t by 2020, IAA PortNews correspondent cites Murmansk Region Governor Marina Kovtun , as saying at the 11 th International Forum and Exhibition \u201cTransport Week\u201d held in Moscow.\nAccording to the Governor, transshipment of dry cargo will reach 22 mln t while design capacity of the terminals on the eastern coast of the Kola Bay is 23 mln t per year including 19 mln t of dry cargo.

It\u2019s a little bigger than a boxing ring. \nWe would all put our pads on and agree to the rules of the day- typically only use half contact to the body, and very light contact to the face, and nothing other than sweeps to the legs as our parents would be a bit upset if we ended up in the ER every week. For the most part, we followed those rules. \nI was by far the shortest of our group at 5\u20196\u201d. One of my friends, Steve, was about 6 inches taller than I was, and had a significant reach advantage. All my friends learned that when they got into the ring with me, all they had to do was lunge punch me and I couldn\u2019t counter because I still had 4-6 inches to go before my hands would even touch them. Steve did this to me all the time and loved showing off. We were sparring in front of our girlfriends one summer day and he was in full Steve mode- Showing off, doing the old rope a dope, and making me look bad in front of everyone. \nSteve really started on the verbal abuse has he kept darting in with lunge punches to my forehead and making everyone else laugh. I then saw a weakness to his punch and how he telegraphed what he was about to do- his toe would slightly turn in right before he would lunge. So I waited for it- and the next time he came in, I ducked the right underneath it, and all I saw was his ribcage. The whole \u201chalf contact to the body rule\u201d went right out the window. \nI wound up a punch all the way from my toes and let it rip, lifting Steve right off the ground and knocking the wind right out of him. \nAs he rolled around on the ground gasping for air among the laughter of everyone else, he stumbled to his feet and said, \u201cOk, lets go\u201d. \nThe next thing he threw was a front kick. He claimed he was aiming for my chest, but it only made it about half way up and the flat of his foot hit me right in the groin. \nYeah\u2026.now I was on the ground groaning feeling like I wanted to die. \nEvery guy in here just winced\u2026 \nLife is like that though. Just when we think we scored a much-needed points, BAM- you are on the ground rolling around in pain. \nWhen life starts to land kick after kick or punch after punch- it affects you, you start to expect it, and it affects how you see life and even how you view God. If we are not careful, a root forms in your spirit, and it produces bitterness within your soul. \nToday we will be concluding our series on the three things that steal our joy or our ability to be a thankful person. \nWe saw how comparison leads to envy, envy to jealousy, and if left alone and allowed to flourish, changes us into a person filled with bitterness and anger.

Prosecutors say he accepted a $2 million bribe from Rosneft's influential chief executive Igor Sechin. \nThe former minister pleaded not guilty to the charges and told the court on Thursday he had fallen victim to \"a horrific and cruel provocation.\" \nThe circumstances of the case have ignited speculation that Ulyukayev was caught in a Kremlin power play against Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin.

Central FM", "text": "\nYour Message: Ministers urged to clarify how low emission zones will be funded \nEnvironmental campaigners have called on the Scottish Government to clarify how low emissions zones (LEZs) will be funded ahead of a statement at Holyrood by the transport minister. \nThe government has announced it will work with councils to introduce LEZs in Scotland\u2019s four biggest cities by 2020 while zones will also be set up, where necessary, in other affected areas by 2023. \nThe first LEZ will be established in Glasgow by the end of next year. \nAimed at improving air quality, fines would be issued to individuals and organisations who enter the zones in vehicles that do not meet designated emission standards. \nFriends of the Earth Scotland has welcomed the move but called on ministers to provide \u201cthe bulk\u201d of the necessary funding to local authorities. \nTransport minister Humza Yousaf is due to deliver a ministerial statement on LEZs at the Scottish Parliament on Thursday. \nAhead of the statement, Friends of the Earth air pollution campaigner Emilia Hanna said: \u201cLow emission zones have been proven to be the single most effective way to tackle dangerous and toxic air. \n\u201cThe Scottish Government is to be congratulated on making LEZs a priority for Scotland\u2019s cities and setting an ambitious timetable for their delivery, but promises will be pie in the sky without the necessary funding to set up and deliver LEZs. \n\u201cThe Scottish Government needs to set out details of how it will fund LEZs. \n\u201cThe Scottish Government must provide the bulk of funding for low emission zones and not simply pass the bill onto cash-strapped councils.\u201d \nThe Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) has urged ministers to help smaller firms upgrade vehicles following warnings as many as three-quarters of Scottish diesel vehicles could fall foul of the new LEZ rules if the strictest standards are adopted. \nAndy Willox, FSB\u2019s Scottish policy convener, said: \u201cLots of Scottish city-centre firms would agree that action must be taken to improve air quality. \n\u201cBut many smaller businesses don\u2019t have large cash reserves and they can\u2019t buy a brand new van at the drop of a hat. \n\u201cTherefore, if we\u2019re to ensure that urban Scotland continues to be a great place to do business, then financial help should be offered to firms looking to transition to lower emission vehicles.\u201d \nThe FSB also called for national LEZ standards and for the zones to be phased-in over a longer period. \nMr Willox added: \u201cMost UK and European low emission zones are phased in over a four-year period \u2013 giving businesses and locals the time to plan and adapt. The Scottish Government must adopt these sorts of sensible lead-in times. \n\u201cFurther, it would not make sense to have different vehicle standards in different Scottish cities. \n\u201cA Dundee-based delivery driver shouldn\u2019t face fines in Glasgow or Edinburgh, if his vehicle passes the test at home.\u201d \nA Scottish Government spokesman said it welcomed the proposals from FSB and that work will be done with them and others to deliver LEZs, with a commitment to bring them into the country\u2019s four biggest cities by 2020. \nHe added: \u201cWe have a clear vision for Scotland\u2019s air quality to be the best in Europe. However, air quality remains a public health issue, particularly for the youngest and oldest in our communities, and especially for those with existing respiratory conditions. \n\u201cEach LEZ must be designed for its city, and those designs are still in development, however, we are committed to providing financial support to implement LEZs in partnership with local authorities. \n\u201cThe Finance Secretary will set out the Scottish Government\u2019s draft budget plans to the Scottish Parliament on December 14.\u201d Share this: Signup to our VIP club \nSubscribe to our VIP club and receive

\u20b92,000 discount makes the best budget phone in India even better. \nThe Mi A1 is the best budget phone you can currently buy in India . Retailing for \u20b914,999, the phone features robust hardware and uncluttered software thanks to Xiaomi's collaboration with Google over the Android One initiative. For the next two days, the phone is available for just \u20b912,999 , a discount of \u20b92,000 from its retail price. \nThe promotion is valid on Flipkart as well as Xiaomi's own Mi.com portal , and is valid on all three color variants of the phone \u2014 Black, Gold, and Rose Gold. \nAs a refresher, the Mi A1 comes with a 5.5-inch Full HD display, Snapdragon 625 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, microSd slot, dual 12MP cameras at the back with a wide-angle primary lens augmented by a telephoto shooter, 5MP front shooter, and a 3080mAh battery. The phone has no issues delivering a day's worth of usage on a full charge, and the camera is one of the best in this category. \nThen there's the software experience, which makes using the Mi A1 a delight. The phone offers a pure Android interface, with a few additions from Xiaomi in the form of the Mi Camera app (to take full advantage of the dual cameras), Mi Feedback to submit feedback about the device, and the Mi Remote app to control devices in your house through the IR blaster. \nXiaomi is set to kick off the Oreo beta test soon , with a stable Oreo update slaeted to arrive before the end of the year. Overall, there isn't a phone in this segment that offers as much value as the Mi A1, and the \u20b92,000 discount makes it an even more enticing option.

If you have to write for your job, there\u2019s no reason why you shouldn\u2019t strive to do it as best as you can. After all, you\u2019re probably trying to impress the people telling you \u201chey, write my essay \u201d. In fact, you can turn your writing job into a nice side hustle, even someday your writing gigs will force you to quit your job and focus on those full-time. Who knows? \nBut for now, you need to acquire the actual skills. Here are some really easy tips and tricks for improving your business writing quality by a lot. Talk the talk \nOf course, this isn\u2019t something that you do overnight. But you should take the time to learn new words and expressions. Especially if you\u2019re new at your job, you probably lack the lingo of the topic of your choice at the moment. The easiest way to \u2018talk\u2019 more like your audience is by to read specialty books or material that is different from what you usually consume. Form the core structure first \nList your main ideas before writing. This is a really useful trick especially if you\u2019re having trouble keeping track of everything that\u2019s supposed to go in your essay. Plan ahead by listing down all the main ideas that will go into your work. Once you cover one idea, just do a check sign next to it and start expanding on the next one, and so on. Get an idea of what you\u2019re looking for \nNo, we\u2019re not talking about stealing or copying someone else\u2019s work. We\u2019re talking about simply reading other people\u2019s essays. Getting a sense of how you are supposed to formulate your essay can improve your work tremendously. \nBy reading other people\u2019s work, you can see how they tackle certain problems that you might be still struggling with during the writing process. For instance, you might find it very difficult to find the right words that tie together your paragraphs. See what your friend does in that situation and then emulate their solution into your own work. Use quotes and statistics \nEssays and usually any kind of written work are more convincing when they tell you what other people say. Include quotes from other people in your essay, and things like percentages from studies done. These will help you look more credible and hook your audience with some facts. Don\u2019t write all your essays the same way \nDepending on who your target audience is, you should change up your writing style . Are you writing for a creative class or for a more rigid environment? Use this to determine if you should keep things serious or if you can go a little wilder with your content.

There are many things that I like about this time of year. Listening to Christmas carols, looking at all the decorated houses while driving, buying gifts for friends and family, slowing down, rekindling relationships and best of all I love all that amazing home cooked food! Just thinking about an entire week of all you can eat buffets of turkey, ham, potatoes, carrots, dressing, pies, cakes and cookies of all kinds; makes my mouth water and stomach grown with delight. Even though there is much I enjoy about Christmas there are certainly many things that I would rather do without. Who really likes wall to wall traffic, trying to find gifts to purchase for those who have everything and schedules that make one run around 24/7? When I think about the good and bad I can\u2019t help but think that the true meaning of Christmas has somehow escaped even us Christians! \nHow does offering trinkets and toys to a world where war, pestilence, disease, hatred and injustice are an everyday occurrence do them any good? Will presents, pretty homes, taking time off work or even food heal their brokenness and give them hope for the other 51 weeks of the year? While a week break from one\u2019s circumstances is a welcoming sight, are not we as Christ\u2019s ambassadors obligated to tell this fallen world that God\u2019s gifts to them are far superior to anything they could ever ask or imagine. Christmas is not just about sharing our love for one another through gifts, parties and food but is to be about proclaiming the message: THE KING IS COMING! In today\u2019s sermon I am going to begin by reviewing statistics concerning the brokenness of this world and the testimony of the wise men, John the Baptist, the man possessed with a legion of demons, the centurion, Peter\u2019s restoration and the witnesses of the curtain of the temple being torn into two; to help remind us that what his world truly needs is He who is the Mighty Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father and Prince of Peace. \nThis is a Fallen World \nUntil one comes to realize how far the people of this world have fallen from grace one simply cannot know how urgent it is that Christians stop offering our usual \u201cstones\u201d of traditional, temporary gifts! While we know we live in the fallen world of Genesis 3:19 , do we truly know how wicked this world has become? With one person every 40 seconds committing suicide, one every 60 seconds being murdered and one every 100 seconds dying in armed combat; we must confess that this world has become one of hatred not only of self but those around us. Obviously we are not so good at following the second Great Command to love each other but what about the first: to love God? With the mention of God being outlawed in any government facility, people shopping and working on the Sabbath, weekly church attendance declining to a mere 16%, and those with \u201cno religion\u201d growing at a whopping 63% per year; can we truly say we are still a nation that recognizes the supremacy of but one God?

It does not just take pride in being one of the oldest stock exchanges globally; it also takes pride in being one of Europe\u2019s best stock exchanges today. It is an honour to be inside for LU-VE S.p.A. as well. Needless to say, the Borsa Italiana has led the European economy\u2014 in one way or another\u2014 to become the globally influential economy that it is today.\nOn the other hand, the FTSE Milano Italia Borsa (MIB) is the country\u2019s benchmark index. Like the Borsa Italiana, it also has a meaningful impact in the entire European trade and commerce environment.\nBorsa Italiana Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy Viceroy Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais had established the Borsa Italiana in February 1808 as one of the first stock exchanges in the world. Based at Palazzo Mezzanotte, Milan, its operations had always been supervised by the government as public entity until 1998.\nThe London Stock Exchange Group had purchased the Borsa Italiana in an all-stock agreement in 2007, merging it with the London Stock Exchange. It helped LU-VE S.p.A. received new audience.\nOn the Borsa Italiana, the pre-market session lasts for an hour, starting at 8:00 a.m. and ending at 9:00 a.m; the regular session lasts for 8.50 hours, starting at 9:00 a.m. and ending at 5:30 p.m.; and the post-market session lasts for 2.50 hours, starting at 6:00 p.m. and ending at 8:30 p.m. The long trading hours give way to international investors who live in countries with different time zones. Consequently, the Borsa Italiana has so much room for growth. Not all stock exchanges have trading hours this long.\nToday, the Borsa Italiana has a total market valuation of about $645 billion with over 300 companies listed on it.\nFTSE MIB The FTSE MIB is currently operated by the FTSE. Prior to the takeover of the FTSE in June 2009, it had been operated as the S&P/MIB by the S&P.\nThe FTSE MIB tracks the 40 largest companies listed on the Borsa Italiana based on market capitalization and with respect to free-floating shares. Different companies of major sectors such as Energy, Financials, Mining, and Telecommunications are included in the FTSE MIB, which represents roughly 80% of the total market valuation on the Borsa Italiana. The components are reviewed quarterly to guarantee the best possible indication of the health of the Italian economy, which plays an important role in the success of the entire European economy. Health of LU-VE S.p.A. shares attract attention of investors.\nThe FTSE MIB had hit an all-time high of 50,108.56 points, which also happens to be its best intraday high, in March 2000. On the other hand, it had hit an all-time low of 12,362.52 points in July 2012 mainly because of high borrowing costs in Europe.\nMany investors are considering Borsa Italiana stocks because of Italy\u2019s competent trade and commerce landscape. It is one of the best ways to count on the growth of the European economy regardless of whether investors are trading short-term or long-term.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://quicksense.net/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "milano italia borsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "borsa italiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "piazza affari", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lu-ve s.p.a.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london stock exchange group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "energy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "borsa italiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lu-ve s.p.a. lu-ve s.p.a.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "borsa italiana napoleonic kingdom of italy viceroy eug\u00e8ne de beauharnais", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "milan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palazzo mezzanotte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "borsa italiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe the borsa italiana", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:53:51.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a1cf03c0d1e03741e41c8d31e831260e1196ec5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdSfHUQ.SRse0jADVpx7Got.3oi4zHbqtyzjFaW1W0sbDdDHIEZ3jQPgry5xIRKFW0M4jofoSa0j6RTBWmVrzOnw5boUC6DHhIr3YZb1QVHelzeH89NJKwm", "site_full": "carsearch.biz", "site": "carsearch.biz", "site_section": "http://carsearch.biz/rss.php?feed=latest&country=US", "site_categories": ["buying_selling_cars", "vehicles"], "section_title": "CarSearch.biz RSS Feed", "title": "Earls Plumbing 11000ERL Earls Neon Wall Clock", "title_full": "Earls Plumbing 11000ERL Earls Neon Wall Clock", "published": "2017-12-07T11:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8a1cf03c0d1e03741e41c8d31e831260e1196ec5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdSfHUQ.SRse0jADVpx7Got.3oi4zHbqtyzjFaW1W0sbDdDHIEZ3jQPgry5xIRKFW0M4jofoSa0j6RTBWmVrzOnw5boUC6DHhIr3YZb1QVHelzeH89NJKwm", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "Earls Plumbing 11000ERL Earls Neon Wall Clock", "text": "18706 , Wilkes-barre, Pennsylvania Seller's Notes: \nPowered by Frooition.com --> Shop Categories Earls Plumbing 11000ERL Earls Neon Wall Clock Item Description Wall ClockEarls Neon Wall Clock Earls Neon Wall Clock; 14.5 in.

Advertisement - \nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday recognized the disputed city of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital \u2014 a historic decision that overturns decades of US policy and risks triggering a fresh spasm of violence in the Middle East. \nTrump calls for calm and tolerance after Jerusalem decision \n\u201cI have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,\u201d Trump said from the White House. \n\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d \nThe declaration calls into question seven decades of deliberate diplomatic ambiguity about the final status of a holy city vociferously claimed by both Israelis and Palestinians. \nTrump also kicked off the process of moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, making good on a campaign promise dear to evangelical Christian and right-wing Jewish voters \u2014 as well as donors. \nHe said his decision marked the start of a \u201cnew approach\u201d to solving the thorny conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. \nTrump\u2019s predecessors \u2014 from Bill Clinton to George Bush \u2014 made similar promises on the campaign trail but quickly reneged upon taking office, and the burden of war and peace. \nThis most unlikely of presidents, who came to office with no foreign policy experience and denouncing experts, was determined to show his arrival in Washington spells the end of business as usual. \n\u201cMany presidents have said they want to do something and they didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Trump said in the hours leading up to his historic address. \n\u201cWhether it\u2019s courage or they changed their mind, I can\u2019t tell you,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s long overdue.\u201d \n\u2013 Outrage \u2013 \nThe announcement leaves many angry US allies and leaders across the Middle East trying to find a measured response and hoping that the tinderbox region is not destined for yet another round of bloodletting. \nPope Francis joined a list of leaders warning of a historic misstep that could trigger a surge of violence. \n\u201cI cannot silence my deep concern over the situation that has emerged in recent days,\u201d the pontiff said Wednesday, one day after speaking by phone with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas. \nThe pontiff added that maintaining Jerusalem\u2019s status quo was important \u201cin order to avoid adding new elements of tension to an already volatile world that is wracked by so many cruel conflicts.\u201d \nIn a frantic series of calls, the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the European Union, France, Germany and Turkey also warned Trump against the move. \n\u2013 Three \u2018days of rage\u2019 \u2013 - Advertisement - \nMoving the US embassy will probably take years to implement, but the repercussions of Trump\u2019s decision are likely to be swift. \nHundreds of Palestinians burned US and Israeli flags as well as pictures of Trump in the Gaza Strip, while relatively small clashes erupted near the flashpoint West Bank city of Hebron. \nThe Palestinian armed Islamist movement Hamas has threatened to launch a new \u201cintifada,\u201d or uprising. \nPalestinians called for three days of protests \u2014 or \u201cdays of rage\u201d \u2014 starting Wednesday. \nAnticipating protests, US government officials and their families were ordered to avoid Jerusalem\u2019s Old City and the West Bank, though the situation remained largely calm Wednesday. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for a summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the main pan-Islamic body, in Istanbul on December 13 \u201cto display joint action among Islamic countries\u201d over Jerusalem. \n\u201cSuch a step will only play into the hands of terror groups,\u201d Erdogan said at a joint news conference in Ankara after talks with Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II. \nJordan and the Palestinians also called for an emergency meeting of the Arab League in Cairo. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu refrained from commenting on the issue on Wednesday in his first speech since Trump\u2019s plan was confirmed. \n\u2013 Peace still possible, US says \u2013 \nMost of the international community does not formally recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, insisting the issue can only be resolved in negotiations. \nThe White House argues the move would not prejudge final talks and would represent the reality that west Jerusalem is and will continue to be part of Israel under any settlement. \nCritics say Trump\u2019s approach could extinguish his own efforts to broker Middle East peace while igniting the flames of conflict in a region already reeling from crises in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Qatar. \nIsrael seized the largely Arab eastern sector of Jerusalem during the 1967 Six-Day War and later annexed it, claiming both sides of the city as its capital. \nThe Palestinians want the eastern sector as the capital of their future state. \nTrump was pushed to act on the embassy as a result of the 1995 law, which stated that the city \u201cshould be recognized as the capital of the state of Israel\u201d and the US embassy be moved there. \nA waiver has been invoked by successive US presidents, postponing the move on grounds of \u201cnational security\u201d once every six months, meaning the law has never taken effect. \nSeveral peace plans have unravelled in the past decades over the issue of how to divide sovereignty or oversee holy sites in Jerusalem.
