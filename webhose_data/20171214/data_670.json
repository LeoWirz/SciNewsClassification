With friends, family, random strangers all radiating festive cheer, it\u2019s difficult not feel infected by the yuletide spirit. I mean, have you been to the Christmas Markets here in Glasgow? I\u2019m sure the Glasgow City Council finance team will have an aneurysm when that electricity bill comes in next quarter! \nI have always adored Christmas, and have spoken briefly before about how magical the season is to me, from fairy lights, to glitter, to tinsel, to parties, to gloriously indulgent feasts! \nYet, over the past few years I haven\u2019t celebrated Christmas quite as much as I did when I was living in Australia, and this is for a very simple reason: \nChristmas isn\u2019t easy when you have no family . \nThis will be my third Christmas here in Scotland, and my third Christmas without contact with my biological family. The Last Christmas in Australia (2014) \nIn Australia I was always the Christmas Party planner for both my friends and family, and always had a beautifully decorated tree up on 1 December without fail. The Christmas of 2014 was no different, except my family insisted I spend the day with them \u2013 they would take over the meal planning and the cooking, and given I was about to relocate overseas, they\u2019d make Christmas easy for me so I could focus on the move. \nUnfortunately, Christmas Day was a disaster that saw my sister and I sharing a massive bottle of Vodka whilst watching The Sound of Music as fights were fought, tantrums thrown like empty bottles of JD against the sidewalk, and a dinner consisting of over cooked chicken breast and a packet salad\u2026 \nIt was my last Christmas in Australia, my last with my family, and my enthusiasm for Christmas, my festive spirit, was thoroughly dashed. It may sound dramatic, and I admit I am prone to hyperbole every now and then, but in this case, it was in all honesty, and without drama, an absolutely thoughtless and horrible day. \nTwo weeks later I was on a plane to London, and three months later I made the decision to remove my immediate family from my life. There was theft, lies and abuse involved and after three months of continuous vile diatribe being sent in my direction I made the choice to block them on all platforms. \nAlso, they ruined Christmas and that\u2019s just unforgivable! The Loneliest Christmas (2015) \nMy first Christmas in the UK, in Scotland, I was alone \u2013 I had no family, and only one friend that lived this far north, and I was in no place to crash another family\u2019s Christmas festivities. \nI had only left London less than a month before, leaving behind a physically, emotionally and psychologically abusive boyfriend. I was still recovering both physically and mentally from his abuse. By that point the bruises had faded for the most part, the scars not so much, and the psychological scarring was still very present. \nIn 2015, Christmas was spent alone in my flat, eating tacos and binge watching Parks and Rec. \nThere were no decorations, no cards. \nThough, I did purchase one person a present \u2013 a young person who posted on Reddit that he was living in a hostel and would be alone for Christmas, and couldn\u2019t even afford noodles on Christmas day, let alone a feast most others were writing about. \nI bought him the ingredients for tacos, and a bottle of vodka. We met for the briefest of moments on Sauchiehall Street where I wished him a Merry Christmas and handed over the goods, before disappearing back into the deep, dark, Glasgow night. \nThat was my only festive cheer that year \u2013 knowing that I brought at least one person happiness was enough for me. \nOn Christmas Day itself, I did try to reach out to my father, whom I\u2019ve always appreciated, yet received only more abuse from my mother. \nI don\u2019t even know if my father saw what I had written to him. It does get easier\u2026 (2016) \nSeven months after moving to Scotland I met Ben, and a month or so later we realised we weren\u2019t just friends but something a little bit more special than that. The conversation actually went a little something like this: \nBen: You do realise this is a relationship. You can look at it any way you want, but it is a relationship. Me: *panic attack* Maia: Miaow? Me: Ok, I guess you\u2019re both right\u2026 \nA few months later it was Christmas and by that point Ben and I had only been dating for 5 months. I had only met his family once, and was still wounded by both my experiences in London, and by my own family\u2019s continued attempts to attack me. \nNot helping matters, at the time I was working 50 hour weeks, was so stressed my weight ballooned out enough to put Santa to shame, and Christmas crept up on me, with me barely even noticing it arrival. \nThere were no decorations at home, and cards were written out of societal propriety, rather than enthusiasm. \nThis would be my second Christmas away from Australia and without a family, and I won\u2019t lie and pretend I didn\u2019t spend the first half of the day in the company of my own tears whilst Ben attended Mass with the family. I had Maia for company, of course, but a cat can only do so much! \nHowever, once his family arrived it was time to get cooking and I spent most of my afternoon sipping wine, and keeping myself distracted with turkey and roast potato, salting the gravy with my tears. \nAfter all the food had been served and eaten it was time to actually participate in Christmas itself, which due to my anxiety, wasn\u2019t the most comfortable. This family unit who I had spent very little time with were laughing and enjoying each other\u2019s company \u2013 I felt like an intruder, a stranger watching their festivities from the outside in. \nYet, as the evening progressed I grew relaxed and started to enjoy myself (most likely thanks to the wine!) This is what a true family Christmas was like, something I hadn\u2019t experienced in years with my own biological family. This was a group of people who despite their differences clearly loved and cared for each other. Now, this is Family (2017) \nThis year we have a small tree in our flat (literally, a small conifer tree in a bright red pot), as well as a few Christmas prints here and there. I\u2019ve pre-ordered all the food in the world, have bought everyone presents, and this weekend I\u2019ll be writing out my Christmas cards not only to my friends, but to my business contacts as well \u2013 not because I have to, but because I want to. \nI\u2019ve already watched Love Actually once , and was only denied a second watching as I don\u2019t know the PIN to our SKY Cinema! \nChristmas Eve we (Ben, Maia and myself) will be heading to Ben\u2019s family home to ensure we all wake up on Christmas day together as a family. I won\u2019t be attending Mass this year, but I will be joining them to visit uncles and cousins, before getting my Kitchen on. \nIt is inevitable that I will feel a little bit sad and lonely on Christmas, due to everything I have been through with my own family, but, and this is a big \u201cbut\u201d \u2013 family, true family , is not biological, especially at Christmas. Finding a family for Christmas \nTrue family is who you want to spend Christmas with, the people you love and who you want to spend the most beautiful day of the year with. They may be friends, or partners, aunts, uncles, or cousins, but if you care for them and look forward to seeing their smiles on Christmas day \u2013 that\u2019s your family. \nI may be what is considered a Christmas orphan, being an immigrant and estranged from my mother, father, brother and sister Thankfully though, despite everything, I\u2019ve been adopted into a beautiful and loving family who I can\u2019t wait to spend the festive season with. \nIf you know anyone who is going to be alone this Christmas, please do invite them into your family for the day. They may say no out of pride, or may not want to \u201cintrude\u201d, but Christmas is a time for family and if you can give someone a family, if only for a day, well, what better gift to give than the gift of love?

No matter the reasoning behind your need to build muscle, there are pieces of useful advice that you can apply to your plan in the article that follows.\nTrain at least three times per week. You need at least three training sessions every week if you want to see significant muscle growth. If you are really new at weight training, this can be reduced to two at the start; however, you should increase the number of sessions per week as soon as you are able. If you already have some experience with strength training, you can add more sessions as well.\nAfter bodybuilding workout sessions, be sure to rest well. Many people fail to do this after their workouts, which can be detrimental to their building larger muscle mass. It is when you are resting that your body grows and repairs itself. If you fail to rest after muscle development workouts, or you cut the rest period short, this over training can prevent your body from becoming larger. As you can see, it is important to refrain from cutting back on rest periods that your body needs.\nMake the \u201cbig three\u201d a part of your daily workout routine. These three exercises include: the deadlift, squat and bench press. These particular exercises are known to help build bulk, strength and condition your muscles each time they are done and should be included in your routine for maximum bodybuilding success.\nFor quick muscle development, you need to push your muscles to grow. Believe it or not, if you do not push your muscles to increase in size, they won\u2019t. By using the overloading principle, you can push your muscles into growing faster. If you are not familiar with the overload principle, it means you need to work out with weights that are greater than your muscles can comfortably handle.\nIt is important to workout until you have reached muscle failure with your muscles. Many people stop working out when they begin to feel the weights getting a bit hard to lift. Containing to push until your body cannot push anymore will give you the lean, strong muscles you really want.\nSquats are perhaps the most important exercise for building muscle mass. Beyond building the leg muscles, squats are an excellent whole-body workout. They work out the arms, chest, abdominal muscles and even the back. Using a proper technique is essential with squats. For a proper squat, the hips should come lower than the knees and the body should remain balanced.\nOn the days after your workouts, it\u2019s best to rest and eat a lot of carbohydrates. This helps your body to build muscle and recover from expending energy during the workout. That way, you\u2019ll see the biggest muscle growth possible from the workout you did. Pasta, peanut butter sandwiches, and similar foods are great for this.\n\nUse visualization exercises to picture what you need to do to reach your goals. Having vague, undefined goals with no real sense of how to accomplish them is a sure road to failure. Picture yourself sticking to your workout routine and visualize what you will look like in the future. This will keep you motivated.\nSquats are perhaps the most important exercise for building muscle mass. Beyond building the leg muscles, squats are an excellent whole-body workout. They work out the arms, chest, abdominal muscles and even the back. Using a proper technique is essential with squats. For a proper squat, the hips should come lower than the knees and the body should remain balanced.\nLimit yourself to four workouts per week. Doing five or more can cause recovery issues that limit or even hinder your progress. Having three days off a week also allows for mental recovery as well as physical. You will be more enthusiastic about going to the gym on your four days.\nRest days are as important as workout days. If you are working on your muscles 7 days a week, not only will you get mentally burned out, but your body will stop responding properly. It is important to rest at least two days a week and allow your muscles to relax.\nWhen trying to increase muscle mass, snack on protein-rich foods prior to working out, and again after you finish. It\u2019s a good suggestion to consume approximately fifteen grams thirty minutes prior to training, and then do the same thing after you finish. To give an example, one to two cups of milk has 15 grams of protein.\nMake sure your deltoids are fully engaged. By having middle deltoids that are developed, your shoulders are wider and thicker. Make sure lateral raises are above the parallel point in order to get the most out of your deltoid exercises. Begin laterals several inches from the hips in order to decrease the involvement of supporting muscles, such as the supraspinatus.\nOne of the key items to drop from your routine when building muscle, is alcohol. Even though one glass of wine once in awhile is okay, do not drink more than that. Alcohol isn\u2019t good for you and can interfere with muscle growth.\nFind como emagrecer rapido em 1 semana that helps you stay motivated. Do not expect to have an entirely different body type within a few weeks: building muscles takes months, even years. You should set a list of realistic goals for yourself and learn patience. You will fail if you expect too much from your body.\nBe sure that you are warming up before each workout. If you don\u2019t warm up properly, you are at risk of injuring a muscle or tendon and ending your workouts for a long period of time. Warm up by doing some cardio exercise and lifting some light weights. Your body will thank you!\nAlways try to mix up your workouts when trying to build muscle mass. http://comicclock0alberto.canariblogs.com/easy-nutrition-tips-that-anybody-can-follow-4170303 change your routine and throw your body off course. Your body will grow much faster when you change the routine and catch it off guard. This will keep your workouts interesting, and also build muscle.\nEach part of your body needs a little tender, loving care, and your muscles are an excellent place to start.

Korea Can start when nuke tests, launches stop, China envoy says By Compiled by Democrat-Gazette staff from wire reports   3:45 a.m.Updated: December 7, 2017 at 3:45 a.m. Credit: AP/South Korean Defense Ministry A U.S. Air Force B-1B bomber (left) and South Korean and U.S. fighter jets fly over the Korean Peninsula on Wednesday as part of a joint military exercise. \nGUANGZHOU, China -- The U.S. would be ready to talk with North Korea if it renounced further nuclear or missile tests and followed through on the pledge, U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad said. \nAs South Korea and the U.S. continued a joint military exercise, meanwhile, North Korea said Wednesday that a war on the Korean Peninsula has become inevitable. \nBranstad on Wednesday told Bloomberg Television that talks could start \"if they announce that they're not going to be doing any more nuclear tests and they're not going to be launching any more missiles. If they announce that and do that, I think there's an opportunity for us to get back to the bargaining table.\" \nBranstad, speaking on the sidelines of the Fortune Global Forum in Guangzhou, also said that sanctions against North Korea were \"starting to have an impact.\" \nCalling Kim Jong Un's push for nuclear weapons \"the biggest threat to humankind right now,\" the former Iowa governor repeated the Trump administration's call for China to cut off oil sales to Kim's regime. \n\"We believe we need to go further,\" Branstad said. \"We think oil and also these North Korean workers working in China and other countries, that needs to stop.\" \nPresident Donald Trump has sought to pressure China to rein in its ally and neighbor, which last week tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile. Kim said the test showed that North Korea's nuclear program was complete because it could deliver an atomic warhead anywhere in the U.S. \nWhile Kim hasn't yet proven he has the technology to put a warhead on an ICBM and deliver it to a target, the test has put new pressure on the U.S. and its allies to find a solution. \nThe United Nations' top official for political affairs is in Pyongyang this week to discuss the nuclear issue, and countries from Canada to Germany are seeking to help facilitate talks. Branstad told the economic forum later Wednesday that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would meet with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to discuss North Korea on Dec. 19. \nMeanwhile, the saber-rattling has continued on both sides, with the U.S. sending a B-1B bomber to join aerial drills with South Korea. North Korea had previously threatened to retaliate against the exercise with the \"highest-level hard-line countermeasure in history.\" \nThe five-day drills that began Monday involve more than 200 aircraft, including six U.S. F-22 and 18 F-35 stealth fighters. \nIn comments attributed to an unnamed Foreign Ministry spokesman, North Korea also claimed that high-ranked U.S. officials, including CIA Director Mike Pompeo, have further confirmed American intent for war with a series of \"bellicose remarks.\" \nPompeo said Saturday that U.S. intelligence agencies believe Kim doesn't have a good idea about how tenuous his situation is domestically and internationally. The North's spokesman said Pompeo provoked the country by \"impudently criticizing our supreme leadership, which is the heart of our people.\" \n\"The large-scale nuclear war exercises conducted by the U.S. in succession are creating touch-and-go situation on the Korean Peninsula and series of violent war remarks coming from the U.S. high-level politicians amid such circumstances have made an outbreak of war on the Korean Peninsula an established fact. The remaining question now is: When will the war break out,\" the spokesman said. \nA provincial state newspaper on China's border with North Korea meanwhile spooked some on Wednesday by dedicating an entire page to advice for residents on how they might survive a nuclear war. \nThe advisory, by the official Jilin Daily , was picked up by many online news services and circulated widely on Chinese social media, forcing the paper and other state media outlets to hurriedly issue statements trying to calm people down. \nIt also marked one of the first times that official China has talked seriously about the threat of a nuclear war. \nInformation for this article was contributed by Peter Martin, Tom Mackenzie, Dexter Roberts and Ken Wills of Bloomberg News; by Simon Denyer, Luna Lin and Liu Yang of The Washington Post; and by Kim Tong-Hyung of The Associated Press.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mike pompeo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luna lin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rex tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim tong-hyung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dexter roberts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simon denyer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin trudeau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ken wills", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liu yang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terry branstad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom mackenzie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "branstad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pompeo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "n. korea talks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap/south korean defense ministry a u.s. air force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jilin daily", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democrat-gazette", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fortune global forum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foreign ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg television", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "n. korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guangzhou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iowa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korean peninsula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guangzhou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pyongyang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:56.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2ca282e7e008e608f0e3528bb65bb1ee798e4295", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRJk3c3FNxoWUMY6I7oMZws0xcCcDsXyAux4rmLF6Pc7smp3hsu3gSyOEg6RcS5SJmDAP3gFd6SUQgNDiz92mHG", "site_full": "askubuntu.com", "site": "askubuntu.com", "site_section": "http://askubuntu.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Ask Ubuntu", "title": "Opentype features in Libreoffice", "title_full": "Opentype features in Libreoffice", "published": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/askubuntu/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=c492c9229955", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1055, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2ca282e7e008e608f0e3528bb65bb1ee798e4295", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRJk3c3FNxoWUMY6I7oMZws0xcCcDsXyAux4rmLF6Pc7smp3hsu3gSyOEg6RcS5SJmDAP3gFd6SUQgNDiz92mHG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "neon2017", "published": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "Opentype features in Libreoffice", "text": "2 \nIs it possible to use Opentype's features like ligatures in Libreoffice? if yes, how? \nBecause as far as I know, in Ubuntu and Linux in general, these features are available only for graphite(aka smart) fonts like Linux Libertine G (a free graphite font available here ).

Babatope, in a statement he personally signed said the South-South stakeholders were being unfair to the South-West, whose turn, according to him, it was to produce the next PDP national chairman.\n\nHe also accused caretaker chairman, Ahmed Makarfi of working for Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike out of greed and ambition. Babatope said, \u201cWe (the Yoruba) will never be servile to anyone at all. And most importantly, we will never compromise on the position of the National Chairman of our great party.\n\n\u201cIt is our turn! And this much must be respected. Anything less than this is outright unacceptable. This is why Makarfi must recuse himself from the composition of all committees of the convention.\n\n\u201cMakarfi is not honest. He is working for Wike. That is the absolute truth.\n\n\u201cThe crass insistence and the insulting protestation of Governor Nyesom Wike that the South-South is the zone providing succour to the PDP is rather crude and insensitive. And it is not true. Right from the formation of the party, the Yoruba people have been consistent in their devotion and loyalty to the party. And they have been very supportive in financial fillip to the party.\n\n\u201cBut Wike is not really the one to blame. The fault solely lies with Senator Ahmed Makarfi who is blinded by personal ambition and apparent greed that could not make him think clearly and selflessly about the issue at hand.\n\n\u201cIt is Makarfi who has deliberately mangled and distorted the micro-zoning tradition of our great party which has given the PDP well over 16 years of inclusive and all embracing accommodating nature.\n\n \u201cNow the very fundamental fabric and dominating principle of the party is torn asunder. We are no longer at ease.\n\u201cThe pronouncement of the South-South Stakeholders is not only provocative, it is divisive, skewed, untidy, and a blatant slide into tribal political arrangement. Do they think the good people of Oduduwa land will just sit down and take it?

You'll want it to continue over errors, though, so you'd start it with: dd if=<usb device> of=<new file on disk with enough space> bs=<should match your blocksize> conv=noerror,sync \nThe important part is the last one: conv=sync tells dd to pad all those blocks it could read only partially with zeroes, so the resulting image may have a few zeroes too many, but will structurally equal the flaky disk, minus its read errors. conv=noerror took care of those read errors, telling dd to continue with the next block.
