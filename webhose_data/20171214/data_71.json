The countries were classified according to the Gini coefficient, a number that measures the inequality in a given country, evaluating the distribution of income of the family.

Fitness apps are not accurate in tracking your physical activity Your smartphone fitness apps can mislead you and cause weight gain! Agencies | Published: December 7, 2017 2:17 pm Tags: Fitness app Physical activity Smartphone Smartphone app \nIf you completely rely on your smartphone to monitor your physical activity, then you are probably more active than it shows, finds a recent study. According to the University of British Columbia researchers, the iPhone\u2019s built-in pedometer missed about 1,340 steps during a user\u2019s typical day when compared to a purpose-built accelerometer worn on the waist. The results suggested that for people who are already tracking their steps, they can rest assured that if their phone says they are getting the recommended 10,000 steps in a day, then they are probably getting at least that many and they are working toward better health. Lead study author Mark Duncan that in order to make accurate conclusions, the team of researchers need to know that the data is actually representative of real behaviour. \nThe team analysed 33 participants and were divided into two parts: a laboratory test and a test in regular living conditions. In the lab test, the participants carried two iPhones \u2013 a personal iPhone and a shared one provided by the lab \u2013 so researchers could see if different phone models produced different results. The findings suggested that personal iPhones underestimated steps by 9.4 percent at the slowest speed of 2.5 km/h. At faster walking speeds, the phones were off by less than five percent, which is generally considered acceptable for a pedometer.

Over three days, the iPhone underestimated the accelerometer data by an average of 21.5 percent, or 1,340 steps per day. \u201cThe accelerometer in the iPhone actually does a pretty good job when tested under lab conditions,\u201d said senior author Guy Faulkner. \u201cYou just have to have it on you at all times.\u201d The results suggest researchers should use caution when relying on smartphone data, but Duncan said the average person should not be discouraged from using health apps for motivation. From a public health point of view, it\u2019s better that it underestimates than overestimates, they concluded. The research appears in journal of Sports Sciences .

We reached the orphanage, Panti Asuhan Yatim, and Dhuafa Muhammadiyah Putra Anda, at around 7pm. It was drizzling, but once we stepped out of the car, the orphanage girls performed us a welcome dance. We were so touched by their enthusiasm and warm welcome. The secretary, Mr. Naryapandi, told us that the girls have been practicing hard since the first email sent, indicating our interests to visit the home. There are three shelters under the same group; Panti Asuhan Yatim and Dhuafa Muhammadiyah Putra Anda (Boys), Panti Asuhan Yatim and Dhuafa Putri Aisyiyah (Girls), and Panti Jompo (the elderly). We were told that the children of about 80 have gathered at the place since 2pm. By the time we arrived, there were only a few stayed, mostly girls. If we do it again, we will schedule our meeting the next morning instead. It is hard to predict airline delays and road conditions. Mr. Naryapandi told us some disheartening stories about the residents in the shelter and introduced us to the three young siblings, who lost their parents. My heart sank in the middle of the ocean, I felt a lump in my throat. I was thinking how lucky we are having our family to take care of us, and how often we take our parents and loved ones for granted. We just presumed that they will always be there, and to know that these little ones only have each other is heartbroken. Our rented motorcycles were delivered to the hotel the next morning. After breakfast, we all geared up and proceeded to the nearest place to fill our fuel. We encountered a few incidents before our long ride. Mel fell off her bike with a slight bruise, and Lynn\u2019s bike could not start after fuelling. We have to wait for a replacement. We cannot always control everything that happens to us, but we can control how we respond. The ladies were supportive of each other, the group cohesiveness was excellent. Sometimes, when we traveled in a group, not everyone is onboard with the plan. We are fortunate this time, that the group compromises and respect their similarities and differences. Some of the interesting places we visited were Kaolin Lake. This place is used to be a mining site but after stopping the mining activities, the land naturally became a beautiful and breath-taking artificial lake. Belitung island became famous after the successful award-winning movie Laskar Pelangi (Rainbow Troops) which portrays the struggling life of the island\u2019s poor children and their teachers. We went to Laskar Pelangi, the replica of the elementary school SD Muhammadiyah Laskar Pelangi where the movie was shot. We met the village children who sang us a song from the movie. We stopped by at Bendungan Pice, the legacy water gate system left by the Dutch. There are 16 gates controlling the water flow of the Sungai Linggang. Revolving around Andrea Hirata\u2019s most popular work of Laskar Pelangi, Museum Kata Andrea Hirata\u2019s display an abundance of colorful artwork and inspirations quotes. We had our snacks at the charming traditional coffee shop. We do not know much about Indonesia politics and refuse to get involved with the saga, but understands that ex-governor of Jakarta, Mr. Basuki Tjahaja Purnama or \u201cAhok\u201d, is a well-respected figure for his strong stance against corruption and his huge contributions to Jakarta. Kampong Ahok is a souvenir store that sells many merchandises with Ahok\u2019s figure on it. The fried banana fritters were yummy! Tanjung Kelayang is a beautiful white sand beach decorated by granite rock formations. It has a panoramic view of the blue sea, swaying coconut trees, low tides, and gentle tropical breeze. We had an impromptu meet up with Belitung Bikers, sharing our passion for motorcycle riding, and took some pictures together. Belitung has many small beautiful islands scattered around it. We had our picnic at Lengkuas Island and some of us climbed the lighthouse which was built in 1882. We also visited Burung Island, Babi Island and Sand Island. Not all of us have a passion for the underwater world, so we only spent a little time snorkeling off the boat. The weather was not great, and the water was choppy, so on the way back, almost all of us get very seasick. We had our last meal in Belitung at Rumah Makan Timpuk Dulu. It is a unique culinary place that serves Belitung traditional cuisine. The ambiance was great and the food tasty. Belitung island is beautiful, the lovely beaches are perfect for a picnic, and the turquoise waters are great for snorkeling, diving, and swimming. The locals are friendly, always smiling, and have a laid back and relaxed attitude. The most exciting about the trip is the bond between the group. The lady bikers from Singapore and Malaysia hit it off right away and remain good friends.

A bomb ignited the USS Arizona\u2019s magazine, starting a fire that engulfed the battleship. It quickly sank, killing 1,300 people. Marine Cpl. E. C. Nightingale was aboard the Arizona that morning. His recollections, which appear at eyewitnesstohistory.com , are posted below. \n\"At approximately eight o'clock on the morning of December 7, 1941, I was leaving the breakfast table when the ship's siren for air defense sounded. Having no anti-aircraft battle station, I paid little attention to it. Suddenly I heard an explosion. I ran to the port door leading to the quarterdeck and saw a bomb strike a barge of some sort alongside the Nevada , or in that vicinity . The marine color guard came in at this point saying we were being attacked. I could distinctly hear machine gun fire. I believe at this point our anti-aircraft battery opened up.   \n\"We stood around awaiting orders of some kind. General Quarters sounded and I started for my battle station in secondary aft. As I passed through casement nine I noted the gun was manned and being trained out. The men seemed extremely calm and collected. I reached the boat deck and our anti-aircraft guns were in full action, firing very rapidly. I was about three quarters of the way to the first platform on the mast when it seemed as though a bomb struck our quarterdeck. I could hear shrapnel or fragments whistling past me. As soon as I reached the first platform, I saw Second Lieutenant Simonson lying on his back with blood on his shirt front. I bent over him and taking him by the shoulders asked if there was anything I could do. He was dead, or so nearly so that speech was impossible. Seeing there was nothing I could do for the Lieutenant, I continued to my battle station. \n\"When I arrived in secondary aft I reported to Major Shapley that Mr. Simonson had been hit and there was nothing to be done for him. There was a lot of talking going on and I shouted for silence which came immediately. I had only been there a short time when a terrible explosion caused the ship to shake violently. I looked at the boat deck and everything seemed aflame forward of the mainmast. I reported to the Major that the ship was aflame, which was rather needless, and after looking about, the Major ordered us to leave. \n\"I was the last man to leave secondary aft because I looked around and there was no one left. I followed the Major down the port side of the tripod mast. The railings, as we ascended, were very hot and as we reached the boat deck I noted that it was torn up and burned. The bodies of the dead were thick, and badly burned men were heading for the quarterdeck, only to fall apparently dead or badly wounded. The Major and I went between No. 3 and No. 4 turret to the starboard side and found Lieutenant Commander Fuqua ordering the men over the side and assisting the wounded. He seemed exceptionally calm and the Major stopped and they talked for a moment. Charred bodies were everywhere. \n\"I made my way to the quay and started to remove my shoes when I suddenly found myself in the water. I think the concussion of a bomb threw me in. I started swimming for the pipe line which was about one hundred and fifty feet away. I was about half way when my strength gave out entirely. My clothes and shocked condition sapped my strength, and I was about to go under when Major Shapley started to swim by, and seeing my distress, grasped my shirt and told me to hang to his shoulders while he swam in. \n\"We were perhaps twenty-five feet from the pipe line when the Major's strength gave out and I saw he was floundering, so I loosened my grip on him and told him to make it alone. He stopped and grabbed me by the shirt and refused to let go. I would have drowned but for the Major. We finally reached the beach where a marine directed us to a bomb shelter, where I was given dry clothes and a place to rest.\" \n\nThe USS Arizona Memorial, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "e. c. nightingale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shapley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simonson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fuqua", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "uss arizona memorial", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pearl harbor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:12:27.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "22bb0eff8d5964e5575d0d2091c9299ce09118de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gfBslnDni2K31mi5.CwrvGI-", "site_full": "us.battle.net", "site": "battle.net", "site_section": "https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/1011638/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Story Forum - World of Warcraft Forums", "title": "The withered.", "title_full": "The withered. - World of Warcraft Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T19:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "/forums/static/images/social-thumbs/wow.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 462, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7739b6ee0125c81c8ec8855135bc8ca29fd61990", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gfBslnDni2K3P.aNs4I2j8bKEtKl4W9nAA--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Mustakraken", "published": "2017-12-07T12:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I'm curious if the fruit of the Arcan'dor can restore Withered to regular Nightborne if you feed enough to them over time.\nI know it's actually to ween regular Nightborne off of Arcwine and the energies of the Night Well, but it's bound ot have other uses.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:12:27.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f56db39724d65c84a26314e192c1fab9fd4b3969", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPEAGWA64CzHJBcur.SJcJr_XgxzHo0.PKIh1XcFxnIyDUifufnLGKCbg6fC81C7g5mpuDbhTcR074EU1CCwj13Vm5B5nWpeBr83ZqbeDdLlzjbSXyN1LiYkHK60G6jvqio.G2GYVqzo52RFkN8KGE", "site_full": "chorpolitician.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://chorpolitician.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Brazil groups look to channel voter anger into political action \u2013 chorpolitician", "title": "Brazil groups look to channel voter anger into political action", "title_full": "Brazil groups look to channel voter anger into political action", "published": "2017-12-07T11:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f56db39724d65c84a26314e192c1fab9fd4b3969", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPEAGWA64CzHJBcur.SJcJr_XgxzHo0.PKIh1XcFxnIyDUifufnLGKCbg6fC81C7g5mpuDbhTcR074EU1CCwj13Vm5B5nWpeBr83ZqbeDdLlzjbSXyN1LiYkHK60G6jvqio.G2GYVqzo52RFkN8KGE", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "chorpolitician", "published": "2017-12-07T11:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "Brazil groups look to channel voter anger into political action", "text": "SAO PAULO \u2013 Something in Brazil has snapped.

been receiving calls and emails from scam artists and people peddling risky investments \u2013 so the Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada is offering free legal help and tips to protect any money they receive from the Compassion Fund.\nIn March, the fund will begin disbursing the $16 million collected, with set amounts to go to families of the people killed and to people who were hospitalized within 48 hours of the shooting.\nTennille Pereira, a consumer attorney for the Legal Aid Center, says the recipients need to be very wary of any investment opportunities suddenly coming their way.\n\u201cPeople get phone calls or emails saying, \u2018Send me a little bit of money and I can release this fund,'\u201d she says. \u201cOr they will have people call them, sometimes friends or family: \u2018I just need some money to get me through this time\u2019 \u2013 or all sorts of investment fraud.\u201d\nTennille Pereira, a consumer attorney for the Legal Aid Center, says the recipients need to be very wary of any investment opportunities suddenly coming their way.\nPereira advises people to consult a licensed financial adviser, to put aside money for an emergency fund, and to set a budget that takes long-term needs into account, because many of the victims are going to need ongoing medical care, and families will have to support the victims\u2019 dependents.\nPereira notes that it can be difficult to decide how to handle a large payout.\n\u201cAnd sometimes it\u2019s not necessarily a fraudulent investment,\u201d she concedes. \u201cIt could be a valid business venture, but it may be incredibly risky and probably too risky for someone who\u2019s going to need that money to rely on in the future.\u201d\nThe Legal Aid Center has posted a toolkit for victims of the tragedy on their website, lacsn.org or call 702-386-1070.\nFifty-eight people died, about 500 people were injured and many more affected when a gunman opened fire on a music festival near the Mandalay Bay Hotel on October first.\nby Suzanne Potter\nPublic News Service \u2013 NV\nFor More Nevada News: elsemanarionevada.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

(Picture: dartagnans.fr) \nAll money raised goes towards restoring and preserving the castle and so far, more than \u20ac760,000 (\u00a3670,000) has been raised by 9,427 people. \nAnd more potential owners are welcome to join in. \n\u2018The idea is not just about raising the money, but getting as many people as possible to participate in saving this magical, fairytale place,\u2019 Dartagnans founder Romain Delaume tells The Guardian . \n\u2018The more the merrier\u2019. (Picture: dartagnans.fr) \nThis particular caste has never been designated as a historic landmark for some reason, so there\u2019s never been any kind of protection to stop it from being destroyed. \nThis \u2018Adopt un chateau\u2019 project, however, is putting that responsibility in the hands of the people \u2013 which is possibly the most gallic thing ever. \nOf course, these 9.5k won\u2019t all be able to go and live in the castle (that would be ridiculous) but they can visit it once it\u2019s been fully restored next year. (Picture: dartagnans.fr) \nAnd they\u2019ll have the ultimate bragging right \u2013 that they own a goddamn castle. \nViva la revolution! \n[metro-link url=\u201d http://metro.co.uk/2017/12/07/10-gluten-free-and-vegan-sweets-that-you-need-to-try-7132203/&#8221 ; title=\u201d10 gluten-free and vegan sweets that you need to try\u201d] \n[metro-link url=\u201d http://metro.co.uk/2017/12/06/what-are-the-st-nicholas-day-traditions-from-around-the-world-7136652/&#8221 ; title=\u201dWhat are the St Nicholas Day traditions from around the world?\u201d]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ch\u00e2teau de la mothe-chandeniers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "romain delaume", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:12:29.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "16dea3e5ac02d4503425cd6d280bcf5c39bd0d88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR.vBceXVEYObVuK2kFyUQAjmZCOuiE1WosWsWQQtDocxcIqcoKjZcUYq8viqzIqmNeL48HqXPL9Mxp8cCXuzzQo6rIA9GssNmHqu8XopdBvw--", "site_full": "tulsa.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://tulsa.craigslist.org/search/ppp?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist tulsa | personals search", "title": "skating ladies hit me up asap - m4w (Tulsa)", "title_full": "skating ladies hit me up asap - m4w (Tulsa)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_epSG8AV8YDG_600x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "16dea3e5ac02d4503425cd6d280bcf5c39bd0d88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR.vBceXVEYObVuK2kFyUQAjmZCOuiE1WosWsWQQtDocxcIqcoKjZcUYq8viqzIqmNeL48HqXPL9Mxp8cCXuzzQo6rIA9GssNmHqu8XopdBvw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "skating ladies hit me up asap - m4w (Tulsa)", "text": "favorite this post skating ladies hit me up asap - m4w (Tulsa) < image 1 of 1 >   Alright ladies 918 let's no time for games it's time to get a little high and fuck until we can't fuck no 954more my number is in the 7478ad and do not email me do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers post id: 6409211776", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "tulsa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:12:29.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b212874515128f8e85481e08a56aca4d1ad604f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6_8ATcbWgqoFEoFP0QO28OnjEntiYOUhnoDwjlK83dxZI4l8JMksMmaCGeBtKvc3xamkra8oVBHvA8L_tdjxPC4FVqvfA2fuqu_uLtL4oSFi", "site_full": "community.babycenter.com", "site": "babycenter.com", "site_section": "https://community.babycenter.com/sitemap/posts/d20171202.xml", "site_categories": ["pregnancy", "family_and_parenting"], "section_title": "", "title": "How do I get my son out of our room?", "title_full": "How do I get my son out of our room? - BabyCenter", "published": "2017-12-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://imageserve.babycenter.com/26/000/366/rhVpfLTQcnVP1WwWtwB0bVjvpXboTae3_sm.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 891, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2f3c0b9fea4a40978f59f0342248814462a2c3e5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6_8ATcbWgqoFEoFP0QO28OnjEntiYOUhnoDwjlK83dxZI4l8JMksMmaCGeBtKvc3xamkra8oVBHvA8L_tdjxPC4FVqvfA2fuqssTK7blO1tj", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "FMMomof4", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "He has 3 sisters. 9, 7 and almost 2.

Renate and Jim are friends of Dave and Claire\u2019s and we have met them several times through Dave and Claire. Renate is German born and had never had a birthday party; so, her very lovely husband, Jim, decided that it was high time to remedy that situation. They very kindly included Michael and me in the birthday invitation and we are so very happy and honored that they did. \nThe party was held at a Munich restaurant called K\u00e4fer-Sch\u00e4nke. What a beautiful place! We were in a private room (there were about 24 of us) and it was intimate, elegant and wonderful. \nWe were greeted by handsome waiters who kept our champagne glassed filled and our fingers full of yummy little appetizers. The meal was superb: First course of two types of smoked salmon served with dainty dollops of horseradish and caviar and some yogurty sauce; a too large bowl of a delectable butternut squash soup garnished with pumpkin seeds, pumpkin oil and a skewer of grilled chicken; a main course of saddle of veal served on a smear of celeriac pur\u00e9e and a heap of perfectly cooked winter vegetables, including the smallest Brussels sprouts I have ever seen; and, finally, a chestnut and cranberry torte with baked apple ice cream. All courses accompanied by generous and repeated pours of appropriate white and red wines. \nAs delicious as the food was, the company was even better. Many of the guests were German friends and family and we were seated in a delightful mish-mash, which allowed us the opportunity to visit with both old friends and new. It was a spectacular evening. \nThanks to Claire for her food photos.

The rules tighten controls over wealth management products, such as prohibiting financial institutions from selling investment products with guaranteed returns. \n\u201cWe see the wealth management regulatory initiative as a positive development for China\u2019s financial stability in the long run,\u201d Qiang Liao, credit analyst at S&P Global Ratings wrote in a note. \u201cThis is because the proposed rules close regulatory loopholes that allow banks to underestimate the potential capital impact of the wealth management business.\u201d \nThe collective outstanding volume of China\u2019s asset management business reached RMB116.2 trillion (US$16.9 trillion), including RMB29 trillion (US$4.4 trillion) from the banks, at the end of 2016, according to China\u2019s central bank. \nUnder the proposed rules, banks can no longer offer wealth management products with a guaranteed rate of return. The value of wealth management products with guaranteed returns has reportedly reached RMB7 trillion (US$1.1 trillion), or about a quarter of banks\u2019 total wealth management products. \n\u201cWe think this new regulation could be a game-changer. If Chinese banks are required to recognize the risk of implicit guarantees on wealth management products, they will have less incentive to issue \u2018expected-return-based\u2019 products. Moreover, if the risks are clearer and the backstops removed, customers will have less incentive to invest in these types of wealth management products, a mainstay of China\u2019s shadow banking space,\u201d wrote Liao. \nWealth management products have traditionally been handled by banks\u2019 asset management divisions. But regulators propose that banks separate out such divisions as subsidiaries which operate independently. The move is seen as another way to compel banks provide products that properly reflect the underlying institution\u2019s risks and abilities to generate returns. \n\u201cMany retail investors choose a banks\u2019 wealth management products because they buy the credit of banks. But banks\u2019 new asset management subsidies will not have the same credit as they don\u2019t have the financial muscle to guarantee the principal or rates of return,\u201d said Yin Ge, partner at Han Kun Law Offices. \nAlso, the proposed rules ban financial institutions from \u201cchanneling\u201d each other\u2019s asset management products. In the past, securities firms and trusts provided channels for banks to invest in their products, which are in effect loans that are structured to appear as holdings of investment products issued by a third party. \nIn terms of product structure, asset management products can now only invest in one layer of other products, which will prevent systematic risks. \n\u201cFor example, asset managers used to use subscription money of product A to invest in product B, and further use subscription of product B to invest in another product down the chain, expanding asset under management indirectly,\u201d said Ge. \u201cIt is difficult for investors of product A to understand the underlying assets to access their risks.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "qiang liao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yin ge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liao", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "shadow banking problem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p global ratings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "people\u2019s bank of china", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:12:31.045+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7c4a9e1f5063f12f0938ccf5f629bec8962d935b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpoUCWzGZSovIko9TxG9S.3IJnTP2mF3VHvvbAiqGbwbQ.pQOK0k08p2kAWS5MNGR2J1HGM.tS2fcD.vz_PQrvcWwUxjSo0.hxOBlUg75EUOA--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "6 Women Sue Harvey Weinstein and His Former Businesses in Proposed Class Action", "title_full": "6 Women Sue Harvey Weinstein and His Former Businesses in Proposed Class Action", "published": "2017-12-07T11:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7c4a9e1f5063f12f0938ccf5f629bec8962d935b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpoUCWzGZSovIko9TxG9S.3IJnTP2mF3VHvvbAiqGbwbQ.pQOK0k08p2kAWS5MNGR2J1HGM.tS2fcD.vz_PQrvcWwUxjSo0.hxOBlUg75EUOA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "6 Women Sue Harvey Weinstein and His Former Businesses in Proposed Class Action", "text": "6 Women Sue Harvey Weinstein and His Former Businesses in Proposed Class Action \n\n6 Women Sue Harvey Weinstein and His Former Businesses in Proposed Class Action New York Times Harvey Weinstein and His Former Businesses Sued by Six Women for Civil Racketeering PEOPLE.com 6 women sue Harvey Weinstein for alleged racketeering ABC News Imagining movies \u2013 and the world \u2013 without sexual predators The Globe and Mail Full coverage Google ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "harvey weinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weinstein", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "globe", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:12:31.050+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cc5619c413b01518776e910ee9e818872ea2d0e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_u2tlfIi70ZlEUizW5FtPWr2IB_zVHBGCCIqlT8whTJPhC9JvpPqtClpzPyxEIH3.H1UAHWjAT9Q--", "site_full": "www.calguns.net", "site": "calguns.net", "site_section": "http://www.calguns.net/calgunforum/forumdisplay.php?f=107", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Private Non-Firearms Related Sales -

According to parliamentary rules, a law cannot proceed at Holyrood until the \u201clead committee\u201d reports that it agrees the general principles of the bill.
