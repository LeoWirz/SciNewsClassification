I am admitted as a non immigrant under TN status June 2016. Got married in october and my husband submitted 1-130 based on immediate family category (spouse). The application has been received with a Priority date November 6 (when it was received). Initially was going to do consular processing but then changed my mind because I am already here and am eligible to adjust. Adjusting my status would allow me to continue to work when we eventually move if my case has not been processed yet. If we filed for consular processing, then when we move, I wouldn't be allowed to apply for a new job and work as I wouldn't be allowed to apply for a new TN visa because i have an 1-130 pending. I also likely would not be allowed back into the US as a tourist while waiting for an 1-130 (because driving through canada when we move), so I decided to adjust my status and not take that chance. Would at least be able to ged an EAD and advance parole permit.\nSo I would assume that once they get my 1-485, then my case would not be transferred to the NVC for processing and would eventually get transferred to my local office once my 1-130 get approved?

The highest number I remember in that category is 7.0 for Auburn in 2010. This time Mayfield has quite a bit more to do than Cam Newton did.\nThe entire Big 12 is a farce in pass defense, similar to 2008 with all the bogus Big 12 teams.

I also have Alabama at 14/1 to win the national championship, courtesy of the adjusted lines after the loss to Auburn. Obviously Alabama could have been locked out either via a Wisconsin win, or committee decision, but that 14/1 was such extreme value I wouldn't have regretted my wager. Several friends of mine played it also.\nThe Alabama -1 wager is a no-brainer. Any time in this era you can get that team and collect simply via them winning the game, I'll go ahead and do it. The Georgia bet is more iffy and a smaller wager because the Bulldogs were not ranked highly in preseason. In fact they were ranked below Oklahoma. So it's kind of a battle royal conflict between pass defense efficiency and preseason indications. Preseason ratings are the truth and the light in college sports. I can't imagine betting games without those amazing numbers. One of the great litmus tests in sports is opinion of preseason rankings. Nate Silver is wise enough to use preseason numbers to make his basketball NCAA tournament picks. No kidding. I've done the same for more than 20 years. Here is a link to someone who finally researched preseason ratings a couple of years ago. I have no idea why he finds the results surprising:\nhttps://www.footballstudyhall.com/2015/9/10/9295405/college-football-preseason-polls-accuracy\nI lived in Las Vegas for 25 years as a sports bettor, as I mentioned here frequently years ago when I was a semi-regular poster. Frankly the obsession with strength of schedule on this forum drove me away. Strength of schedule is an invention of idiots and applied by morons. I couldn't believe so many otherwise intelligent posters were gullible enough to be brainwashed by strength of schedule. Too bad the public doesn't set the wagering odds. Otherwise you'd actually have spreads based on who beat who, instead of the gold standard of reliable power ratings, ones that use strength of schedule only as a minor component.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.footballstudyhall.com/2015/9/10/9295405/college-football-preseason-polls-accuracy", "http://www.cfbstats.com/2017/leader/national/team/defense/split01/category02/sort04.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:58.036+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5303cbc949d523a0b1c21b04a09b9fb4b7ba34d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTIjXRLn6u6Sd4i_2YgjVD2WG4_OztnoPscoUIXtflFZP1JwTREHfDT_8h1P8hzCQEwhGHZ6TLTXeuNX0A1T5QVx5C.r7JbwOSbB3BzhgUY8jLYcNCIWVUQXMPGvtXbmJCP0kNSLm6UMDuGgNZVqKb3", "site_full": "www.aussiev8.com.au", "site": "aussiev8.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.aussiev8.com.au/bodywork-styling-wiring-sound/", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "painting", "sports", "home_video_dvd", "tech", "adult", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "scuba_diving", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bodywork, Styling, Wiring &amp; Sound", "title": "Need help!

It has a Winsor 347 stroker (roughly 4 years old) with fresh oil.\nIts been off the road for a month or so as I just finished putting in a new Performance Automatic reverse manual C4 and a high stall (3500rpm) TCE torque converter. New trans cooler and obviously trans oil, coolant etc.\nWent for a test drive yesterday. First 10 minutes of the drive were great, engine and gearbox very sweet and car very quick.\nOnce warmed up I went for a very hard run to really test it out and possible I may have over-revved. I had a quick glance at my Autometer tach (to which I stupidly had not yet set a rev limit on) and think I saw about 6000-6500rpm (which should be safe?).\nNext set of lights horrible sounds coming from under car - it actually sounding like fluid bubbling and boiling to me so I limped the 2 minutes home at very low revs. When I popped the hood the drive belt (it has a gilmer drive) was completely off as the alternator bracket had come loose so I thought that was the sound. Tightened it up and this video is how it sounds.\nhttps://youtu.be/q5BHXIKc9I4\nI can't tell where the strange sound is coming from - whether it is engine or torque converter as it seems to be coming from everywhere at once. I tried listening with a screwdriver and the right hand side head is very loud compared to the left. But then you get under the car and it sounds even louder like its coming from the bottom rear of the engine or the bellhousing.\nI took off the inspection plate in the bellhousing and no loose bits of metal in there, bolts to the torque converter and flexplate all still tight. I've drained the oil and can't see any metal shards or anything.

They seem to have a terrible slow processing time. I originally filed for consular processing, but have changed my mind and am submitting AOS today. Anyway, once my AOS is received what processing time lines do I look at. The Nebraska service center? Or my local Field office? My local office shows their processing times as pretty fast. So does my application eventually get sent from the nebraska service center, and is the whole thing (i130 and I 485) then send to my field office? Any idea how fast my application gets sent to my field office? Does my I-130 have to be approved before the rest gets sent to the field office? From what some one told me who also is in my area, once its at my local office it should be pretty quick, but how long does it take to get there?

GBV in the ASM sector deserves special attention. This statement is a summary of profound and compelling cases of GBV linked with ASGM and a call to action to different stakeholders, relevant government institution, corporates, media, development agencies and male counterparts in the ASGM sector.\n1. Overlapping mining claims, double or multiple claim allocation increases women vulnerabilities to violence. The lack of a computerised mining title management system coupled with corrupt practices of Ministry of Mines and Mining Development officials and mainly male investors causes arbitrary displacement of women from gold claims. First In First Assessed principle not respected when it comes to women on claims with proven resources \n2. Corruption by the police officers creates conditions were interpersonal violence frequently occurs in the ASGM sector as the police receive bribes and openly harass rightful women claim owners and their workers to hound them off their operations. This wanton disregard of the right to property (mining claims), is a perverse form of human rights violation against women in this sector. \n3. The long delays in settling claim ownership disputes, which delays are often-times unnecessary, by the Ministry of Mines and the courts are a form of Gender Based Violence as they result in women suffering due to loss of livelihoods for them and their dependents mainly children who need school fees, food and clothing. These institutions of the state are equally actors in perpetrating structural gender based violence against women in the ASGM sector. \n4. Women miners frequently face sexual and physical harassment from the male dominated labour-force who threaten to gang-rape them if they are not paid their expected share of proceeds regardless of gold output and expenses. \n5. Illegal arrests and detention of women in ASGM by mostly male police officers on alleged crimes linked with ASGM make women vulnerable to sextortion. Men often possess financial muscle to bribe their way out of police custody but women in ASGM often do not have similar resources. The police often charge the women with the crime of Illegal possession of gold and when the women produce their mining licences the police change the charge to failure to produce register yet they do not ask for the registers upon arrest. Unrealistic regulations such as the Gold Trade Act which criminalised gold possession creates an enabling environment for the police to seek bribes and forced sex from women artisanal and small-scale miners. Women hurt the most from compliance risks due to high levels of poverty impeding their ability to acquire costly mining claims. \n6. Violence caused by machete wielding gangs is making ASGM unsafe for women miners. Corrupt police officers are not arresting known gang leaders because of bribes. \n7. During administration of deceased estates, where the estate involves a rich gold claim and where the likely beneficiary is a woman, the probability of them being dispossessed of the claim is very high compared to when it is a male beneficiary. This dispossession is coupled with emotional and physical harassment. The impunity for such violence against women points to structural tolerance and causes aggravation of violence against women facing such situations in ASGM. \nMining is one of the key economic sectors of the country and will be one of the sectors to contribute to the economic recovery of our country. The Constitution and the Broad-Based Women\u2019s Economic Empowerment Framework call for gender equality and equal participation of men and women in key economic sectors. Gender Based Violence in ASGM is a way of excluding women from participating in this key economic sector. The state must stop being an aggressor of violence against women in ASGM by putting in place computerized mining title management and purging the Ministry of Mines and ZRP of corrupt elements. The government must sanitize the operating context for artisanal miners, ridding ASGM of violent machete wielding gangs.

Derek Thomas, Helston\u2019s MP, has been asked to look into whether the act can be repealed so that the money no longer has such restrictions. \nIf achieved, it would free up the \u00a3106,000 - the proportion of the \u00a3159,000 left once fees had been deducted - to be spent on any project in the town. \nTown clerk Chris Dawson told the Packet: \"Anybody that looks at it will realise it's an archaic act that was to get people into industry training, so you would hope in this day and age, where training is readily available, you don't need any act of parliament to build a technical college; really it is outdated now.\" \nHe said Mr Thomas had written to communities and local government minister Sajid Javid to begin the the process of attempting to remove the act, but the council had been warned it \"could take some time for a response.\" \nThe issue was raised again recently when the town council reviewed its \u201cstrategic plan,\u201d which looks at the different projects it hopes to achieve between 2016 and 2021, along with how they should be prioritised. \nAmong the list is the sale money, which the council wants to \u201cinvest [the] capital receipt with a view to purchasing land to conform with the Technical and Institutions Act 1892.\u201d \nThis has already been marked as \u201chigh\u201d on the agenda, but councillor Dave Potter said he would like to see it \u201cbecome a priority\u201d \u2013 with or without the act being lifted. \nHe said: \u201cI would like to see it become an agenda item. I understand the money has been in place for a number of years now. \n\u201cWe all know how long it can take to repeal acts. We may need to look at [a project] within the area boundaries of that [act].\u201d \nIt was agreed that the council\u2019s policy, finance and resources committee should carry out at more detailed discussion at its next meeting, before bringing back a revised list to the full council. \nThe remaining proportion of the sale price that could be freely distributed, \u00a353,000, has already been awarded by the council to the Epworth Hall, to provide disabled access. \nContracts were exchanged for 3 Penrose Road in July 2012, after Helston Town Council agreed to rescind the existing contract made with John Stansbury at auction the previous November 4, as he had failed to complete the sale even with an extension of time. \nThe building was bought jointly by Sir Nicholas Serota and Teresa Gleadowe of Porthallow, with Karen Townshend, of Kestle Barton near Manaccan, matched the previous auction price and then transferred the building into the control of a new trust they set up, the Cornubian Arts and Science Trust (CAST). \nIt was the third attempt that the trio had made to buy the building, having put in a \u00a3100,000 pre-auction bid the previous year under the name Cornwall Arts Centre Trust, which was rejected, and then bidding at the auction before the price went beyond their limit. \nHelston Town Council first suggested selling the building back in 2008, prompting 400 protestors to gather. It closed as a community centre at the end of February 2011.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "derek thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris dawson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave potter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karen townshend", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "passmore edwards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sajid javid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "teresa gleadowe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kestle barton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john stansbury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicholas serota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helston", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "penrose road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helston town council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cornwall arts centre trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cornubian arts and science trust", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "penrose road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epworth hall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manaccan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "porthallow", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:59.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "faac462f8253cf168cd15592df1bcc43c53c671a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_kWTFmHec1c6myXrZSSWfZ4hFm4Jq1ot2szZP3sKiDwxnSPpWHUNiRS4OiaAqGpJOEPWepQrAA6_71dnaFR3jw3n1HGA2lioNYujlrRFiDaQfhmZjES_hGIk.Ljyooe_KjKS_SyMoNLUhe_vri1R_E", "site_full": "www.visajourney.com", "site": "visajourney.com", "site_section": "http://www.visajourney.com/forums/forum/130-adjustment-of-status-from-work-student-amp-tourist-visas/", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "immigration"], "section_title": "Adjustment of Status from Work, Student, &amp; Tourist Visas - VisaJourney", "title": "I don't understand how the applications are processed, timelines etc", "title_full": "I don't understand how the applications are processed, timelines etc - Adjustment of Status from Work, Student, & Tourist Visas - VisaJourney", "published": "2017-12-07T07:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://static.visajourney.com/images/uploads/monthly_2017_04/visajourney-logo-social-media.jpg.6e6b1b83deab742607adb9d8628f8e88.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27019, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8d3a8e9c9e2ef6cd5fa529ba61a55d2508a908be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_kWTFmHec1c6myXrZSSWfZ4hFm4Jq1ot2szZP3sKiDwxnSPpWHUNiRS4OiaAqGpJOEPWepQrAA6_71dnaFR3jw3n1HGA2lioNYujlrRFiDaQfhmZjES_hGIk.Ljyooe_KjKS_SyMoNLSCRptK8apnqkuoVBusf2Ag-", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "aleful", "published": "2017-12-07T11:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "no,\nyou should have sent the adjustment of status with the copy of the i130 so they link the case and they don't send it to the nvc , they won't send it back, plus if you didn't send it with a copy of the i130, they'll return the package because there is no approvable i130 in the package", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:59.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0fb1cef3da77fb1c878fd3937fe3f2d83bf41fe6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJpIKC16qphebO71efzjghbK4e1YMmydAqWDOwrWwDjSK383_het1W3tX6qQ8p8X_jMs3zwHiZnqMjeoyIXsr4dw61653Z3ZkBXbHBA75wV7yFCTVKEFDzs7g9l_bbPCU5HqEG_ayNvmw-", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Holiday-Decorations-Christmas-Decorations/N-5yc1vZcgxo/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "Home Accents Holiday 72 in.

But, of course, sometimes this requires a little push. It\u2019s not always a given that the man you\u2019re dating will think of you when you\u2019re away from each other; thus, you have to make him miss you.\nSo, how do you do this? How do you make him miss you so much that it improves the foundation of your relationship? How do you make him miss you so much that he wants to commit? It starts with recognizing what you\u2019re really asking.\nIf you\u2019re trying to learn how to make a man miss you, odds are high that you\u2019re really trying to become a priority in his life. You want him to long for you \u2014 sure, who doesn\u2019t want that? \u2014 but you also want him to spend more time paying attention to you and cultivating your union.\nThere are many ways you can go about achieving this desired effect, but 3 things are proven to work. And it all begins with being a safe place for him to rest his head.\nTo know how to make him miss you, you need to do these 3 things:\n1. Be his sanctuary.\nIf you were to take a class entitled \u201cHow To Make A Guy Miss You\u201d, your first quiz would be on the concept of sanctuary.\nMany men, including the ones you\u2019re likely attracted to, care deeply about their careers; they\u2019re driven by success and wealth. This can be a good thing, but it\u2019s also a stressful way to live.\nThat\u2019s why being a safe place is so appealing: a man is attracted to lightness, relaxation, and connection. After a hard day at the office, he wants to go somewhere that\u2019s the opposite.\nOffering yourself as a sanctuary has other benefits too. For one thing, many men feel as though they need to recharge so they can return to the rat race the next day. By giving him the ability to do that, you increase his confidence and vigor. Men like that \u2014 really, everyone does.\nWhat this looks like is up to you \u2014 a massage, a nice dinner, a funny movie, or maybe just an ear for him to air his troubles.\n2. Focus on the connection rather than the commitment.\nAnother way to get a man to miss you is to focus on your connection above all else. Focusing on the commitment first is like putting the cart in front of the horse.\nWhat does this focus look like? It looks like getting out the proverbial cement and strengthening the connection between the two of you before you start to worry about wedding bells. Doing the opposite doesn\u2019t put a man at ease \u2014 it makes him feel pressured and unsafe.\nIn truth, it shouldn\u2019t be hard to focus on the connection \u2014 it is that intimacy that is the driving force behind any relationship. And once that intimacy is established, the commitment falls into place.\nThink about it like this: If you\u2019re a woman trying to get your guy to commit, you\u2019ve already lost the game a little bit. If you\u2019re trying to force the commitment, you\u2019ve already upset the natural polarity of allowing him to lead and allowing your relationship to play out in due time.\nStarving the connection until some sort of commitment is in place is futile: it\u2019s not fair to expect people to commit to something when they aren\u2019t yet sure if there is a connection.\n3. Give him your trust.\nThe third way to get a man to miss you is to give him something he desperately covets: your trust!\nWhen a man knows that you trust him, he knows that you are presenting him with a precious gift: the chance to be seen clearly by you. When you allow a man to lead, to plan, to handle your heart, he will want to be around you. And, when he\u2019s not, he\u2019ll miss you.\nNow, it\u2019s important to note that trusting an untrustworthy guy is never recommended. If you\u2019re with someone who has betrayed your trust over and over or lied repeatedly, there is really no reason to give him chance after chance.\nBut you should ask yourself this: why are you with someone untrustworthy in the first place? A man worthy of trust is the type of man worthy of you.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:59.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "22cfbc2673ed02029b07b9d6c5aa6c2116411784", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRK6nwTTWpROAwLf4hVZCVozFO9j42iag0-", "site_full": "ernohannink.nl", "site": "ernohannink.nl", "site_section": "http://ernohannink.nl/podcast/feed", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "Podcast \u2013 Erno Hannink", "title": "Van lastige start in 2017 naar 1 miljoen omzet \u2013 Doug McIsaac", "title_full": "Van lastige start in 2017 naar 1 miljoen omzet \u2013 Doug McIsaac", "published": "2017-12-07T07:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://ernohannink.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/141Doug_McIsaac.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "22cfbc2673ed02029b07b9d6c5aa6c2116411784", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRK6nwTTWpROAwLf4hVZCVozFO9j42iag0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Erno Hannink", "published": "2017-12-07T07:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "Van lastige start in 2017 naar 1 miljoen omzet \u2013 Doug McIsaac", "text": "Het verhaal http://dougmcisaac.com/1078/my-duh-moment-its-amazing-when-you-get-out-of-your-own-way/ \nTranscriptie \nErno: Welcome Doug. You stood out to me on LinkedIn because of a story you wrote. The story was about your business over the past time. How you developed and implemented a lead generation strategey, which added a lot of customers. That is why I asked you. What was this strategy? \nDoug: I provide a variety of service around lead generation for consultants and software companies. I\u2019ve been in marketing for 30 years. Digital marketing become more popular during this time. I love the oppurtunities available. I built an agency and sold it to another company, after that, I was trying to decide what to do with my life. \nErno: Do you still use direct mail? You talked about that in the story. \nDoug: Occasionally. I used it for a local print shop which yieled a 39% respond rate and we won a award for our campaign. We spent about 14.000 and generated at least 300.000. \nErno: There are not many campaigns that do the same. \nDoug: No not at all, I ususally don\u2019t even use it myself. Adverstising only is starting to catch up, cost wise. You need to get better in things besides ads, but also get better in the ad space. I use ads but my core is LinkedIn. \nErno: 3 years ago, you sold the company. Why did you get out? It was a good running company. \nDoug: I was doing everything, after transitioning into another agency, we took on clients that just were not the right fit. There were clients who did not want to implement everything and second guessed our plans. They would re-write campaings. It did not work. I was ready to move on. I was working on starting a software company, which went sideways. I dove back into lead generation using LinkedIn for clients. \nErno: How do you use LinkedIn? \nDoug: There are several campaings. The core are LinkedIn messaging campaings and cold e-mail campaings. LinkedIn messaging campaings first identifies the customer. Then we will target that person by rewriting the profile. Most profiles are written as a resume. We don\u2019t want that, we want a salespages. People need to understand why you are better and how they can work with you. For example, I generate leads for B2B consultants and software companies using LinkedIn. We added cold e-mail 2 months ago. Get the profile done, then it is about building your network. I have been testing some stuff out here. \nErno: What are you testing out? Are you doing updates? \nDoug: It is updates. I built an outline with some marketeers. Post generally follow this outline. They tested thousends of posts and find out what makes a post go viral. Pulse is LinkedIn\u2019s publicing platform. It differs from an update by being meant for educating. It is meant for sharing information and is used in ranking for SEO. The updates are designed for connecting with your audience. Half the traffic is on your phone. That is why these updates are getting a lot more traffic. These updates need to be readable. LinkeIn has prioritized a long form update for most engagement. The second is a long form text, followed by text with image. 4th is video, which might go into third. After that comes the publicing platform followed by links and 3rd party video, linke Youtube. The reason is that LinkedIn wants you to stay in LinkedIn, here are their ads. Bill Gates believed that the LinkedIn news feed was going to be as famous as the Facebook news feed. Stuff the keeps people on the website, has priority. \nErno: That is so smart. \nDoug: Historically, LinedIn has not been relying on ad revenue. Most of their money comes from monthly fees for recruiters and recruiter ads. Their advertising platform was not robust. Ads make up 99% of Facebook\u2019s revenue. LinkedIn wanted to amp this up. They wanted to use items that kept you on the site. Only Google wants you to leave the website. That is their goal. \nErno: So then you post these updates for you clienst? \nDoug: We are starting to. I always test stuff myself first. We do messaging campaings for most of our clients. We re-write the profile, find the target and start connecting. We send out a 1000 and hope to get 300 back. We set up a messaging sequence. We do not sell hard in the \u201dthank you\u201d message. It worked before but it is a numbers game. We share content with them, stuff that these people will be interest in. We make sure that these messages are well done. We can also write content, leverage 3rd party content for authority. After this, we can request a meeting. It is a whole sequence of messaging. \nErno: What is your conversion percentage on a conversation? \nDoug: 1 to 5 people a week, it depends on the industry. 1 client of mine had 8 conversations a week and 1 contract per month, a six figure number. Another client is getting closes of a 1000 dollars each. His customer value is about 36.000, that is a large profit. We work with a variety of clients and industries, it differs. Some work better than others. An update strategy will usually work better for a broader audience. The connection strategy works better when the audience is easily identifiable. \nErno: Right, you also mentioned cold e-mailing, is that also on LinkedIn? \nDoug: No, sometimes you reach a point where you have hit every person in the profile on LinkedIn, there are only so much profiles. There are more people than that available. That is why we do cold e-mail, we are not spamming at all. We make sure that they are the right type of client, with the right title. Then we start the sequence. It is not agressive, we just want to chat. The book \u201cPredictive Revenue\u201d enforces this. This is the core of many companies, B2B. If you are extending services that help a company save time and money, then it is not spam. Not everybody will buy it, but the chance will increase if you send it to the right person. \nErno: Getting back to the original question, what did you do to get informants to this new goal? \nDoug: It wasn\u2019t looking good. Shocking, I did a LinkedIn messaging campaign and cold e-mail. I did what I sell, before I did not do it. My business had dropped because I was focussing on 1 client. I needed to start implementing lead generation for myself. It was obvious, but I had gotten used to people reaching out to me. It was not consistent, you can not grow a business based on word to mouth. You need a consitent lead generation flow. I implemented these campaigns for myself. I now average 5 tot 6 lead calls per week and close 2 clients a week. It is just a matter of implementing. I am going to build an agency just around lead generation.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "doug mcisaac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linkedin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doug", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill gates", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:59.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8ba424184ded8dc5447109f79218fc871ff4beeb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSyTlJo9Od1ONIVb4Q_5TwSqLxiNOfxCuuXuf_BW3ApY_HBsiFEPEHJFV_fJJisph8Zx6QRaliXFVYkEs7furMVkt.5F_ArAlkIQuaZ.bBUjVqiXnTBUAi1g--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/movies", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Movie News and Discussion", "title": "Dexter Fletcher Replaces Bryan Singer as Director of 'Bohemian Rhapsody'", "title_full": "Dexter Fletcher Replaces Bryan Singer as Director of 'Bohemian Rhapsody' : movies", "published": "2017-12-07T04:13:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 68, "participants_count": 68, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.5, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1995c2723efd998c1a660f8c818ec2576693d062", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSyTlJo9Od1ONIVb4Q_5TwSqLxiNOfxCuuXuf_BW3ApY_HBsiFEPEHJFV_fJJisph8Zx6QRaliXFVYkEs7furMVkt.5F_ArAlkIQuaZ.bBUjX4ymdZQ7ohVGmps16sDaYSKrEK7arF.jY-", "ord_in_thread": 64, "author": "NeoNoireWerewolf", "published": "2017-12-07T11:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Fletcher probably isn\u2019t too worried about credit; he jumped in to save this ship and get production back on track, so he likely was able get a sweet back end deal where Fox will finance a modestly budgeted passion project of his.

This time, it's the \"Great American Songbook\", a bunch of songs mostly from musicals of an era. Michael Feinstein is presenting the spotlight. He's probably a great choice for this: the couple of times I've seen him on TCM he's clearly had a passion for the movies, and with his career in that sort of music, he probably knows the material well. I distinctly recall when he was a Guest Programmer he actually played the piano that was a prop in Robert Osborne's set. (I always wondered whether they had to bring in a working piano. I figured having to move a working piano every time they put up or struck the set would be too much work.) Anyhow, as an example of the sort of music we're talking about, there's Hollywood Hotel overnight tonight at 2:15 AM. This is the movie that introduced \"Hooray for Hollywood\". The following feature, Dames at 4:30 AM, gave us \"I Only Have Eyes for You\". In between, at 4:15 AM, there's a short featuring Harry Warren, a songwriter performing a couple of his songs, including \"42nd Street\". The movie 42nd Street will be in the spotlight on the 21st, as well as part of the daytime lineup on December 16. One movie that doesn't seem to be part of the spotlight is Roberta , which if I'm not mistaken is the one that gave us \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\".

Anita Blay , AKA CockNBullKid ( Cleopatra ) has also seen success as a solo artist in the UK. Burnett and Blay formed Antony & Cleopatra together in 2014, marking a new and exciting chapter in their careers. \nThe duo is currently in Australia and will be performing a headlining show on December 13th at Bondi\u2019s Beach Road Hotel. \nTwitch is the second official single to be lifted from their full-length debut album which is expected to drop in 2018. \nAntony & Cleopatra\u2019s \u2018Songs for Late Nights\u2019 Playlist: \nSoho \u2013 Hot Music \nAnita : This song was originally released in 1990 but when I first heard it, I couldn\u2019t tell if it had been made decades ago or weeks ago. I\u2019m always impressed by how timeless it sounds considering a jazz loop dominates the entire song. It\u2019s like nothing you\u2019ve heard before [with] a really cool use of the Karen Young \u2013 Hot For You vocal sample. Burial \u2013 Archangel \nA&A : This song reminds us of cold nights in London. Catching the night bus home alone. Arca \u2013 Saunter \nA&A : Such a beautiful track with layers and sharp turns. Listen to this and you\u2019re very likely to fall into an altered state. Little Dragon \u2013 Pretty Girls \nAnita : Yukimi\u2019s voice is one of my favourites to listen to. She soundtracks most of my evenings. This is a perfect late night jam. Leon Vynehall \u2013 Time \nAlexander : What I love most about this is the way it builds but there\u2019s never any payoff. It\u2019s the perfect comedown track. We love Leon as he always does Dance with subtlety and sophistication. Rae Sremmurd \u2013 Swang \nAnita : I think this was one the best songs released this year. There are some real cool orchestral motifs and interesting hooks in this. And weirdly melancholic.Swae Lee\u2019s falsetto vocals on the pre-chorus always make me feel a little emotional whenever I hear them. Massive Attack \u2013 Blue Lines \nAlexander : When we first started Antony and Cleopatra, we bonded over our love of Soul To Soul, The KLF and Massive Attack.One of our early releases Sirens was very much inspired by this track. Madonna \u2013 Justify My Love \nAnita : Pretty self-explanatory why this is the ultimate late night track. Justify My Love was also the inspiration for an early A&C track we eventually ditched after feeling it wasn\u2019t right. Then our producer reworked it into an extended, weird techno banger which we now use to open our live shows with. So we owe everything to Madonna, really.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cleopatra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte daraio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rae sremmurd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexander", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burnett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexander burnett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anita", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yukimi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leon vynehall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swang  anita", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madonna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karen young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anita blay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blay", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "klf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antony & cleopatra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "archangel  a&a", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sparkadia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "soho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bondi\u2019s beach road hotel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:59.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb01481ac28970af1ed2d84abc1cc25b85743a65", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhq6SKsx4lXFwV2cpxf1UI5jorip1NvAhd0X6J.1p25mkcCiynxVVPRBBu9kCPAOAHFQ--", "site_full": "www.thestudentroom.co.uk", "site": "thestudentroom.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/forumdisplay.php?f=828", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "International Postgraduate Study - The Student Room", "title": "Postgraduate Students - Has living been a struggle?", "title_full": "Postgraduate Students - Has living been a struggle? - The Student Room", "published": "2017-12-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//static.thestudentroom.co.uk/5a252fde38287/forum/images/base/logo-facebook.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7797, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "55f1259245a362e1c6b347d717fe4b269dc20075", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhq6SKsx4lXFwV2cpxf1UI5jorip1NvAhd0X6J.1p25mkcCiynxVVPRBAerhgmGhSsZTD8vcU2J0eL", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "worldender", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Re: Postgraduate Students - Has living been a struggle?\n OK now I've managed to get some PhD funding, but last year wasn't great. 10K PG loan plus a tuition fee scholarship, I was comfortable but often quite hard-up in one of the cheaper towns in the UK, and worked to supplement my income.

I just had a thought about VCO/DCO's that I haven't been able to google satisfactory. I guess there is nothing novel and that this idea has either been implemented or rejected, but I'm noob and suck at googling No really, I just want to ask here since I have got so great answers before Anyway, I've been getting the feeling that it's a bit of a mess with temperature stability of analog VCO's in the expo converter. So I searched the webs about doing just that digitally and found the term DCO. So the idea there is to have a high freq (many MHz) clock that you subdivide to the asked freq and use this as the pulse for resetting the timing cap. However, the wikipedia article then go on: \"For a given capacitor charging current, the amplitude of the output waveform will decrease linearly with frequency. In musical terms, this means a waveform an octave higher in pitch is of half the amplitude.\" Sure, of course. Then: \"In order to produce a constant amplitude over the full range of the oscillator, some compensation scheme must be employed. This is often done by controlling the charging current from the same microprocessor that controls the counter reset value.\" If I understand, that is whan the Juno does: https://electricdruid.net/roland-juno-dcos/ But that sounds like we're actually going a little bit too digital here and that it might take the analog \"umphf\" away in some fashion. So what I wonder is this, why not just use a normal expo too but tune it a bit low so that the digital reset always trumps it, but that the analog expo follows the digital hard sync pretty closely? This will push the tuning/stability problems of an analog vco into amplitude space instead of freq and would be pretty negligible? Also, fun fact that its actually cheaper for me to buy say an Arduino Nano and a cheap 12-bit ADC than a tempco resistor. Weirds times Should I try on a breadboard or is it a bad idea?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:00.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b6ceac3dd97a29288eb1d229c4d0cd2adb1d917b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvJBaK8OIft38fKWqiXmETEPpJwb0UkK3H67Nz8ly7KnX4hWbtxTnWMzJ_1NIWgXTHlnEOOPkk4KxPLKCyjh8VRS2sDMoDnFyZ22s5XfUjtELP7IJ_.evvYrvdv02_AeAJ2T9Nxt7WmVFkCdQEiZtXq_iI3DMu2ha.Nw79vqjaMU0-", "site_full": "www.4-traders.com", "site": "4-traders.com", "site_section": "http://www.4-traders.com/rss/FeedNews.php", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Stock market news - Company News  - 4-Traders.com", "title": "Graft-buster Zhou Liang named vice chairman of china's banking regulator", "title_full": "Graft-buster Zhou Liang named vice chairman of china's banking regulator", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27554, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c09cb7bbcef7eda6e69772ae2037ac26474e1b43", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvJBaK8OIft38fKWqiXmETEPpJwb0UkK3H67Nz8ly7KnX4hWbtxTnWMzJ_1NIWgXTHlnEOOPkk4KxPLKCyjh8VRS2sDMoDnFyZ22s5XfUjtELP7IJ_.evvYil45elPYVn2", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "www.4-traders.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Graft-buster Zhou Liang named vice chairman of china's banking regulator", "text": "Zhou Liang, 46, has been appointed as a vice chairman of China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC), according to a brief statement released on the regulator's website on Thursday.

J. Scott Applewhite AP Photo Lawmaker says GOP has the votes to avert government shutdown By ALAN FRAM Associated Press December 07, 2017 11:49 AM UPDATED 2 MINUTES AGO WASHINGTON \nOne of the House's conservative leaders indicated Thursday that Republicans have the votes needed to approve legislation preventing a weekend partial government shutdown. \nWith Senate passage also considered likely, the remarks by Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., seemed to erase any doubt that Congress would approve legislation keeping federal agencies afloat through Dec. 22. Their money runs out at midnight Friday without approval of fresh funding. \nBut hours before President Donald Trump was to bargain with congressional leaders at the White House over long-term budget decisions, Meadows, who heads the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, says the group would oppose any agreement they feel allows excessive federal spending. \n\"I want to avoid a headline that says President Trump's administration just passes the highest spending levels in U.S. history,\" Meadows told two reporters. \"There will be zero support on numbers that are too high, regardless of anybody's position on that.\"   SUBSCRIBE NOW \nMeadows said House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., told him Republicans have the votes they'll need to approve the short-term spending measure Thursday. Freedom Caucus members will likely give leaders whatever votes they need to pass the legislation, Meadows said. \nMany conservatives had been threatening to oppose the measure. Meadows says they'll help it pass to avoid distractions from the GOP drive to push their $1.5 trillion tax bill through Congress this month. \nHe also says House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., promised he'd fight in coming weeks to pass a full-year budget for the military and leave fights with Democrats over domestic spending for later. It is unclear how that strategy would work, since Republicans control the Senate 52-48 and will need at least eight Democratic votes to pass any spending legislation. \nIn another brewing battle, Meadows said conservatives would strongly oppose any spending bill with provisions extending protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children. Trump ended safeguards against deportation three months ago, but Democrats are demanding their revival and Trump has expressed openness to restoring them. \nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters Thursday that lawmakers \"will not leave here\" without approval of language helping those immigrants. \nThe prospects for successful White House talks were buffeted Wednesday when the impulsive Trump blurted to reporters that a shutdown \"could happen.\" He blamed Democrats, saying they want \"illegal immigrants pouring into our country, bringing with them crime, tremendous amounts of crime.\" \nLast week, an unexpected attack by Trump on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Pelosi prompted the two to skip a bargaining session that was planned then. \nThis time, the White House smoothed the waters by following up with a more peaceable, written statement. It praised Pelosi and Schumer for choosing to \"put their responsibility to the American people above partisanship\" and said Trump was anticipating productive talks between \"leaders who put their differences aside.\" \nLater, the White House issued another statement indicating Trump would sign the two-week spending extension. It also laid out administration budget goals, saying money for the military, including missile defense and security along the border with Mexico, \"must be prioritized in a long-term funding agreement.\" \nFor Republicans, a shutdown would put a humiliating bookend on a year in which they've controlled the White House and Congress with little to show for it. But they seem on track for a major win by sending their tax measure to Trump, they hope by Christmas. \nThe two-week spending bill also makes money available to several states that are running out of funds for the Children's Health Insurance Program. That widely popular program provides medical care to more than 8 million children. \nWhile many Democrats seemed likely to oppose the short-term bill, enough were expected to support it in the Senate to allow its passage there. They know they'd still have leverage on subsequent bills needed to keep the government running. \nDemocrats have been using their leverage to insist on spending boosts for health care, infrastructure and other domestic programs that would match increases Republicans want for defense.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul ryan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "steve scalise", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "chuck schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. scott applewhite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark meadows", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin mccarthy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mobile & apps from", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "freedom caucus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump on house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap photo congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house freedom caucus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan fram associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "children's health insurance program", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "r-wis.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-la.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-n.y.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:01.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c04bb5b1c4c7d7453d69ec141230f527f0fcfc60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jfOSxOSD0TdHm0tD_R.eodxsfwObpK2cTncrPgVE1zQCNLwbV7p7nI1r3IV4yF1IFD3hWSyOAJsbh25FuEOqPGZ", "site_full": "ceiprodamilans2009.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://ceiprodamilans2009.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "3r A", "title": "Christmas song", "title_full": "Christmas song", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "AD", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c04bb5b1c4c7d7453d69ec141230f527f0fcfc60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jfOSxOSD0TdHm0tD_R.eodxsfwObpK2cTncrPgVE1zQCNLwbV7p7nI1r3IV4yF1IFD3hWSyOAJsbh25FuEOqPGZ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CEIP Rodamilans.

Since several years the mybet Group operates a successful B2B sports betting offering in Ghana in cooperation with a local partner. Already more than 120 mybet branded land-based betting shops are in operation in Ghana. This business is one of the main reasons for the growth achieved in mybet Group's group segment B2B. Now the local partner expands his offering in cooperation with mybet: Henceforth customers from Ghana are able to bet on sports results online at www.mybet.com. \n'Due to a rapid growth the mybet brand used by our partner has become one of the market leaders in sports betting in the country. Now we want to expand on this success together with our partner. From our perspective there is currently no online sports betting offering in Ghana that is able to compete with the quality and safety of mybet. Therefore we are convinced that the mybet brand can reach market leadership in Ghana in the mid-term,' said Markus Peuler, CEO of mybet Holding SE. \nThe Management Board is expecting the online business to have a significant positive effect on the economic development of the group segment B2B within a few months only. Thus, in addition to the B2B activities in Austria already started in August, mybet Group's very profitable group segment B2B gains another growth driver. \nmybet Holding SE \nThe mybet Group, licensed in several European countries to offer sports betting and online casino games, has its registered office in Berlin and locations in Cologne and Malta. mybet offers its betting and gaming products over the internet platform mybet.com as well as at land-based betting shops operating under a franchise system. In addition, the group supplies regional betting providers in Europe and Africa as a B2B service provider.\nmybet Holding SE is the parent company of the mybet Group. The shares of mybet Holding SE (ISIN DE000A0JRU67) are listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in the Prime Standard.\nFor further information, visit www.mybet-se.com | www.mybet.com | www.mybet-shop.com \nContact \nmybet Holding SE\nSebastian Bucher\nInvestor & Public Relations \ntel +49 30 22 90 83 161\nfax +49 30 22 90 83 150\ne-mail [email protected] \n07.12.2017 Dissemination of a Corporate News, transmitted by DGAP - a service of EQS Group AG.\nThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement. \nThe DGAP Distribution Services include Regulatory Announcements, Financial/Corporate News and Press Releases.\nArchive at www.dgap.de\n\nmybet Holding SE published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 09:16:04 UTC . \nOriginal document https://mybet-se.com/en/pressemitteilung/?story=1077 \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/A29636486A34290CFEC65E72DE37D12505018D41", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mybet ho", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "markus peuler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "frankfurt stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "se sebastian bucher investor & public relations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eqs group ag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dgap distribution services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "regulatory announcements", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "management board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prime standard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dgap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mybet group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ghana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ghana  berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cologne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malta", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:01.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "979f1af4f6939db5c5f5c37ba5182fd2882fd873", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf5.vv7qYYB5XIbZrf5u9XF5qD41PgmptocePR6Kh7sQIyv26T1H025xnNkTVd6RKE0AQRNfS_KdRA--", "site_full": "www.expedia.se", "site": "expedia.se", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.se/Alla-Hotell-I-Toronto.d178314.Reseguide-Stad-Alla-Hotell", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Alla hotell i Toronto", "title": "Quality Inn Airport West", "title_full": "Quality Inn Airport West (Toronto, Kanada) | Expedia.se", "published": "2017-08-17T23:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 96941, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "324f18ae85ae5c3e4056bcd3363125616cde868b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf5.vv7qYYB5XIbZrf5u9XF5qD41PgmptocePR6Kh7sQIyv26T1H025xnNkTVd6RKE1bMpT1tvu4cOE651jW3SiRpmNUBWu7UX9nSPujZxKX9w--", "ord_in_thread": 15, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-29T19:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "We booked a king size bed room.

It will probably start at 15:00 GMT and end at 00:00 GMT but we can extend the timing if there are enough people signing up. Stream ops please respond if you're able to help switch and what time range you are available. No really, it would be nice to have some more people to help with switching duties. As always, if you are interested in performing, please copy/paste this Sign-Up template and post in this thread: 1. Preferred Start Time (Please use GMT/Military Time): 2. Set Length (30 or 60 minutes): 3. Artist Name (For displaying on the poster): 4. Chat Name (if different from artist/forum name): 5. Location (City/State/Country - Optional): 6. Description (Style/Genre/Equipment, etc. - Optional): 7. Website Address: 8. Anything else you like to mention: For reference, this clock could be useful: F irst Time Streamers Please Read: Please review the Electro Music Copyright Policy Please note: \"Preferred Start Time\". We will do the best that we can to accommodate people to their requested times. However, please be flexible because this event will have European and American musicians in many different time zones. Time slots will be on a semi-\"first come-first served\" basis. Furthermore, please post your time in GMT. The handy clock should make it simple. However, we do use military/24 hour time. It will undoubtedly be an international event and GMT is the only way to coordinate such events. As in the past, the chat room will serve as an invaluable communication tool for set up, streaming, and connecting to those listening....and it's just a lot of silly fun! I suggest participants get familiar with it in advance, if you aren't already. If you want a recording of your set, it would be prudent to record your own set, rather than depend on others. Accidents and mistakes happen...especially in this format. There are many ways to record your set, either thru the stream app or record your stream from your mixer on the signal path to the computer. Performers MUST stream at 128 kbps, 44.1 kHz , stereo. more info about broadcasting on radio.electro-music.com can be found here . It is IMPERATIVE that everyone test their connections before we start streaming. At least 24 hours before but sooner is preferred. Sorry, but we can not guarantee that musicians will be allowed to stream if you do not test 24 hours before hand. Not only does it delay the schedule, but causes unneeded stress on performer, server operator, and audience during performance time. Join the chat room for testing and help setting up. banner_01.jpg Description: banner 01 Filesize: 53.81 KB Viewed: 9 Time(s) This image has been reduced to fit the page.

Sometimes he goes down without it because he spits it out when hes in a deep sleep before going down.\nAs for the cot. There's no way it'll fit in our room. Weve already tried moving furniture around. Which is why we bought a travel cot. I'll be putting him in his own room in the new year.\nWith the bouncy chair. I've tried this lots of times as it's something I've read on your other posts. He just sits running at me. I'm quite happy with getting him down for naps though and am accepting of his 30 min stretch!\nLast night was slightly better. He had his formula at around 10.45. In his travel cot for 11 and got up again just before 2. He stayed in bed with me for the rest of the night.

They have no definitive place outside of their relationship to the spaces you are coming from and going to.

Schools not in session, empty museums, being awake when other people are asleep - all these things and spaces feel weird because our brain is like \u201cI already have a context for this space and this is not it so it must be dangerous.\u201d Our rational understanding can sometimes override that immediate \u201cdanger\u201d impulse but we\u2019re still left with a feeling of wariness and unease. \nListen I am very passionate about liminal spaces they are fascinating stuff or perhaps I am merely a nerd. \nI, for one, appreciate your passion for liminal spaces and thank you for explaining it to the rest of us.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:02.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b3935b8f4a928e4925c0b83ef61fd748c8b02ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.CtWGBCQ5SYfyGpKoy2hG2X2sAAS0pd8i92We1mHtMvqkuP0huJ6w.8gTsMKu3fiQ-", "site_full": "www.mumsnet.com", "site": "mumsnet.com", "site_section": "http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/sleep", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Sleep | Mumsnet Discussion ", "title": "So tired.", "title_full": "So tired. | Mumsnet Discussion", "published": "2017-12-06T14:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "/images/logo/mn-logo-square.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6762, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f92fb7a63207807c55790da4177901cf86da9cf0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.CtWGBCQ5SYfyGpKoy2hG2X2sAAS0pd8i92We1mHtMvqkuP0huJ6w.hAsJ7JTeV1n22PxbsYBPaPrCs6nzBXFd", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "Nosleepforthewicked", "published": "2017-12-07T17:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Oh my god chosen!

VHEs develops and commercialises technologies that make it possible for industries to turn their waste heat into usable energy. The transaction with Viking Heat Engines was made possible by the support of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI). EFSI is the central pillar of the Investment Plan for Europe , under which the EIB Group and the European Commission aim to act as strategic partners to boost the competitiveness of the European economy. \nAmbroise Fayolle, Vice-President of the EIB responsible for Germany, commented: 'Today, more than 50 per cent of the world's energy generated is wasted as heat*, making this an extremely attractive renewable energy source. The development and dissemination of VHEs' technology contributes significantly to energy efficiency and the circular economy - two areas, which are of utmost importance for the EU bank.' \n'Supporting VHEs is also a perfect demonstration of the real benefits that the EU bank, with the support of the Juncker Plan, can provide to start-ups. Innovative small companies like VHEs are the basis for future growth and jobs in Europe. We, at the EIB, are therefore very keen to accompany these start-ups on their way into industrialization,' he added. \nMaro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, European Commission Vice-President for the Energy Union, said: 'EFSI has already mobilised hundreds of billions of euros, investing in innovative projects and concrete solutions. Viking Heat Engines is a perfect example of a project which is smart, sustainable, profitable, and above all, disruptive: instead of energy going to waste, it turns waste into energy.' \nHelge Valeur, COO and CFO at Viking Heat Engines, underlined: 'The EU is leaning forward and taking a stance in supporting what may be extremely important technologies for reducing C02 emissions in the future. The fact that EIB is supporting us is a fantastic proof of how far we have come and that we have a promising future ahead.' \n*Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the US Department of Energy \nEIB - European Investment Bank published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 09:16:04 UTC . \nOriginal document http://www.eib.org/infocentre/press/releases/all/2017/2017-355-investment-plan-for-europe-eib-grants-financing-to-viking-heat-engines.htm \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/580256C5E2980EB183651FCD9DA724023185315A", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ambroise fayolle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helge valeur", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "european investment bank", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eib", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eib group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lawrence livermore national laboratory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us department of energy  eib - european investment bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "efsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "energy union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:02.034+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4a703e72dbaa5c1f9dfcd30e698a80d1903c620b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRLq3JluWhMk5AGjNRtLw5vh3fwYaX7TJb4udgIdyq5_HaLOhOAgYWAb9kd7QC5N_MR_nRgI.6eJb3PQncaZRIqq8jLhckEpWw-", "site_full": "kloterklubniederanven.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://kloterklubniederanven.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Hangboard training \u2013 KloterKlub Niederanven", "title": "Hangboard training", "title_full": "Hangboard training", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4a703e72dbaa5c1f9dfcd30e698a80d1903c620b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRLq3JluWhMk5AGjNRtLw5vh3fwYaX7TJb4udgIdyq5_HaLOhOAgYWAb9kd7QC5N_MR_nRgI.6eJb3PQncaZRIqq8jLhckEpWw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ingmar Schumacher", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "Hangboard training", "text": "There is some scientific literature that looks at the optimal way to train finger strength on a hangboard.

We present the man behind the racing driver in this two-part interview. In Part 1, Maro talks about... \n... his first laps in a kart: 'Nico and me used to really enjoy, messing around in mini go-karts' ... growing up in the Principality: 'My parents moved to Monaco when I was three' ... the period in between his time in the DTM: 'I owe a lot to the customer racing programme and Mercedes-AMG' Maro, how did you first get into motor racing? \nMaro Engel: I grew up with Nico [Rosberg] as most fans probably already know. We went to kindergarten together and soon got along very well, as we were the only German children there. So, we became friends very quickly and also used to play together in our spare time. At some point, Keke [Rosberg] said to my dad, 'Do you know what, I'm going to get Nico a go-kart for his birthday. How about getting Maro one? Then the boys can spend time down at the track, and we can enjoy our holidays.' Fortunately, my dad answered: ' Yeah, why not?' And that's how it all started. \nWhat happened subsequently? \nMaro Engel: After that, we used to have fun, messing around in the mini karts. We then took them back home to Monaco, where I would practise with Nico at weekends. Our parents eventually started up a kart team together, and we contested our first races with the team at around ten years of age. We then went our separate ways from a racing point of view. I competed in junior kart races in Germany and Nico in Italy. \nHow did you come to grow up in Monaco? \nMaro Engel: My parents moved to Monaco when I was three. My father was a fashion designer and even launched his own brands later on. He met Prince Albert at an event somewhere along the line, and he suggested to my dad that he should move headquarters to Monaco. My mother and my wife kept one of the brands going, but my dad bailed out when they split up. He now lives in Brazil. \nYou just mentioned your wife, Steffi, to whom you recently got married. That must have been the highlight of your year? \nMaro Engel: Yes, absolutely, our wedding was beautiful. Everything was amazing that day. We got the bright blue sky we'd always dreamed of and found it really fantastic, far more beautiful than we could ever have imagined. It was a very special day. \nBut you couldn't get married without involving motor racing, could you? \nMaro Engel: It was a totally amazing experience. We were blown away when the team told us we could use a Mercedes-AMG C 63 DTM as our wedding car. Steffi said straightaway that we definitely had to go for it given half a chance. She thought the idea was brilliant! It was an amazing feeling, driving away from the church down the narrow road through the small fishing village and out along the coast with my wife in a DTM car. Neither of us could stop smiling. It was absolutely fabulous! \nYou got involved with Mercedes AMG's customer racing programme after your first spell in the DTM. What did you learn along the way? \nMaro Engel: It was an opportunity for me personally after my first four seasons in the DTM. I owe a lot to the Customer Sport programme and Mercedes-AMG. It's why I'm still a keen competitor in the big GT races. I really enjoy them. But of course, the idea that I hadn't quite finished with the DTM was always lurking at the back of my mind. I was well up for another chance and intended to grab it. I worked hard towards that goal and got the chance to line up again this year on the same basis as my team-mates. \nDaimler AG published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 09:16:04 UTC . \nOriginal document http://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Maro-Engel-I-hadnt-quite-finished-with-the-DTM.xhtml?oid=32241044&ls=L2VuL2luc3RhbmNlL2tvLnhodG1sP29pZD00ODM2MjU4JnJlbElkPTYwODI5JmZyb21PaWQ9NDgzNjI1OCZib3JkZXJzPXRydWUmcmVzdWx0SW5mb1R5cGVJZD00MDYyNiZ2aWV3VHlwZT10aHVtYnM!&rs=0 \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/F3CF31FA50394E2DAA74DBDF26D681B534A4311E", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "maro engel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "steffi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keke [rosberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nico [rosberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albert", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mercedes amg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "customer sport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dtm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daimler ag", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "monaco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:03.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "645239a9a1a98c540b18369a018fc94f291576a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSbLRGzw23J9gV5Vb_XBtq2HBn9O6NX3sWQPL1YqGL8SkcHb48auqk.pRJSZlP6aYe5310B2oHzYA--", "site_full": "www.speakertv.com", "site": "speakertv.com", "site_section": "http://speakertv.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["music", "entertainment"], "section_title": "speakertv", "title": "Sia @ AAMI Park, Melbourne", "title_full": "Sia @ AAMI Park, Melbourne", "published": "2017-12-07T01:38:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.speakertv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/379A4136.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "645239a9a1a98c540b18369a018fc94f291576a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSbLRGzw23J9gV5Vb_XBtq2HBn9O6NX3sWQPL1YqGL8SkcHb48auqk.pRJSZlP6aYe5310B2oHzYA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "David Reece", "published": "2017-12-07T01:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "Sia @ AAMI Park, Melbourne", "text": "Read more Join the Speaker TV team.

The technology shift, with live OTT as a key driver, is the perfect enabler to start developing new creative concepts that will reach a new and more engaged audience. New challenges can never be solved by old processes. To do what you have always done, is not an option. It's time to stretch our minds. Work together. Think big and think different. \nHistory is full of companies that refused to change and made it into a sport to sleepwalk through decades of rapid change. \nIn my mind there has never been a more exciting time to be in the media and broadcasting business. Being able to offer technology that brings people together and creates communities, with a shared experience, is a true pleasure. Being able to offer new revenue streams for the media industry, which have struggled for years, is a bonus. These are the questions you need to ask yourself; \nHow can we use technology to broaden our audience? How can we use technology to increase the audiences' loyalty? How can we integrate our digital strategy cross functional in every touch point? How can we make more money and attract new partners? We are convinced that technology will continue to set the scene, transform business models and drive change years to come. It will also challenge the way we think and do business. \nNet Insight AB published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 09:16:04 UTC . \nOriginal document https://netinsight.net/2017/12/07/executive-predictions-for-2018/ \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/2C6A65FDBD94F59FC02B3E06C578C0F438BE7291", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fredrik tumeg\u00e5rd", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ott", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "insight ab", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:03.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "14b74925d8b6361a51d99ea559f0b07520f93798", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvv3H8zcns_WZliZHVjrhdDbfJ4v0IePbvCewUyX6MSshIroc0_4rzg4Kik.AXkw24hfa2BTllKcYJ8ygd2ptD1FAuw9OcWN_lRSLl8aOhzlP.b9ldF2OA_dEUlNJ.DJZ1bIVmLHnnOgufbS9ygNhH2FYs7WG__JY0rkY_G3oInbXF_oOfTyQx2z38l0Ow1A5_YXqeaph6QBz4-", "site_full": "www.4-traders.com", "site": "4-traders.com", "site_section": "http://www.4-traders.com/rss/FeedNews.php", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Stock market news - Company News  - 4-Traders.com", "title": "Disclosure Of Interest/ Changes In Interest Of Substantial Shareholder(s)/ Unitholder(s) :: Changes In Interest Of Substantial Unitholder - Gs Investment Strategies, LLC", "title_full": "Disclosure Of Interest/ Changes In Interest Of Substantial Shareholder(s)/ Unitholder(s) :: Changes In Interest Of Substantial Unitholder - Gs Investment Strategies, LLC", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27554, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b6071dd7719313f7b13b872128ab8c93152a5a83", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvv3H8zcns_WZliZHVjrhdDbfJ4v0IePbvCewUyX6MSshIroc0_4rzg4Kik.AXkw24hfa2BTllKcYJ8ygd2ptD1FAuw9OcWN_lRSLl8aOhzlP.b9ldF2OA_dEUlNJ.DJZ1bIVmLHnnOgudSg4v9.afiCg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "www.4-traders.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Disclosure Of Interest/ Changes In Interest Of Substantial Shareholder(s)/ Unitholder(s) :: Changes In Interest Of Substantial Unitholder - Gs Investment Strategies, LLC", "text": "Announcement Title Disclosure of Interest/ Changes in Interest of Substantial Shareholder(s)/ Unitholder(s) Date & Time of Broadcast Dec 7, 2017 17:10 Status New Announcement Sub Title Changes in Interest of Substantial Unitholder - GS Investment Strategies, LLC Announcement Reference SG171207OTHRSO80 Submitted By (Co./ Ind.

Michael Balsamo, File AP Photo FILE - In this Oct. 22, 2017, file photo, FBI Director Christopher Wray speaks at the International Association of Chiefs of Police annual conference in Philadelphia. Wray is facing a tough test four months into his leadership of the FBI. He must defend the agency against blistering attacks from President Donald Trump without putting his own job at risk. Michael Balsamo, File AP Photo FBI director defends his agency against Trump's attacks By SADIE GURMAN and ERIC TUCKER Associated Press December 07, 2017 12:51 PM UPDATED 5 MINUTES AGO WASHINGTON \nCountering strident attacks on his agency from the president who appointed him, FBI Director Chris Wray on Thursday defended the tens of thousands of people who work with him and declared, \"There is no finer institution, and no finer people, than the men and women who work there and are its very beating heart.\" \nWray provided his first public defense of the nation's premier law enforcement agency since a weekend of Twitter attacks by President Donald Trump, who called the FBI a biased institution whose reputation is \"in Tatters \u2014 worst in History!\" and urged Wray to \"clean house.\" \nThe outburst from the president followed a guilty plea from his former national security adviser for lying to the FBI and the revelation that an agent had been removed from a special team investigating the Trump campaign because of text messages seen as potentially anti-Trump. \nWray, who served as a top Justice Department official under President George W. Bush and was nominated as FBI director by Trump, faced a wave of Republican criticism over perceived political bias in special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of possible Trump campaign ties to Russia during the 2016 presidential election and in the handling a year earlier of an FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server that ended without criminal charges.

SUBSCRIBE NOW \nAlthough he did not mention Trump's criticism directly, Wray rebutted him directly, saying, \"My experience has been that our reputation is quite good.\" \nWray sought to fend off the attacks on the agency by expressing pride in the agents, analysts and other personnel who he said were working to protect Americans. But he also conceded that agents do make mistakes and said there are processes in place to hold them accountable. \n\"There is no shortage of opinions out there, but what I can tell you is that the FBI that I see is tens of thousands of agents and analysts and staff working their tails off to keep Americans safe,\" Wray said of the agency he has led for just four months. \"The FBI that I see is tens of thousands of brave men and women working as hard as they can to keep people they will never know safe from harm.\" \nThe focus on the Clinton and Trump probes reflected how the FBI in the last two years has found itself entangled in American politics, with investigations focused on the Democratic presidential nominee and the Republican president and his successful campaign. Those investigations have transformed routine oversight hearings, like the one Thursday, into platforms for tense questions about the political leanings of an agency that prides itself on being removed from partisan consideration. \nWray's defense of the FBI came after the committee's chairman, Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said he was concerned by reports that Peter Strzok, a veteran counterintelligence agent involved in the Clinton investigation, was removed from Mueller's team last summer following the discovery of text messages seen as potentially anti-Trump. \n\"It is absolutely unacceptable for FBI employees to permit their own political predilections to contaminate any investigation,\" Goodlatte said. \"Even the appearance of impropriety will devastate the FBI's reputation.\" \nRep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, top Democrat on the House Judiciary panel, predicted Trump's attacks on the FBI will only grow louder as Mueller continues investigating. \"Your responsibility is not only to defend the bureau but to push back against the president when he is so clearly wrong, both on the facts and as a matter of principle,\" Nadler told Wray. \nWray's tenure as the new FBI chief would be difficult even without the intense scrutiny of the Russia investigation. Since he was sworn in on Aug. 2, the U.S. has experienced two of the deadliest shootings in its modern history and a terror attack on a bike path in Manhattan. \nTrump's weekend tweets created a fresh dilemma for Wray. With his bosses, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Sessions' deputy, Rod Rosenstein, staying publicly silent, it fell to Wray to defend the agency. But FBI directors traditionally have been low-key and stoic \u2014 with Wray's predecessor, James Comey, a notable exception. \nAnd Trump's firing of Comey while he led the Russia probe shows what can happen to a director who antagonizes the president. \nWray repeatedly deflected questions about the FBI's handling of the Clinton investigation, saying the entire matter was under review by the Justice Department's inspector general.

Produced water is usually generated in large quantities. Currently, there is no separation between oil management and produced water in terms of administrative divisions. There are, however, multiple stages within oil management that cater to the management of produced water. The primary aim of any oil management body is to minimize the amount of water produced in order to reduce the volume of water that is lifted and pumped and consequently reduce the volume of water being treated and disposed. Most conventional oil production scenarios witness an exponential proportion between the amount of oil extracted and the volume of water produced. Unconventional oil production methods show an inverse proportion between oil and water.

Overview of the Global Produced Water Treatment Market The global produced water treatment market is currently expected to grow at a steady rate. One of the major drivers of the global produced water treatment market is the increase in the rate of exploration of on-shore and off-shore oil and gas resources. Extraction procedures have scaled up in terms of number of installations as well as production volume, further propelled by a growing demand for oil and gas on a global level. The global produced water treatment market also benefits from the growing prevalence of fracking, or land gas drilling through the use of hydraulic fracturing. As the production rates of the oil industry increase, so will the demand from the global produced water treatment market. The market is also propelled by the constantly reducing supply of usable water in developing countries such as India and China, thereby increasing the demand for better water treatment solutions. View Sample PDF @ https://www.marketresearchreports.biz/reports/759848/produced-water-treatment-systems-market-research-reports.pdf The market is, however, restrained by the high installation costs and operation costs. Most top players in the oil and gas industry are concerned about the scaling of water treatment processes with their growing production of oil. They have also expressed concern regarding the high maintenance costs of operating large-scale water treatment equipment. Regional analysis of the global produced water treatment market reveals North America to have led in the recent past, owing to an increase in oil exploration and tightening government regulations over the release of treated and polluted water in larger water bodies. Companies Mentioned in the Research Report The key players in the global produced water treatment market are Siemens, Veolia, Cetco Energy Services, Baker Hughes Inc., Schlumberger, FMC Technologies, Ovivo, Halliburton, GE Water, and Enviro-Tech Systems.

(December 6, 2017) - Eversource has completed construction of the Merrimack Valley Reliability Project (MVRP), a top priority to strengthen the energy system in response to forecasted load growth. In partnership with National Grid, the energy company began construction of the 345 kV transmission line between Londonderry, New Hampshire and Tewksbury, Massachusetts in the fall of 2016 and will put the new transmission line into service this month.\n'The completion of Merrimack Valley Reliability project construction is a significant achievement that will help answer an urgent need identified by the regional grid operator to enhance reliable service for energy customers throughout the region,' said Eversource New Hampshire President Bill Quinlan. 'In addition to being completed under budget and on schedule, the project successfully created hundreds of jobs for New Hampshire workers and injected millions of dollars into the local economy.'\nThe MVRP runs along existing utility rights-of-way, with approximately 18 miles through Londonderry, Hudson, Windham, and Pelham in New Hampshire and approximately 6.5 miles through Dracut, Andover, and Tewksbury in Massachusetts, for a total length of approximately 24.5 miles. Eversource worked closely with Londonderry and Hudson officials and property owners every step of the way, fulfilling all commitments to mitigate impacts from the project as promised, and maintaining constant communication with residents and local officials throughout construction.\n'Eversource made every effort to work with property owners and I appreciated the company's responsiveness throughout construction,' said Londonderry State Rep. Doug Thomas. 'It's good to know that the work was completed professionally, carefully, safely, and in an efficient and quality manner. I am confident that the integrity of this project is in excellent hands and that this project will serve its purpose of helping to maintain the reliability of the New England energy grid for many years to come.'\nEversource and National Grid jointly invested a total of nearly $129 million in New Hampshire and Massachusetts to bolster the regional infrastructure. Project construction included many local workers, including Michels Corporation, lineworkers from IBEW Local 104 and a core group of New Hampshire-based management and companies, including: U.S. Silt & Site Supply, Bow; Redimix Companies Inc., Manchester; New England Mat Company, Winchester; and, Busby Construction, Atkinson. ES Boulos Company utilized lineworkers, electricians and laborers from New Hampshire Local Unions 104, 490 and 976 to complete substation construction, as well as New Hampshire based crane services, suppliers and material distributors.\n'The Merrimack Valley Reliability project is a great example of the positive impact a transmission project can have on local economies by creating local jobs and by energizing local businesses,' Quinlan added.
