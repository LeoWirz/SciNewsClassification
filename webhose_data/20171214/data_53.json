But that's not the whole story.\nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently.\nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare.\nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge.\nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills.\n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\"\nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day.\n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings.\n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose.\nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries.\nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage.\nIn other findings:\n\u2014 Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage.\n\u2014 Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare.\n\u2014 Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare.\nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story.\n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\"\nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage.\nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network.\nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers.\n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\"\nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said.\nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs.\n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said.\nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C.\nFor the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point. For Medicaid recipients, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vickie rose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan witters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kavita patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "witters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt salo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national association of medicaid directors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicaid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mid-delta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stuttgart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ark.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clarendon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:30.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9a73dbd9ec0b134ce2005e908b7ed1a1d657105c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSOcyADcVrmXIf1Io9ZnM6IoUTUhDRzhIHuOa6YQvUz18vsptdYBS2Vxt9RgK.qT4g-", "site_full": "www.multihousingnews.com", "site": "multihousingnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.multihousingnews.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "MultiHousing News", "title": "The To-Do List", "title_full": "The To-Do List", "published": "2017-12-07T10:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://media.atre.yardi.com/1/63577/images/P_Rosta.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9a73dbd9ec0b134ce2005e908b7ed1a1d657105c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSOcyADcVrmXIf1Io9ZnM6IoUTUhDRzhIHuOa6YQvUz18vsptdYBS2Vxt9RgK.qT4g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "The To-Do List", "text": "Subscribe to MHN \nExecutive Editor Paul Rosta \nThis year I\u2019m determined to get a jump on my New Year\u2019s resolutions, so to get in the right mindset, I thought I\u2019d try a little warm-up exercise. For starters, I\u2019ll offer a few 2018 resolutions for the multifamily sector. It\u2019s a rather presumptuous exercise, even in an editorial, so maybe I\u2019d better dial it back a notch and call it a to-do list instead. \nWith that caveat, here are a few items you might wish to consider. \nStay engaged. No matter your sector, geographic location or company size, something is happening on the policy front today that is affecting your business. These issues can crop up at any level of government and take the form of lawmaking, judicial decisions or regulations. Whatever the specifics, the rule of thumb is that policy is not a spectator sport. Make sure your voice is heard, whether as an individual, through an industry organization or, preferably, both. \nBe prepared. Thousands of multifamily communities felt the wrath of floods, hurricane winds or fires this year. If your company, residents and clients were lucky enough to escape unscathed, count your blessings and then make plans for a top-to-bottom review of your emergency preparation and response strategy. Watch for the in-depth report coming early next year in the CPE-MHN Guide to 2018. \nStay connected. As my younger colleagues can tell you, I\u2019m the last person on our team who should be lecturing others about staying on top of the latest developments in the digital world. But given the rapid pace of change, the competitive necessity of well-applied technology and the real estate industry\u2019s reputation as a slow adopter, a friendly reminder is in order. \nRaise the bar. If the past few months are any indication, American society is starting a long-overdue reckoning with how women are treated in the workplace. Considering the centrality of this concern to every industry, it seems impossible to overlook in this short list. If you haven\u2019t done so lately, make it clear that harassment will not be tolerated in your shop. If your company lacks a safe, confidential and fair policy to handle problems, get to work on one today. \nAnd speaking specifically to the gentlemen, let\u2019s be reliable allies with our female colleagues on this issue\u2014and resolve to earn the privilege of being considered gentlemen, every day. In fact, how\u2019s this for a rule of thumb: Never treat a female colleague in a way that you\u2019d be embarrassed to tell your grandmother about later. Workplace harassment is a vexed issue, all right, but some parts of the answer really don\u2019t seem all that hard to figure out. \nOriginally appearing in the December 2017 issue of MHN.

Capital One Multifamily Finance provided the 15-year fixed-rate Freddie Mac loan. Meridian worked on behalf of the borrower, Legacy Real Estate Development. \nThe 24-building property, located at 18880 Marsh Lane, features one- and two-bedroom apartments ranging from 609 to 1,042 square feet. Community amenities include a clubhouse, swimming pool, spa, laundry facilities and 400 parking spaces.

There is a random distribution between wins and losses for any given set of variables that define an edge. 4. An edge is nothing more than an indication of a higher probability of one thing happening over another. 5.

Neurologic involvement in these conditions is generally thought to be limited to cognitive delay and entrapment neuropathies (primarily carpal tunnel syndrome). We sought to evaluate peripheral nerves in this condition using nerve ultrasound.\nMethods We performed peripheral nerve ultrasound in two siblings with genetically confirmed mucolipidosis type 3 (alpha/beta).\nResults Peripheral nerves in mucolipidosis type 3 (alpha/beta) exhibit multifocal enlargement.\nConclusion The peripheral nerve ultrasound has a role in the evaluation of this, and possibly other lysosomal storage disorders.\n\n\nfrom Imaging via alkiviadis.1961 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2Agub0L", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "neurolo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:30.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1d9cf4d5f8c59e5c5170dd72dcbf1adfb74f3963", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjfHKemPNi8uGMn0W7n3CGiCMZggPFqKPhz7f_bMdl.WlgQ5F7eiq86K2XB479FxE0aXXIxYNwi7yLHRgyTuHCu7_mXu_Lx7ix_GAX4Ta52A9uT.JE38BX5gp8ZRLHvQ-", "site_full": "www.alamaula.com", "site": "alamaula.com", "site_section": "https://www.alamaula.com/s-otros-empleos/v1c47p1", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Otros Empleos en Argentina | Clasificados alaMaula ", "title": "SE NECESITA COSTURERA | Avellaneda 130808396", "title_full": "SE NECESITA COSTURERA | Avellaneda | alaMaula | 130808396", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.31, "main_image": "https://securelatam.classistatic.com/1.1.452/images/es_AR/logoOpenGraph.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 11990, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1d9cf4d5f8c59e5c5170dd72dcbf1adfb74f3963", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjfHKemPNi8uGMn0W7n3CGiCMZggPFqKPhz7f_bMdl.WlgQ5F7eiq86K2XB479FxE0aXXIxYNwi7yLHRgyTuHCu7_mXu_Lx7ix_GAX4Ta52A9uT.JE38BX5gp8ZRLHvQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "alamaula.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "SE NECESITA COSTURERA | Avellaneda 130808396", "text": "SE NECESITA COSTURERA - SE NECESITA COSTURERA PARA TRABAJAR EN TALLER INTERNO AVELLANEDA LUNES A VIERNES TRABAJO SENCILLO ARMADO DE BOMBACHAS DE NENA SEPA OVERLOCK Y RECTA PAGO SEMANAL", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:30.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cf44cd7d397203e632d6c2eaa438b096d2e1db18", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSCNLOI102eCJdzmNcrCsCD28iUKRwE8x4._u4Dfw3uc8fm62kW62Wm28vpdPYAbZscegyenwtNENZtxBweXxG4DQba5AjmcDQhbOzYq7ZEwQ--", "site_full": "www.olx.ba", "site": "olx.ba", "site_section": "http://www.olx.ba/rss", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "OLX.ba artikli", "title": "LG SPIRIT DUAL SIM DUOS GOLD *NOVO-ZAPAKIRANO*", "title_full": "LG SPIRIT DUAL SIM DUOS GOLD *NOVO-ZAPAKIRANO*", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "BA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s6.pik.ba/galerija/2016-05/16/09/slika-684264-573a1c9bae308-default.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6838, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cf44cd7d397203e632d6c2eaa438b096d2e1db18", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSCNLOI102eCJdzmNcrCsCD28iUKRwE8x4._u4Dfw3uc8fm62kW62Wm28vpdPYAbZscegyenwtNENZtxBweXxG4DQba5AjmcDQhbOzYq7ZEwQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "LG SPIRIT DUAL SIM DUOS GOLD *NOVO-ZAPAKIRANO*", "text": "-SVE BOJE -GARANCIJA -PLA\u0106ANJE NA RATE -ZAMJENA DA- 063-033-333 Detaljni opis **Prodaju se LG SPIRIT DUAL SIM DUOS mobiteli** **NOVI, ZAPAKIRANI, NE KORI\u0160TENI** **BIJELA, CRNA i GOLD/ZLATNA BOJA** **ORIGINALNA FULL-FULL OPREMA** **TVORNI\u010cKI OTKLJU\u010cANI NA SVE MRE\u017dE** \nMO\u017dE I RAZNA VRSTA ZAMJENE UZ NA\u0160U ILI VA\u0160U NADOPLATU SVEJEDNO!

It's all having an impact on the state's bottom line. \nRyan Hansen is at his booth at the cannabis business expo answering questions and making contacts. He and his business partners created Liberty Defense Group, a security company, after medical marijuana passed in Arkansas. \n\"We want to be on the ground floor of an emerging industry,\" Hansen said. \nThe business model the former Marines has, is something a bit different. They are hiring veterans and want to provide them with opportunities. More from this section \n\"We not only want to break into the cannabis industry as far as security goes, but we want to have a transitional place for veterans to come back and join our company,\" Hansen said. \nThey are just one of several vendors at the trade show held at the Statehouse Convention Center. \n\"We have dozens of businesses that support the industry,\" Arkansas Cannabis Industry Association board member Corey Hunt said. \nNot necessary working with the plant, but around the production. \n\"From top to bottom, there's a lot of people that support this industry,\" Hunt said. \nAs it soon becomes a reality, the state says the economic impact as a whole is yet to be seen. \n\"There's so many different ways that someone could get involved in this industry,\" DF&A spokesperson Scott Hardin said. \nThe state anticipates it's in the tens of millions of dollars. \n\"I think once we're up and running, maybe a year from now, we'll be able to look at this and say, 'this is what we're looking at and the number of people that are employed directly and indirectly,'\" Hardin said. \nUntil then, Liberty Defense Group will fight the battle to break into the biz.

The situation is very risky.\u201d \nBy changing America\u2019s stance toward Jerusalem, Trump \u201cis opening a can of worms that cannot be controlled.\u201d \nTrump\u2019s decision sparked anger across the Middle East and beyond as global leaders warned about the destabilizing repercussions across borders. \nSince fielding a phone call from Donald Trump on Tuesday night, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has been in close contact with regional allies, the UN and the EU, demanding they condemn the move. \nHassassian said that the US policy shift discredited America\u2019s role as a peace broker between Israelis and Palestinians. \n\u201cWe cannot look at the US as a mediator anymore,\u201d he told News Agency, adding that the new policy showed an undeniable bias toward the Jewish state. Moreover, Hassassian cautioned that altering the status of Jerusalem would spark ire far beyond the borders of Palestine. \n\u201cThe issue of Jerusalem will carry the weight of a religious conflict, now,\u201d Hassassian said. \u201c1.5 billion Muslims are not going to accept the monopoly of Judaism over the (holy city).\u201d \nThe American president he said, \u201cis putting the region into real risk.\u201d \nThe international community considers East Jerusalem to be Palestinian territory illegally occupied by Israel since the 1967 war. \nTrump\u2019s statement, Hassassian said, constituted a break with UN resolutions and international norms. \nBen Jamal, director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, agreed. \u201cThe decision that Donald Trump has made is a flagrant violation of international law and disregards legitimate rights and claims of the Palestinian people,\u201d he told News Agency. \nHe said that the status of Jerusalem was an unequivocal red line for Palestinians. \u201cThere is no possible peaceful resolution to the conflict that does not acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of the Palestinian state.\u201d \nCondemnation of Trump\u2019s new policy was echoed by Omar El-Hamdoon president of the Muslim Association of Britain, who said it was \u201cnot just a step in the wrong direction but it\u2019s almost like pouring oil onto the fire.\u201d \nHassassian said the Palestinian leadership was appealing to the international community to stand against Trump\u2019s intransigence. \nJamal agreed: \u201cIt is time for the international community to take robust action if it wishes to support a just resolution,\u201d he said. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s decision needs to be \u2026 condemned by all governments, including the UK government that say they support international law.\u201d  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mahmoud abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hassassian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben jamal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "omar el-hamdoon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manuel hassassian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judaism", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine solidarity campaign", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "news agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim association of britain", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:31.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e4125b767af98cc4766647f9b60c18da374730a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTAG7wb.Qhctrxd9gF4IgUZFVk84yveEnmYF7cgyZT.VlXTBcw7ET1ThcYOzp7PxhAnXQH9zoheeI3ZpdxJGAP1xYCbb80xobbPxY2Cb3nx5nz6Ku8.cHjydoqRJirBHVzGcoR3VLx5Zw--", "site_full": "www.racingandsports.com.au", "site": "racingandsports.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.racingandsports.com.au/en/sports", "site_categories": ["horse_racing", "auto_racing", "sports"], "section_title": "Racing And Sports -

Security Council resolutions that \u201cstipulated the non recognition of the Israeli occupation\u201d of the West Bank and the eastern sector of the city, government spokesperson Mohammad al-Momani told state news agency Petra. \nThe kingdom also considered \u201call unilateral moves that sought to create new facts on the ground as null and void\u201d, the government spokesman added. \nThe European Union said in a statement that it expresses serious concern about announcement by Trump on Jerusalem and the repercussions this may have on the prospect of peace. \nIn a statement UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that the UK \u2018disagrees\u2019 with the US decision on Jerusalem, describing it as \u2018unhelpful\u2019. \n\u201cWe disagree with the US decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem and recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe believe it is unhelpful in terms of prospects for peace in the region\u201d. \nLebanon\u2019s President Michel Aoun said on Wednesday that Trump\u2019s Jerusalem decision was dangerous and threatened the credibility of the United States as a broker of the peace process in the region. \nThe decision has put back the peace process by decades, and threatens regional stability and perhaps global stability, Aoun said in a statement. \nEgypt\u2019s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has also expressed Egypt\u2019s rejection of the move and of \u201cany implications resulting from it,\u201d in a statement issued. \nTunisia\u2019s foreign ministry also warned that Trump\u2019s move \u201cseriously threatens to undermine the foundations of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.\u201d \nMeanwhile Mexico\u2019s foreign ministry said that it will keep its Israeli embassy in Tel Aviv, following the US decision to move the embassy to Jerusalem. \nMexico will continue to adhere to United Nations resolutions recognizing the status of Jerusalem and continue supporting the historical claims of the Palestinian people, the foreign ministry said in a statement.

7, 2017 Middle East KSA denounces Trump\u2019s Jerusalem move as \u2018irresponsible and unwarranted\u2019 \n:: Saudi Arabia on Thursday expressed \u201cgreat disappointment\u201d over US President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and relocating the US embassy to Jerusalem. \nIn a statement carried by the Saudi Press Agency (SPA), the royal court said the Kingdom had previously warned of the serious consequences of such an \u201cirresponsible and unwarranted step.\u201d \nOn Tuesday, Saudi King Salman warned Trump that moving the US embassy for Israel to Jerusalem was a \u201cdangerous step\u201d that could rile Muslims worldwide. \n\u201cThe Kingdom expresses its denunciation and deep regret that the (Trump) administration has taken this step, as it represents a great bias against the historic and permanent rights of the Palestinian people in Jerusalem, which have been affirmed by the relevant international resolutions and have been recognized and supported by the international community,\u201d the statement said. \nIt said that although Trump\u2019s move does not diminish the \u201cinalienable and preserved rights of the Palestinian people in Jerusalem and other occupied territories,\u201d it does \u201cexemplify a drastic regression in the efforts to move the peace process forward.\u201d \n\u201c(It) is a shift away from the United States\u2018 historically impartial position with regard to the issue of Jerusalem, which will further complicate the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,\u201d the royal court said. \nIt said Saudi Arabia is calling on the US administration to reverse its action and support the international will to enable the Palestinian people to regain their legitimate rights. \n\u201cThe Kingdom reaffirms the importance of finding a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian cause in accordance with the relevant international resolutions, and the Arab Peace Initiative, so that the Palestinian people can regain their legitimate rights, which will strengthen security and stability in the region,\u201d the statement said.\u201d \nTrump\u2019s action was widely denounced, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan saying it was not only \u201cirresponsible and illegal\u201d also plays into the hands of terrorists. \nJordan decried the announcement as a violation of international law and the UN charter.

Officials said the service will not cost the city any money, but there will be a small fee for customers who use it.

The council voted in favor of the contract after city attorney James Hill III said the deal with Nexcheck is a standard contract that he has review several times and had no problems with. Chris Bishop, who spearheaded the efforts to find a company to provide the utilities payment service, said he interview four companies. He said the service can expand to the city\u2019s municipal court system.

I liked some of the stuff there. one of the highlights for me was the Supreme Wall. The Supreme Wall was filled with skateboards and various clothing from the brand Supreme. there were various brands spread out across the eight floors and it was cool to see how fashion had evolved over the years. it was also cool so see different brands that people wear and to encounter brands that I see everyday on the streets. it was very fun to with my friends as it gave us a chance to see what each other liked. we tried on various types and clothes and fooled around. it was fun learning experience.

I LOVED the Performance, and it was my #1 baby buy. Unfortunately, the 360 just isn't as good. First of all, it's not anywhere near as comfortable as the Performance, the waist band digs into me all the time, and I've adjusted it as best as I could. It's a stiffer material and is uncomfortable for long periods. Secondly, baby's arms just stick out the sides behind the shoulder straps rather awkwardly and my son gets sooo frustrated that he can't bring his hands together or up to his mouth, etc. Third, there are no pockets on it like there is on the Performance so you can slip in keys/phone, etc. so I had to get a custom pocket, no biggie, but would've been handy if it was built in. Now you might notice the complaints I have are all compared to the Performance - otherwise it is a very good product.

Now, robots are shaping the mechanical engineering program here at Snow College. \nThe first mechanical robot ever built, named the Unimate, was engineered by a man named George Devol. It was designed to lift pieces of hot metal from die casting machines for General Motors in 1961. It was a big breakthrough at the time, but technology has advanced a long way since then. \nNow, college students can build their own robots by simply taking certain engineering courses, like the Engineering 1000 course that is provided by Snow. Students aren\u2019t required to buy their own equipment for this class\u2014Snow College provides kits for making robots, which students return at the end of the semester. Ryan Richens and Hunter Fowles are holding up the robot they built. This robot was created for their Engineering 1000 class that they are enrolled in. Photo courtesy of Ryan Richens \nRyan Richens and Hunter Fowles are partaking in the Engineering 1000 course this semester. They have built and programmed their own robot, which can move across floor tiles and sense the assorted colors it\u2019s driving over. It can follow a path, go around a colored tube, and come back to the engineers. It can also drop a ball out of a basket it has attached to it. They have been working on this robot as part of their lab for at least a month. \n\u201cIt\u2019s just really cool to see how you can program a robot to do something, and it will do all that you tell it to do on its own,\u201d said Fowles, a sophomore. \n\u201cProgramming is easy, and it\u2019s fun to watch the robot go,\u201d said Richens, a freshman, \u201cIt\u2019s fun to learn about different aspects of engineering. I wish we could do different stuff in the class.\u201d \nThere are many competitions that go on for those who are building robots outside of class, too. One of them, hosted by Snow, is the Vex Robotics Competition, which will take place at the Greenwood Student Center on December 2nd. \nThere are many other subdivisions of engineering besides mechanical.

It is a matter of who that will be with, though.\nMcInnes has never worked under a Director of Football before and could be seen as more of a manager, in the traditional sense, than a Head Coach.\nSo the demarcation lines between he and Mark Allen must be made clearly. Allen has had a key role in the recruitment process in recent weeks and the working relationship that he forms with McInnes will be crucial going forward.\nBoth are ultimately working towards the same goal and with the same targets in mind but they will need to share a philosophy when it comes to player identification, the youth department and the scouting structure.\nRead more: Rangers must back Derek McInnes in the transfer market if he becomes new Ibrox boss, says Kris Boyd\u200b\nAllen will be the first point of contact for McInnes on all football matters, with the former Manchester City academy chief then reporting to Managing Director Stewart Robertson.\nUltimately, every major decision will be run by Dave King and the trust and backing of the chairman will be significant for McInnes.\nKing had differing relationships with Mark Warburton and Caixinha and he will hope to strike up a far more successful alliance with the next man in the dugout.\nSQUAD\nThe group of players that McInnes will inherit is of a greater strength and depth than the one that he leaves behind at Pittodrie.\nBut it is still some way off being capable of challenging at the top of the Premiership and it will need further surgery sooner rather than later.\nGraeme Murty has shown in recent weeks that it is possible to get more out of the players that underperformed and underachieved during Caixinha\u2019s reign and McInnes will hope he can improve the squad individually and collectively.\nEveryone on the books will see the new era as a clean slate and a chance to impress but some have more ground to make up than others and even a change in the dugout won\u2019t be enough to prolong their Ibrox careers.\nRead more: Derek McInnes is the man to transform Rangers' fortunes, says St Johnstone stopper Joe Shaughnessy\u200b\nWith the January transfer window just weeks away, time is of the essence for Rangers and McInnes will hope to quickly establish who he can work with and who will be allowed to leave.\nBUDGETS\nRangers have seen little return for their considerable outlays over the last two years and that must change if they are to close the gap to Celtic on and off the park.\nKing has already stated that funds will be made available to strengthen the squad but only time will tell how much cash McInnes feels is required next month and how much is saved for the summer transfer window.\nThe money at his disposal, both in terms of fees and wages, will increase several fold and McInnes will now be able to shop in a different market than the one he scoured at Aberdeen.\nMcInnes will be well aware of what is needed to get the Gers up to standard and will expect the Light Blues hierarchy to sign the big cheques as and when required.\nRECRUITMENT\nThe Ibrox board can\u2019t be faulted for backing both Warburton and Caixinha with significant funds but the strategy in the market can be questioned.\nIt would be no surprise to see McInnes operate a safety-first approach to the next stage of the rebuild. The likes of Kenny McLean and Louis Moult would certainly improve the Ibrox squad for relatively low outlays.\nRead more: Rangers close in on Derek McInnes after Aberdeen boss holds talks over his Pittodrie future\nThe new scouting structure implemented by Allen will be tasked with uncovering talent at both home and abroad but McInnes has already shown that he is a shrewd operator in the transfer market.\nHe will have the final say on all incomings but he will have to work with Allen to identify the characteristics of what he expects in a player. His knowledge of the club and Scottish football will certainly prove useful here.\nINFRASTRUCTURE\nMuch of this will come under Allen\u2019s remit and the appointment of Andy Scoulding as Head of Scouting was an important step for the Welshman.\nNine-in-a-row hero John Brown will scout the domestic market, while Dave Swanick will scour Europe for players and Billy McLaren will search for youngsters to bring into the Auchenhowie Academy.\nRangers have invested in the youth system in recent years and Craig Mulholland is likely to be left to continue with his blueprint for the future. It remains to be seen if Under-20s boss Murty will have a role at first team level, though.\nRead more: Rangers must back Derek McInnes in the transfer market if he becomes new Ibrox boss, says Kris Boyd\u200b\nMcInnes will inherit a significant backroom team and behind the scenes staff but will have the resources to bring his own people on board if required.\nRESULTS\nThe appointment of McInnes hasn\u2019t been universally popular with supporters but the former Light Blues midfielder will get the backing of the Ibrox crowd from the off.\nThe win for Murty\u2019s side at Pittodrie on Sunday was the first of seven fixtures the Gers will play this month and McInnes will have to hit the ground running if he is to pull away from the Dons.\nRangers won\u2019t be expected to challenge Celtic for the title but the Old Firm clash in a couple of weeks gives McInnes a chance to get a big game win under his belt early on.\nAMBITIONS\nThe goals for the remainder of the campaign are twofold for Rangers. The first objective is to finish best of the rest in the Premiership and the other is to mount a serious challenge for the Scottish Cup.\nNeither should be beyond the Gers in the coming months and ending the season with a bit of momentum will be crucial to allow McInnes to gear up for the Europa League qualifiers and his first full crack at the top flight.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "graeme murty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "billy mclaren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derek mcinnes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcinnes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warburton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stewart robertson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caixinha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louis moult", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig mulholland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenny mclean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pedro caixinha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave swanick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy scoulding", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stewart milne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark warburton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "aberdeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "light blues", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester city academy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auchenhowie academy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europa league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rangers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pittodrie", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ibrox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aberdeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pittodrie", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:32.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9f77ab87466d68f9c7259e4b0a6fe4627fbc5a1f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_AX7lDWWzx1VYEWWlcjRv143zJ8fzo9jxxbJnF2JQ2vQczB0Ra4QcZ5bLM0RXtn0lS_Nq818ZtdYUeYMuu3KTiJl.Sp4.v8bKNwFOoftSc3CXt3bltOT82ZZL53hLPibDe_WDbESSaNQ--", "site_full": "www.dutchnews.nl", "site": "dutchnews.nl", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Dutch say Trump 'unwise and counterproductive' with Jerusalem move - DutchNews.nl", "title_full": "Dutch say Trump 'unwise and counterproductive' with Jerusalem move - DutchNews.nl", "published": "2017-12-07T11:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.198, "main_image": "http://www.dutchnews.nl/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/halbe-zijlstra-as-foreign-minister-560x370.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 50871, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9f77ab87466d68f9c7259e4b0a6fe4627fbc5a1f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_AX7lDWWzx1VYEWWlcjRv143zJ8fzo9jxxbJnF2JQ2vQczB0Ra4QcZ5bLM0RXtn0lS_Nq818ZtdYUeYMuu3KTiJl.Sp4.v8bKNwFOoftSc3CXt3bltOT82ZZL53hLPibDe_WDbESSaNQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "Dutch say Trump 'unwise and counterproductive' with Jerusalem move - DutchNews.nl", "text": "December 7, 2017 \nPhoto: Rijksoverheid.nl \nThe US decision to recognise Jerusalem as capital of Israel and move its embassy there from Tel Aviv is unwise and counterproductive, Dutch foreign minister Halbe Zijlstra said on Twitter. \n\u2018The two-state solution remains the Dutch objective,\u2019 Zijlstra said, adding that the UN Security Council resolution is clear: \u2018 The annexation of east-Jerusalem is illegal,\u2019 the Dutch minister said. \nThe foreign affairs ministry has also altered its official travel advice to Israel, warning visitors to remain alert and follow what is happening in the local media.

He said he's sat there ever since he got home from the hospital. \nHill said, \"The stuff they took from me? They think that's going to bury me? uh uh (no).\" \nThe 63-year-old told us doctors diagnosed him October 23rd, 2017, with stage 4 cancer in his neck. \n\"People talking about I want to pray for you. I'll pray for you. I don't want anyone to pray for me. I want them to pray with me.\" More from this section \nHe may not look familiar but you may recognize his artwork that decorated Little Rock decades ago. \nHill said, \"It just slowed me down it didn't stop me. I'm not through until I'm gone.\" \nOne heater warms his wife and his home after he said thieves hit them when he was in the hospital. \nThe thief or thieves took more than just the heaters and air conditioning units he said, \"They took all my hand tools, all my lawnmowers I was working on.\" \nHis wife showed us where the washing machine used to sit. \nHe explained why he did not file a police report, \"What do you want me to do? Call out the SWAT? Comb the neighborhood?\" \nHill said weeks had passed by the time he got home from the hospital and he has been focused on his health instead of the thieves. \n\"We were using the fireplace but see I didn't have a chance to get it cleaned this year so I don't trust using it,\" Hill explained. \nHe said the small space heater works well for the room where he sits in his recliner a majority of the time. \nAndra Dobbins stopped by to check in on the man he considers family. \nDobbins said, \"We just want them to straighten their life up and don't run astray from God because God is always out there.\" \nHe explained that was a lesson Hill taught him when he was a kid. \nOur reporter Price McKeon asked Hill, \"What would you're message be to the person or people who took your things?\" \nWithout missing a beat he replied, \"Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.\" \nHis wife in the background said, \"God bless you.\" \nThe North Little Rock man continues to preach living each day as if it is a new start as he continues to fight cancer. \n\"When do I have to start life? When I wake up in the morning. Every day is a new day.\" \nHill told us he is not looking for sympathy. He did not reach out to us. We met him while working on another report. He said he is focused on his health and hopefully beating cancer.

How cool is that? ShareThe product design and development firm is showcasing an example of how an augmented surgical system might lower the risk involved in operations and lead to better results for patients.Using Microsoft's HoloLens headset, the team at CC has developed a highly intuitive AR surgical system that equips surgeons with 'X ray vision' making it possible to see inside a patient in real time, while operating through minimally invasive openings.Having the correct information in the right place at the right time is essential for successful surgery, yet the operating theatre is typically a very busy environment with limited access to any type of real time imaging.

Sgt. Don Newton, police public information officer, identified the suspect as Lavonte Marquise Freeman, 25, of Pell City. Newton said Freeman was arrested on charges of trafficking drugs and possession of drug paraphernalia, and also on an alleged probation violation. According to the St. Clair County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Freeman remains in the St. Clair County Jail in Pell City with a $10,500 combined bond for the charges of trafficking drugs and possession of drug paraphernalia. Newton said the Pell City Narcotics Unit received information that someone was distributing narcotics on the 800 block of 20th Street North. He said officers and members of the Narcotics Unit went to the residence, where they arrested the suspect. Newton said detectives recovered a large amount of the drug known as spice, prescription drugs, and scales and bags. \u201cI am proud of our officers and their response to information about someone selling drugs in our community, and especially someone who refuses to stop committing crime,\u201d said Pell City police Chief Paul Irwin. \u201cWe appreciate all the communities\u2019 assistance in reporting criminal activity and assisting us in identifying criminals.

We have a lot of great research happening in this country of ours and especially when I see an author or two I know personally I find it compelling to review such papers. Today is one of those days as the lead author for a paper is my colleague Dr. Louis here in Winnipeg. Let me put his mind at ease in case he reads this by saying that what follows is not a skewering of the paper he just published using Canadian Neonatal Network data (CNN). Over the last twenty years that I have had the privilege of working in the field of Neonatology we continue to discuss the same things when it comes to the PDA. Does it really cause problems or is it an association for many outcomes? Does treatment make a difference? If you treat then what should you use (ibuprofen, indomethacin, paracetamol)? When should you treat and if you treat early should it be in the first few days or right after birth using a prophylactic approach (provided within 12 hours of delivery)? It is the prophylactic approach which is the subject of this post! Why treat prophylactically? \nThe TIPP trial reported the results in 2001 of the study whose goal was to determine if prophylactic indomethacin use could improve neurosensory impairment at 18 months by reducing rates of severe IVH. The results of the study are well known and showed that while the rates of severe IVH and PDA ligations were reduced through this approach, there was no actual effect on long term outcome. The use of this approach fell off after that for many years but recently resurfaced as some units in Canada opted to start the practice again as the two benefits seen above appeared to be worth using the approach. The thought from a family centred approach, was that eliminating the stress for families of informing them their tiny preterm infant had a serious intracranial bleed and potentially avoiding a surgical ligation with probably vocal cord impairment afterwards were good enough outcomes to warrant this practice. Having used this approach myself I have to admit one consequence is that indomethacin was so effective at closing the PDA most of the time that over time one begins to assume the PDA is in fact closed and is less likely to go hunting for one when the baby is misbehaving later on in their course. What if it didn\u2019t close though? Are there any predictors that can increase our index of suspicion? Answering the question \nThe CNN provides a large database to look retrospectively to answer such a question. In this article, the authors looked at a period from 2010 to 2015 including all infants < 28 weeks gestational age at birth yielding a very large sample of 7397 infants. Of these 843 or 12% received prophylactic indomethacin and from there a little over half (465) still had a PDA. From there, 367 received treatment with eventually 283 needing only medical, 11 having a PDA ligation and 73 having both medical and surgical closure. From this analysis so far I can tell you that providing prophylactic indomethacin certainly does not guarantee closure! \nWhen a myriad of risk factors were put into logistic regression a number of interesting risk factors arose accounting for more of less risk of a PDA that needed surgical ligation despite prophylactic treatment. Much like all infants in the NICU, the risk for a persistent PDA was highest with declining GA. The combination of outborn status and short interval of ruptured membranes predicted higher risk. No doubt this is reflective of less frequent antenatal steroid use and even if provided time for it to work. Looking at medical or surgical treatment, surfactant therapy increased risk which may be explained by an improvement in oxygenation contributing to increased left to right shunting as PVR drops. Maternal hypertension and longer duration of rupture of membranes again play a role in reducing risk likely through the mechanism of the former increasing endogenous steroid production and the latter again allowing for steroids to be provided. What can we learn from this paper? \nI suppose the biggest benefit here is the realization that even with prophylactic indomethacin we are not assured of closure. In particular if there is a lack of antenatal steroid use or a stressed fetus one should be vigilant for the PDA. Interestingly, all of the risks seem to point towards antenatal steroid use. The bottom line then is that this reinforces what is already known and should be the focus of improvement strategies for centres. Increase the rate of antenatal steroid use and you will reduce the risk of a PDA even in the baby receives prophylactic indomethacin. I am happy to report that our centre has taken one step towards this goal by reinforcing to our Obstetrical colleagues that when they receive a call from a referring centre and have a woman who might be in labour it is better to err on the side of caution and just give the steroid course. If they are wrong on arrival then one can always repeat a course later on as we do although repeated courses of steroids are in and of themselves a contentious issue.

The one thing that made me want to give it a try is that I also have a Panasonic DX902 which as you know is a FALD TV with double the amount of zones than the new Sony XE9405 has, but I love my DX and the FALD technology. So in for a penny in for a pound !!\nAs soon as I got back home with the Sony and set it up, messed about with the settings and sat down to watch I knew I had made the right decision.\nThe colours are better, more punch than the E6 and its bright, very bright !! Motion is fantastic and far better than the E6 I feel. And even though it has a lot less zones than my DX it gets very black as you can see by pictures posted a few posts back.\nTo top it all my other half has said how much better this TV is and that's saying something !!\nI don't think OLED is quite there yet, there good but\nA couple more years then I feel OLED will be better. Obviously screen burn is not an issue on the XE like it is on OLED !!\nThe ZD9 is another great TV but its well pricy still for a 2016 set !! Click to expand... Thanx mate, im in such a dilemma.

Nair Rukmani Nair\nWith rapidly increasing rates of non-communicable diseases, India is experiencing a dramatic public health crisis that is closely linked to changing lifestyles and the growth of the middle-class. In this essay we discuss how the practice of Nature Cure provides a way of understanding the scale and scope of the crisis, as it is embodied, and a way to understand key elements of a solution to problems that the crisis presents for institutionalized health care. As institutionalized in contemporary India, Nature Cure involves treatment and managed care using earth, air, sunlight, and water as well as a strict dietary regimen. In this regard, the essay shows how Nature Cure\u2019s bio-ecological orientation toward public health, which is grounded in the history of its modern incorporation into India, provides an expansionist, ecological model for holistic care that counters the reductionist logic of bio-medical pharmaceuticalization.\n\nfrom #AlexandrosSfakianakis via Alexandros G.Sfakianakis on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2kuh1q7\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexandros g.sfakianakis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph alter r. nair rukmani nair", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "india  international journal of environmental research and public health", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india ijerph", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:32.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "79c1fc3430fff9164add7c02b5677ff3f6ec1547", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_pox_2m9g1mU.GwgDufP6.LGFzfncDyk7taJkBlbljHgV1zoeh7TLGJG5r8xMixd72CZSgLHl6CCYVRm2hn_yn0aVsHQ54NU3Fhqd0YC_RJLzZo75DN0N0CL8", "site_full": "iatrikisfakianakis.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://iatrikisfakianakis.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "\u0399\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u0386\u03c1\u03b8\u03c1\u03b1 \u0391\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u0393. \u03a3\u03c6\u03b1\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2", "title": "Global Well-Posedness for a Class of Kirchhoff-Type Wave System", "title_full": "Global Well-Posedness for a Class of Kirchhoff-Type Wave System", "published": "2017-12-07T10:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "79c1fc3430fff9164add7c02b5677ff3f6ec1547", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_pox_2m9g1mU.GwgDufP6.LGFzfncDyk7taJkBlbljHgV1zoeh7TLGJG5r8xMixd72CZSgLHl6CCYVRm2hn_yn0aVsHQ54NU3Fhqd0YC_RJLzZo75DN0N0CL8", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anonymous (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "Global Well-Posedness for a Class of Kirchhoff-Type Wave System", "text": "In recent years, the small initial boundary value problem of the Kirchhoff-type wave system attracts many scholars\u2019 attention. However, the big initial boundary value problem is also a topic of theoretical significance. In this paper, we devote oneself to the well-posedness of the Kirchhoff-type wave system under the big initial boundary conditions. Combining the potential well method with an improved convex method, we establish a criterion for the well-posedness of the system with nonlinear source and dissipative and viscoelastic terms. Based on the criteria, the energy of the system is divided into different levels. For the subcritical case, we prove that there exist the global solutions when the initial value belongs to the stable set, while the finite time blow-up occurs when the initial value belongs to the unstable set. For the supercritical case, we show that the corresponding solution blows up in a finite time if the initial value satisfies some given conditions.\n\nfrom #AlexandrosSfakianakis via Alexandros G.Sfakianakis on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2j0G2ZC\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexandros g.sfakianakis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:32.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fe63988c39eabbefe12ef6d0228ae5d3127335d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU4461Nw3T9bd8EBqnJlWwGKz306skOwpawfwci5N_ToeylFgSDKoJMeq26TB15zJlq4DTlkjd3ZXl2XKnzNGZ6if80t4lUV47Zw-", "site_full": "lalows.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://lalows.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Lancashire and Lakeland Outback Adventure Wildlife Safaris", "title": "Wither has it wandered we wonder", "title_full": "Wither has it wandered we wonder", "published": "2017-11-30T23:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e7a1720bd67ed651a55c1473b3cdb8326512f357", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU4461Nw3T9bd8EBqnJlWwGKz306skOwpawfwci5N_ToeylFgSDKoJMeq26TB15zJlq4DTlkjd3ZXl2XKnzNGZ6ifbdLW4HYegJo-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Conehead54", "published": "2017-12-07T08:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Your fern isn't Bracken but a species of Polypody.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:10:32.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7ed3f2acbd43055fdebdd4d0770b24f5fd4a57fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gT.AZYqr_Njcxh8MaRWawM5INRodqn53Xw--", "site_full": "us.battle.net", "site": "battle.net", "site_section": "https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/1011638/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Story Forum -

The one thing that made me want to give it a try is that I also have a Panasonic DX902 which as you know is a FALD TV with double the amount of zones than the new Sony XE9405 has, but I love my DX and the FALD technology. So in for a penny in for a pound !!\nAs soon as I got back home with the Sony and set it up, messed about with the settings and sat down to watch I knew I had made the right decision.\nThe colours are better, more punch than the E6 and its bright, very bright !! Motion is fantastic and far better than the E6 I feel. And even though it has a lot less zones than my DX it gets very black as you can see by pictures posted a few posts back.\nTo top it all my other half has said how much better this TV is and that's saying something !!\nI don't think OLED is quite there yet, there good but\nA couple more years then I feel OLED will be better.

She has only has what she been told about what happen she did not live it. Also her hatered fo the Horde has been around for 1000 years now i doubt anything will change her mind.\nThe Alliance is not a innocent as some people thing when it comes to the Blood Elves. True the idiot know as Garithos started it. He try to kill the last known memeber of the Royal Family of the Blood Elves, they got help from the Naga big deal he took all of the Alliance heavy forces to fight and left the rear guard which was Blood Elves only with only light forces. Cause they took help from the Naga a couple of times it lead to him wanting to kill the current leader of the Blood Elves. ALong with every member of the Blood Elf Army.\nThen the New Alliance makes a couple of mistakes with the Blood Elves when they were a netural power. First they sent a Dwarf to spy on Silvermoon, second the Night Elves send a miltary force to the Kingdom. Those two acts plus the fact that the Forskaen had sent real help seal the deal for Silvermoon of course at this point and time it was a Alliance of Convince.\nThen Garrosh comes to power and slowly but surely starts to lose support of the other Horde Races. During this time Varian see a chance to get the Elves if not into the Alliance at least out of the Horde which would pull a good deal of Magic support from Horde forces.

Pittman was arraigned on murder charges and his bond was set at $3 million.\nAccording to court documents, Pittman initially told police there was a third person in the car who was responsible for shooting Santiago, but then changed his story to say that he pulled the trigger.\nPittman also told police that he had a sexual relationship with Santiago, and that she was threatening to tell his girlfriend.\nAccording to the teen\u2019s family, Santiago\u2019s aunt is Pittman\u2019s girlfriend and the mother of his children. Waterbury police told FOX61 on Tuesday that they are investigating possible additional charges relating to the relationship.\nInside court, Pittman stood silently as the judge set his bond. His friends sat silently, some in tears, then shouting that they loved him as they left the courtroom.\nOnce outside court, friends of Pittman and Santiago clashed, swatting at cameras and microphones, prompting police to step in.\nPittman\u2019s friends say he is innocent of the crime and did not have a sexual relationship with Santiago.\n\u201cHe loves his children, his girlfriend,\u201d said family friend Rosaura Rodriguez. \u201cHe was a good person.

The only way to avoid this is to wait until they have both finished education in the US (which is 4 years here, not 3), at which point you will probably find that your children have deeply integrated into the US and won't want to go \"home\".\nAlso remember that until you get a green card your right to live in the US will be entirely dependent on your DH's job.

Regardless of my HDMI port understanding it will be best to have the UBP-X800 on the most capable port as this will be the most capable 4k source you own. Sky Q will go on any port however if not all HDMI ports support full bandwidth then you may only be allowed to choose 8-bit colour on the Sky Q 2160p output (on the least capable port).\nI hope this helps.\nCheers Click to expand...

I always have liked to travel so I knew I wanted to do something with traveling. I also know a couple people in that field and they said it was great. so I decided that International Business was a good place to begin. To further my knowledge I decided to go to a Study Abroad Fair. I attended the study abroad fair with Mitchell. when I got to the fair, I was very impressed with the amount of booths they had set up. I saw various countries there such as India, England, Ecuador, Spain and France. Each country had something different to offer. The country I was most intrigued was actually Denmark. It had a relatively low cost of living. this is something different as the cost of living in New York is higher than most places. it also looked a nice place to live. the other country I was intrigued by was India. I was intrigued by India because my parents are from India and it would be easy from me to travel there. I speak the language there and it would be easy to interact with the people there. It is also a country that connects with America. It is were most of the IT people come from these days so it is a familiar connection. this relates to my career because these are all countries I might visit one day as a part of my job. so I should know countries that I might have a preference traveling to. I also wanted to interact with people from different countries to see what type of people I would be in contact with. the study abroad fair was an informative fair. it was a fun event to attend.

Incarnate, through the hands of Mary according to St. Louis Marie de Montfort: Day 33: December 7: Note: Preparation for Consecration on the feast of the Immaculate Conception on December 8. . . Theme for the Week: Knowledge Of Jesus Christ . During this period we shall apply ourselves to the study of Jesus Christ. What is to be studied in Christ? First the God-Man, His grace and glory; then His rights to sovereign dominion over us; since, after having renounced Satan and the world, we have taken Jesus Christ for our Lord. What next shall be the object of our study? His exterior actions and also His interior life; namely, the virtues and acts of His Sacred Heart; His association with Mary in the mysteries of the Annunciation and Incarnation, during His infancy and hidden life, at the feast of Cana . . Imitation of Christ, by Thomas \u00e1 Kempis: Book 4, Chapter 11 That the Blood of Christ and the Holy Scriptures Are Most Necessary unto a Faithful Soul . O most sweet Lord Jesus, how great is the pleasure of the devout soul that feasteth with Thee in Thy banquet; where there is set for her no other food to be eaten but Thyself, her only Beloved, and most to be desired above all the desires of her heart! To me also it would be indeed sweet, in Thy presence to pour forth tears from the very bottom of my heart, and with the grateful Magdalene to wash Thy feet with tears (Luke 7:38). But where is that devotion? Where that bountiful flowing of holy tears? Surely in the sight of Thee and Thy holy Angels, my whole heart ought to burn, and to weep for joy. For in this Sacrament I have Thee mystically present, hidden under another shape. For to look upon Thee in Thine own Divine brightness, mine eyes would not be able to endure; nor could even the whole world stand in the splendor of the glory of Thy majesty. Herein then Thou hast regard to my weakness, that Thou dost hide Thyself under this Sacrament. . . From True Devotion To the Blessed Virgin Mary, Nos. 261-265 In Mary . 261. We must do everything in Mary. To understand this we must realise that the Blessed Virgin is the true earthly paradise of the new Adam and that the ancient paradise was only a symbol of her. There are in this earthly paradise untold riches, beauties, rarities and delights, which the new Adam, Jesus Christ, has left there. It is in this paradise that he \"took his delights\" for nine months, worked his wonders and displayed his riches with the magnificence of God himself.In this earthly paradise grows the real Tree of Life which bore our Lord, the fruit of Life, the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which bore the Light of the world. In this divine place there are trees planted by the hand of God and watered by his divine unction which have borne and continue to bear fruit that is pleasing to him. Only the Holy Spirit can teach us the truths that these material objects symbolise. 262. The Holy Spirit speaking through the Fathers of the Church, also calls our Lady the Eastern Gate, through which the High Priest, Jesus Christ, enters and goes out into the world. Through this gate he entered the world the first time and through this same gate he will come the second time. For Mary 265. Finally, we must do everything for Mary. We take Mary for our proximate end, our mysterious intermediary and the easiest way of reaching him. Relying on her protection, we should undertake and carry out great things for our noble Queen. We must defend her privileges when they are questioned and uphold her good name when it is under attack. We must attract everyone, if possible, to her service and to this true and sound devotion. As a reward for these little services, we should expect nothing in return save the honour of belonging to such a lovable Queen and the joy of being united through her to Jesus, her Son, by a bond that is indissoluble in time and in eternity. . .

Give us, O Lord, a perpetual fear and love of Thy holy Name; for Thou never failest to govern those whom Thou dost solidly establish in Thy love, Who livest and reignest world without end. R. Amen. . . St. Louis De Montfort's Prayer to Jesus . O most loving Jesus, deign to let me pour forth my gratitude before Thee, for the grace Thou hast bestowed upon me in giving me to Thy holy Mother through the devotion of Holy Bondage, that she may be my advocate in the presence of Thy majesty and my support in my extreme misery. Alas, O Lord! I am so wretched that without this dear Mother I should be certainly lost. Yes, Mary is necessary for me at Thy side and everywhere: that she may appease Thy just wrath, because I have so often offended Thee; that she may save me from the eternal punishment of Thy justice, which I deserve; that she may contemplate Thee, speak to Thee, pray to Thee, approach Thee and please Thee; that she may help me to save my soul and the souls of others; in short, Mary is necessary for me that I may always do Thy holy will and seek Thy greater glory in all things. Ah, would that I could proclaim throughout the whole world the mercy that Thou hast shown to me! Would that everyone might know I should be already damned, were it not for Mary! Would that I might offer worthy thanksgiving for so great a blessing! Mary is in me. Oh, what a treasure! Oh, what a consolation! And shall I not be entirely hers'? Oh, what ingratitude! My dear Saviour, send me death rather than such a calamity, for I would rather die than live without belonging entirely to Mary. With St. John the Evangelist at the foot of the Cross, I have taken her a thousand times for my own and as many times have given myself to her; but if I have not yet done it as Thou, dear Jesus, dost wish, I now renew this offering as Thou dost desire me to renew it. And if Thou seest in my soul or my body anything that does not belong to this august princess, I pray Thee to take it and cast it far from me, for whatever in me does not belong to Mary is unworthy of Thee. O Holy Spirit, grant me all these graces. Plant in my soul the Tree of true Life, which is Mary; cultivate it and tend it so that it may grow and blossom and bring forth the fruit of life in abundance. O Holy Spirit, give me great devotion to Mary, Thy faithful spouse; give me great confidence in her maternal heart and an abiding refuge in her mercy, so that by her Thou mayest truly form in me Jesus Christ, great and mighty, unto the fullness of His perfect age. Amen. . . O Jesus Living in Mary . O Jesus living in Mary, Come and live in Thy servants, In the spirit of Thy holiness, In the fullness of Thy might, In the truth of Thy virtues, In the perfection of Thy ways, In the communion of Thy mysteries; Subdue every hostile power In Thy spirit, for the glory of the Father. Amen.

(AP) \u2014 Dr. Byron Maas surveys a supply of marijuana products for dogs that lines a shelf in his veterinary clinic. They\u2019re selling well. \n\u201cThe \u2018Up and Moving\u2019 is for joints and for pain,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe \u2018Calm and Quiet\u2019 is for real anxious dogs, to take away that anxiety.\u201d \nPeople anxious to relieve suffering in their pets are increasingly turning to oils and powders that contain CBDs, a non-psychoactive component of marijuana. But there\u2019s little data on whether they work, or if they have harmful side effects. \nThat\u2019s because Washington has been standing in the way of clinical trials, veterinarians and researchers say. Now, a push is underway to have barriers removed, so both pets and people can benefit. \nThose barriers have had more than just a chilling effect. \nWhen the federal Drug Enforcement Administration announced last year that even marijuana extracts with CBD and little or no THC \u2013 marijuana\u2019s intoxicating component \u2013 are an illegal Schedule 1 drug, the University of Pennsylvania halted its clinical trials. Colorado State University is pushing ahead. \nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned companies that sell marijuana products online and via pet shops and animal hospitals that they\u2019re violating laws by offering \u201cunapproved new animal drugs.\u201d The FDA threatened legal action. \nBut, seeing potential benefits of CBDs, the American Veterinary Medical Association\u2019s policy-making body said last summer it wants the DEA to declassify marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug \u201cto facilitate research opportunities for veterinary and human medical uses.\u201d It asked the board of the national veterinarians\u2019 organization to investigate working with other stakeholders toward that goal. The board is awaiting a recommendation from two group councils. \n\u201cThe concern our membership has is worry about people extrapolating their own dosages, looking to medicate their pets outside the realm of the medical professional,\u201d Board Chairman Michael Whitehair said in a telephone interview. \u201cThis is an important reason for us to continue the research.\u201d \nUtah Sen. Orrin Hatch, a conservative Republican, became an unlikely champion of this push when he introduced a bill in September that would open the path for more clinical research. While Hatch said he opposes recreational marijuana use, he wants marijuana-based drugs, regulated by the FDA, produced for people with disorders. \n\u201cWe lack the science to support use of medical marijuana products like CBD oils, not because researchers are unwilling to do the work, but because of bureaucratic red tape and over-regulation,\u201d Hatch said. \nDawn Boothe, of Auburn University\u2019s College of Veterinary Medicine, is waiting for federal approval to begin a study of marijuana\u2019s effects on dogs with epilepsy. The classification of marijuana products containing CBD as a Schedule 1 drug, the same category as heroin and LSD, creates a \u201cmajor, major, major, terrible roadblock\u201d for researchers, Boothe said in a phone interview. \nResearchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine were studying CBDs\u2019 effects on dogs with osteoarthritis and pruritis, or itchiness, until the DEA released its policy statement. \n\u201cThe ambiguity in this process has really brought us to a screeching halt,\u201d said Michael DiGregorio, director of the university\u2019s clinical trials center. \u201cIt is research that needs to be done, because there are a lot of CBD products out there.\u201d \nWhen it clarified that marijuana CBD extracts are Schedule 1 drugs, the DEA said it was assigning a code number to those substances to better track them and to comply with international drug control treaties. \nDiGregorio complained that researchers seeking federal approval to study CBD products are told to provide certain data, but that data isn\u2019t normally available until the study is done. \n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the data, you can\u2019t get the registration to do the work,\u201d he said. \nOn a recent morning, Maas took a break from seeing four-legged patients in the Bend Veterinary Clinic. A stethoscope dangling from his neck over green scrubs, Maas said his clients have reported CBDs help relieve pain, arthritis, anxiety, loss of appetite, epilepsy and inflammation in their pets. \n\u201cUnfortunately there\u2019s not a lot of research out there, especially on animals, on CBD compounds,\u201d Maas said. \u201cThe research is really necessary to help us understand how to actually use these compounds on our pets.\u201d \nVeterinarian Janet Ladyga of the Blue Sky Veterinary Clinic, also in Bend, said she doesn\u2019t recommend marijuana products because of the unknowns. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of evidence right now, so we don\u2019t know the toxicity or the safety profile \u2026 and we don\u2019t have any good evidence to show either if it\u2019s safe or efficacious,\u201d she said. \nThe study at Colorado State University aims to provide some data. The roughly two dozen dogs in the arthritis study and the 30 in the epilepsy tests are given either CBD oil or a placebo. For the arthritis study, activity monitors are attached to the animals\u2019 collars, to determine if they\u2019re more mobile when they\u2019re taking CBD. \nPrincipal investigator Stephanie McGrath said she hopes the results will be a stepping stone for longer and more diverse studies, and that they provide useful information for human medicine. \n\u201cEvery medication we\u2019re taking has been given to a dog first,\u201d the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s DiGregorio noted. \nMeanwhile, Boothe said she had everything ready to start her study in January, and was waiting for a green light from federal officials. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s taking so long,\u201d she said. \n___ \nFollow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky Share, Print or Email",

masterplan DOMANII CAMERON, Townsville Bulletin December 7, 2017 8:01pm \nAN IDYLLIC lagoon that\u2019s set to transform The Strand and draw thousands of tourists to Townsville is expected to be built by 2020. \nThe Crystal Lagoon is just one project that\u2019s part of Townsville City Council\u2019s Townsville 2020 masterplan which was announced at a stakeholder\u2019s breakfast today. media_camera An artist's impression of the proposed redevelopment of Ville Resort-Casino in Townsville. \nThe 6ha lagoon, which would be Northern Australia\u2019s largest man-made pool, would stretch from the front of Tobruk Pool to \u00adGregory St. \nNo imagery of the lagoon\u2019s design have been released however it\u2019s expected to feature resort-like facilities with eateries to surround it. \nMayor Jenny Hill said it was one of the projects that she would love to see finished by 2020. \n\u201cBut I want it a long way into its development before that,\u201d she said. media_camera An artist's impression of the proposed redevelopment of Ville Resort-Casino in Townsville. \nTownsville 2020 is the council\u2019s adaptation from Pure Projects\u2019 masterplan that was delivered earlier this year. \nThe bold plan looks to revitalise Townsville and make it more appealing to younger generations. \nTwo local businesses were among the first beneficiaries with Townsville\u2019s Counterpoint Architecture, in conjunction with Milford Planning, winning the tender to head the revitalisation of Castle Hill. media_camera An artist's impression of the proposed redevelopment of Ville Resort-Casino in Townsville. \nMundingburra\u2019s Place Design will also supervise the design of new features at entry points to the city. \nCr Hill said most of the projects proposed would be completed or on their way to completion by 2020. \n\u201cToo many people have seen so-called plans in the past and nothing being delivered,\u201d she said. \n\u201cThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re about. \n\u201cWe\u2019re about setting down vision for the city.\u201d media_camera An artist's impression of the proposed redevelopment of Ville Resort-Casino in Townsville. \nCr Hill said the council wasn\u2019t aiming low, with the masterplan being more than just plans for the Strand and the CBD. \n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about entry statements, we\u2019re talking about Castle Hill and Mt Louisa,\u201d she said. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve already begun the process. \n\u201cWe have money set aside in future budgets. \n\u201cWe have the private sector ready to also invest in our community.\u201d media_camera An artist's impression of the proposed redevelopment of Ville Resort-Casino in Townsville. \nThe Mayor said the Morris Group was already trying to extend their tourism empire with new footage of The Ville\u2019s development also being released today. \n\u201cIt\u2019s all about creating a different way for how our city looks,\u201d she said. \n\u201cI want the community to be positive. \n\u201cWe know we have problems here but we also have attributes.\u201d \nPure Projects\u2019 chairman Don Morris said it was a very exciting day for Townsville. media_camera An artist's impression of the proposed redevelopment of Ville Resort-Casino in Townsville. \n\u201cThe plan is underway,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a great thing. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be another report that goes nowhere. \n\u201cPeople have been appointed, contracts have been issued. \n\u201cThe stadium is the first huge catalyst. \n\u201c2020 is not far away.\u201d",
