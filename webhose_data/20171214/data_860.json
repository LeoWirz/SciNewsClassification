Let them keep calling me \u2018neech\u2019, we will not respond. In our hearts we do not have this mindset and want to congratulate them for theirs.

Have I done any shameful thing. Then why are they calling me \u2018neech\u2019,\u201d says Modi \n4.20 pm: \u201cThis Mughlai mindset sees everyone but prices as \u2018neech\u2019.

They firmly believe that education is an emancipatory force. Mahatma Phule\u2019s words warn us about the miseries caused by lack of knowledge. Therefore, my parents were determined that their daughter should get the best education possible. For a second-generation learner like me, to study in one of the best central universities of India is like a dream. But, after one semester, do I still hold that view? A question I often ask myself and the answer to which I will try to seek here. \nI grew up in an Ambedkarite Buddhist milieu of Nagpur. I was aware of my Dalit identity though stories my parents and grandparents narrated. These were of people like Babasaheb, Savitri mai, Shahu Maharaj, Thanthai Periyar. My childhood memories resonate with the songs written by Lokshahir Vamandada Kardak, an eminent Marathi poet, playwright and follower of Babasaheb. My identity was one that always empowered me. Personally, I never experienced the iniquitous side of it until I came out of my \u2018security blanket\u2019 and entered into the world of higher education. The higher educational space has reduced me to my immediate and a singular identity and has brought me more closer to the actual realities of it. \n\u201cWhich category do you belong to?\u201d \nDiscrimination and exclusion is visible here, yet it is so invisibilised. Earlier this year, a friend of mine, on her very first day at college was asked by the professor in front of the whole class, as to \u201cwhich category she belonged to\u201d. This is commonplace. Once the identity get revealed he/she frequently encounters taunts of being \u201cfreebies\u201d, and having \u201cinadequate knowledge\u201d. Everyday humiliations a student faces in classrooms because of his/her identity can range from the clever use of casteist abuses like \u201cchamar\u201d, \u201cbhangi\u201d or as Thorat Committee points out in things like the Viva Voce. The committee while referring to another institute spoke of how SC/ST students, while taking these tests were made to feel inferior, and asked their caste background by the examiner. These experiences many times force students to take extreme steps like dropout and suicides. The high dropout rates among Bahujan minority students are a manifestation of some of this discrimination, which is never talked about in \u201cprogressive\u201d circles. \nThe elitist mask of progressiveness of Indian academia fascinates us from a distance but when we come closer, we realise how unjust these spaces can be. I make this statement from my own experience. I realise my experiences seem peculiar to students who come from a different caste and class background. This is because exclusion gets \u2018normalised\u2019 in very mundane and banal ways. For instance, \u201cWhat is your admission percentile?\u201d is a very general question with which students start their interactions with each other in the initial days. I used to wonder why do these numbers matter when a student has already entered the institution? It is often a pretty way of knowing to which category a student belongs to \u2014 \u2018reserved\u2019 or \u2018general\u2019. Outside the academia, we ask surnames; inside, we ask admission percentages. Both are an indirect way of figuring out each other\u2019s social identity and then adjusting behaviour, relationship, proximity. \nThe caste-blindness of feminist spaces \nGender discrimination in academia is a much-debated topic. Many parallel feminist spaces have been created here. But these spaces are established within existing power structures and do not reflect the concerns of women who are at the margins here. The caste-blindness of these spaces makes them futile for Bahujan women who struggle at the intersections of caste-gender. When Savitrimaai and Fatima Sheikh struggle to find a place in the feminist circles of India\u2019s best women colleges, I fear how I will be able to find space as a woman, a Dalit-Ambedkarite woman. \nI was told that our history is important for it gives us strength and confidence to face the present world. What I realised here is that my history is completely unknown to this place. My history is not a history but a series of untold stories. And the stories that are regarded as histories here are the ones I can never lay claim to. One thing that I believe is that our histories are deliberately erased to make us feel inferior, and for this very same reason our assertion becomes important. I carry a small badge of Babasaheb\u2019s photo with me and students often end up asking me who the person is. I am unsure how my classmates will understand and accept my Ambedkarite identity when they refuse to even acknowledge Babasaheb, either by design or brutal ignorance. \nThe prejudices against the reservation policy tends to criminalise our very existence. Our own classmates (I don\u2019t call them friends) make us feel \u2018undeserving\u2019. In any \u2018academic talk\u2019 on reservations, I have seen students, even professors use the chant of \u2018merit\u2019. It takes so much mental labour to deal with taunts of being \u2018non-meritorious\u2019 and to convince yourself that you deserve to be here and you have to study hard for those among us who still don\u2019t have the \u2018privilege\u2019 to enter these institutes. These experiences are agonising. And how does our university help us cope with this? It gives us \u201cEqual Opportunity Cell\u201d that conducts spoken English classes \u2018exclusively\u2019 for Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe students. \nHigher educational institutes in India are structurally designed to be ghettoised spaces. They marginalise students coming from already marginalised communities. The \u2018groups\u2019 that exist here have a homogenous composition that alienates a student who does not fit in the \u2018mainstream\u2019 identity or to be specific, the upper caste/class identity. I used to think that because I am introvert and shy, I am unable to be part of these groups. After a point I realised, they were never meant to include us. I frequently look at the long list of students union representatives and find my community\u2019s representation to be miniscule, almost non-existent. \nTo quote Victor Hugo, \u201cThere is in every village a torch \u2014 the teacher; and an extinguisher \u2014 the priest.\u201d In Indian academia, priests are in disguise of teachers playing a role of torch for some and extinguisher for others. I still remember how hard it was for my mother to let her daughter live alone in this university after the tragic death of Rohith Vemula and J Muthukrishnan. \nOn the occasion of Independence Day we were made to take a number of oaths in the college for a better India, and to fight against \u201ccasteism\u201d (surprisingly!) was one among them. But if I go and point out to them how their own institute functions by caste norms, they will deny the existence of caste in this \u2018premium\u2019 institute and tell me that caste is a \u2018thing of the past\u2019. \nThis is certainly not the space I dreamt of. I came here with an aspiration to study like Babasaheb. Universities are considered a second home, a place students cherish but for us these spaces are battlefields where we tirelessly fight a new battle each day \u2013a fight that breaks us and builds us at the same time. But we are determined to win this battle.

Anyone under 10 raise your hands? I see you tiny Tim. Yes yes, God bless us everyone. Top 5 ever. I presume everyone else in the room is of age? How about the card carrying silver foxes? Whoa. Big majority. 15% is coming off your bill. You earned it. Over 65 years in this human experience? It hasn\u2019t been a cakewalk has it? If you\u2019re like me you didn\u2019t really set the world on fire neither. Not any dividend checks coming in every month. Didn\u2019t write a song like Frosty the Snowman to set the family up. No, it\u2019s been a paycheck to paycheck 5 days a week existence. On call the other 2 days. No wonder I lost my childhood wonder. At least I\u2019m not alone. \n\nThe Elf on the shelf, if you don\u2019t know, is a little stuffed elf doll that \u201ccomes down from the North Pole\u201d the day after thanksgiving and stays till the day after Christmas Day. And the days in between, he/she gets into all sorts of mischief in the night. \n\n\n\nSo here\u2019s the thing\u2026earmuffs, tiny Tim\u2026children have such a sense of wonder, that they actually believe these elves are real. They believe in Santa Claus so why wouldn\u2019t they? Every Christmas Eve they go to sleep, cookies, milk and no presents\u2026.they wake up no milk, half eaten cookie, presents. You do the math. Maybe little Cindy Loo Who could do the math, but why? If it ain\u2019t broke. Every year like clockwork the fat man delivers. That was the deal. He keeps his end and I keep mine. \n\nImagine if you told a child Santa Claus is coming on the 12th this year. He\u2019s not coming on Christmas Eve. What would the look be on that child\u2019s face? Is something wrong? Why? What happened? I would almost bet a steak dinner that a child might say, this doesn\u2019t feel right. Let\u2019s just wait till our usual time. How crazy would that be but somehow I can picture it. Maybe children have an inner sense of how things work that we just forget over time. Something about that sense of wonder that slips through our hands over the years. Is that why they say the children lead us? That children teach us? Maybe they remember more of their light they had before they arrived here into this human existence. \n\n\n\nI don\u2019t know. Maybe something about this 3D human existence has made us hard. Impatient. Frustrated. Tired. Embarrassed. Shamed. Working all the time. And not enough time to do the things you want on those 2 days off. It\u2019s a hard road. Why would anyone in their right mind sign up for this life? I guess for the same reason why would anyone run an obstacle course? Why would anyone want to be an astronaut? Why would anyone eat an oyster? For the experience I presume. And some experiences are better than others. Some were born into a loving family. Maybe they got lots of nice pretty presents under the tree. Santa was always on time. And then there\u2019s the others. Maybe what\u2019s so frustrating is that some never had the wonderful childhood experience they should have. Maybe this is their shot to get it right for themselves and their family. I\u2019d be frustrated too. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/sj-RxX_FjoM \n\n\n\nI imagine there\u2019s a few out there who haven\u2019t lost their sense of wonder in all this time. The ones who can dream easily. The ones who live with their feet off the ground. But what does society say about them? Quit dreaming and get to work. You\u2019re flying too close to the sun. Wake up. Get a job. Your pipe dream ain\u2019t gonna put food on the table. You are arrested development. \n\n\u201cYou give me breadcrumbs \nAnd I\u2019m tired of living the boss' dream \nThey'll squeeze you dry man, if you let 'em \nYou better take your chances if you get 'em\u201d \u2013 Jane\u2019s Addiction \n\nSo this world suppresses the dreamers don\u2019t they? Hmmm. Heaven forbid you have your head in the clouds and make a decent wage. Hey kid you want to be an artist? You wanna be a teacher? You wanna work at a nonprofit animal shelter? You wanna be a magician? You like being poor? Good luck kid. \n\n\n\nBut the times they are a changing. With the sizable blessings moving closer to us with every tick of the island clock on the wall, like a child, you can now go back to dreaming of the world you want to live in. And dream out loud. At high volume. Do you realize how lucky we are? All our dreams are going to come true. For better or for worse. Not just for our sakes but for the sake of all. For the dreams of all our brothers and sisters. Can we put \u201cWe make your dreams come true\u201d on a business card? What would you say if you got a card like that? But it\u2019s true. \n\nThe melancholy part of this whole gig? Of this dream job? How much of our dreams are 3D adult dreams? I dream of 8% interest. I dream of an offshore account free from taxes. I dream of an impenetrable trust. I dream of genie. I dream of butlers. I dream of no NDAs. I dream of 88 bodyguards. I dream of a penthouse suite with 360 views. They\u2019re all nice dreams, but not quite hitting the chosen one mark are they? And that\u2019s why today, I reach inside me and pull forth my inner child. To look deep inside and find my lost sense of a childs wonder. That wonder to believe that Santa Claus is coming right on time. That wonder to believe that God is real. That wonder to believe that a school teacher can make as much as a banker. That a homeless shelter can be the most expensive building in a 5 miles radius. That you can be a policeman and put the bad guys away. That orphans can live with families that truly love them. That I can give away my paintings for free and eat. That I can spend my time making others dreams come true. That I can live with the wonder of a child forever. That my arrested development is a good thing. \n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s the word \n\nHeisenberg \n\nhttps://youtu.be/Pu9rQ8lkQ5c \n\nhttps://youtu.be/17-90JQO8mo \n\nhttps://youtu.be/9ZC8tgGuVKM \n\nhttps://youtu.be/EErSKhC0CZs \n\nhttps://youtu.be/z92bmlcmyq0 \n\nhttps://youtu.be/USodN3D4wnc \n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ggg5V-iryhY \n\nhttps://youtu.be/wKaQTSVJRKk \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Original of the Species\" \nBaby, slow down The end is not as fun as the start Please stay a child somewhere in your heart \nI'll give you everything you want Except the thing that you want You are the first one of your kind \nAnd you feel like no-one before You steal right under my door I kneel 'cause I want you some more I want the lot of what you got And I want nothing that you're not \nEverywhere you go you shout it You don't have to be shy about it \nSome things you shouldn't get too good at Like smiling, crying and celebrity Some people got way too much confidence, baby, baby \nI'll give you everything you want Except the thing that you want You are the first one of your kind \nAnd you feel like no-one before You steal right under my door I kneel 'cause I want you some more I want the lot of what you got And I want nothing that you're not \nEverywhere you go you shout it You don't have to be shy about it, no Oh, oh no Sugar, come on!

He moved up three spots from number five after his career best Test score of 243 which he scored against Sri Lanka in the Kotla Test which ended in a draw on Wednesday. In the three-match series, Kohli accumulated 610 runs including three hundreds. \nBefore the beginning of the series, Kohli was placed at the sixth spot behind Steve Smith , David Warner , Kane Williamson, Cheteshwar Pujara and Joe Root. However, his phenomenal run of form saw him jump four spots and sit at the second position. The numero uno position is still held by Australia skipper Steve Smith who is 45 points ahead of Kohli. While Smith has 938 points Kohli is on 893 points. \nKohli made back-to-back double centuries in the series against Sri Lanka. The one in Kotla was his sixth in Test cricket and he moved ahead of Brian Lara as the captain with most Test double centuries. \nCurrently, Kohli is the number one batsman in both ODI and T20 cricket. Hence, the 29-year-old will be eyeing the top spot in Tests since he is the current number one in ODIs and T20Is. Meanwhile, among the teams, despite losing one point India is still at the number one ranked Test side.

China\u2019s legislature approved a new environmental tax law late last year that gave regions the power to set their own rates. Several regions have already drawn up schemes and in January will start charging firms according to the amount of air, water and even noise pollution they produce. But Hebei, a major source of hazardous and politically embarrassing emissions drifting across China\u2019s capital Beijing, is under heavy pressure to clean up and will levy higher rates of tax than other regions. \nAccording to draft regulations now being discussed by local lawmakers, firms in the cities of Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Langfang and Dingzhou will be charged as much as 6 yuan ($0.91) for each unit of air pollution and 7 yuan for each unit of water pollution they produce, the local government said. The highest permissable rate stands at 12 yuan and 14 yuan respectively, according to the law passed last year. \nCities and counties directly bordering Beijing will be forced to pay even higher rates, with major air pollutants like sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides charged at 9.6 yuan per unit. Major water pollutants like ammonium nitrate will be levied at 11.2 yuan per unit. Units are calculated based on coefficients that assign weights to different pollution sources. A single unit is the equivalent of 16.7 kilograms of carbon monoxide or 0.95 kilograms of sulphur dioxide. \nNeighbouring Shanxi province, China\u2019s biggest coal producing region, also said this week that it would introduce a environmental protection tax starting from Jan. 1, 2018, with polluters paying 1.8 yuan per unit of air pollution and 2.1 yuan per unit of water pollution. The province said it expected the new tax to raise 1.9 billion yuan next year, with the figure likely to decline steadily as firms gradually cut their emissions.

name of rescuing woman, she denies link \nUS Senate Republicans agreed to talks with the House of Representatives on sweeping tax legislation on Wednesday, amid early signs that lawmakers could bridge their differences and agree on a final bill ahead of a self-imposed Dec. 22 deadline. \nThe Republican-led Senate voted 51-47, along party lines with Democrats opposed, to begin formal conference negotiations to reconcile rival House and Senate tax bills passed last week. \nThe move, which follows similar House action this week, brings Congress a step closer to sending President Donald Trump a tax overhaul that he can sign into law. \nHouse and Senate negotiators will need to work out differences on issues ranging from business taxes to the repeal of the Obamacare mandate that Americans obtain health insurance or face a penalty before lawmakers can pass a final version. \nBut John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said he was optimistic House and Senate tax negotiators would be able to work out an agreement within the next two weeks. \n\u201cGiven the similarities between the House and the Senate bills, I think there are some obvious targets where they need to focus their attention but obviously they won\u2019t be rewriting the bills,\u201d Cornyn said. \nRepublican negotiators must be careful not to agree to changes that could diminish support in the Senate, where they can afford to lose support from no more than two party members. \nThere has been no major tax overhaul since 1986, when Republican Ronald Reagan was president. \nWhile there are significant differences between the House and Senate bills, both would cut the U.S. corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, provide tax relief for \u201cpass-through\u201d enterprises including small businesses where earnings are taxed at individual rates, and both benefit the wealthiest Americans and reduce the tax burden for most middle-class taxpayers. \nRepublicans claim the legislation will spur enough economic growth to pay for the tax cuts with new revenue, but the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that Senate bill would still add $1 trillion to the federal budget deficit over a decade, even with an economic upswing. \nUS stock prices have rallied on growing optimism that tax legislation will become law. \nDEFICIT WARNING \nBut on Wednesday, the head of sovereign credit ratings at S&P Global told Reuters that the rising deficit and looser fiscal policy could prompt negative action on U.S. credit ratings unless Washington addressed long-term budgetary issues. \n\u201cIf U.S. tax reform is approved, it seems certain to increase the federal budget deficit,\u201d Moritz Kraemer, S&P\u2019s sovereign global chief rating officer, said in an interview. \n\u201cA meaningful relaxation of fiscal policy without countervailing measures to address the longer-term fiscal challenges of the U.S. could lead to a negative rating action.\u201d \nSenate Republicans later voted down a Democratic motion instructing tax negotiators to produce a deficit-neutral bill. \nPassage of the tax bill would provide a badly needed legislative victory for Trump and Republicans after their failure earlier this year to enact legislation repealing President Barack Obama \u2019s signature healthcare law. \nTrump and his Republican allies see enacting the tax overhaul that they promised voters as crucial to their strategy for the 2018 U.S. congressional elections, when all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 33 seats in the 100-member Senate will be up for election. \nDemocrats have been united against the bill, calling it a handout to corporations and the rich that would drive up the federal deficit. \nIn an early sign of progress on reconciling the House and Senate versions, Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the tax-writing Finance Committee, said he did not think that the final bill would retain a corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT). \nThe House bill calls for a repeal of the corporate AMT, which is designed to limit the ability of corporations to reduce their payments through tax breaks and credits. Corporate AMT repeal is not part of the Senate version. \nGetting rid of the corporate AMT would be popular with many businesses and would also be a concession toward the House bill. \nBut repeal would also require lawmakers to replace the $40 billion in revenues that retaining the corporate AMT would raise over a decade. Increasing the corporate income tax target from 20 percent is seen as one way to pay for the AMT repeal and other potential changes. \u201cI\u2019ll keep it at 20 if I can, but there\u2019s a drive to get it to 22. They want more money, that\u2019s why,\u201d Hatch told reporters.

As the new proposal seeks to slash the corporate tax rate, investors have lifted shares of banking stocks, with the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund up 6% over the past two weeks. On top of the idea that the tax bill could provide a boost to the financial industry\u2019s bottom line , analysts\u2019 bullish notes on a pickup of growth in the industry has also worked to help stocks. (See also: Trump Tax Plan \u2018As Good as It Gets\u2019 for US Banks. ) Gradual Fed Interest Rate Hikes to Lift Profits \n\u201cI think the strength that we\u2019re seeing, and it started a couple of weeks ago, I think that\u2019s marking a new leg of outperformance here,\u201d said Oppenheimer\u2019s Ari Wald in an interview with CNBC. \n\u201cWhat gives us conviction that this strength can continue is just how broad-based it's been. It's not just the banks; it's the banks, it's the brokers, it's insurance companies, it's the online exchanges, it's the asset managers . What we think this is, is a new turn, a round of leadership that should continue into the first quarter of 2018,\" said Wald. \"Buy financials. They're breaking higher.\" The Oppenheimer analyst specifically recommends buying Bank of America Corp. ( BAC ). \nLast week, Wall Street research firm CFRA also upgraded its outlook on financials. Analyst Lindsey Bell suggested that banks should benefit from a gradual improvement in loan growth, along with more interest rate hikes under the incoming Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. Higher interest rates lead to an increase in bank profits by widening the difference between the interest income generated from loans and the amount of interest paid out to savings account holders.

Man Commits Suicide Over N300,000 Debt In Ibadan December 07, 2017 Another man, a 57-year-old, identified as Olajire Otunla on Monday was reported to have commit suicide by hanging himself over an alleged N300,000 debt, DAILY POST reports. The incident which occurred at SW8/634, Oke-Ado in Ibadan, the Oyo state capital at about 1:30pm on Monday left neighbours and other residents in the environs shocked as majority of them who spoke with journalists informed that the deceased was an easy-going and hardworking man. The body of the deceased has since been deposited at the Adeoyo mortuary. Wife of the deceased, Mrs Monisola Otunla in a pensive mood described her husband as an easy going person. She said \u201cMy husband was a trader who deals in men\u2019s underwears, he was a very hardworking man. He did not go to where he sells his wares today so he was indoors.\u201cAt about 1:30pm, I went upstairs to drop some of the kitchen utensils I used and start preparation for tommorow\u2019s business as my shop is located downstairs. I knocked the door to our rooms, there was no response, that was when I raised the alarm and the neighbours joined me to forcefully open the door only to get in inside the bedroom to find his lifeless body with rope around his neck tied to the window burglary protection iron rods\u201d. She, however, said about a debt of 300,000 her husband was owing may be responsible for him taking his life. She said, \u201cAlthough, he has not been sharing series of challenges he was facing, but I am aware of the fact that he was owing the sum N300,000. Maybe that was what prompted him to take his life because he did not leave a suicide note\u201d. One of his children, Bolade Otunla said she was surprised to receive a call that her father had taken his own life. She said, \u201cI just got a call from someone that I should come home right away that my father had taken his own life. This is so shocking, I still cannot comprehend what could lead to his action\u201d. The deceased it was gathered was survived by four children, two males and two females, two of which are already graduates. DAILY POST learnt that one of them had her graduation ceremony two weeks ago while the second is preparing for his convocation ceremony scheduled to hold next two weeks. Na Wa O!!

PLASTIC BAN All 193 UN states are members of the UNEA. \"Some of the actions will have to do with the way we produce and the way we consume,\" Thiaw said. \"Our models of production and consumption will have to change. We do not have to have models of production and consumption that harm the environment and keep killing us.\" This would require \"very clear policies\" from governments at the national and local level, said Thiaw, such as banning single-use plastic shopping bags. Mobile phones could be upgraded and reused instead of being replaced every few years, and plastic straws prohibited, for example. PLEDGES \"Every year we dump 4.8 to 12.7 million tonnes of plastic in our oceans and generate over 40 million tonnes of electronic waste,\" the ministerial declaration said. The UN Environment Programme said it had received 2.5 million anti-pollution pledges, including from national governments, municipalities, businesses and individuals by Wednesday. They include commitments, which are non-binding, to ban plastic bags, curb air pollution, or green public transport. Some 88,000 individuals also made pledges, undertaking to switch to less-polluting fuel, for example, or to use less plastic and recycle more. Taken together, if all the commitments by governments, businesses and civil society are honoured, they would lead to 1.4 billion people breathing clean air, said Jacqueline McGlade, who co-authored a pollution report for the assembly. KILLER Furthermore, 480,000 kilometres (almost 300,000 miles) \u2014 a third of the world's coastlines \u2014 will be unpolluted, and $18.6 billion dollars (15.7 billion euros) will be invested in anti-pollution research and innovation. The assembly heard this week that pollution has become the biggest killer of humans, claiming nine million human lives every year \u2014 one in six deaths worldwide. Of the annual tally, nearly seven million people succumb from inhaling toxins in the air \u2014 from car exhaust fumes, factory emissions and indoor cooking with wood and coal, according to a recent report by The Lancet medical journal. Lead in paint alone causes brain damage in more than half-a-million children every year. RESOLUTIONS The assembly adopted a dozen pollution-curbing resolutions \u2014 urging governments to ban the use of lead in paint, step up \"actions\" to prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds by 2025, and urging member states to set ambitious air quality standards. The president of the UNEA meeting, Costa Rica's environment minister Edgar Gutierrez, lamented on Wednesday that humans \"haven't done a good job\" managing Earth's natural bounty. \"The room we have for making more mistakes is very narrow,\" he warned. ACTION Environmental group Greenpeace welcomed the assembly outcome, stressing the resolutions must now be put into action. \"Whilst leaders talk, the tide of plastic, chemicals and air pollution keeps growing,\" Greenpeace East Asia campaigner Cheng Qian said in a statement. \"The decisions made here must be actioned, implemented and accelerated if we are to stand a chance of restoring the health of our planet.\" Related Stories", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jacqueline mcglade", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibrahim thiaw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cheng qian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thiaw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edgar gutierrez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "un environment programme", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "unea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the lancet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenpeace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenpeace east asia", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "costa rica", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:55.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a0aeb8b9e43f46e21d5198a4da3d381bdc17df2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSuUEHVPsJMGKzZG0Y8ZY3SuDlZBXT04D3xxGwQENI.5mhkJ_XoEtGbvgS09AOjps-", "site_full": "foorum.hinnavaatlus.ee", "site": "hinnavaatlus.ee", "site_section": "https://foorum.hinnavaatlus.ee/viewforum.php?f=3", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "vaata foorumit - Arvutitehnika ja tarkvara m\u00fc\u00fck/vahetus :: Hinnavaatluse Foorumid", "title": "Snowflake ITX i7 Gamer", "title_full": "Snowflake ITX i7 Gamer :: Hinnavaatluse Foorumid", "published": "2017-12-07T12:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "EE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 63969, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a0aeb8b9e43f46e21d5198a4da3d381bdc17df2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSuUEHVPsJMGKzZG0Y8ZY3SuDlZBXT04D3xxGwQENI.5mhkJ_XoEtGbvgS09AOjps-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "loe/lisa", "published": "2017-12-07T12:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "Snowflake ITX i7 Gamer", "text": "Pakkumisel vaikne ja v\u00f5imas, v\u00e4rskelt kokku laotud stiilne masin m\u00e4ngimiseks!\nM\u00e4ngib uuemaid m\u00e4nge 60+FPS @ 1920x1080 resolutsioonil!\n[b]PROTSESSOR: Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 i7-4770 Processor (8M Cache, up to 3.90 GHz)\nPROTSESSORI JAHUTI: Intel Stock Cooler\nEMAPLAAT: ASRock H81M-ITX/WIFI\nVAHEM\u00c4LU: 8GB HyperX Savage 1600Mhz [V\u00f5imalik juurde lisada!]\nVIDEOKAART: MSI ARMOR 2X GTX 970 4GB/ GTX 1070 8GB\nSSD: Samsung EVO 850 250GB\nHDD: V\u00f5imalik lisada!\nTOITEPLOKK: SuperPower 650W\nKORPUS: Thermaltake Core V1 (Snow Edition)\n*Kaasa: voolukaabel, m\u00f5ned karbid!\nGarantii 12-kuud!

One men's team and one women's team will get that opportunity.\nWith two days left of round-robin play, the playoff picture is getting a little clearer as teams are slowly being eliminated from contention.\nKevin Koe's team out of Calgary is the first to earn a spot in the playoffs. They did so Wednesday afternoon by defeating John Epping 6-4.\nLIVE BLOG: Canadian curling trials Carey gets emotional win after death of her grandfather\n\"Our first goal is done. Obviously that's great,\" Koe said. \"Now we just have to get hot on the weekend.\"\nKoe's team is undefeated through six games. He's the only unbeaten men's team left at the trials.\n\"I'm feeling good and felt really good out there today,\" Koe said after Wednesday's win.\n\"It's the biggest event and you have to do everything you can to get ready. I'm throwing with a lot of confidence out there right now.\"\nKoe needs just one more win to earn a spot directly into Sunday's final, something he says is crucial.\n\"It's one less chance you have to step out there and possibly lose,\" he said. \"And it's always a little reassuring to start with the hammer.\"\nBrad Gushue defeated Mike McEwen 8-3 Wednesday night to run his record to 4-2. McEwen dropped to 4-2.\nGushue has now won two games in a row and three out of his last four.\nTaking time for the fans, as always. @TeamGushue signing autographs after their 4th win at the Trials. #cbccurl pic.twitter.com/DPwILoY5HY\n\u2014 @Devin_Heroux \"I'd feel better if we were in Koe's spot but we're moving in the right direction,\" Gushue said. \"We're getting more confident as the week goes on.\"\n\"I thought there would be a logjam up front with ourselves, Jacobs, McEwen, Koe and Carruthers.\"\nAfter Gushue and McEwen there are a bunch of teams still trying to find a way into the playoffs.\nBrad Jacobs, Reid Carruthers and Brendan Bottcher are still alive, sitting with three losses. Four losses is mathematically still in the playoff picture (but it's a long shot).\nWomen's side still up for grabs There's only one women's undefeated team left at the trials.\nChelsea Carey won an emotional game Wednesday afternoon over reigning Olympic champion Jennifer Jones 7-5 to remain perfect at 5-0.\nChelsea Carey remains undefeated after victory over Jennifer Jones 0:59\nOn Saturday, as the trials were beginning, Carey's grandfather died. The funeral was held in Winnipeg just hours before her game against Jones in Ottawa.\n\"I told my mom before the game he was in my heart today,\" Carey said. \"He was an amazing man. He was the kindest, most gentle soul I've maybe ever met.\"\nCarey's third, Cathy Overton-Clapham, has won five Scotties championships but never an Olympic berth. She says the key to success at big bonspiels starts with a confident skip.\n\"One of the biggest things is your skip reading the ice and playing well,\" Overton-Clapham said. \"And when I've won championships that's always been the case. I think Chelsea has a great handle on draw weight.\"\nIn the night draw on Wednesday, Rachel Homan made a heart stopping double to score four in the tenth end to defeat Casey Scheiddeger 10-7 and earn a fifth win.\nAfter the shot Homan, who normally holds back her emotion, waved her arms to the crowd as they erupted in cheers.\n\"It was a battle and making that last one was all of our emotions coming out,\" she said. \"That was amazing. It was so awesome to have everyone here. It was fun to play and fun to make that last shot.\"\nShe did it! And the place goes crazy. @TeamHoman wins a thriller over Scheidegger for 5th win. #cbccurl pic.twitter.com/wlMuyyAHkW\n\u2014 @Devin_Heroux With the win, Homan is tied with Jennifer Jones for second with a record of 5-1.\nKrista McCarville's team is still alive and in the playoff hunt after stealing two in the 10th end and defeating Allison Flaxey 8-7. At 3-2, McCarville has a massive upcoming game against Jones Thursday afternoon.\nIt sets up a dramatic Thursday of curling at the Olympic trials in Ottawa.\nThe top three teams on the men's and women's side advance to the playoffs. The first-place team goes directly into the finals on Sunday. The second and third-place teams play in the semifinals on Saturday to determine who will move onto the final.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Devin_Heroux/status/938606612834635777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/cbccurl?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/Devin_Heroux/status/938605093854773248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/TeamGushue?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/TeamHoman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/wlMuyyAHkW", "https://t.co/DPwILoY5HY"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mcewen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rachel homan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "casey scheiddeger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacobs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelsea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "krista mccarville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelsea carey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike mcewen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad jacobs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reid carruthers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "overton-clapham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mccarville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scheidegger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brendan bottcher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin koe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad gushe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cathy overton-clapham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john epping", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carruthers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "homan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allison flaxey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gushue", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "ottawa ottawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ottawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "winnipeg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calgary", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:55.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9ab8822bbe63e23d361c23e2210f371c7b5c0e09", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg83.Qbxd2VNsvuYb6EmDdFYDEoeP1l4ZH3vbg5ijZERjsf8c9t0ZC5DUao.fvfO.OH9CvkTnKvlKA--", "site_full": "www.marilynvossavant.com", "site": "marilynvossavant.com", "site_section": "http://www.marilynvossavant.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=1", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Marilyn vos Savant \u2022 View forum - Magazine column", "title": "Why do pigeons live in cities?

A couple of years ago, DH and I simultaneously and unbeknownst to each other started looking for more social opportunities.  He found a group who kayaks, something he had been wanting to take up, and I found a book club that meets monthly about 15 miles from us. My group has been around for a long time but I just hadn't gone searching for anything in many years.  They are the best!  And it isn't just me saying that.  A few people have joined after me and some have left having moved away.  We always get reports back through their friends that they have tried to find a group as good in their new town but haven't been successful.\n\nWhat makes my book club great?  We talk about the book.  It isn't gossipy.  Our organizer starts and ends on time and generally keeps us on track.  We don't do food or drink so there are no obligations to whip up an impressive dessert when it is your turn to host.  You don't even have to ever host or lead the discussion.  We all read the same book each month with a mix of fiction and non-fiction. We nominate and vote on the books to read once per year.\n\nThrough our discussion, we discover a bit about each other here and there whatever people want to share but only as it relates to the book.  Very few members are native to this area originally and many have moved here in recent years.  They are also 'my people' politically which is a rarity in this part of the country.\n\nThe first Christmas I was in the club I made these types of bookmarks.  I placed them on the table in the center of the room and let people choose one if they wanted.  I think most of our members are still reading printed books at least part of the time.  Since we've had some new people join up, I thought I'd do this again this year. I've also made some more traditional bookmarks using stamps and and papers from October Afternoon's Public Library collection.\n\nIronically, I just bought myself a tablet so I'm starting to read books in that format and am enjoying it.  I still like the traditional bound book and many of the ones we read - both fiction and non-fiction - are found at our local libraries so my bookmarks won't sit idle.\n\nMaking these is easy with a gelli plate, stencils and packing tape.  It takes a little time as you have to wait between coats for the paint to dry but you get 5 bookmarks per print on an 8x10 plate.  Here's the video: \n\nAt our December meeting, the author of our latest book \"With Love from the Inside\", Angela Pisel, is coming to our meeting.  She is local and I'm anxious to find out how she did the research for this book with one of the characters on death row and what inspired her to tell this mother/daughter story. \n\nDo you have a social club you just love?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "angela pisel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "public library", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:55.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "be242adfd79d769d1597f1c683fcb0a15bf04898", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.1X6UnAQck4sM.iGDo9DZHlgQkZuMVz0urcPX4bIZlLn0RPedtkxSYVV24t6erfKYP25VHBb9cDg--", "site_full": "www.lisaedesign.com", "site": "lisaedesign.com", "site_section": "http://www.lisaedesign.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Lisa E Design Blog", "title": "Bookmarks for Book Club", "title_full": "Bookmarks for Book Club", "published": "2017-12-01T15:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b94bc119dccd2489f678947bdeae00a917c1c6f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.1X6UnAQck4sM.iGDo9DZHlgQkZuMVz0urcPX4bIZlLn0RPedtkxSYVV24t6erfKbPFBlnDzP9kDn2KNe6MMAN", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Gab", "published": "2017-12-07T10:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Those bookmarks are just gorgeous Lisa!
