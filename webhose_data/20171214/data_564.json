Hang in there!", "text": "\nThis week is one of the hardest weeks so far during motherhood years (4y11m)! I am going on an emotional turmoil! How could I be should emotional when it is just my (eldest) girl going to school? Can I just shake it off \u2013 I have just one less to care for half a day? No, I couldn\u2019t careless!\nI care ALOT about her feelings and how she will face it! And because of that \u2013 my emotions is going on a roller coaster ride! When she leaves home feeling sad or saying \u2018I want mama\u2019, I feel just very down. When she is away, I am \u2018worried\u2019 (and further down if she cried when she left!) The best part is picking her up \u2013 to see her happy face (hearing her call mama out when she sees me out of the car) \u2013 I feel so relieved! Even happier when both the siblings playing together so hard because they miss one another. I feel sad/touched with her telling me how much she misses mama, Mei Mei and mui mui! (she even remembered that i told her that she can feel mama by touching her heartbeat)! With going to school, she has become more \u2018attached\u2019 to me \u2013 she wants my attention and hug. Sometimes she comes to me with teary eyes. This coupled with tiredness, sometimes I do get mad when her demands become so unreasonable, yet I feel guilty for feeling mad! The worst thing is she misses papa too and papa is busy with work -coming home late night \u2013 imagine she woke herself up at 1130pm to eat and sleep with her papa! \nSeriously, I am goingggg \u2018crazy\u2019 soon but I know I have to hang in there! This is just a phase, a transition. Every phase comes with challenges and when it passes \u2013 you will just laugh at it! (Says a friend)\n\nIn a happier note, today when she saw me \u2013 the first thing she told me was \u2013 I played at the playground today and we picked leaves! I reminded her isn\u2019t that similar to what we have done in the past. She even told me that there were 5 of them in class today! And she didn\u2019t snack any of her snacks (but will eat them on our way back \u2013 which she did)! I saw her water tumbler and question if she finished it. She said yes and she can actually refill it in school! Then she told me she ate rice, soup and egg for lunch! I also told her what I (without Nikki in the pic \u2013 I didn\u2019t tell her we went post office) did \u2013 like cooking, cleaning the kitchen and tidying up the bed! We also laughed about how Nikki slept on the floor while Norrah was on the bouncer. I showed her the picture too! I told her I got her more blueberries, dragon fruit and seaweed noodles from market today. I shared with her what me and Mei Mei ate for lunch too! ALL this small talks would not happen if she didn\u2019t go school! So, I will definitely take this positively!\nAnyway, I did hint that she needs to wear the uniform to school tomorrow. And she replied \u2018ahaaaa\u2019!

That is especially true of journalists who, if they are not careful, can get carried away dealing with the constant stream of rumours and innuendo they are being fed.\n\nOf course the difference between a proper journalist and somebody riffing it on social media is that the former tends to check their sources and approach the more unbelievable stories with caution. Every now and again though, somebody might decide that even if what they are being told is not credible, it suits their paper's agenda and so it is worth running with it.\n\nAs far as I can see that last scenario is the only rationale for this story in today's Sun in which they say that supporters of the Brexit Secretary, David Davis have seized on Theresa May\u2019s latest Brexit woes to start building another plot to sack her and put him into 10 Downing Street instead. \n\nThey say that one of Davis' closest allies, former chief whip Andrew Mitchell is organising discreet drinks evenings with him and new generation Tory MPs:\n\nThree of the newly elected high-flyers invited to one soiree last week were Tom Tugendhat and James Cleverly \u2013 both tipped as future party leaders \u2013 as well as highly respected rookie Gillian Keegan. \n\nUnder the \u2018dream ticket\u2019 plot, Mr Davis would take over as Prime Minister from beleaguered Mrs May, but only for a few years. \n\nThe 68-year-old former SAS reservist would then stand aside for one of the new generation elected in 2015 or 2017 to take over in time to prepare for the 2022 general election. \n\nA key ally of Mr Davis told one of the younger Tory MPs: \u201cTheresa has the smell of death around her. \u201cShe\u2019ll be gone by Christmas. It\u2019s time to rally around DD.\u201d \n\nDavid Davis of course is the Brexit Secretary who led Parliament to believe that there were 58 top secret reports assessing the impact of Brexit on key sectors of the economy, only to reveal that they didn't exist when the House of Commons insisted on seeing them. He makes Theresa May look like a giant on the world stage and that is saying something. \n\nI won't comment on his performance in negotiating Brexit with Brussels, except to point out that he has effectively been relieved of the really important stuff by the Prime Minister herself. Perhaps that is what has upset his fan club.\n\nFor the rest of us, we have to reflect that if David Davis is the answer to the incompetence of the UK Government and their determination to drive us over an economic and constitutional cliff then it must be time to rephrase the question. \n\nThe idea is so absurd that the only reason I can see for publishing the story is to further destabilise the Prime Minister and her government to make way for a more realistic contender for the leadership, if such a person exists.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom tugendhat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james cleverly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gillian keegan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew mitchell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "house of commons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cardiff bay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:22.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a0485561a0650c664d173c60d30abd1377d6f3ef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_NH9fkgknESdY0kstTUd.SjCtiZ0XN1lCPt8z028ODwuHHPglIvFcW71AaNAV.lmM-", "site_full": "www.zerodayinitiative.com", "site": "zerodayinitiative.com", "site_section": "http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/published/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Zero Day Initiative", "title": "Zero Day Initiative", "title_full": "Zero Day Initiative", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a0485561a0650c664d173c60d30abd1377d6f3ef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_NH9fkgknESdY0kstTUd.SjCtiZ0XN1lCPt8z028ODwuHHPglIvFcW71AaNAV.lmM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "anonymous", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Zero Day Initiative", "text": "Microsoft Edge Undo Command Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure Vulnerability ZDI-17-725 : September 12th, 2017 CVE ID CVE-2017-8661 CVSS Score 4.3, (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) Affected Vendors Microsoft\nAffected Products Edge\nTippingPoint\u2122 IPS Customer Protection TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID 28919.

He is a golden person to have in our district right now.\u201d \nTrussell had Hattiesburg High School at the peak of success this year as all of its varsity sports were elected to the MHSAA Scholarly Team with a 3.0 or higher grade point average and ranked No. 7 in the ALL Sports Award voting in Class 5A. \nLosing a leader like Trussell will hurt Hattiesburg and that\u2019s what its head football coach Tony Vance told SHS coach Chris Jones. \n\u201cThe day they made the announcement (Vance) said, \u2018you\u2019ve got me down here crying. You just took the best AD in the state and you\u2019ve got a good one,\u2019 so I\u2019m looking forward to it,\" Jones said. \"I heard he is going to do some good things and he\u2019s got a good track record.\u201d \nNot only has Trussell worked in a large area like Hattiesburg, but he also has experience as assistant director of athletics in the Jackson Public School District from 1999-2002. \nDuring his time in Jackson, Trussell was responsible for scheduling, coordinate and direct the Interscholastic Athletic Programs of the district. He also served as a representative to the Mississippi High School Activities Association. \nThe Jackets welcomed Trussell to town on Wednesday during a press conference and the coaches are ready to jump in there with him and go to work. \n\u201cSounds like it\u2019s going to be fun,\u201d SHS baseball coach Travis Garner said. \u201cYou talk about a guy with a lot of experience at big schools. It seems he is all about athletics, all about the kids and all about the coaches.\u201d \nTrussell is eager to get started.

If you\u2019ve planned a conference before, or if you haven\u2019t but have a little bit about you (which you must do, because you\u2019re planning a conference), you\u2019ll know that \u035eplan carefully\u035f is redundant tip. \nOf course, you\u2019ll plan carefully; the mechanics of careful planning, seating, catering and timing are only the bare bones of a conference, not what makes it a success. Those things are the minimum participants expect, not a way to give the attendants a conference to remember. \nWe\u2019re going to break down the ways you can plan a conference with the wow-factor,to enthuse your participants and make them advocates. \n1.Ice Breakers \nEven if you\u2019ve got a room full on entrepreneurs and go-getters, everyone is a little shy when gathered in a room full of people they don\u2019t know. \nPart of the reason people attend conferences is to meet others in their field and to network. An icebreaking session may be a little impractical in a large lecture hall, but if there are ever smaller groups in your conference like seminars or workshops, plan a cool icebreaker. \nIf attendees leave feeling they\u2019ve made valuable connections, that will give your conference some strong accreditation. \n2.Killer Design \nDesign involves a lighter touch than pure planning. Get creative in the way your conference will look, and watch as, on the day, people are more and more impressed. \nPart of this is how you work with the space you\u2019ve got; part of it is choosing a great space. \nPeople will be enthused about being by the seaside in the summer months, especially if your venue has a great vista, and even a pool. These touches will help give your conference the wow-factor. If that kind of thing is a little out of your budget, no fear. \nMake sure that the spaces you\u2019ve got are engaging and visually stimulating without being overcrowded. Think about lighting that\u2019s soft- not harsh, but not sleep-inducing. Include a funky chill-out area with beanbags, an area with outside seating where attendees can network and have a coffee. Leave people feeling that they\u2019ve been somewhere special. \n3.Get Interactive \nYour audience are here to learn, sure, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t want to engage. A little bit of interactive engagement goes a long way with conference participants, and really gives your conference that extra pizzazz. \nThere are lots of ways you can encourage a more active participation. Quite an efficient way to encourage feedback is through soliciting it with a mobile app. If you get your participants to engage in polls on how they rate segments of the event, and broadcast it across screens in real time, that can be an effective form of engagement. It\u2019s a very easy technique which comes across as very sophisticated. \n4.Content is Queen \nMake sure that your speakers and workshop leaders are chosen not just because they are industry leaders, but also because they are charismatic and engaging. You want them to deliver high-quality and exciting speeches and presentations, that are valuable for all your attendees. \nIf you are sure the form- the delivery- is going to be good, ask for a preview of your speaker\u2019s contents to check that\u2019s up to scratch too. After all- content is Queen. \n5.Professional Entertainment \nA lot of people advise waiting until the end of the day until there\u2019s any entertainment at all, but that rule doesn\u2019t have to be hard and fast. In the summer months, try giving your attendees a longer lunch and a slightly later close time, and provide some entertainment too. This is even better if it\u2019s participatory, like a pancake flipping contest. This will make people laugh, and laughter is a sure-fire way to forge connections between strangers. \nIn the evening, offer a way for people to wind down and socialize as a form as entertainment. Maybe invite a comedian to help people wind down, and put on a cover band at the boozy reception to help people walk away feeling they attended something special.

I have two Advent hopes. First of them for me and other one is for the people on earth. Thanks God that I achieved my hope that was meeting with brothers and sisters. It was a gift from God. I am thankful to GOD for that. I am also homesick of Woodcrest and I had missed my brothers and sisters at Woodcrest . God helped me to achieve this hope. I joined the meeting with brothers and sisters on Advent breakfast meeting on first Advent. The other Advent of mine is PEACE AMONG ALL PEOPLE on earth. I know that each one of us can do something for that. Peace starts by smiling as mother Teresa said. And we can do more than smiling ; we can forgive and remember that we belong each other and peace is in our hearts. \n\u201cAdvent Prayer\u201d \nwe wait for your coming, and in our grinding despair we doubt that you will. . . . \nGive us the grace and the impatience to wait for your coming to the bottom of our toes, to the edges of our fingertips. We do not want our several worlds to end. Come in your power and come in your weakness in any case and make all things new. Amen. \n\u2013Walter Brueggeman, Awed to Heaven, Rooted in Earth: Prayers of Walter Brueggemann A few years ago, the same year our family of six moved from upstate New York, where we\u2019d lived our whole lives, to follow God\u2019s calling in Austin, Texas, we discovered for the first time what it means to feel sad in the season approaching Christmas. Our children, aged thirteen to twenty, desperately missed friends and family whose presence in our lives had defined our holiday traditions. It wasn\u2019t our first year to mark Advent, but in many ways, we noticed for the first time the meaning of its weeks of prayer, moderation, and lament. Our homesickness made us vulnerable, open to the wisdom and nourishment of the church\u2019s historic calendar. \nAs in previous years, we lit a candle every night, prayed together, and squinted in the darkness to read a daily scripture and prayer. As newly-practicing Anglicans, we closed our prayer time by making the sign of the cross by candlelight, hoping that all we\u2019d said and heard would be sealed within us until we met around the table again. \nBut, in the great tension of flesh and spirit that all of us must suffer, we also yawned a great deal, and often wished we could hurry back to television, homework, bed: the ordinary detritus of our home waiting to grab our attention as soon as we blew out the candles. At times, we bent our heads in quiet confession only to end up blurting out awkward apologies. At other times, we left apologies unsaid. In the middle of it all, we giggled at the juxtaposition of our everyday American lives with the often preposterous imagery spoken by blustery Old Testament oracles, wonder-struck gospel witnesses, and alarmed visionary writers of the apocalypse all converging in an infant born in a small-town shed. \nIt wasn\u2019t just the language of scripture \u2013 rod of Jesse, a virgin birth, bowls of wrath, ancient betrothal customs, plowshares and pruning hooks \u2013 that struck us as strange. Hope itself is absurd. In her poem \u201cAfter the Annunciation,\u201d Madeleine L\u2019Engle concurs: \nThis is the irrational season when love blooms bright and wild. Had Mary been filled with reason there\u2019d have been no room for the child. \nOur family needed to embrace the irrationality of Advent hope. To practice, we made a list of things we hoped for, checked the list twice, and each settled on one thing each of us really, really, really hoped would happen soon. Lonely and uncertain in our new city, we hoped for new friends and jobs to help pay for college. With our Northeast \u201cwhite Christmas\u201d dreams, we hoped to feel at home in the middle of a hot, arid December. As a mother, I staked my hope on God\u2019s promise to draw near to my children\u2019s homesick hearts \u2013 and to mine as well. We tentatively prayed, and listened for what the Father impressed on our minds and hearts. We asked him to make our hopes match up with his, and to help us know the difference. \nOur family needed to embrace the irrationality of Advent hope. \nBut the more we read and prayed together, the more I began to take comfort in the absurdity of the Advent narrative: a tiny nation of people who have been living for centuries in the darkness of unmet hope and unfulfilled promise finally receive what was prophesied in the form of a baby king born in a stable to a virgin mother and anxious father. The incarnation makes shepherds into royal guests and barn animals into silent midwives. So why not, I surmised, make the humble bric-a-brac of our new Texas life a part of the Advent story, and a reason to give thanks to the Giver of every good gift? \nAnd so, that first Advent away from the place we\u2019d always known as home, we made lists not only of our hopes, but also of our thanksgivings for the ordinary, everyday gifts that we often overlook. We invited each of our kids to place in the center of our Advent wreath one ordinary object that represented something of deep value and meaning. The wreath began to look quite ridiculous, covered with our little knickknacks. One daughter contributed a tiny plastic zebra (a gift from a New York friend); I added the flannel-wrapped beanbag that I popped into the microwave to warm sore muscles, tense from the work of moving and praying for my kids. Our Advent wreath that year was not something anyone would ever share on Pinterest. At the same time, I\u2019m not sure it has ever looked more beautiful. \nThe quirky objects cluttering our family altar reminded me of the apostle Paul\u2019s words to the Colossians: \nIn our prayers for you we always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints, because of the hope laid up for you in heaven. You have heard of this hope before in the word of the truth, the gospel that has come to you. Just as it is bearing fruit and growing in the whole world, so it has been bearing fruit among yourselves from the day you heard it and truly comprehended the grace of God. (Col. 1:3-6) \nFor the remaining weeks leading up to the great festival of Christmas, we\u2019d gather around our absurd little wreath to pray. Sometimes our prayers consisted of only one word, the rest unspoken as we listened for the comfort of a silent God-With-Us, sitting among us in our own version of a hillside cave. We sat in the dark kitchen, heavy with unmet expectations and uncertain outcomes, praying that the Messiah would come to us, to this messy dining table, and be born again in us. We gave thanks for the ordinary, sometimes peculiar ways, he daily made his goodness known to us, and we believed in the absurdity of hope that he would do it again.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "\u2013walter brueggeman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christ jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madeleine l\u2019engle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walter brueggemann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus christ", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:22.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db0e0a62d1ce6bc9abb169e12b2e98b5f6e5d370", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwpfpRw.8wzF9ehGIH9IrJvqxgmIeBD_U3UOVUzPYLjtOJn.y0uGHnTAhPmCEK9Vxaog.UMYLyyHA--", "site_full": "forums.moneysavingexpert.com", "site": "moneysavingexpert.com", "site_section": "http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/forumdisplay.php?f=90", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Household &amp; Travel - MoneySavingExpert.com Forums", "title": "SORN status", "title_full": "SORN status - MoneySavingExpert.com Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T08:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2270, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dac162c1c70dff004a6fa82ceaa491f101933a64", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwpfpRw.8wzF9ehGIH9IrJvqxgmIeBD_U3UOVUzPYLjtOJn.y0uGHnTAhPmCEK9VxaKyG8VtZMKffP.Dz6zA_5J0TtdEHRUw6I-", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "ohreally", "published": "2017-12-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "\u201c\nWhat site did you check on?

The expansion at Tropicana Gold Mine, a joint venture between AngloGold Ashanti which holds a 70 percent interest and Independence Group NL, is expected to add 2.1 million ounces and extend the mine's life by approximately seven years to 2027. By using a strip mining approach and reducing waste haulage distances by using in-pit backfill, the company said it had developed a more cost-effective way to mine waste. \"This project is in line with our approach of developing cost-effective brownfield projects with attractive payback periods that extend life and improve margins,\" said AngloGold Ashanti's Australian Senior Vice President Michael Erickson. AngloGold forecasts gold production at the mine of as much as 492,000 ounces next year and at least 530,000 ounces in 2019. Gold production over the remaining life of the Tropicana mine is forecast to be about 4 million ounces.

(Jason Schreiber/UNION LEADER CORRESPONDENT) BRENTWOOD \u2014 A Seabrook man was sentenced to 10 years in state prison and apologized in court for a vicious attack on his girlfriend as he pleaded guilty to a dozen charges.Fred McKenzie, 45, fought back tears as he stood before Rockingham County Superior Court Judge Marguerite Wageling on Wednesday to admit to the assault and told how he didn\u2019t want to put the victim through a trial and \u201crelive the nightmare\u201d that haunts him. \u201cThere\u2019s not a waking moment that I don\u2019t (think about it). Even when I try not to think about it I think about it,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI still love the woman.\u201dMcKenzie pleaded guilty to 12 domestic violence related charges resulting from the assault and attempted strangulation on June 7. They included four counts of second-degree assault, reckless conduct with a deadly weapon, criminal threatening, and six counts of domestic violence.As part of a plea deal, prosecutors dropped an attempted murder charge and two other charges.The charges to which he pleaded guilty accused McKenzie of applying pressure to the victim\u2019s neck or throat to impede her breathing and threatening to use scissors as a deadly weapon by pushing them against the victim\u2019s back while saying, \u201cI could paralyze you.\u201dMcKenzie also stuck the pair of scissors near her eye and caused the victim to cut her hand.He was also accused of terrorizing the victim and threatening murder by telling her that \u201cif I can\u2019t have you, no one will\u201d and \u201cyou are going to die tonight.\u201dAccording to the charges, McKenzie sat on the victim\u2019s torso, pinned her with his knees, put something around her neck and pulled, pulled her by her neck or hair, threw her to the floor, and pushed her against a wall.During his sentencing, McKenzie apologized for \u201cwasting the court\u2019s time to have to listen\u201d to his case.Wageling said it wasn\u2019t a waste of time. Calling it a \u201cterrible tragedy\u201d for McKenzie and the victim, she said she appreciated his honesty and willingness to accept responsibility and that he needs help.Assistant County Attorney Annaliese Wolf was pleased with the plea agreement.\u201cDomestic violence is a serious and pervasive issue, which should be highlighted and addressed in order to bring an end to this type of conduct. This plea is a fair and just resolution for the terror and violence that the victim endured that night. I hope this plea sends a message to the community that this behavior is not tolerated,\u201d she said. jschreiber@newstote.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "seabrook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jason schreiber fred mckenzie", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "marguerite wageling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason schreiber/union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "annaliese wolf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mckenzie", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rockingham county superior court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "seabrook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brentwood", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:23.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a93fccf138f5a9fed2169b5668ef5e36ed6feb42", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_wWkB_4GQJ89YEo4smCxXqO", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/x/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/x/ - Paranormal - 4chan", "title": "Luciferian Prayer.", "title_full": "/x/ - Luciferian Prayer. - Paranormal - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-06T18:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 116, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2983843389883074b8baef83a487f98aaafefbb8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_wWkB_4GQJ89UJbmS.BJ2OiTYv9OX8kTrk-", "ord_in_thread": 78, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T03:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>19998398\nplease help us understand, your 'dispute' and your anger, directed at Yaweh.\nwhy do you hate God?

Here's the link to the study: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02135939 . The stated purpose: In this randomized study the investigators aim to determine the effects of a whole-food plant-based vegan diet on markers of inflammation and glucometabolic profile in patients with cardiovascular disease. The investigators hypothesize that a whole-food plant-based vegan diet will reduce markers of inflammation and improve glucometabolic profile compared with the American Heart Association (AHA)- recommended diet at 2 months follow-up in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The investigators are also evaluating endothelial function using the EndoPAT device and stool microbiome. Food was provided for the eight weeks of this study. It's pretty astonishing to me that they had difficulty finding people willing to participate. Equally astonishing is the quote by Cleveland Clinic chairman of cardiovascular medicine: There is this cult around the vegan diet that I object to,\u201d Dr. Nissen says. \u201cPeople fervently believe a vegan diet will erase your heart [disease] but we can\u2019t tell the public to go out and have this diet based on flimsy science. The results: The NYU Langone team stated that \u201ca vegan diet significantly reduced systemic inflammation and improved lipid profiles in patients\u201d with coronary artery disease while \u201can AHA recommended diet did not. All the researchers agree that more study is needed, but meanwhile - let's eat plants!

Advertisement \n\u201cWe heard them cheering because it was an upset last time,\u201d said North senior Samantha Pirosko of the last meeting. \u201cThat gave us a lot of motivation to want to come in and play hard tonight.\u201d \nBehind Pirosko (17 points, 11 rebounds) and sophomore Destiny Leo (13 points, 12 rebounds), the Rangers controlled the paint, controlled the rebounding and controlled the tempo in general. \nIn doing so, North (2-2, 1-0) got an important road win in what is expected to be a rugged league race. Coach Paul Force doubts any team will run the table with a 14-0 record. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a big start,\u201d Force said. \nWhen the Wildcats\u2019 Katelyn Kinczel hit a pair of free throws at the 5:44 mark of the fourth quarter, Mayfield had pulled even with North, 39-39. It was Kinczel\u2019s putback 40 seconds into the fourth quarter that gave her team a 37-36 lead, its first lead since early in the first quarter. \nBut then the offense dried up. \nWhile North only scored seven points over the final 5:44, Mayfield scored none. \n\u201cWe wanted to be active,\u201d Force said of his team\u2019s defensive mindset. \u201cWe wanted them to get out of their comfort zone offensively. We wanted to limit them to one shot and control the boards. I think we did a good job of that.\u201d \nMayfield shot 15 of 49 (30.6) for the game, but was a chilly 1-for-10 in the fourth quarter. \n\u201cI think there were opportunities there,\u201d said Mayfield coach Ryan Looman. \u201cWe had some pretty good looks at the hoop, but shots weren\u2019t falling. \n\u201cIt was a failure to capitalize on some opportunities that were there.\u201d \nNorth had a number of opportunities to pull away. When Val Arnold hit a 3 in the second period, the Rangers had 27-16 lead, but buckets by Kinczel (18 points, 13 rebounds) and Catherine Rock (9 points, 7 rebounds) kept the team close in the third. And when Kinczel hit a 3 from the top late in the third, Mayfield only trailed, 31-29. \nBut North responded. Pirosko hit a reverse layup, followed by a steal and three-point play by Leo to open a 36-29 lead. \nAgain, North couldn\u2019t pull away. Mayfield\u2019s Leah Nerone buried back-to-back 3s to cut the margin to one at 36-35 going into the fourth. \nThen Mayfield turned frigid. \nNorth helped itself by making 13 of 17 free throws. Mayfield hit all four of its charity shots, but didn\u2019t get to the line enough for it to make a difference. \n\u201cYou can talk about it or practice it, but some days you shoot well and some days you don\u2019t,\u201d Force said of the free throws. \u201cMost days, when Destiny is at the line, we shoot well.\u201d \nLeo was a perfect 8-for-8. \nForce credited it as a team win, pointing to big 3-pointers by Arnold, Madelyn Hamilton, a big pass by Allie Chlad and some nice drives by Anaunda Lyons. \nWhile Kinczel shook loose for a big night, the defense on Jules DeBaltzo (who was held to three points) was clutch, too. \nNine of Mayfield\u2019s 15 field goals were 3-pointers. \n\u201cIf it\u2019s in the flow of the offense, in the rhythm and it\u2019s a good look, everybody has a green light,\u201d said Looman of his team\u2019s offense. \nBoth coaches agreed there is a lot of basketball left to be played in the WRC. Both North and Mayfield anticipate being in the race well into the new year. \n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to start 1-0,\u201d Force said. \u201cBut we\u2019re looking at Brush and Madison next week.

Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street to attend the weekly session of Prime Ministers Questions in Parliament in London, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017. \nLONDON (AP) - Ireland's government expects Britain to make a new proposal on Brexit by Friday as officials in London struggle to resolve issues surrounding the Irish border that are stalling talks with the European Union. \nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure to persuade EU leaders who meet next week to declare that sufficient progress has been made on divorce issues, such as the Irish border, so that trade talks can begin. Business leaders warn further delays will cause trouble for companies as they plan for the future. \nIreland's prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said Wednesday he hopes May will submit a new formal written offer \"tonight or tomorrow.\" \nDisagreements about how to treat the border between the Republic of Ireland and the U.K. province of Northern Ireland derailed an earlier proposal.

(March 20 - April 18): Don't review factors with the expectation that you'll arrive at the same result. Things can't return to the way they used to be. It's time to move on.\nTAURUS. (April 19 - May 19): Stop returning to a well that's run dry. Look around and you'll see that you're surrounded by other wellsprings of support.\nGEMINI. (May 20 - June 19): You won't like being told \"I told you so\", but if that's what it takes to regain an invaluable ally then do it. It's a small price to pay.\nCANCER. (June 20 - July 21): You want to acquiesce, but don't. You'd regret it. You may have the patience of a saint, but it doesn't mean you have to be a martyr.\nLEO. (July 22 - Aug. 21): You wonder if recent skirmishes were worth it. That's exhaustion talking. Take time to absorb what went down and you'll like what you see.\nVIRGO. (Aug. 22 - Sept. 21): Your feeling that somebody did you wrong may be based on a big misunderstanding. Extend the benefit of the doubt for now.\n J.K. Rowling Breaks Silence on Johnny Depp\u2019s 'Fantastic Beasts' Casting EWTime DJ LIBRA. (Sept. 22 - Oct. 21): Details emerge concerning an association and you could kick yourself for having been so trusting. But don't do anything now. Let developments unfold.\nSCORPIO. (Oct. 22 - Nov. 20): You're plagued by doubt even though you know that the path you've chosen is the right way to go. Persevere. It will all come together in the end.\nSAGITTARIUS. (Nov. 21 - Dec. 20): You're tying yourself in mental knots trying to force a fit where there isn't one. The best decisions are the one you can live with. Nothing less will do.\nCAPRICORN. (Dec. 21 - Jan. 18): You're working too hard at working hard. Loosen your hold on the reins and a project will find its own way home.\nAQUARIUS.

He was shot multiple times. The seven-year investigation into his death has been one of the Memphis Police Department\u2019s most high-profile unsolved cases. \nAuthorities haven\u2019t discussed details of the investigation.
