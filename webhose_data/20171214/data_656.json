Advertisement \n\"This is Australia: Fair, diverse, loving and filled for respect for everyone,\" said an effusive Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, as he introduced the bill for a final vote. \n\"This is a great day, it belongs to every Australian.\" \nThe move follows a two-month national postal survey that showed 61% of more than 12 million respondents were in favor of marriage equality. \nThe country is now the 24th in the world to allow same-sex couples to marry, according to Pew Research. \nAustralia's first same-sex weddings will not take place until at least January, however, due to a longstanding requirement for all Australian couples to provide a full month's notice of their intention to get married. \nHistoric moment \nMarriage equality campaigners have fought for years for Thursday's vote. Though the bill was expected to pass into law without significant opposition, the lengthy legislative process was excruciatingly slow for the hundreds of advocates watching from the public gallery. \nAmong them was Christine Forster, the gay sister of Tony Abbott, the former Australian Prime Minister who has long been seen as the face of the \"no\" campaign. \nForster was joined in the public gallery by her partner, Virginia Edwards. They plan to marry next year, and Abbott has said he'll attend despite his personal views. \nAbbott and other conservatives proposed amendments to the bill to include further religious protections, all of which were voted down. \n\"These amendments are important and I stress they are not against same-sex marriage, they are simply in favor of the rights of religious organizations to keep doing what their doing,\" Abbott said. \nOpponents of the changes argued they would legalize discrimination against the gay community. The 500 or so people in the gallery were vocal in their disapproval of the amendments. They were warned multiple times that parliamentary rules prohibit them making noise and even applauding. \nAn emotional week \nAfter the bill passed the Senate last week, House proceedings kicked off with fireworks Monday when Liberal MP Tim Wilson surprised his colleagues by proposing to his long-time partner Ryan Bolger. \nThe next day, Liberal MP Andrew Wallace, who is a devout Catholic, shared with his colleagues how his gay daughter helped change his position on same-sex marriage. \n\"She said: Dad, in the years to come, my generation will look back and judge your generation about how you deal with the issue of homosexuality in the same way that your generation considered your parents' generation in the way that they dealt with our Indigenous people,\" Wallace said. \nFighting back tears, Liberal MP Sarah Henderson told the story Wednesday night of a close gay friend of hers who died months ago and who, in one of their last conversations, asked her to continue to push for same-sex marriage. \nSurvey says yes \nThursday's vote comes three weeks after Australia voted overwhelmingly to legalize same-sex marriage as part of a national postal survey lasting two months. \nUnder political pressure to find a solution, the ruling Liberal National Coalition government announced the non-compulsory survey in August, saying if the result was \"yes\" they would allow a free vote in Parliament. \nIn the end, 61.6% of Australia voted in favor of allowing same-sex marriage, with 38.4% saying \"no.\" \nAbout 12.7 million people participated in the survey, which had a response rate of nearly 80% -- which is considered very high. \nAustralians have long been in favor of same-sex marriage, with polling from as long as 10 years ago showing a majority support for legalizing marriage equality.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine forster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia edwards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah henderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan bolger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pew research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal national coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:35.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1beea66d47edfff1ce1547c0004ec48fe7e22d92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacs7Fca5PnH78XVQO3wNjgfw2M1UKEhkglpez9_Wwgij9rO5lMfJWKh5VijW_dmDt47mFn0E4K3SE-", "site_full": "www.nairaland.com", "site": "nairaland.com", "site_section": "http://www.nairaland.com/jobs", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Jobs/Vacancies - Nigeria - Nairaland", "title": "Diamond Bank Is Recruiting For Graduate Trainees 2017 (21)", "title_full": "Diamond Bank Is Recruiting For Graduate Trainees 2017 - Jobs/Vacancies (21) - Nigeria", "published": "2017-12-06T05:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 951, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2b6c26001486aaeaad0bc095ea8f829a36f2a0c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xacs7Fca5PnH78XVQO3wNjgfw2M1UKEhkglpez9_Wwgij9rO5lMfJWKh5VijW_dmDt4px8t_AwrxpboWdtDVXtGNA--", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "jesusgirl92", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "How are these people sending their invites??

Hours later, another woman said Franken inappropriately squeezed \"a handful of flesh\" on her waist while posing for a photo with her in 2009. That brought the number of women alleging misconduct by Franken to at least eight. \nFranken, the former comedian who made his name on \"Saturday Night Live,\" faces a chorus of calls to step aside, and Democratic senators said they expected their liberal colleague to resign. \n\"Enough is enough,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. \"We need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is OK, none of it is acceptable, and we, as elected leaders, should absolutely be held to a higher standard.\" \nGillibrand was the first to call for Franken's resignation on Wednesday, but a torrent of Democrats quickly followed. \n\"I'm shocked and appalled by Sen. Franken's behavior,\" said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state. \"It's clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time. It's time for him to step aside.\" \nThough the writing appeared to be on the wall, Franken's departure was not certain. A tweet posted Wednesday evening on Franken's Twitter account said: \"Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate.\" \nLate in the day, Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York added his voice. \n\"I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately,\" Schumer said. \nThe resignation demands came in rapid succession even though Franken on Wednesday vehemently denied the new accusation that came from a former Democratic congressional aide, who said he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006. \nThe woman, who was not identified, told Politico that Franken pursued her after her boss had left and she was collecting her belongings. She said that she ducked to avoid his lips and that Franken told her: \"It's my right as an entertainer.\" \nFranken, in a statement, said the idea he would claim such conduct as a right was \"preposterous.\" \nBut it was soon clear that his position had become untenable. \nFellow Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who spoke to Franken, wrote on Twitter, \"I am confident he will make the right decision.\" \nThe pressure only mounted Tuesday, when Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., resigned after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. Rep Ruben Kihuen, D-Nev., faces pressure to resign as well over allegations reported by Buzzfeed that he repeatedly propositioned a former campaign worker. \nWhile Franken apparently is departing, Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore could be arriving, if he prevails in a Dec. 12 special election. Multiple women have accused the 70-year-old Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were teens and he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s. If Moore is elected, it could create a political nightmare for Republicans, who have promised an ethics probe. \nA national conversation about sexual harassment has intensified this fall after the heavily publicized case of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of many acts of sexual misconduct, including rape, by actresses and other women. Just on Wednesday, Time magazine named as its person of the year the \"silence breakers\" - women who have come forward on sexual harassment. \nPunishment has been swift for leaders in entertainment, media and sports while members of Congress have tried to survive the onslaught of allegations. \nFranken already faced a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into previous claims by several other women that he groped them or sought to forcibly kiss them. \nThe allegations began in mid-November when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan. \nOther allegations followed, including a woman who says Franken put his hand on her buttocks as they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Two women told the Huffington Post that Franken squeezed their buttocks at political events during his first campaign for the Senate in 2008. A fourth woman, an Army veteran, alleged Franken cupped her breast during a photo on a USO tour in 2003. \nFranken has apologized for his behavior but has also disputed some of the allegations. \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Juliet Linderman in Washington and Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Alabama, contributed to this report.

He says right now the city needs the provincial government\u2019s permission to do anything, and council needs the ability to enact and enforce its own bylaws. Small Solutions No Longer Working for Municipalities: Joyce \nMunicipal Affairs Minister Eddie Joyce says cookie cutter solutions aren\u2019t working anymore. \nThat was his response in addressing long-awaited changes to the Municipalities Act. \nJoyce announced yesterday that the provincial government is starting consultations to modernize the province\u2019s legislation governing municipalities. He says government needs to step back and look at the whole act with the help of the public. \nHe says rather than making small amendments, which has been the case for the past 30 years, now is the time to put the entire Municipalities Act on the table and see how government can make it better for all the residents of Newfoundland and Labrador.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "municipa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "joyce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eddie joyce", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "joyce new small solutions no longer working for municipalities", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "newfoundland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labrador", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:38.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "69f7b1fc463fdc5b71e2c81e45fbb621074710cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pEJmYP03ByBEOdb9tM_bGJKphdoF_t6XQ", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/aco/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/aco/ -

I also share other meaningful stories. This one really grabbed my heart. I\u2019ve shared this story during live events and I can never get through it without a few tears.\n\nKrissy\u2019s simplicity story \nMy friend Krissy, a development leader for big nonprofits, has saved every birthday card, wedding invitation, Christmas card, and birth announcement she has ever received. When her dad died unexpectedly from complications of heart surgery when she was twenty-six and her mom died eight years later after a six-month battle with pancreatic cancer, Krissy\u2019s box of cards became filled with more cards from the funerals and other things her parents left behind.\nWhen she began to declutter, she started with her boxes of saved cards. \u201cThe funny thing is that they were just sitting in a box in my closet. I never looked at them or read them,\u201d she says. She decided to read through all of the cards one last time and then let them go, with the exception of two birthday cards\u2014one from her mom and one from her dad. She forgot they were there, so it was a moving surprise to find them as they both included touching, handwritten messages. She now keeps both cards in her nightstand drawer.\nBy getting rid of the hidden boxes, she made room for the love that her parents shared with her in those notes and was able to deal with some of the grief that she hadn\u2019t known how to process when she was younger. She treasures the words and enjoys knowing that they are close to her heart.\nWhat I love about Krissy\u2019s story is how it not only demonstrates the power of letting go but reminds us that by holding on to everything, it\u2019s hard to remember what matters. When everything is important, nothing is. Krissy let go and traded her grief for love.\nIf you\u2019d like to read more \u2026 \npre-order the book here for some fun, simplicity-inspired bonus gifts learn about the closet make-under contest here join me on the Soulful Simplicity Book Tour The post How my friend Krissy traded her grief for love after losing her parents appeared first on Be More with Less .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "krissy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:39.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3cde95be71a8b74b965c39f3770f9fe25ec92368", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQu.wM6SL793dwpH4yL6CDnZ_7FAD8FaHmMe9oIhh6FRThFFd.5uC7oaZR7ZovZEFrIhvJu13OuOCCl3tWmMpKMiJQ1MNoJPADaVatsOjK_xg--", "site_full": "syracuse.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://syracuse.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist syracuse | for sale search", "title": "2007 tundra SR5 4x4 lifted (Syracuse) $12999", "title_full": "2007 tundra SR5 4x4 lifted (Syracuse) $12999", "published": "2017-12-07T10:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.craigslist.org/00W0W_7OmrAvx7yFW_600x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3cde95be71a8b74b965c39f3770f9fe25ec92368", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQu.wM6SL793dwpH4yL6CDnZ_7FAD8FaHmMe9oIhh6FRThFFd.5uC7oaZR7ZovZEFrIhvJu13OuOCCl3tWmMpKMiJQ1MNoJPADaVatsOjK_xg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "2007 tundra SR5 4x4 lifted (Syracuse) $12999", "text": "  2007 Toyota Tundra 4x4 with 125k miles 4door with chrome door handles and grill It's lifted runs great excellent shape inside out comes inspected doesn't need anything call or text   6409224277", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "syracuse", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:39.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8acd36594ad2a8ef27f1cd7ba48a20683f6db1b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqUxy3YpYTfWA1c_wkULsavKJQ2HzNRkl7CA1Rj3UBTI7h97wFSnjIyH3EFCLdUgRBAyCOoxpHJTIT8RvQFiuNH", "site_full": "britishcouncilvacancie.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://britishcouncilvacancie.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "All recent Jobs in British Council Vacancies in Nigeria and More", "title": "Willco Property Management Vacancy -

Global west subframe poly bushings. XXR 19\" rims with 265s up front on 305s in the rear. The engine is a 06 LQ4 (iron block LS2) with 100k miles that runs great. It has a CAI and a rewired standalone 3 wire harness. The computer has been retuned already for the set up about 400hp. The trans is the beefy 4L80e that will handle any abuse. It has Ls1 radiator and fans. EFI fuel tank with aeromotive 340 fuel pump installed.

It starts on the first try and sounds fantastic. I'm in no big hurry to sell the car. I just don't have the time like I used too. It's not a show car but built as a driver and autocross car. Like any finished project the car needs a couple bugs worked out of it, it may need new head gaskets. I have a new dash cap for it, the door panels are currently off in the pics because I'm adjusting the door glass. Do your research on the value of this car, eBay Barrett-Jackson mecum wherever. It's very rare to find a early 2nd gen built like this. I had it listed for $20k but it needs some attention and I don't have the time right now. $15k take it home as I found a Jeep I'd like to get.

The Getty Center lies shrouded in smoke as seen from Casiano Road in the Bel Air district of Los Angeles after the Skirball wildfire swept through, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017. \nBy AMANDA LEE MYERS and ANDREW DALTONAssociated Press \nVENTURA, Calif. (AP) - Southern California has felt yellow wind, orange wind, and red wind. But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.
