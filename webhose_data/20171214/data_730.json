Their Employees 1.4 K SHARES December 07, 2017 1.4 K SHARES We spend most of our day in the office, so it\u2019s only fair that employers throw in some perks and benefits that make the long hours and hard work less tiring. But some companies go the extra mile in looking after their employees. Leading the pack are companies like Airbnb, IKEA, and Netflix, who offer an array of perks that go beyond standard vacation and sick days. 1. Netflix The online streaming service provider does more than just give subscribers the opportunity to binge-watch shows when they aren\u2019t working. The company offers a year\u2019s worth of paid leave to new mothers and fathers. Throughout the year, the new parents can return part-time or full-time depending on their need and take time off as needed. \nnetflix 2. Airbnb Airbnb literally lives up to its name. The company offers its employees an annual stipend of $2,000 so that they can travel and live in any Airbnb listing around the world. Airbnb employees are indeed very lucky. \nairbnb 3. Adobe Adobe\u2019s required time off is a perk that we all can get behind. The company gives its employees one entire week off in December and one week over the summer. During these two weeks, the company downs its shutters so that everyone can enjoy time off work without feeling guilty. \nadobe 4. Starbucks Starbucks offers full tuition reimbursement to its employees. This benefit covers Starbucks\u2019 partnership with Arizona State University where the company\u2019s employees can earn their bachelor\u2019s degree with full tuition coverage. \nstarbucks 5. Accenture Accenture proudly supports the LGBT community and constantly strives to build an inclusive environment for the members of the community. As part of this initiative, the company even supports gender reassignment for its employees. \naccenture Don't Miss A School Principal Sexually Assaulted A 7-YO Student & Called It A \u2018Small Mistake\u2019 734 SHARES 6. Google Google is world famous for its swanky workplaces and employee benefits. It\u2019s a lesser known fact that the company offers a death benefit to its employees wherein the surviving spouse or partner of a deceased employee receives 50 percent of their salary for the next ten years. \ngoogle 7. Southwest Airlines There are many perks to enjoy if one works with an airline company. But Southwest Airlines does it differently. The biggest perk of working at Southwest is that all employees get free unlimited travel packages for themselves and their eligible dependents. \nsouthwest 8. Twitter When employees aren\u2019t tweeting, they are enjoying three catered meals a day. But this is a well-known benefit that the company provides its employees. In addition, employees are also treated to on-site acupuncture and improv classes. \ntwitter via cnbc 9. Deloitte At Deloitte, employees can avail two kinds of sabbatical programmes. First, a month-long sabbatical can be availed for any reason. Second, a three- to six-month break can be taken to pursue personal or professional growth opportunities. Employees can avail the latter with 40 percent pay. \ndeloitte 10. Walt Disney Company At the \u201cHappiest Place on Earth\u201d, employees of the Walt Disney Company are literally happy. The company provides its employees - along with their families and friends - free admission to all its parks. They also get discounts on hotels and merchandise. \nwalt disney 11. Salesforce The company takes its corporate social responsibility seriously. Employees at Salesforce get six days of paid volunteer leave every year so that they can spend time on social work. In addition, the company also gives employees $1,000 to donate to a charity of their choice. \nsalesforce It is imperative for companies to not only retain their employees but also keep them happy and interested at work. Perks and benefits go a long way in achieving this. 1.4 K SHARES ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "deloitte at deloitte", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "netflix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walt disney company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southwest airlines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "starbucks starbucks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "airbnb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netflix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ikea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "starbucks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "accenture accenture", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "southwest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "airbnb", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:35.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6448d544cf299f55dce56d6008cfdf78afbf1932", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFef5GBGxkW6xuslOV8Hx7QwLoIGZaZvWmqBcyUtXz2bAOC9rQkQC06BATXydvlZQAlb3BmyGiATEYuuTM9aDimAiiCGZVxpSSQSaH_nvAdI5WjUv2ODNuIeUPKhDTZCSHbTAuq4xmU_iVJkQhDPJ5BpUXmlOCiaVsejOuaeOeHQd80SQko3xNQA5Tg5e2t.lzXu5UTbLXGwBw-", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/discovertech/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Discover Tech - Buy Discover Tech at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "Marshall Major headphones With Mic Deep Bass DJ HiFi Headset Professional DJ Monitor Genuine New Version", "title_full": "Marshall Major headphones With Mic Deep Bass DJ HiFi Headset Professional DJ Monitor Genuine New Version | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2016-12-15T05:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 47, "participants_count": 39, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.124, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0930c0ee2e5da359c0dcd0fbf22584aeb069f56b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFef5GBGxkW6xuslOV8Hx7QwLoIGZaZvWmqBcyUtXz2bAOC9rQkQC06BATXydvlZQAlb3BmyGiATEYuuTM9aDimAiiCGZVxpSSQSaH_nvAdI5WjUv2ODNuIeUPKhDTZCSHbTAuq4xmU_iVJkQhDPJ5BpUXmlOCiaVsejOuaeOeHQd80SQko3xNQA5Tg5e2t.lzXAIq8Oh.wHufiC.uZCwfl3A--", "ord_in_thread": 44, "author": "Cheung Y.", "published": "2017-11-21T13:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "Product reached earlier than target", "text": "Packaging: Packaging was excellent.

remember how old Missy is now but she recovered perfectly well from it. She didn't have the more extensive surgery (TPLO/TTA where they cut/move bone) but a repair of the ligament if I remember rightly. Of course its down to personal choice but having been through cruciate tears/ruptures with two of my dogs now I could not watch my dogs continue with the pain/discomfort of having their knee joints unstable which is also causing arthritis to develop. Imagine how that feels to have your femur sliding forward and not held in place by the cruciate ligament. You mention your dog is a cross breed but haven't given us any idea of his size, some smaller breeds do respond well to conservative management but many do not and go on to need surgery despite a prolonged period of rest. Is he having any form of pain relief besides the Yumove Advance? Yumove Advance works well on my rottie bitch (she ruptured both cruciates aged 13 months and had bilateral TPLO surgery but does have arthritis in both front and both back legs) in conjunction with a NSAID, I understand those are not possible for your boy but what about something like Tramadol?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:35.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "677d8b94b256309ea8a9971879a979de0aed4644", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/r9R5Oks0axR3ChAtiQSiIpLlzmF8ki3yKbsRtkbNtonwtnrV3Eb0pUub8tQ0hKZV_ZV_D1jyUfo-", "site_full": "zougla7.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://zougla7.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "zougla", "title": "\u0391\u03bd \u03b5\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bc\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf \u03b8\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03c2", "title_full": "\u0391\u03bd \u03b5\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bc\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf \u03b8\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03c2", "published": "2017-12-07T12:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "677d8b94b256309ea8a9971879a979de0aed4644", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/r9R5Oks0axR3ChAtiQSiIpLlzmF8ki3yKbsRtkbNtonwtnrV3Eb0pUub8tQ0hKZV_ZV_D1jyUfo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "dionisis kokinos (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "\u0391\u03bd \u03b5\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bc\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf \u03b8\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03c2", "text": "Be like snow.

But there was a lot of drama for issues not relating to the game itself. \nOn Day 2 one noticed Lankan players wearing masks due to the smog. After a while they requested the umpires to stop play as it was impossible. The Indians were keen to bat on and after a brief interruption play resumed. But soon fielders started going off and the visitors were running short on players. \nAFP \nIn sheer frustration, Virat Kohli declared. But the matter was far from over as many Lankans were vomiting during India's second innings. It led to a wart of words as the hosts felt it was no big deal while the tourists felt conditions were not fit to play in. \nThe BCCI says it will take into account if Delhi shall get winter Tests when smog level is the highest. Meanwhile Sri Lanka's cricket board has complained to the ICC about having to play in unfavourable conditions. While cricket's leading body has said they will take action, one is yet to see what actions they take. \nAFP \nSo is there a chance Delhi may not hold winter Tests in the future? In the end it is the local cricket fans who suffer for no fault of their own. In all honesty, the scheduling has been poor. \nWhen the dates were released by the BCCI, they were aware of how the atmosphere is during the winter months. Could they not have chosen an alternative venue? Even when the scheduling was final, still alterations could have been made. But they chose to see it through and it resulted in the match being marred in smog controversy. \nIf one recalls, last year Kolkata was set to host a match during Durga Puja. However, the BCCI realised its error and changed the venue at the last minute, albeit a swap with another stadium. Could something similar not have been done here? The answer lies only with those making the decision. \nAFP \nThe matter is now in the upper channels and Kotla's fate rests in the hands of those with authority. We will only know the truth when the venues are announced for Tests scheduled next year around this time.

There was no Channel Guide for the TV. When I called the front desk, I was told that they keep them In the Lobby and I could go and get one. The remote allowed me to turn on the TV, but I couldn't change channels, view the Guide, or adjust the volume. I called the Front Desk, they sent a maintenance man who replaced it. The new one worked until he left. I called again, he came back tried it, it didn't work, he replaced it again. When the 3rd one didn't work, the maintenance man returned again, and discovered that the cable with the receptor was hanging from the TV behind the dresser, thus blocking the reception. After we discovered that, it finally worked. The next morning I discovered the coffeemaker didn't work. I called and it was replaced with a working one. That night, shortly after I went to bed, someone started knocking on doors. A couple of times it sounded as if he was knocking on my door. I called the Front Desk and complained and was told the person was locked out of his room and there was a maintenance person with him. So I waited, and after 20 minutes when it hadn't stopped, I called again. This time the staffer said he would send a maintenance person. It continued for about another 30 minutes. When I checked out, I complained about all of the above, and asked for an adjustment of my bill which I received.

Ties between Turkey and Greece have warmed over the past 20 years, after decades of tension that almost sparked a miltary confrontation in 1996 ended when earthquakes struck both countries in 1999. Relations today are relatively cordial, but a Greek government spokesman expressed concern after the Turkish president called for \u201cimprovements\u201d to how airspace and waters between the two states are delineated in the Aegean Sea in a television interview on Wednesday. \u201cThe interview today with Erdogan raises serious worries and questions,\u201d said Dimitris Tzanakopoulos in a statement, adding that Athens sees the visit as \u201can opportunity to build bridges, not walls.\u201d With Turkey\u2019s bid to join the EU at a standstill and relations with much of the West frigid, Erdogan\u2019s trip will be only his second visit to an EU member since last year\u2019s failed coup, after talks in Poland this October. Turkey\u2019s president Celal Bayar visited Greece in 1952, the same year the two countries simultaneously joined NATO with strong American backing. Erdogan visited Greece twice as prime minister in 2004 and 2010, building on a rapprochement between Ankara and Athens that only began in earnest after the destructive quakes. Wide divide exists The two countries have uneasy relations dating back to the creation of the modern Turkish Republic out of the ruins of the Ottoman Empire. But Erdogan\u2019s Islamic-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002, sought a more pragmatic relationship based on trade and tourism, and Greece became a key backer of the Turkish bid to join the EU. \u201cErdogan\u2019s visit can be seen as part of the long phase of rapprochement between the two countries that began in 1999,\u201d Dimitrios Triantaphyllou, director of the Centre for International and European Studies at Kadir Has University in Istanbul, told AFP. But he added that while Greek-Turkish relations can be seen as \u201crelatively robust\u201d, none of a whole range of outstanding issues between the two sides have been resolved. \u201cBeyond the pragmatism, a wide divide exists between the two countries,\u201d he said. Athens is unhappy over Turkey\u2019s upkeep of Byzantine heritage in Istanbul, the former Constantinople, including the Hagia Sophia, which is officially a museum but has seen an uptick in Muslim worship in the last years. Greece has also been rattled by Erdogan\u2019s sometimes angry tirades against the post World War I treaties that set the countries\u2019 modern borders and meant almost all the Aegean Sea islands are Greek territory. Erdogan revisited the issue Wednesday in an interview with Greece\u2019s Skai TV, saying existing territorial waters were \u201cquite problematic\u201d for Turkish maritime liners plying the Aegean, \u201cand this is not something that we can live with.\u201d Ankara, meanwhile, is unhappy that Greece is hosting suspects wanted over the 2016 failed coup and who fled Turkey, notably eight troops who escaped by helicopter on the night of the putsch. Another festering sore is Cyprus, where the northern portion of the island is still occupied by Turkish troops following the 1974 invasion in response to an Athens-inspired coup aimed at uniting it with Greece. Much-touted peace talks this year that brought together both sides on the divided island as well as Greece, Turkey and colonial power Britain ended without a breakthrough. \u201cWhile over the last decades economic cooperation and commercial and tourist ties between the two countries have been very active, their relations still get stuck on the same differences,\u201d said Jean Marcou, associate researcher at the French Institute of Anatolian Studies. Deep relations Athens and Ankara are cooperating over the migrant crisis, following a deal between Turkey and the EU which has significantly stemmed the flow of people to Europe. The Turkish president\u2019s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said Turkey had \u201cdeep\u201d relations with Greece and applauded Athens\u2019 support for the embattled Turkish EU membership bid. He confirmed Erdogan would first go to Athens to meet Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and then to the northeastern Thrace region, home to Greece\u2019s main Muslim minority. Erdogan has a relatively warm relationship with Alexis Tsipras, the leftist politician who became Greek prime minister in 2015 and generally eschews nationalist rhetoric against Turkey. Tsipras told Turkey\u2019s state-run Anadolu news agency in an interview ahead of the visit that suspected coup plotters \u201cwere not welcome\u201d in Greece and emphasised the importance of dialogue between Turkey and the EU. In a move seen by Turkish commentators as a gesture to Ankara, nine suspected members of the Marxist Revolutionary People\u2019s Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C), branded a terrorist organisation by Turkey were last week charged by a Greek prosecutor.

The legendary star doesn\u2019t have fans in India only, he also ruled the hearts of those in Pakistan. After he passed away, residents of Peshawar organised a candle vigil called \u2018Pride of Peshawar\u2019 outside the Kapoor Haveli\u2014his ancestral home\u2014on Dec. 4. \nThe Kapoor Haveli, situated in the Dhaki Nalbandi area in the interiors of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, was built by Kapoor\u2019s grandfather Dewan Basheswarnath Singh Kapoor in the early 20th century. Cultural Heritage Council (CHC) Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa paid a tribute to the Hindi cinema star, who passed away on December 4 at the age of 79. The event was attended by several people from different walks of life, including cinema lovers.

It was the love for his roots that prompted Kapoor to visit the city back in 2000. Shakeel added, \u201cPeshawarites have great love and respect for the Kapoor family and Bollywood actors belonging to the ancient city.\u201d Peshawar owns Shashi Kapoor too: People from all walks of

On Wednesday, Hockey India (HI) CEO Elena Norman said the Pakistan are welcome to take part in the mega event and two union ministries have already okayed their participation. \nBCCL \n\"We have already written to the ministry of youth affairs, home and defence, seeking permission for hosting the 16 teams, one of them being Pakistan, for the tournament. While two of them have already given their permission regarding the same, the other one is expected soon,\" she told reporters. \"After that, it is up to Pakistan to proceed accordingly. There is a time limit and they have to fulfill all the requirements by then.\" \nTalking about the Hockey India League, which has been shelved for now, Norman said the plan was to hold it in 2019. \"We're planning to hold the Hockey India League at the end of 2019. As far as the number of teams is concerned, there will be either six or eight teams but it's not confirmed yet,\" she remarked. \nBCCL \nNorman also allayed fears that the World Cup can be shifted from here. The seating capacity of Kalinga Stadium is being increased for the big event and Norman revealed even the pitches will be relaid. \"It is expected that all constructions will be completed by the end of May. Then we will have two months to relay the pitches. So before monsoon, everything will be done,\" said the HI CEO. 'We played to our potential' \nBCCL \nIndia coach Sjoerd Marijne said: \"We could beat them because all the players played to their full potential. We have improved with the matches and it was evident from the way we played against Belgium. Our marking was better, our trapping was better and we are disciplined throughout the game. \nCaptain Manpreet Singh said: \"We wanted to play to our strengths and do what we are good at. Another focus was on converting the penalty corners and we were able to that. Also we took all the chances that came our way.\" Don't Miss ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "norman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sjoerd marijne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bccl  norman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elena norman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manpreet singh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hockey india league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bccl  india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hockey india", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kalinga stadium", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:37.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b9feec263042de1d2d4ccaa7a38b7162e818cfd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQkK7aUqeqwE6FcBfT4kcWNLgj1THEfvZLCZa_rfA718JKmjJkxdSXsgwf0kIu3KlhueTEsu.K1t2G85Q6DayO6_w5Jsk1zcgpeWpB2owr1VibLbiB3B3gKkAfIrqu4kb3T7C6Nl6Wavw--", "site_full": "www.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "11 Animals That Are Going Extinct This Very Minute - Indiatimes.com", "title_full": "11 Animals That Are Going Extinct This Very Minute - Indiatimes.com", "published": "2017-12-07T07:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.156, "main_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2017/Nov/fb_1511181333_800x420.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 387, "comments": 1, "shares": 387}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4b9feec263042de1d2d4ccaa7a38b7162e818cfd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQkK7aUqeqwE6FcBfT4kcWNLgj1THEfvZLCZa_rfA718JKmjJkxdSXsgwf0kIu3KlhueTEsu.K1t2G85Q6DayO6_w5Jsk1zcgpeWpB2owr1VibLbiB3B3gKkAfIrqu4kb3T7C6Nl6Wavw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T07:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "11 Animals That Are Going Extinct This Very Minute - Indiatimes.com", "text": "Another gorgeous animal that\u2019s a large neotropical parrot is already extinct now. They were last recorded in 1960 and are considered to non-existent; however, some claim that they are there somewhere in the deep jungles of South America. 5. Great Indian Bustard \nYoutube Weighing more than 18 kg, the great Indian Bustard is undoubtedly one of the heaviest flying birds and we are losing them because of change in habitat system and poaching. The decimated population has reached a point where there are just 200 of them left in India and Pakistan. 6. Florida Panther \nTypepad These Panthers have been idealised in several cartoon and movies, but let\u2019s take a minute to know how they are doing in real life. The species is now endangered and there only just 20 of them in the wild. The recent headcount tells us that there has been an increase in number, but the big cat still faces countless challenges in its fight for survival. 7. Angonoka Tortoise \nThoughtCO Native to Madagascar, the land of diversity, the Angonoka Tortoise is easily the most endangered tortoise in the world. They are only found in certain regions of Northwest Madagascar. They are poached and killed for their distinctive look and beautifully decorated carapace. 8. Singapore Stream Crab \nwrscomsg \nDiscovered just recently in 1986, the Singapore stream crab are found in the live streams of Singapore and are going extinct due to rapid urbanization. Locals often hunt them as food. They only reach about 3 cm in width. 9. Madagascan Fish Eagle \nWiki Commons Another gem from Madagascar, the Fish Eagle is a bird of prey. Close to 63 cm long, their population is in rapid decline as they are threatened by habitat destruction and persecution. The current wild population of this bird in the wild is estimated to be around 120 breeding pairs. 10. Mexican Wolf \nLA Times Also known as \u201cel lobo\u201d, this they roved in thousands across the Unites States. However, the rapid change brought about by urbanisation and too much intervention by humans in their habitat, has seen their population dwindling. To keep them safe, a small group of Mexican wolves was released back into the wild in Arizona from the zoo. 11. California Condor \nLa Times A majestic North American bird, the condor has a wingspan of 3 m. It\u2019s a new world vulture and arguably the largest; sadly, it became extinct in the wild in 1987. Their numbers drastically declined in the 20th century due to poaching, lead poisoning, and habitat destruction. The condor is a significant bird to many Californian Native American groups and plays an important role in several of their traditional myths. Can we say that better preservation of the earth we were given could have saved these animals? Can we say that our poaching and unhealthy intervening habits have killed so many species that it\u2019s difficult to get them back now? Can we say that if not the past, we are willing to change the future with our actions? Can we?

Uncertainty for new airline Passenger numbers have increased in recent years at Dakar\u2019s current airport in the middle of the city, leading to long waits at security and contributing to chronic traffic jams, and the old Leopold Sedar Senghor airport will become a military airfield from Friday. The new airport boasts six footbridges direct to flight cabins, and will be able to service a range of aircraft including Airbus\u2019s massive A380s.Work was completed on the 4,500-hectare site \u2014 with 2,000 hectares unused in case of required expansion \u2014 by Turkish consortium Summa-Limak after a disagreement with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Bin Laden construction derailed the final stage of preparations. But bets on whether Blaise Diagne would open on time have lasted until the last minute amid complaints by major European airlines over fuel capacity and regulations.Summa-Limak will now operate the airport for the next 25 years, furthering ever-closer economic ties between Ankara and Dakar.A train linking the airport with the city is not expected to open for years, leaving taxi drivers in pocket but ordinary travellers nervous of arriving on time for flights in a city with unpredictable traffic.Backed by loans from France\u2019s development agency the African Development Bank (ADB), the West African Development Bank (BOAD) and Islamic lender the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), officials are celebrating the airport\u2019s completion \u2014 but the future of Senegal\u2019s new airline is less certain.Air Senegal still does not have all the licences required to begin commercial flights and has a fleet of just two ATR 72-600s, but Aviation Minister Maimouna Ndoye Seck said international ambitions for the airport meant a well-performing national airline was \u201ca necessity.\u201dAgence France-Presse", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Bitcoin: Approaching the 'big short' moment? Source : Arnav Joshi Last Updated: Wed, Dec 06, 2017 12:32 hrs \nInvestors everywhere (this is not a problem specific to India) are notorious for jumping on the newest, shiniest bandwagons without necessarily understanding what lies underneath the hood. \nWhat is a problem specific to India is the dichotomy of its burgeoning investor community lining up with alacrity for their golden tickets, without any semblance of a safety net to catch them if they fall. \nWith Bitcoin (and other crypto-currencies), that fall has the potential to be their hardest yet. As prices surge to tantalising new heights, constantly breaking their own records, Bitcoin FoMO is very real -- and there is clear potential, as there are pitfalls of investing in what some have carelessly called Gold 2.0. \nRags to riches Bitcoin investment stories are, of course, plastered across the web and beyond, drawing investors by the boatload, and why not, when value rises 900 per cent in a year, albeit with fluctuations between 44 (up) and 25 (down) percent. What isn't easy to come by when Bitcoin fever takes hold, is the ominous flip side. \nVili Lehdonvirta (who may or may not be Satoshi Nakamoto) is among many others rightfully labelled experts who have for some time now been warning of the eyeball frenzy and an approaching proverbial \"big short\" moment. \nCloser home, Pramod Emjay of CryptoMe Payment Technologies and formerly the Dogecoin Foundation, shares this concern. \nIn our discussion on crypto-currency exchanges in India, he tells me how \"any exchange worth its salt knows that it's supplying the shovels in this gold rush. It is stupid to assume this will go on forever\". \nAnd while it may admittedly be the wave of the future, for the time being, a gold rush is what it is -- of which there will be both casualties and collateral damage. You may have forgotten Mt. Gox for example, but its clients have not. \nBitcoin, of course, is only the flag-bearer, and gets most of the attention, good and bad. In all there are over a thousand publicly traded coins, and the advent of Initial Coin Offerings opens up new fronts for slapdash investments. As the world once again leaps before looking, parallels to the sub-prime crisis and the dotcom bubble are not unwarranted. Fed enough quick-buck hysteria, history will repeat itself. \nCommercially, prospective Indian investors need to dig deep and understand how Bitcoin infrastructure, buying, storing and pricing actually works. A lack of adequate local mining infrastructure for instance, means eye-watering premiums over global prices (30 per cent is the latest figure doing the rounds) currently apply for Indian purchases. \nOn the legal front, the Indian government has on several instances in the past, through the Reserve Bank, the Securities and Exchange Board of India and recently the Finance Minister himself, reminded the country that crypto-currencies do not have legal sanction. While some industry stakeholders have stretched this wait-and-watch to claims that a hard stance is all but impossible, such exuberance is exaggerated and has little evidence or precedent. \nThere are, however, enough and more examples of reactive legislation ranging from public liability to data privacy, and everything in between. In a worst-case scenario, public issue and private placement, exchange control and national security considerations create a minefield that can cause governments to take sudden and radical steps, saying only that \"you were warned\". \nWhere does this leave the Bitcoin investor legally? At best, what your purchase can be likened to a commodity -- furniture, only furniture doesn't (usually) cost you $13,000 apiece. Careless moves with wallets can cause your investments irreversibly going up in smoke, and data breaches associated with these wallets also have limited legal and practical recourse. \nPramod Emjay, even as an industry pro, has himself been the subject of crypto-currency fraud, and he rightly points out that when that happens, there's nobody to go crying to. In the absence of legal sanction and a regulator, investments are not just a commercial, but also a legal gamble. Should and would you invest in the stock market if SEBI didn't exist? \nHaving had a consistently ominous outlook (although I myself treasure all things blockchain), I have been the recipient of many an evil-eye from stakeholders in the local Bitcoin ecosystem. Genuine as their motives may be, there are clear conflicts of interest, which do not help spread objective awareness or resolve desperate uncertainty for potential investors. Uncertainty which local law still does not alleviate, and inherent commercial volatility exacerbates. \nIt is for this, above all other reasons, that I continue to hold up the red flag. With the law providing no protection, being forewarned now more than ever, is being forearmed. As one local platform ironically warns in its fine print, \"never spend more money on Bitcoins than you can afford to lose\" -- the three extra questions you must then ask yourself is not just how much you can afford to lose, but how, when and why you might lose it. \n(Arnav Joshi is a technology lawyer and Data and Society masters candidate at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

Arms swaying with each step along with her hips, head turning back to watch Anthony as she walked a cat-walk style, making sure her bubble-butt bounced with each step. Biting her bottom lip as her cheeks clapped together in the skin tight latex. Bellas' pony-tail swished back unto her shoulder, nestled their whilst removing her glasses. Stopping just short of the bed as she places the glasses aside and sat down on the bed- towards him, legs spread. Still staring at him considering he has to take time to get out of his armor, teasingly began to unzip her vault-suit down the middle. Pale, smooth, skin revealing inch by inch, showing Isabellas' bare, pert breasts and pink nipples all the way down to her mid-riff; both arms squeezed between her thighs, using her forearms to squeeze her town tits together for Anthony; \"Since we're not going for a baby, maybe you'll cum all over these- or my ass.. I'll leave it up to you.\" A devious grin towards him as she bit down on her own tongue. Waiting for him to step over towards her and take control of the situation as she was already half naked and seated on the bed.\r\n\r\n23:29 - ArMaGeDdOn: Anthony glares towards Isabella as she begins to tauntingly make her way over towards his bed. He'd release a short chuckle towards her words as he begins to undo the straps of his armor, discarding them over towards the bed as he watches her sit down onto it and expose her body to him. He'd say; \"I was thinking the same exact thing.\" after removing near enough everything off of him aside from his boxers, she'd see that his exposed muscles without any equipment or gear on would make up for the armor that he wears. Not looking much different in terms of bulkiness as he makes his way over towards her on the bed. Upon doing so he'd stand directly in front of her saying; \"Go on, pull my boxers down.\" awaiting for her to do so. If she were to do so, given the fact that she was able to see the bulge even before he got close to her, she'd be met with his cock springing out of his pants and hanging there. His cock becoming erect just of the sight of her as he says; \"I am eager to see what you plan on doing. I think I have a few ideas but ladies first of course.\" his eyes would dart down at her body, specifically over her thighs as he seems rather eager when dealing with her. His breathing heightening very slightly as he awaits for her next move.\r\n\r\n23:41 - Sir Wolf #TheresOnlyJuanMata: ** Isabellas' eyes watch Anthony walking over in nothing but his boxers as both arms began to slip out of her vault suit, leaving the top-half of her body entirely naked. Issy' only breaking eye-contact to stare in awe at his bulky and muscular physique. Ant' could see Bella' biting on her bottom lip ass he gazed over his body - but once he stood infront of her and commanded the young Isabella to pull his boxers down. Fingers reaching up against his abdomen, slipping between the grooves of his abs' before her fingertips slip between the folds of his boxers, ever so slowly pulling down to reveal the thick length of his cock before it springed in her face. Anthony more than likely watching as Isabellas' eyes widen at the size of his juicy, thick, cock - both hands darting against its girth. Hand petite in comparison as her fingers tried to wrap around the fleshy, veiny, sides, jerking his cock up and down whilst Isabella's lips were millimeters from the head of Anthonys cock as she balanced it on her pillowy lips whilst the foreskin was being tugged back and forth by her hands which twist left and right. A hot breath felt against Ants' sensitive tip as she ushers out; \"I hope you don't mind if I get a.. Little messy.\" Following suit her silky-soft lips wrap around the entirety of his dick, cheeks caving in as she sucked away and forced her head further down on his cock- forcing it against the back of her throat. Tongue doing what it loves best and exploring the veiny sides and coating his cock in cables of thick saliva. Isabella staring up at Anthony, arching her back on the back and sticking her ass out on it. The slurping, sucking sound heard as she gags away at him - Isabellas' left hand slipping down and quickly cupping his sack in hand, twisting and turning it. Aiming to show Anthony just how skilled she can be at pleasuring someone as her touch was gentle, caressing his hefty-balls between her fingers.\r\n\r\n23:55 - ArMaGeDdOn: Anthony keeps himself standing in front of her as she brought his boxers down exposing his cock. Within the moments of her beginning to handle it's thick and long length she'd see it grow in size even further as it reaches it's peak. He'd release a short moan as she felt her immeadiately starting to twist and turn her hands along the shaft of his cock. Even more so when she felt her lips wrap around it and bobbing it back and forth into her mouth. He'd watch as his cock gets absolutely covered in saliva from Isabella's rather aggressive cock sucking nature. He'd smirk saying; \"The messier the better, don't worry about it. But let me return the favor.\" he'd begin to make his way over towards the bed, laying himself down onto it which of course causes him to sort of turn her around and place her on top of him. His eyes would be now set on the lower half of her body which he'd aim to make bare before hand. With them in the '69' position he'd look at her ass-hole and pussy directly in front of him, seeing what she looks like down below. And without much hesitation he'd push her body back allowing his arms to wrap around the small of her back to keep her pinned whilst his face digs into her fat, pale ass. His tongue reaching out against the backside of her pussy as his face rests against both holes. She'd feel his tongue parting her lips as he thrusts his hips forward, his throbbing cock entering down her throat as she continues to caress his balls hanging there. He'd pull back momentarily as he says; \"Fuck, Isabella. You taste incredible. Go all out down there, you'll get a surprise soon.\" he'd soon resume to tending to the both of Isabella's holes, making sure to get inside as best as he can, face buried against her as he eats her out.\r\n\r\n00:07 - ArMaGeDdOn is now Online.\r\n00:09 - Sir Wolf #TheresOnlyJuanMata: Isabella keeps herself seated on the bed until Anthony moved her, mouth working the thick, long girth of his cock with her tongue and vigorous sucking. She'd stop for but a second as she felt him move around and laying onto the bed - feeling herself being pulled ontop of him, biting her bottom lip as she was more than likely dragged ontop of him. Instinctively straddling his chest, lifting up both legs as she rested her belly ontop of him - which wouldn't be any trouble considering she was as light as a feather as he removed the rest of her vault suit. Isabella prepping herself infront of his face, back arched and ass presented before him - a vibrantly pink, bare and shaven, pussy shines with a pearlescent cum, being a tight innie with her lips being sealed; an even tighter puffy asshole resides between two illustriously thick, plump cheeks which shake at the slightest of movement. As soon as his lips had touched Isabellas' pussy he would be hit with the sudden sweetness taste, similar to some sort of candy-esque taste overwhelming his tongue as soon as he parted both lips. A muffled moan escapes Bella's lips which would currently be stuffed full of Anthonys' cock, though she'd grind her hips up and down across his mouth and tongue, loving every second of it as she goes wild on his cock. Isabella /forcing/ Anthonys' dick further and further down his throat, as much as she can take, and now considering his cock was facing more up her thick saliva drools down the sides, right hand picking it up upon jerking his cock off and lathering it, coating her hand in strings of her own spit which completely drenches Anthonys cock in minutes. Coaxing his balls to cum as she tended to them with a spare hand, gently caressing them as her saliva made them shine in hand, allowing more free-movement as both hands slipped around. Isabella more so would be focusing on pleasing Anthonys cock from above as her head bobs up and down, the tip of his cock finding it's way further down her throat before he began thrusting his hips up -\r\n00:10 - Sir Wolf #TheresOnlyJuanMata: - To which she began to bottom out on his cock, bulging out her throat which clamped around it, holding herself there for what seemed like eternity in the moment with Anthony eating her out. Before suddenly pulling back with a loud gasp of air, an impressive feat to hold her breath as she caught it back, ropes of pre-cum and spit most likely lining her lips to his cock, drooling down and creating quite the mess as she wouldn't care in the moment. Soon going straight back down.\r\n\r\n00:17 - ArMaGeDdOn: Once tasting Isabella's sweet pussy on his tongue it would pretty much send Anthony into overdrive with lusting for the taste of her pussy, his tongue having a diffcult time opening up her pussy though manages as he continues to tongue and eat her out. As Isabella continues to go to town down below on his throbbing and thick veiny cock he'd release a moan as her head slid up and down the entire shaft of it, effectively coating it and making it shine, though not only to his cock, but his hefty sack as well. Her spit working wonders to allow the both of his balls an equal as spit covered gloss to them as she continues to toy with them, coaxing him to cum further. With the continued pounding that his cock takes inside her mouth he wouldn't be able to hold himself much longer given the mass amount of stimulation coursing through his cock. He'd be too busy eating Isabella out to even care to warn her about cumming, and in doing so assuming she'd be bottoming out his cock in full she'd suddenly feel his cock pumping deep into her throat a load of thick, hot cum. She'd be able to actually feel his cock delivering the cum straight into her as he retracted his lips covered in her pearlescent cum only to moan out loudly in pleasure as he emptied his sack into her throat. He'd look over to Isabella as he says; \"K-Keep it down your throat and milk it with your hand, fill yourself with it Isabella, fuck.\" his cock certainly being quite a ways down her throat, this being around the time she completely bottomed herself out to it, quite the timing for him to cum.\r\n00:29 - Sir Wolf #TheresOnlyJuanMata: Isabella wouldn't necessarily be able to react to Anthony going wild on his cock from the outside, but inside it would be the drive to suck like no tomorrow on his cock and work it like she never had done before. Muffled moans escaping her lips, everytime she pulled back for air from gagging on Anthonys' tree-trunk of a cock it would be filled with harmonious moaning, singing from her lungs as he plunged his tongue deeper into her pussy as he was near enough addicted to the intense sweet-taste. Isabella's hips riding back and forth, twisting left and right on his open, inviting, mouth and tongue. He could feel both legs around him tightening, thighs locking up as she came closer to her orgasm. Though she herself wouldn't be paying attention to her own cum, as she was too busy focusing on Anthonys' unbelivably thick, juicy appendage; mouth pumping up and down, sealed as her silky lips slurped across his saliva-glossed, coated cock; when she bottomed out, she would get the preemptive warning from his balls of when he is cumming, intentionally keeping herself down as it throbbed in her throat, nose buried deep into his hefty, musky sack. Tongue hanging out of her open mouth, trailing along the sides of it whilst Anthonys sticky cum was dumped straight down her throat and into her stomach. Isabella lost in the moment held her breath, hands intensly massaging his sensitive, hefty sack to milk every bit of cum. That is before she had to pull back, lips sealed like a vaccuum on his cock once she did so, feeling it slip from her clamped throat - Bella making sure every bit is sucked clean. Reaching the tip her mouth would be open, tongue dangling out as she circled it across the tip to acquire that certain taste; curling under the foreskin before she began to lather the head of Anthonys cock with multiple kisses; lips drooling with spit and cum as she did so, muttering under her breath; \"I love it- I love it-\" Repeatedly, lost in the moment as she worshipped him. Though with Isabella now having a stomach full of cum-\r\n00:30 - Sir Wolf #TheresOnlyJuanMata: - Anthony could feel her body shiver and shake as his mouth was overwhelmed with a creamy wave of Isabella's cum coating her pussy as she experienced her orgasm whilst worshipping him, probably sending her into the overly-lustful state for him as she quivered ontop of him, moaning and panting with her pussy convulsing over his tongue whilst trickling like a stream with the creamy-cum.\r\n\r\n00:39 - ArMaGeDdOn: Anthony keeps his tongue buried deep inside of Isabella's pussy, by no means aiming to stop pleasuring her into she came as he did and that is what he received. With her sweet cum dripping and leaking against his tongue he wouldn't hesitate to lap it all up, continuing to lick her out post orgasm. As for his cock emptying inside of her he'd lean back removing his tongue from her dripping wet, pink pussy as he looks up at the ceiling, breathing heavily as he says; \"Fucking hell, Isabella.\" he'd remain laying there with her on top of him as his cock was milked and taken care of, more specifically his balls as she continued to caress him. After all was done with the both of them being milked for their cum, Anthony begins to un-wrap his arms from the small of Isabella's back and instead begins to slowly move her off of him to make her lay down onto her back. Her lower body hanging off the bed slightly. With a devilish smirk on his face Anthony rises from the bed, breathing heavy and his muscles bulging out as his veiny, thick cock hang there, still wanting more of Isabella. He'd be move his hands over towards her hips sliding her closer to his cock. He'd press the base of it against the entrance to her tight, pink pussy as he rests his cock against her cunt, showing just how deep it is going to go inside of her. He'd look up at her with a smirk saying; \"Your pussy is so pink and tight, Isabella. I am eager to see what it is going to be like in a second. I want you to watch while I do it.\" he'd then gently run the underside of his cock against her clit, and over the slit of her pussy lips and soon the weight of his cock is lifted off of her as the tip presses against the entrance to her extremely tight pussy. She'd suddenly feel him pushing slightly, the tip having a difficult time to penetrate her though eventually he gets the head of his cock inside of her bright pink pussy, and his shaft follows shortly after. From her first hand view she'd be able to witness her pussy stretching out as his cock took control of-\r\n00:42 - ArMaGeDdOn: the situation. He'd begin to push his saliva coated throbbing cock inside of her, eventually going balls deep as he holds it there, releasing a groan of pleasure once inside. With her pussy being stretched and the entirety of his cock inside of Isabella's tight, welcoming pink pussy, he'd begin to thrust himself out of her, followed by going back in once more, repeatedly this action as he begins to fuck her. His left hand rubbing against her clit rather quickly whilst his right grabs ahold of her legs, propping them up against his shoulders and eventually resumes it's position on her lifted left leg holding it up as he stretches out her tight pink pussy fucking her at a moderate pace. She'd be able to see from this position that his throbbing, long cock repeatedly slamming into her would surely send her into submission on the account of just having it down her throat got her the way she is, now it fully filling the inside of her pussy up would be another story completely.\r\n\r\n00:56 - Sir Wolf #TheresOnlyJuanMata: As Isabella took the time to catch her breath whilst gently caressing Anthonys sack and kissing away at his cock - face flushed a bright red from the intense orgasm which sent assisted in sending her into such a state. Laying ontop of him as both were thoroughly milked, the moans ushering to a stop as she was slowly lifted up and rested onto her back, legs dangling off the side as she lay there; staring up at Anthony with a bite to her bottom lip. Partially seated up, Isabellas' eyes wander down to Anthonys' bulging and veiny muscles with his rising chest, grinning herself with a lustful grin, licking her cum-coated lips towards him as she was so roughly dragged towards Anthony and his cock. Staring down as his cock was measured up against her body, giggling to herself in amazement of just how much she's willing to take - head swiftly pivoting up and staring deeply into his eyes; \"Mmh- I'll watch- I want to watch every bit of your cock fill me... Watch you fuck me into /your/ plaything.\" Isabella deviously grinned before pursing her lips out in a moan as his soaked cock brushed up against Bellas' sensitive, pink, clit. Willingly spreading her legs out further for him into the splits, as the spread either side of her, giving Anthony full, unprecedented, access to Isabellas' wanting, pink, tight pussy. Eyes eagerly watching as the tip of his cock squeezed up against Bellas' pussy - jaw dropping as cum drooled off her tongue which near enough hanged from her mouth from the pleasure; moaning loud enough to echo the room as his cock began to fill her up. Head flicking back to stare up at the building; \"Fuck me, Anthony- I-It f-feels so good.. Fuck me like I-I'm your p-personal dirty s-slut..\" Every push deeper sent Isabella into a submissive state as she craned her head back down, watching as Anthonys' cock stretched and stuffed her tight pussy which seemed near enough impossible to push into, as Issys' walls clamped across his cock repeatedly, stimulating his shaft every second it's inside and every juicy bit of -\r\n00:58 - ArMaGeDdOn is now Online\r\n01:00 - Sir Wolf #TheresOnlyJuanMata: - His girth was hugged in a wet-velvety like-vice. Isabellas' legs being grabbed and propped onto his shoulders, toes curling up as he started to thrust in and out, the wet clap filling the room accompanied by labored moans as she cries out in bliss from Anthony thrusting, hands reaching out and grasping the covers of his bed, claws dragging in before quickly latching onto both of his arms. Ant' could feel her nails dig in, body bouncing as her lusciously rounded tits jiggled up and down with every thrust into her wet, snug, pussy. Begging under a heavy breath; \"H-Harder, baby- Fuck me harder.. F-Fuck, mmh!\" Eyes clenching tight as his cock absolutely filled her up and probably would be no surprise if it had bulged its way through from just how deep it filled her up.\r\n\r\n01:06 - ArMaGeDdOn: Anthony's thrusting does not cease in the slightest, his cock effectively stretching her tight and small pink pussy out to probably the most it can go. He'd look down towards his cock as he watch her lips stretch and hug around it with each thrust. He'd smirk as his thrusts only get rougher and faster, basically completely going balls deep and filling her with the entirety of his cock. Anthony moves the both of his hands down to her hips as she suddenly grips them, scrapping against his arms now as he leans forward a bit, allowing her to watch the bulge inside of her from the thickness and length of his cock repeatedly slamming into her. At this point her g-spot would be more than hit, probably pressed again in a consistent manner as her cum lubricates the entirety of his cock allowing multiple strands of string form from everytime he pulled out. As for his cock in general a white creamy coat would appear on it from really getting in and fucking her. his eyes would be glaring down at her at this point as he watches her pant and moan wildly his cock all the more erect like a diamond as he continues fucking her. He'd speak out to her, seeing as she likes calling herself a slut; \"Yeah, ride my dick Isabella. Fuck, cum all over it I know you want to. God damn!\" his eyes would overlook her signficantly pale body in comparison to her's. His hands moving down towards her breasts as he'd squeeze ahold of them at this point just mercilessely fucking her without any intention of stopping until he reaches his climax. He'd then say; \"Your pussy is going to be /covered/ in cum and so will that pretty face of yours-.. mh, keep going Isabella, ride that cock, cream all over it!\"\r\n01:17 - Sir Wolf #TheresOnlyJuanMata: Isabellas' constant panting wouldn't stop as she was fucked, a moan escaping with every breath, whimpering as she was at the mercy of Anthony who would be filling her up with his thick cock; eyes slowly opening from their clenched state, staring down at his cock bulging through as she gawks in awe - mouth wide open as she is fucked senseless. Isabella using her hands wrapped around his forearms as leverage to pull herself back and forth on his cock, gyrating and grinding her hips and ass down into his pelvis everytime he bottomed out, practically dancing herself on the bed. Loving every second as his juicy black cock repeatedly slammed balls deep into her, soon enough Anthony could feel her nails scratch into his skin as his already creamy-cock would be flooded with another thick wave of Isabellas' cum considering his cock was constantly pressed and rubbing against her g-spot. Isabellas' head leaning back up towards the cieling, mouth open as she loudly giggles in the heat of the moment. Feeling as Anthonys hands grasping onto her tits as both hands slipped down and interlocked between his fingers, making his hands squeeze down over them more roughly whilst Issys' head twisted left and right chest raising but still finding the energy to ride his cock as she creamed all over it. The sticky, stringy ropes of saliva and cum mixed from both Bella' and Anthony would create quite the mess, the sticky slap sound as he thrusted into her, also coating Bellas' ass, making it have a glossy, oily shine to it whilst ropes from Anthones cock drip onto it. Isabellas' right hand drags Anthonys' left hand over to her mouth as she would gently bite on his index finger whilst glaring into his eyes.. It would be the first time he heard the words escape her lips; \"C-Cum for me, Daddy-\" Ultimately submissing herself to Anthony with a slutty grin as she gently suckled on his finger. Body bouncing back and forth.\r\n\r\n01:25 - ArMaGeDdOn: With Anthony's continued strokes of his cock entering deep inside of her only to be met with it pulling near enough all the way out but never actually leaving her tight, pink pussy, she'd get her wish ultimately. With the rough fucking that she is receiving after feeling her cum along his cock coating it in a sticky collection of her sweet cum, on top of the squelching echoing through the room, Anthony would swiftly pull himself out of her tight pussy, allowing her stretched pink pussy and body to remain laying against the bed, in awe from her climaxing as hard as she did. Soon enough his cock would unload onto her once more. Multiple thick ropes of his creamy, white and hot cum shoot out of his cock lacing her abused, pink pussy as well as over her pelvic region coating her pussy in his hot cum. Shortly after he'd rest his cock against her clit using the underside of it to rub against her allowing a few more thick strands to shoot onto her stomach. A loud moan escaping his lips as he'd look down at Isabella saying; \"F-Fucking hell, look at you. An absolute mess. He'd then begin to slowly move her around once more allowing her to get onto her knees in front of him as the cum coating her pelvis and pink pussy drips onto the floor beneath them. He'd wrap a hand around his cock as he moves forth allowing his hefty sack to be hanging mere centimeters from her face. He'd begin to jerk himself off a few times allowing some of his cum to be milked out of his cock, and assuming she knew what to do with his cum and spit covered balls, she'd feel excess strands of his seed shooting onto her face as his cock remains hung against it. His hand now being set off of his cock as he rests it there against her face allowing her to recover or do as she wishes as he breathes heavily.\r\n\r\n01:25 - ArMaGeDdOn is now playing Tower Unite.

Feeling it pull back from her pussy, head lifting up as she watched it begin to pump thick ropes onto her stretched and fucked-raw pussy, gasping softly under her breath; \"Mmh- That's it, give it to me.\" She would rest back on the bed as his cock began to rest across her clit, rubbing against it causing Isabella to writhe on the bed with a soft moan- Isabellas; hands would already be busy caressing the cum into her hands and fingers, smothering them across her breasts as he took a second to stare down at her, which indeed she would be quite the mess; hair a frizzy mess in the pony-tail with her face a bright red with a pearly white grin. Lifting up both fingers to quickly lick the cum dripping off of them prior to being forced onto the ground and onto her knees; pure instinct guiding this little animal as both her hands cup his balls. Mouth opening as she gently licks and sucks across each one, cleaning it up of any cum and saliva as she slurped away, caressing his large sack whilst taking in his cocks musky scent. Eyes beaming up towards him, watching as he jerked off - quickly closing her eyes as cum began to spurt out down onto her face. A muffled surpassing both occupied lips on his balls as she felt the sticky, cum-soaked cock rest on her face, craning her head back to begin licking it whilst she was herself a cum-soaked mess. Tongue dangling out and taking long drags across his cock to clean it off, leaving it resting on her face as she submitted herself to it. Worshipping it; \"So- Anthony.. What do you think.. About my cock lovin' side?\" The minx giggles up at him.\r\n\r\n01:44 - ArMaGeDdOn: Anthony slowly retracts his cock from off of her face, it hanging there as he breathes heavily after draining his load once into her stomach and the second all of her as he says; \"Mh, it's incredibly. Fuck, you took an entire load into your stomach. That's determination.\" he'd begin to stand her up onto her feet once more, his hands moving to her hips as he looks down at her saying; \"I'd kiss you but you, well I am sure you know what you did you dirty little girl.\" his right hand soon straying from her hip, reaching around to grab ahold of her ass cheek spreading it out slightly followed by a slap as he spreads her ass out slightly, his middle finger soon finds it's way against her puffy ass-hole. Too bad I didn't get a chance to fuck you in your tight little ass, huh? I am sure next time I can do so if you allow me to that is. Not a lot of women are fond of getting fucked there.\" he'd soon begin rub over her tight little hole staring down at her saying; \"What do you say? Then I can cum inside of your ass.\"\r\n\r\n01:57 - Sir Wolf #TheresOnlyJuanMata: Isabella is slowly pulled up by Anthony as she would stand up fully, pressing up against him with her breasts smooshed against his abdomen, staring up towards him with a wide-spread grin; \"Mmh, don't worry- I brush my teeth so we can kiss in bed later, heh.\" Feeling her ass being grabbed by Anthony would rile Isabella up as she bit her bottom lip, body quickly jolting forth at the sudden slap which marked her ass red; \"You can fuck me there anytime you like..\" Feeling his index finger ever so lightly tease it; \"Heh, it's one of the places I love- actually, but.. Not today, where's the fun in giving my man all the spoils in one sitting?\" Isabellas hands whilst she was talking were idly wiping away at the cum staining her body, licking up every bit of it off of her hand and fingers with a smile; \"Want to join me in the bath before bed..?\" Isabella cooed out. The devilish minx seemed to tease Anthony as she stared into his eyes with passion, tongue rolling over her lips.\r\n01:59 - ArMaGeDdOn: Anthony smirks as he'd continue to gently toy with her puffy asshole, nodding once to her request saying; \"Mhm, let's go. I want to relax after unloading into you like I did. I think it is all the more better because of how pale you are, everything is redfined and I just have the urge to fuck you like an animal. Though I am glad I can sate your hunger.\" he'd release a chuckle, moving his hands from around her and walking to the shower.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "isabella", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wolf", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "issy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthonys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bellas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isabellas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "issys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bella", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "anthonys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "/ anthonys", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "anthones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isabellas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:38.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "34cedf5088cf43e4bfd8711c9327a5d8b7de2d7c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQkK7aUqeqwE6FcBfT4kcWNNVC4zpuvWMXsV_ujZ1WDyqTL.bh9h0HbeEEcrRVMUpICscFk1IRZvH0anHkai2YoiGn2._dFAJtIKowWOvrrOL.mXpqDcbgpAsD5iGPq06d86Z2EcprJqJSWhgg9FTUm8yVsyOJFdHtBBnn0dZEM6Zi4E_9aDwwM", "site_full": "www.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Hungry Family Forced To Sell Eight-Month-Old Baby For Just Rs 200 To Buy Food In Tripura - Indiatimes.com", "title_full": "Hungry Family Forced To Sell Eight-Month-Old Baby For Just Rs 200 To Buy Food In Tripura - Indiatimes.com", "published": "2017-12-07T09:43:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.252, "main_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2017/Dec/new_born_1512632620_800x420.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1025, "comments": 0, "shares": 1025}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "34cedf5088cf43e4bfd8711c9327a5d8b7de2d7c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQkK7aUqeqwE6FcBfT4kcWNNVC4zpuvWMXsV_ujZ1WDyqTL.bh9h0HbeEEcrRVMUpICscFk1IRZvH0anHkai2YoiGn2._dFAJtIKowWOvrrOL.mXpqDcbgpAsD5iGPq06d86Z2EcprJqJSWhgg9FTUm8yVsyOJFdHtBBnn0dZEM6Zi4E_9aDwwM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "Hungry Family Forced To Sell Eight-Month-Old Baby For Just Rs 200 To Buy Food In Tripura - Indiatimes.com", "text": "December 07, 2017 207 SHARES \nAnother appalling case of selling a child for buying food has surfaced in Tripura. According to reports, a tribal man confessed that he sold his eight-month-old daughter for just Rs 200 to fetch some food for his poor family. \nKarna Debbarma from Sarat Chandra ADC village of south Maharanipur, under Teliamura sub-division, confessed to the selling of his eight-month-old daughter, for just Rs 200 to fetch some food for his poor family. \n\u201cDue to poverty, I was compelled to sell my child in order to feed my family,\" he told ANI. \nDebbarma added: \"In spite of demanding on several occasions, I only have an APL (above poverty line ration) card. I even did not get any house or toilet (which are generally provided free under the government's flagship programme). I have demanded a house and a BPL (below poverty line ration card) to the Left Front government. I am poor and somehow run my family by selling straw and bamboo.\u201d \nThis year, it is the third incident reported of a tribal poor family selling their children off in order to run their families in Tripura. \nDebbarma added, \u201cThe politicians have been assuring me that when the appropriate time comes, they will fulfill my demands. But, they never gave us anything.\u201d \nThere are six members of his family at present and their lives are dependent on selling of forest products. They are deprived of the various schemes launched by the Centre and the state government for the tribal people. \nAFP \nLocal villagers alleged that in spite of the poor condition of Karna\u2019s family, he got nothing from the government. \nSampri Debbarma, a local villager said, \u201cI have seen Karna Debbarma for the last many years at Maharanipur. His condition is poor and he does not have a house to live. He had appealed to the government several times for a BPL card or a house, but he did not get anything.
