Scott Barbour / Getty Images Members of Parliament celebrate at Parliament House on Thursday in Canberra, Australia, after the approval of same-sex marriage. Michael Masters / Getty Images \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of registered voters and ensured that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\" Copyright 2017 NPR.

The Republican-led House passed a bill to make it easier for gun owners to legally carry concealed weapons across state lines. J. Scott Applewhite / AP \nThe House approved a bill on Wednesday that would ease legal restrictions for carrying concealed firearms across state lines \u2013 a move pushed by the National Rifle Association that comes just weeks after mass shootings in Las Vegas and Texas. \nOn a mostly party-line vote, the measure easily passed, 231-198, although 14 Republicans voted no. Six Democrats voted for the so-called reciprocity measure, which would allow a gun owner with the proper permit in any state to carry a concealed firearm to another state where it is also legal. \nThe bill now goes to the Senate, where it is likely to encounter a much tougher battle. \nIn the House version, GOP lawmakers added a measure aimed at strengthening tracking in the national background-check database of legal and mental health records that might prevent some gun purchases. Just last month it was revealed that Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman who killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., legally purchase firearms used in the attack despite a record of domestic assault in the Air Force that should have disqualified him. \nHowever, as The New York Times reports: \"... the background check measure was not enough to win over most Democrats, nor did it persuade law enforcement officials in some of the largest cities, including New York, who say the legislation would force locales with strict gun laws to bow to places with few or no gun restrictions.\" \nThe bill angered many Democrats who argued that following mass shootings that have killed 80 people, the times called for stricter, not looser gun measures. \nConnecticut Democrat Rep. Elizabeth Esty \u2014 who represents Newtown, Conn., where 20 first-graders and six teachers and staff were killed in a 2012 mass shooting \u2013 said the bill would undermine states' rights, \"hamstring law enforcement and allow dangerous criminals to walk around with hidden guns anywhere and at any time. It's unspeakable that this is Congress' response to the worst gun tragedies in American history,\" according to The Associated Press. \nThe NRA's executive director, Chris Cox, is quoted in the Times as saying Thursday's vote is a \"watershed\" for Second Amendment rights and that the bill would ensure \"all law-abiding citizens in our great country can protect themselves in the manner they see fit without accidentally running afoul of the law.\" \nIn the Senate, supporters would likely need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster by Democrats.

I can\u2019t do this \u201cSwim to the next feed\u201d thing, which always reminds me of revision for exams, when I would spend hours and hours staring in desperate boredom at my notes while I tried to memorise facts and figures, with only the prospect of a five minute break once an hour to sustain me.

This is an excellent idea if you can achieve it, in marathon swimming as in everything else. However, my brain ain\u2019t fooled. It knows perfectly well how long it has to swim and wants to be at the end of that time as soon as humanly possible. Thinking \u201cOh, let\u2019s just swim to the next buoy/feed/break\u201d are met with the sneering response \u201cOh, yeah, and what about the bit after that? What about that, eh? Eh? Come on! What about that!?\u201d In some ways my brain is way too smart for its own good, which is not a humblebrag, more an observation that my life would on many occasions be a bit less of a struggle if my brain were more easily fooled.\nMick is more Zen than I am, and possibly better practiced at fooling the cynical bits of his brain, since he was clearly not, as I was, thinking each time he swam past the last buoy \u201cTWO more laps till I can leave that b*stard on my right and get out, ONE more lap until I can leave that b*stard on my right and get out\u2026\u201d The result of this was that, when he reached the end of his final lap, he aimed for the right of the buoy in question rather than the left.\nMore shortly.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mick", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:44:46.030+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d85f1f4b196cc1829542677404bda6f4b60d4d33", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.tgLF8laWHovMCryR2utdDiuWPBkNFuuq8Td3Li_XCwPkeuFZucvk0IqVR1SCPrrRTWydqY.castZPvh.nyMWQ", "site_full": "wvxu.org", "site": "wvxu.org", "site_section": "http://wvxu.org//rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media", "music", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "China Says Indian Drone Crashed In Its Territory", "title_full": "China Says Indian Drone Crashed In Its Territory", "published": "2017-12-07T09:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201712/569030027.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d85f1f4b196cc1829542677404bda6f4b60d4d33", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.tgLF8laWHovMCryR2utdDiuWPBkNFuuq8Td3Li_XCwPkeuFZucvk0IqVR1SCPrrRTWydqY.castZPvh.nyMWQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Neuman", "published": "2017-12-07T09:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "China Says Indian Drone Crashed In Its Territory", "text": "By Scott Neuman \u2022 2 hours ago Indian army drone flies near the site of a gunbattle between Indian government forces and suspected militants in Padgampora village of Pulwama, south of Srinagar, in March. Tauseef Mustafa / AFP/Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 3:27 am \nMonths after a tense standoff between China and India along their Himalayan border, Beijing on Thursday expressed anger at an Indian drone that crashed inside its territory. \n\"This action by India violated China's territorial sovereignty. We express strong dissatisfaction and opposition,\" Xinhua cited Zhang Shuili, a senior military official in China's western battle zone command, as saying. \nChina said the drone crashed in \"recent days\" but didn't say where. Zhang said his country would defend its national sovereignty against such intrusions. \nHe said China's border defense forces conducted \"an inspection of the device,\" but didn't elaborate. \nIndia has not responded to the charge. \nAlthough the two countries have made moves toward warmer relations in recent years, they also have a long history of border tensions. In 1962, they fought a brief, but inconclusive border conflict. They have also had ongoing disputes over sovereignty in other border areas, notably Aksai Chin, a Himalayan region that straddles their territorial demarcation in the west. \nThe two countries have also long been at odds over India's hosting of Tibet's government-in-exile and their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, considered by China to be subversive because of his calls for Tibetan independence. \nStarting in June this year, tensions flared again over a disputed region called the Doklam Plateau that borders China, Bhutan and the Indian state of Sikkim. \nAs NPR's Julie McCarthy reported from New Delhi in July , the problems stemmed from China's construction of a road in Doklam Plateau. \"Not far from the plateau lies the narrow passage that connects India's northeast states with the rest of the country \u2014 a strategic link called the Siliguri Corridor but more commonly known as the \"Chicken's Neck. \" Any possibility of China being able to sever that \"neck\" unnerves India. \nAs late as August, India had rushed troops to Doklam Plateau and although an immediate conflict was avoided, heated rhetoric on both sides has soured relations. \nIn September, India's army chief said that his country \"could not afford to be complacent and must be prepared for war,\" according to The Hindustan Times. \nAnd in November, China took umbrage at Indian President Ram Nath Kovind's visit to the remote state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China also claims, Reuters reports.

It provides valuable information to the industry insiders, potential entrants or investors. It includes an exhaustive enquiry with the reliability of logic and the comprehensiveness of contents. Request Free Sample Report: www.marketresearchhub.com/enquiry.php?type=S&repid=1394120 \"The UK Accessories Market 2017-2022\", report offers comprehensive insight and analysis of the market (including forecasts up to 2022), the major players, the main trends, and consumer attitudes. It provides in-depth analysis of the following: the hot issues impacting the market (the tourism boost to the premium and luxury segments, online displays restricting impulse purchases, under 35s driving the market, untapped potential in mens accessories, autumn/winter 17 and spring/summer 18 accessories trends), strategies for success, market sizes and forecasts, retailer profiles, retailer market shares, consumer data and future outlook. While accessories spend is forecast to rise by 1.6% in 2017, volumes are in decline - with a fall in shopper numbers and a cut back on self-treating to blame. Womens accessories will outperform mens over the next five years. The midmarket accessories leaders continue to lose their share of spend as value players, such as Primark, improve ranges, and the premium segment prospers from a tourism boost. Scope - 4.0 million fewer domestic consumers shop for fashion accessories in 2017. - Replacement purchases are now the main trigger of purchasing accessories among domestic shoppers, compared to consumers spending because they want a treat. - Price remains the core driver of spend forcing retailers to minimise inflationary price increases in 2017 and 2018. - While the accessories specialists channel is forecast to grow 0.3 percentage points over the next five years, Accessorize and Claires will struggle, and premium and luxury specialist brands will outperform.

Our sensation of time always moving forward isn't a representation of time's real nature. Like Segment Five said, the real cage isn't outside us, as a computer simulation would be, it is in us. The sixth sense that the Isu deprived us of.\nTime, as Segment Two says, is a system that defines what comes to be. That's it. Just a natural system. The Isu refer to it as \"code,\" because they use a mathematical language to easily understand and communicate the concepts. Just like we do for genetics, or physics, etc.\nWe can call something a \"book\" but that word is simply a subjective designation that we gave the object, and not even a universal one. Spanish speakers would call it \"libro,\" German speakers would call it \"buch.\" Objectively, it's none of these things. It just is. It exists independently of what we call it. The same with time. It exists as a part of nature. The Isu use mathematical equations to understand it.\nThe world was originally going to end because of the solar flare. Desmond stopped that. Now it seems it's going to end because of humanity's destructive tendencies. All of the variables, all possible actions and events, will lead to that end. That's not time, or the universe, or a simulation's doing...it's our doing.\nAnd all of this doesn't even get into the fact that making the universe a simulation is probably the absolute worst thing they could possibly do to the series. Everything we did over the course of ten years and nine games? Pointless. None of it was real. There's a real universe out there, but we'll never see it. It would be a useless twist.

Scott Barbour / Getty Images Members of Parliament celebrate at Parliament House on Thursday in Canberra, Australia, after the approval of same-sex marriage. Michael Masters / Getty Images \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of registered voters and ensured that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\"   \u00a9 2017 KWIT 4647 Stone Avenue, Sioux City, Iowa 51106 712-274-6406 business line . 1-800-251-3690 studio",

Alex Wong / Getty Images \nFour months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in \"tatters\" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics. \nIt's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray. \nOn Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch. 1. Russia, Russia, Russia \nWray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, \"a witch hunt.\" \nWray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied to the Trump campaign, including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nDoes that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Stzrok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation , suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case? \nShould there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him? \nLook for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this. \n\"The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,\" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing. \n\"We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,\" Goodlatte added. 2. Independence \nThe job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was \"the Russia thing.\" \nFor his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees , who have faced criticism from the president this year. \nThis week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to \"keep calm and tackle hard\" amid the current adverse climate. And, at his confirmation hearing, Wray pledged his loyalty was to the Constitution, not a political regime. \"I will never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice, period, full stop,\" he said at the time. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee will no doubt want to ask Wray about his contacts with President Trump and others in the White House this year. 3. Oh, yeah \u2014 FBI business \nIn a matter of weeks, an important electronic surveillance tool will expire if Congress does not reauthorize it. The murder rate has spiked in several major American cities. \nCourts have thrown out corruption charges or reduced sentences of public officials accused of bribery and other offenses, following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the tools the Justice Department's public integrity unit can use to attack graft in state houses across the country. \nThe bureau also has open investigations into activity by sympathizers of the Islamic State in every one of its field offices. \nThe FBI, in short, has its hands in many baskets. And after the questions about Russia and Trump, members of the committee may want to discuss some business in regular order.   \u00a9 2017 KWIT 4647 Stone Avenue, Sioux City, Iowa 51106 712-274-6406 business line . 1-800-251-3690 studio", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christopher wray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carrie johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael flynn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goodlatte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia  wray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul manafort", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james comey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "comey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex wong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob goodlatte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter stzrok", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wray", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the house judiciary committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate judiciary committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house judiciary committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nbc news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bureau", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-va.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iowa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sioux city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:44:47.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "70993ed51ab23bb83cf091508a2269878844872f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSX66fZOWxt.Y538NTwyHgQ_J7eCIRfTrLN6uZ4OQR2ga7Vl2aizzEcbeHrBXHn3UB73cdbRp13o8BfQEudKJNUkiW5Mzf5zUNB_EGwmDSh1CogFCcDM2ieg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Assassin's Creed", "title": "The Empirical Truth, Simpler than we Thought.", "title_full": "The Empirical Truth, Simpler than we Thought. : assassinscreed", "published": "2017-12-07T03:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d477bf1e2b0cf6e304068ee0b655119deeb11435", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSX66fZOWxt.Y538NTwyHgQ_J7eCIRfTrLN6uZ4OQR2ga7Vl2aizzEcbeHrBXHn3UB73cdbRp13o8BfQEudKJNUkiW5Mzf5zUNB_EGwmDSh1DI1Hm.TYFV51WJR7X6HopcborQyGkZU6o-", "ord_in_thread": 13, "author": "TDCAUGirl", "published": "2017-12-07T08:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I believe it is a matter of personal interpretation, and we can only agree to disagree for now, at least until we see how things will play and who's right.

He cited safety concerns for himself and his family as the reason for resigning. On Monday morning, December 4, Slusiewicz discovered that his office window had been damaged over the weekend. The Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department personnel found a possible bullet hole in his window, but according to Chief of Police Services Matthew Barr, no projectile was found and there is no suspect as of now. The investigation is ongoing. \nSlusiewicz was first elected to the Laguna Niguel City Council in 2012 and re-elected in 2016. In his letter of resignation, Slusiewicz stated, \u201cServing the citizens of Laguna Niguel has always been a tremendous privilege and I am grateful to the taxpayers who twice elected me as their advocate. Yet my greatest commitment has always has been to my family and my highest honor serving as a husband and a father. Their safety is my top priority, and this has shaken us to the core. Considering the events of the last 48 hours, we have decided as a family that it would be unwise for me to remain on the City Council.\u201d \nIt was with understanding and regret that the City Council accepted Slusiewicz\u2019s resignation at Tuesday\u2019s council meeting. Mayor Gennawey said, \u201cIt is shocking and concerning that this would happen in our City. I know our police services are investigating it. I certainly understand that Jerry wants to put his family first and while we accept his resignation with a heavy heart, we thank him for his years of public service both as an elected leader and a community volunteer.\u201d \nThe City Council will decide how to fill the vacated council seat at a future City Council meeting. #### \nVoice of OC posts press releases to provide readers with information directly from organizations.

The Republican-led House passed a bill to make it easier for gun owners to legally carry concealed weapons across state lines. J. Scott Applewhite / AP \nThe House approved a bill on Wednesday that would ease legal restrictions for carrying concealed firearms across state lines \u2013 a move pushed by the National Rifle Association that comes just weeks after mass shootings in Las Vegas and Texas. \nOn a mostly party-line vote, the measure easily passed, 231-198, although 14 Republicans voted no. Six Democrats voted for the so-called reciprocity measure, which would allow a gun owner with the proper permit in any state to carry a concealed firearm to another state where it is also legal. \nThe bill now goes to the Senate, where it is likely to encounter a much tougher battle. \nIn the House version, GOP lawmakers added a measure aimed at strengthening tracking in the national background-check database of legal and mental health records that might prevent some gun purchases. Just last month it was revealed that Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman who killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., legally purchase firearms used in the attack despite a record of domestic assault in the Air Force that should have disqualified him. \nHowever, as The New York Times reports: \"... the background check measure was not enough to win over most Democrats, nor did it persuade law enforcement officials in some of the largest cities, including New York, who say the legislation would force locales with strict gun laws to bow to places with few or no gun restrictions.\" \nThe bill angered many Democrats who argued that following mass shootings that have killed 80 people, the times called for stricter, not looser gun measures. \nConnecticut Democrat Rep. Elizabeth Esty \u2014 who represents Newtown, Conn., where 20 first-graders and six teachers and staff were killed in a 2012 mass shooting \u2013 said the bill would undermine states' rights, \"hamstring law enforcement and allow dangerous criminals to walk around with hidden guns anywhere and at any time. It's unspeakable that this is Congress' response to the worst gun tragedies in American history,\" according to The Associated Press. \nThe NRA's executive director, Chris Cox, is quoted in the Times as saying Thursday's vote is a \"watershed\" for Second Amendment rights and that the bill would ensure \"all law-abiding citizens in our great country can protect themselves in the manner they see fit without accidentally running afoul of the law.\" \nIn the Senate, supporters would likely need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster by Democrats.   \u00a9 2017 KWIT 4647 Stone Avenue, Sioux City, Iowa 51106 712-274-6406 business line . 1-800-251-3690 studio", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scott neuman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. scott applewhite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elizabeth esty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris cox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "devin patrick kelley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national rifle association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "air force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wis.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tex.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newtown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iowa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conn.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sioux city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sutherland springs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:44:48.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ba52844a00fccf36647670e37c9d44ed88ff0f05", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKZcjWHgtK50_ypGrmi_IJxgfdKoGSu6qKaQcwrxL.A11_ykDREhsJq7aWwhWfpaeWABborrh8Q6G4OGIgMiFF9Q--", "site_full": "www.freelancer.com.au", "site": "freelancer.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.freelancer.com.au/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Freelancer - New Projects", "title": "Take some photos by inadevart", "title_full": "Take some photos by inadevart", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.f-cdn.com/assets/img/facebook/default-04d56222.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 65835, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ba52844a00fccf36647670e37c9d44ed88ff0f05", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKZcjWHgtK50_ypGrmi_IJxgfdKoGSu6qKaQcwrxL.A11_ykDREhsJq7aWwhWfpaeWABborrh8Q6G4OGIgMiFF9Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "Take some photos by inadevart", "text": "Set your budget and timeframe Outline your proposal Get paid for your work It's free to sign up and bid on jobs 19 freelancers are bidding on average $90 for this job Designing services.

Tauseef Mustafa / AFP/Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 2:27 am \nMonths after a tense standoff between China and India along their Himalayan border, Beijing on Thursday expressed anger at an Indian drone that crashed inside its territory. \n\"This action by India violated China's territorial sovereignty. We express strong dissatisfaction and opposition,\" Xinhua cited Zhang Shuili, a senior military official in China's western battle zone command, as saying. \nChina said the drone crashed in \"recent days\" but didn't say where. Zhang said his country would defend its national sovereignty against such intrusions. \nHe said China's border defense forces conducted \"an inspection of the device,\" but didn't elaborate. \nIndia has not responded to the charge. \nAlthough the two countries have made moves toward warmer relations in recent years, they also have a long history of border tensions. In 1962, they fought a brief, but inconclusive border conflict. They have also had ongoing disputes over sovereignty in other border areas, notably Aksai Chin, a Himalayan region that straddles their territorial demarcation in the west. \nThe two countries have also long been at odds over India's hosting of Tibet's government-in-exile and their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, considered by China to be subversive because of his calls for Tibetan independence. \nStarting in June this year, tensions flared again over a disputed region called the Doklam Plateau that borders China, Bhutan and the Indian state of Sikkim. \nAs NPR's Julie McCarthy reported from New Delhi in July , the problems stemmed from China's construction of a road in Doklam Plateau. \"Not far from the plateau lies the narrow passage that connects India's northeast states with the rest of the country \u2014 a strategic link called the Siliguri Corridor but more commonly known as the \"Chicken's Neck. \" Any possibility of China being able to sever that \"neck\" unnerves India. \nAs late as August, India had rushed troops to Doklam Plateau and although an immediate conflict was avoided, heated rhetoric on both sides has soured relations. \nIn September, India's army chief said that his country \"could not afford to be complacent and must be prepared for war,\" according to The Hindustan Times. \nAnd in November, China took umbrage at Indian President Ram Nath Kovind's visit to the remote state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China also claims, Reuters reports.   \u00a9 2017 KWIT 4647 Stone Avenue, Sioux City, Iowa 51106 712-274-6406 business line . 1-800-251-3690 studio", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scott neuman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhang shuili", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ram nath kovind", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julie mccarthy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tauseef mustafa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aksai chin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dalai lama", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "npr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xinhua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hindustan times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arunachal pradesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhutan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pulwama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sikkim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sioux city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "srinagar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tibet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siliguri corridor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iowa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "padgampora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doklam plateau", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:44:49.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a7142b1d48cbe52b6d88c1d2eff730198c713dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKprIkY0g9nZLmz4IHWwgkVsFo_AZF7IxvRO8FgdwsljMMkoctI2r_vmkMb5QsNL5cndv7Vc0JszZq9W1cMjbJOg--", "site_full": "www.freelancer.com.pe", "site": "freelancer.com.pe", "site_section": "https://www.freelancer.com.pe/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "freelance_writing"], "section_title": "Freelancer - New Projects", "title": "Translating English to French and German by katerynaF", "title_full": "Translating English to French and German by katerynaF", "published": "2017-12-07T11:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "PE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.f-cdn.com/assets/img/facebook/default-04d56222.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3a7142b1d48cbe52b6d88c1d2eff730198c713dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKprIkY0g9nZLmz4IHWwgkVsFo_AZF7IxvRO8FgdwsljMMkoctI2r_vmkMb5QsNL5cndv7Vc0JszZq9W1cMjbJOg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "Translating English to French and German by katerynaF", "text": "Translating English to French and German \nOur company focused on IT technology. \nWe need to translate our site from English to French and German. \u00a1Ofr\u00e9cete a trabajar en este proyecto ahora!

The airlines say any such batteries need to be removable. Rob Carr / Getty Images Originally published on December 6, 2017 6:42 pm \nAirlines including American, Delta and Alaska have announced restrictions on so-called smart luggage because the lithium-ion batteries found in many of these suitcases pose a fire risk. \nThese kinds of bags have proliferated in recent years, including motorized suitcases you can ride and one pitched as an autonomous \" robot companion \" that follows you around. \nPrices can range from $275 to more than $1,000 , depending on a bag's bells and whistles, like device charging, GPS tracking, remote locking and built-in weight sensors. But these features require power, often in the form of lithium-ion batteries. \nThe batteries are in many electronics these days, because they are extremely efficient . But li-ion batteries have the potential to overheat and ignite, as shown in dramatic fashion by the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which the Department of Transportation banned from flights last fall after dozens of reports of the smartphone's batteries smoking, catching fire and exploding . In 2015, many airlines banned hoverboards owing to similar concerns. \n\"Beginning Jan. 15, customers who travel with a smart bag must be able to remove the battery in case the bag has to be checked at any point in the customer's journey. If the battery cannot be removed, the bag will not be allowed,\" American said in a statement on Friday. The same day, Delta and Alaska announced similar policies on their flights. \nAmerican's policy dictates that if the bag is carry-on size, passengers can take the luggage onboard, so long as the battery can be removed if needed. If passengers need to check the bag, the battery must be removed and carried onboard. But if the bag has a nonremovable battery, it can't be checked or carried on. \nAn FAA spokesman told The Washington Post that the airlines' policies are \"consistent with our guidance that lithium-ion batteries should not be carried in the cargo hold.\" \nThe FAA's policy on portable electronic devices containing these batteries states: \n\"Devices containing lithium metal or lithium ion batteries (laptops, smartphones, tablets, etc.) should be carried in carry-on baggage when possible. When these devices must be carried in checked baggage, they should be turned completely off, protected from accidental activation, and packed so they are protected from damage. \n\"Spare (uninstalled) lithium metal and lithium ion batteries are always prohibited in checked baggage and must be placed in carry-on. When a carry-on bag is checked at the gate or at planeside, any spare lithium batteries must be removed from the bag and kept with the passenger in the aircraft cabin.\" \nIn May, the International Air Transport Association, an airline trade association, published suggested smart bag guidelines for airlines. Its list of hazards and potential consequences is enough to make any flyer a little nervous. \nA spokesman for American tells NPR that rules banning the bags' powerful lithium batteries from checked baggage aren't because they're more likely to catch fire in a cargo hold, but because it's hard to fight a fire that breaks out there. \n\"You have very limited options in the cargo hold,\" American spokesman Ross Feinstein says. If a fire starts there, the crew can use fire suppression bottles to fight it, \"but you can only deploy them once.\" \n\"In the cabin, passengers and crew can fight a fire,\" he adds. \nFor manufacturers of luggage with nonremovable batteries , the airlines' restrictions are a blow. \n\"Before and at the time of production, we did our due diligence to make sure that we complied with all international regulations defined by DOT and FAA,\" one such company, Bluesmart, said on its website . \"While most airlines understand and approve of smart luggage, others might still be getting up to speed. We are saddened by these latest changes to some airline regulations and feel it is a step back not only for travel technology but it also presents an obstacle to streamlining and improving the way we all travel.\" \nSome luggage makers advertise that their bags are \"TSA-approved.\" \nBut TSA does not approve or endorse bags. And Feinstein says that on American, there won't be any exemptions to its policies, no matter the manufacturer. \n\"We know these bags are getting popular,\" Feinstein says. \"American is not opposed to smart bags. However, the battery must be removable.\"   \u00a9 2017 KWIT 4647 Stone Avenue, Sioux City, Iowa 51106 712-274-6406 business line . 1-800-251-3690 studio", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laurel wamsley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob carr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "feinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ross feinstein", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "npr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bluesmart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "airlines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung galaxy note", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images originally", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of transportation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international air transport association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the washington post", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iowa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alaska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sioux city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:44:50.006+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15112200, "moreResultsAvailable": 15112100, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512639890006&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 506}
