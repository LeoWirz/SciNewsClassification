This will probably be happening early next week sometime.\nThe software is amazing. Those who use your phones to access the site will be thanking me. The mobile version is awesome. And the desk top version is fast - it has pretty much the same look and feel, and it is more responsive. The CAG members have been checking it out for a little over a week, and so far no one has mutinied .\nAnyway - some caveats:\nThe \"Thanks\". We are having problems importing the thanking system. The new forum has a thanks system in place, but does not display the older ones in the forum posts. So we may have to ditch that and start afresh.\nThere are newer \"Thanks\" plugins for the new forum, it just won't be able to calculate the ones you have already been given. It has imported the likes, so you will have those to admire.\nSocial Groups or the Meister Clubs: We may have to ditch these as well. The software is just not importing these correctly. We can keep a copy of them and perhaps import them at a later date, but not that many people are using them, and this doesn't justify holding off on the relaunch. Sorry for those of you who have been using the Meister Clubs.\nBlogs : These aren't porting over very well either. So they will have to be loaded up at a latter time. Perhaps it could be done on the Word Press sections. We will see.\nWho has read a thread: This works fine, but it hasn't imported the historical \"reads\". Sorry 'bout that.\nWhen the export/import of the forum commences, it is going to take some time (it takes 5 hours for the PMs alone), so the forum will be down, but in a \"read only\" mode. You will be able to peruse the posts/threads etc.; you just won't be able to do anything that will change the data base.\nSo watch this space for more info. I'm trying to create a new thread in the \"Mesiter Minions\" for withdrawal reports - but I can't create a thread. Is this classified as Mesiter club, hence why it doesn't work?

One answer, according to DailyMail\u2019s U.S. director of programmatic sales Patrick Dignan, could be sentiment analysis. \n\u201cAdvertising has always been about the emotional connect,\u201d explained Dignan, during an interview at the 2017 FUSE Media Summit. \u201cIt\u2019s why TV advertising has always been so successful.\u201d He thinks that sentiment analysis tools like Centiment , which competed in and won the Startup Derby competition at FUSE Media, can help make emotion-driven programmatic ads a reality. \nUsing artificial intelligence , sentiment analysis tools can help publishers and advertisers understand how consumers react to certain topics. Media companies can use those insights to deliver more poignant marketing messengers to consumers.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dailymail", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dignan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick dignan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "proctor & gamble", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fuse media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "media rating council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:56.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "707cfb084d33a4d5f844cecc03c9624ecbd8ca89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpS_KpuZHf1vkE.gyUoIMR1bjwRm8T5CDeOsQL.BfzjANxeIYBL4Tvy4XTsUMorUYbJuPk2mwpaSESrjsNgv1uSc4yLVHFbr1tk-", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "https://www.hotukdeals.com/tag/audiovisual-new", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Audiovisual Deals \u21d2 Cheap price, best Sale in UK - HotUKDeals", "title": "Apple TV 4K Box 32gb 159.30 64gb \u00a3177.30 at Groupon (with code)", "title_full": "Apple TV 4K Box 32gb 159.30 64gb \u00a3177.30 at Groupon (with code) - HotUKDeals", "published": "2017-12-07T04:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.198, "main_image": "https://images.hotukdeals.com/threads/thread_full_screen/default/2849219_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1864, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3eddc33dcbf85287f2b783f550d4f9d783d8069f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpS_KpuZHf1vkE.gyUoIMR1bjwRm8T5CDeOsQL.BfzjANxeIYBL4Tvy4XTsUMorUYbJuPk2mwpaSESrjsNgv1uScgXM4l1l1Jv4X1VepSJHPXgXW2NyBwHBB", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "webhose.io", "published": "2017-12-07T06:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Is this just the usual 'vote cold because it's Apple' or is there cheaper out there?

Here is the real question, ''Can Many Religions All Be True?'' That question will be opined on lastly. And after you are through reading my simplified answer to that very REAL question, please watch the video at the end. Learn about 'Big History', a  unified approach to understanding what is REAL. God and HIs Universe are calling us to greatness.\n\n'' Science without religion is lame,\nreligion without science is blind.'' \n\u2015 Albert Einstein\n\nReligion is a system for worshiping God or whatever you call God or your higher power. Religion can also be anything we are devoted to such as our families or jobs, even our hobbies. But mainly we are speaking about and to the observances of God and worshipping our own idea of God.\n\nThe existence and variety of so many religions confuses people who are sincerely looking for the truth about God. Some want the absolute, final word before they even find Faith. Some even say that the existence of so many religions is proof that either you cannot know God or that God simply does not exist.\n\n'' The Christian does not think God will love us because we are good,\nbut that God will make us good because He loves us.'' \n\u2015 C.S. Lewis \nWhy are so many religions? Because the truth of God has a space in every human heart and soul. God designed us that way. He did that so that we, His created could choose Him or reject Him. It is a need we are all born with, but most of us, instead of accepting the truth about God and submitting to it,  reject Him and seek their own way to fill that space created and reserved for God. Very often, far too often, we fill that space with junk. Junk like food, toys, and vices like drugs and alcohol.\n\nMany people do not want to believe in the kind of God who demands strict morality and a code of conduct, so they invent their own God(s) who will make no such demands. The creates a wide road to travel on through life. Religions tend to narrow that road considerably pointing the pilgrim directly towards God.\n\nSome people do not want to follow a God who says it impossible for people to buy their way into heaven. So they create a God who accepts people into heaven if they have followed certain steps, followed certain rules, and adhered to certain laws, and with some it is just the 'good old college try'.\n\nWe, humankind in general, like to replace our Creator with a God who is more to our liking, often a God created by us, in our own image. The problematic danger? We are not perfect. We didn't create the Universe and all it's laws of operation. In fact we do nothing without both the guidance and allowance of God. \n\nThe good news in all of this, is that we have a continuing partnership with God, even if we reject Him. We serve Him, but he also serves us. \n\nWe saw it when God came to earth by incarnating Himself to teach us. He washed his disciples feet. ''If I then, your teacher and master, have washed your feet, it is also your duty to wash one another's feet. For I have set you an example in order that you may do what I have done to you.'' A humble partnership. Jesus also made it very clear by doing this that He would not ask us to do anything that He would not do Himself. This is also the mark of true leadership.\n\nSo, for the question at hand. ''Can Many Religions All Be True?'' The simple answer is yes. Do all religious belief systems lead to God? Actually they really do. God has made it so. Remember that space in our heart, soul and spirit that God created? It has to be filled, not with money, power and other material and carnal wants, but with God. \n\nHow you get to your belief in God is your business, not mine. I am your brother, not your judge. We all need to live and let live. It is your path. Along that path are many 'gods'. Many of you will have to try out many of them to see how they 'fit'\u2015 to see if they fit that space God Almighty created for it.\n\nWe are all looking for that 'fit'. We all find it in the end. Just remember that God the Creator, the one(1) and the only has many names. With no explanation, I will leave you with this, a passage from the Bible, concerning the return of God in human form:\n\n''On His head were many crowns. He had a name written on Him that no one knew except Himself.\n\n'' God has no religion.''   \u2015 Mahatma Gandhi \n\n''Religion 3.0'' \nby Michael Dowd \nLanguage changes over time, and words create worlds. What we call Reality , the ancients called God , or if you lived in a polytheistic culture, the gods . These were personifications of our inner and outer reality. This fundamental insight not only makes sense of religious differences and bridges the science-religion divide, it also clarifies our way into the future.\n\nI\u2019m a Big History evangelist \u2014 I preach \u2018the gospel of right relationship to reality\u2019 \u2014 that is, the Good News that is only possible when we, individually and collectively, live in right relationship to what is fundamentally and inescapably REAL. \nHere is my recent TEDxGrandRapids talk, titled, \u201cReality Reconciles Science and Religion.\u201d \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "c.s. lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2015 mahatma gandhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael dowd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2015 albert einstein", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "corthell  religion", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:56.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "707cfb084d33a4d5f844cecc03c9624ecbd8ca89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpS_KpuZHf1vkE.gyUoIMR1bjwRm8T5CDeOsQL.BfzjANxeIYBL4Tvy4XTsUMorUYbJuPk2mwpaSESrjsNgv1uSc4yLVHFbr1tk-", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "https://www.hotukdeals.com/tag/audiovisual-new", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Audiovisual Deals \u21d2 Cheap price, best Sale in UK - HotUKDeals", "title": "Apple TV 4K Box 32gb 159.30 64gb \u00a3177.30 at Groupon (with code)", "title_full": "Apple TV 4K Box 32gb 159.30 64gb \u00a3177.30 at Groupon (with code) - HotUKDeals", "published": "2017-12-07T04:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.198, "main_image": "https://images.hotukdeals.com/threads/thread_full_screen/default/2849219_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1864, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "345b99441046de6d796aa9f20a060c25ac3b92b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpS_KpuZHf1vkE.gyUoIMR1bjwRm8T5CDeOsQL.BfzjANxeIYBL4Tvy4XTsUMorUYbJuPk2mwpaSESrjsNgv1uScgXM4l1l1Jv4X1VepSJHPXrBtHaO1kqG_", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "webhose.io", "published": "2017-12-07T06:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Amazon Prime app was made available today.

Lakers travelling to Pennsylvania to play host Philadelphia 76ers. LA is on a five game losing streak and begins a four game Eastern road trip tonight which will take them to Philly, Charlotte, New York and Cleveland. \nIn their last game the Sixers lost to a young Suns squad with Joel Embiid in the lineup. Devin Booker was on fire in this game scoring 46 points on Philadelphia\u2019s defensive unit. In the last five games the 76res are 2-3 with additional losses to Boston to Cleveland. \nIn 312 all-time head to head matches the Lakers hold the edge 144-134. The past two seasons the squads have split their games. L.A. Lakers \nThe Lakers enter on a five game losing streak, the most recent a 23 point loss to Houston. While the team has demonstrated glimpses they are still a squad in development. \nLonzo Ball has fallen short of initial expectations particularly in his inability to hit shots from the field. News of Ball nursing injuries to both calves may be the current reason, but it\u2019s his shot which needs to be fundamental reworked. \nThe second Lakers rookie Kyle Kuzma is enjoying his initial professional season. Kuzma leads the team in points per game (16.8) adding 6.5 rebounds per contest. Brandon Ingram is starting to recognize success and learning how to utilize his length on the floor. \nOn the season Ingram is averaging 16 points, 5.4 rebounds and 2.9 assists. In the first game versus the Lakers Ingram scored 26 points adding 11 rebounds (both team highs). \nDespite the losing streak and lottery bound record the Lakers continue to be among the top ten defensive squads in the Association ranking 8th. Philadelphia 76ers \nWhen the Sixers played in L.A. Joel Embiid delivered a performance for the ages. Embiid\u2019s stat line featured 46 points, 15 rebounds, 7 assists, and 7 blocks. \nThe big man was aggressive getting to the line 19 times (made 16). His shooting was highly efficient connecting on 14 of 20 from the field and 2 of 3 from deep. \nEmbiid thoroughly enjoy the spotlight and will be licking his chops at the prospect of facing the Lakers so soon after his dominant performance. \nThe Sixers are still without this season\u2019s top pick Markelle Fultz (shoulder), but rumor is he should return to the lineup sometime within the next two to three weeks. Other players who may miss the game are Justin Anderson (shin splints), T.J. McConnell (shoulder) and Jahlil Okafor who remains on the shopping block. NBA Betting Trends: In their last 11 home contests the Sixers are 8-3 ATS. In the last 18 head to head games the road team is 14-4 ATS Teams are 5-5 ATS in last 10 head to head Over Under is 4-6 in team\u2019s last 10 head to head matchups Free L.A. Lakers vs. Philadelphia 76ers NBA Prediction: \nJoel Embiid gets up for these nationally televised games using them as an opportunity to build upon his growing fame. \nGiven the Lakers 2-8 road record and struggles scoring it feels like too many factors for LA to overcome. In the initial meeting the squads put on a scoring feast with Philly winning 115-109. 4* Free NBA Betting Pick: Lakers +8 \nHow successful Lakers coach Luke Walton is at getting his charges to focus defensively will determine the outcome. But, with TNT airing the game fans could be in for another Embiid explosion. \nAlthough the Sixers likely garner the victory and the Lakers struggle on the road I think they\u2019ll keep the score close enough to warrant taking the points. \nNBA   Sixers 107 \u2013 Lakers 101 \n  NBA picks like this L.A.

Ravi posted videos of the break-in on Facebook. The firm\u2019s security officer, Rueben, and other employees \u201cmade it clear\u201d that Ravi and Lai were not welcome, prosecutors said. They also called the police. \nThe firm changed its lock after the break-in. \nOn Jun 23, Rueben reported a second break-in. He called the police, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s M Ravi.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement \nRavi and Lai had intended to break into the office the day before, when they realised the lock had been changed. \nThey returned next day with a screwdriver, which Lai used to unscrew the newly installed metal shutter, bypassing the new lock. \nRavi similarly posted a video of the break-in on Facebook. The men\u2019s intent was to \u201cannoy Rueben\u201d, prosecutors said. \nAfter this incident, the firm hired a contractor to secure the shutter by screwing it into the ground. When the men returned on Jun 26, they found the shutter fastened firmly to the ground with eight screws. \nThey returned next day with the screwdriver and broke into the office. Again, Ravi posted a video of the break-in on Facebook. \nLai\u2019s intention was to help his friend of 15 years, his lawyer Satwant Singh said. \u201cWhen (Lai) saw Ravi having trouble with his psychiatric condition, he did his best to offer any help he could,\u201d the lawyer said. \nWhen Ravi asked Lai to break into the firm\u2019s office, Lai obliged. \u201cMr Lai felt (pity) for Ravi \u2026 seeing a good lawyer like (him) in such a state of distress,\u201d Mr Singh said. \nHe also thought that \u201cit would be alright to enter the office since the premises would probably be available again to Ravi at a later stage\u201d. \nMr Singh also noted the offences were committed while Ravi was \u201csuffering from a relapse of bipolar disorder, and he was clearly in a state of frenzy\u201d. \nLai pleaded guilty on Thursday to two of charges of housebreaking. \nA third count was taken into consideration for sentencing. \nFor housebreaking, Lai could have been jailed for up to two years per charge and fined. \nRavi pleaded guilty to the charges in November. He will be sentenced in January.

REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne Varadkar has played a key role in negotiations over Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union this week, insisting that a tentative deal struck on the Irish border on Monday must be fulfilled if talks are to move onto the next phase, as London wants.\nThat was in sharp contrast to a week earlier when his deputy prime minister had to resign to avert a government collapse and election before Christmas, an episode that members of Fine Gael feared would damage both the party and its leader.\nYet support for Fine Gael rose by five points to 36 percent in the Irish Times/MRBI poll, while fellow centre-right rival Fianna Fail has fallen four points to 25 percent since October. The left-wing Sinn Fein party was unchanged on 19 percent.\nThe most recent survey taken by another polling company, conducted during the government crisis, showed that the two main parties were almost neck and neck. The number of undecided voters was far higher in the MRBI sample.\nSatisfaction with the government also rose by five points to 41 percent in Thursday\u2019s poll, the highest level achieved by any government in almost a decade.\n\u201cToday\u2019s poll proves that timing is everything,\u201d said MRBI director Aisling Corcoran.\n\u201cInterviewing took place on Monday and Tuesday against the backdrop of Brexit negotiations and the government has been credited with approaching the negotiations with clarity and determination.\u201d\nReporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ",

It was built in the 14th century and suffered a major fire in 1922. The castle is situated on what was once an O'Bannon stronghold. The castle eventually passed into the ownership of the Darby Family, who expanded on the central keep with significant extensions. However, in order to pay for these extensions rent's were raised and much of the land accompanying the castle was sold. This is one theorised motivation for the burning of the castle during the Irish Civil War in 1922. Many people were imprisoned and executed in the castle, and it is supposedly haunted by several spectres, the most terrifying of these beings is a small, hunched creature whose apparition is said to be accompanied by an awful smell.

You can bring gallon jugs. Realize that if any piece of luggage is over 50 pounds (23 kilograms) you may be charged extra, and on some airlines a LOT.\nFor your carry on, you are limited to maximum sized containers of 100 ml (a bit over 3 ounces). It does make matter if the container is 1/2 full, if the size listed on the container is over 100 ml, you will have it confiscated (actually YMMV, I have seen them allow small amounts in larger bottles, but rarely). All the bottles of liquids or gels that are in your carry on, must fit in SINGLE quart (or liter) sized zip lock bag. ONLY ONE ZIP LOCK BAG PER PERSON. I have seen people try to take 3 bags.

While the Tata JV emerged as the lowest bidder for both the Sea Packages 1 & 2, it was awarded only one of the packages (package 2) as provided in the tender conditions. The package awarded to Daewoo \u2013 Tata Projects JV involves construction of a 7.8 km long bridge section across the Mumbai Bay including Shivaji Nagar Interchange at Navi Mumbai at contract value of Rs. 5,612 Crores ($850 million), which is a complex stretch. Tata Projects is one of India\u2019s fastest growing construction company and together with its Korean partner, it will bring state of the art technology and latest construction methods and techniques to deliver this milestone project. The project will use reverse circulation drill method for foundation and erection of a large block (180m) orthotropic steel deck structure at navigational span. Specialised steel will be imported from Japan for fabrication. Tata Projects adheres to highest quality and safety norms and is geared for on-time delivery of its projects. (Reverse Circulation Drilling is a method of piling in hard rock strata wherein the machine drills through the rock and the cut material gets mixed with water, which the machine brings back to surface by using pressurised air. This method is faster and proven to be successful than conventional bored piling method in hard rock. High drilling penetration rates can be achieved using this method as it is quite versatile. It is also an environment-friendly technique when compared to conventional methods as it doesn\u2019t use bentonite/polymer.) (An Orthotropic steel desk structure \u2013 comprises of structural steel plate and an extended arm. The arm is located at the obligatory span for enabling navigation. This structure is stiffened longitudinally and transversely to allow for bearing various loads. Thus, prefabricated structures can be moved across. The 180m structure planned is amongst the largest used.) TATA Projects is one of the fastest growing and most admired infrastructure companies in India. It has expertise in executing large and complex urban and industrial infrastructure projects. TATA Projects operates through its business units \u2013 EPC, Transmission, Transportation, Construction & Environment, Urban Infrastructure and Quality services. The Company provides turnkey end to end solutions to set up power generation plants, power transmission & distribution systems, fully integrated rail & metro systems, commercial buildings & airports, chemical process plants, water and wastewater management solutions, complete mining and metal purification systems.

There is an ever-growing need to encourage and persuade younger generations to choose a career pathway in STEM areas from an early stage in their education, not least because organisations are struggling to find the analytical talent they require. Communications can play a key role in enabling businesses to communicate and attract talent, and create awareness among students. But how can communications have such an impact? \nThe answer could be social media. As technology evolves and becomes faster, online interactions are increasing. Today, there are 2.8 billion global social media users, of whom 400 million are in Europe. On average, social media users spend 2 hours and 19 minutes a day using social networks. Teenagers and millennials, however, spend around 9 hours a day on social platforms. \nIt\u2019s clear that social media plays a huge role in our lives. It has now become almost a necessity in our daily routine. It is also a perfect tool for bringing larger communities together, allowing people to communicate, share and learn from each other in a more efficient and effective way. \nThe importance of social media also extends to education. According to research by Hootsuite , social media is a crucial area for educational institutions, with over 90 percent using social media for marketing, recruiting and engaging with millennials. Social media enables students to connect with professors and tutors both within and beyond their institution. This means that they can gather views and opinions from a much larger community. \nSocial media also allows businesses to get involved and connect with students, professors and academic institutions. They can therefore provide resources, further learning and connections to current data scientists in business. Finally, it allows users to share experiences that have inspired them. Using social media successful to attract millennials to analytics \nSuccessful social media use requires an understanding about its use. Facebook and Twitter are the most popular channels, followed by Instagram and LinkedIn. Facebook achieves the highest engagement by targeting students demographically. Twitter is designed as a bridging platform where students, academics and learners can consume wider-focus content. Instagram is a way to connect in a more visual way with eye-catching content. LinkedIn can be useful for persuading and educating decision-makers in universities or organisations on adoption of tools to solve future skills gap in analytics/data science. \nThe next step is to define your audience. Analytics plays a role in understanding people\u2019s behaviours, based on data generated on social media platforms. This will allow you to design a clear profile of your target audience and a positioning statement to influence how students will recognize your brand. \nYour strategy should be built around the social media engagement cycle, Consume \u2013 Create \u2013 Curate. This will help develop a strong social media strategy to influence awareness and deliver a clear message: Consume : Millennials are demanding and consume huge amounts of content on social media every day, in a wide range of formats including video, blog posts, webinars, and pictures. They are always looking for trending and interesting pieces of content to download, read, tweet, retweet, like and share. Create : Content needs to be creative and innovative, focusing on areas that interest your target audience. It can also be repurposed, which is a major resource saver. Data analytics will help you to make decisions about the best way to use organic and paid content. Short content, images, videos and testimonies tend to produce the best performances. It is important to have a combination of different activities that work well together, to generate a smooth and cohesive output. Curate : This is the process of sharing content between networks. Carefully create your brand, and by sharing your opinions, you will be able to influence your audience and build a community. Of course, you still need to make sure that you create strong social media experiences. \nThis is a never-ending cycle, because sharing provides feedback based on experience. \nOnce you understand your audience and have a suitable social media strategy, you will start to generate traction. Establishing your audience is, after all, only the first step; you then have to keep them.
