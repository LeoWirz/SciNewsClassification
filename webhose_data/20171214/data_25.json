Scott Barbour / Getty Images Members of Parliament celebrate at Parliament House on Thursday in Canberra, Australia, after the approval of same-sex marriage. Michael Masters / Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 7:50 am \nUpdated at 5:50 a.m. ET \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nMarriage in Australia is now defined as \"the union of two people\" instead of \"union of a man and a woman.\" \nLawmakers had tried and failed some two dozen times in the past to make the change. \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of the 80 percent of registered voters who cast ballots, ensuring that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\"  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scott barbour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george brandis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "parliament approves same-sex marriage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images members of parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "npr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the sydney morning herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "federation square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images  australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:50.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6253628a34376ad7bf99d610bfe372c3659d583e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWdzjE8MP1_UI0PlzfyPHQs.IECCVEmrophGvdLanIW9kNnrYz54IBArsdO1Yjyk2DKNfx2H9kR4bXD9CjkAhH", "site_full": "forums.att.com", "site": "att.com", "site_section": "https://forums.att.com:443/t5/AT-T-PREPAID/bd-p/prepaid", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "AT&amp;T PREPAID - AT&amp;T Community", "title": "Sim Card issues", "title_full": "Sim Card issues - AT&T Community", "published": "2017-11-27T02:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://forums.att.com/html/assets/att_globe_rgb_pos2.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 335, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ef8627dcfe3ec53caf2853a06381f42b33a98606", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWdzjE8MP1_UI0PlzfyPHQs.IECCVEmrophGvdLanIW9kNnrYz54IBArsdO1Yjyk2DKNfx2H9kR.DNlB.d3iHdn22x6Op4iNo-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "ATTCares", "published": "2017-12-06T15:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hello @bjsmith ,\nThank you for reaching out to us on the Community Forums!

Tauseef Mustafa / AFP/Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 7:49 am \nMonths after a tense standoff between China and India along their Himalayan border, Beijing on Thursday expressed anger at an Indian drone that crashed inside its territory. \n\"This action by India violated China's territorial sovereignty. We express strong dissatisfaction and opposition,\" Xinhua cited Zhang Shuili, a senior military official in China's western battle zone command, as saying. \nChina said the drone crashed in \"recent days\" but didn't say where. Zhang said his country would defend its national sovereignty against such intrusions. \nHe said China's border defense forces conducted \"an inspection of the device,\" but didn't elaborate. \nIndia has not responded to the charge. \nAlthough the two countries have made moves toward warmer relations in recent years, they also have a long history of border tensions. In 1962, they fought a brief, but inconclusive border conflict. They have also had ongoing disputes over sovereignty in other border areas, notably Aksai Chin, a Himalayan region that straddles their territorial demarcation in the west. \nThe two countries have also long been at odds over India's hosting of Tibet's government-in-exile and their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, considered by China to be subversive because of his calls for Tibetan independence. \nStarting in June this year, tensions flared again over a disputed region called the Doklam Plateau that borders China, Bhutan and the Indian state of Sikkim. \nAs NPR's Julie McCarthy reported from New Delhi in July , the problems stemmed from China's construction of a road in Doklam Plateau. \"Not far from the plateau lies the narrow passage that connects India's northeast states with the rest of the country \u2014 a strategic link called the Siliguri Corridor but more commonly known as the \"Chicken's Neck. \" Any possibility of China being able to sever that \"neck\" unnerves India. \nAs late as August, India had rushed troops to Doklam Plateau and although an immediate conflict was avoided, heated rhetoric on both sides has soured relations. \nIn September, India's army chief said that his country \"could not afford to be complacent and must be prepared for war,\" according to The Hindustan Times. \nAnd in November, China took umbrage at Indian President Ram Nath Kovind's visit to the remote state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China also claims, Reuters reports.

Six Democrats voted for the so-called reciprocity measure, which would allow a gun owner with the proper permit in any state to carry a concealed firearm to another state where it is also legal. \nThe bill now goes to the Senate, where it is likely to encounter a much tougher battle. \nIn the House version, GOP lawmakers added a measure aimed at strengthening tracking in the national background-check database of legal and mental health records that might prevent some gun purchases. Just last month it was revealed that Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman who killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., legally purchase firearms used in the attack despite a record of domestic assault in the Air Force that should have disqualified him. \nHowever, as The New York Times reports: \"... the background check measure was not enough to win over most Democrats, nor did it persuade law enforcement officials in some of the largest cities, including New York, who say the legislation would force locales with strict gun laws to bow to places with few or no gun restrictions.\" \nThe bill angered many Democrats who argued that following mass shootings that have killed 80 people, the times called for stricter, not looser gun measures. \nConnecticut Democrat Rep. Elizabeth Esty \u2014 who represents Newtown, Conn., where 20 first-graders and six teachers and staff were killed in a 2012 mass shooting \u2013 said the bill would undermine states' rights, \"hamstring law enforcement and allow dangerous criminals to walk around with hidden guns anywhere and at any time. It's unspeakable that this is Congress' response to the worst gun tragedies in American history,\" according to The Associated Press. \nThe NRA's executive director, Chris Cox, is quoted in the Times as saying Thursday's vote is a \"watershed\" for Second Amendment rights and that the bill would ensure \"all law-abiding citizens in our great country can protect themselves in the manner they see fit without accidentally running afoul of the law.\" \nIn the Senate, supporters would likely need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster by Democrats.

Many are as simple as the use of blogs or search engine optimization. This article can help you to understand these techniques and how they work. Then you can put them to work for your business.\n\nMake sure that any mention of your business in the media, be it on television, a magazine or the newspaper, prints your web address or domain name. Many people will want to check you out online if they see you via one of these media outlets. Having an informative up to date web site that they can visit will increase your sales.\n\nUse PLRs, private label rights, for internet marketing if you do not have the time to write. PLR is content that someone writes and after you purchase it, you can do as you wish with it. You can change all, rewrite it, and use it for other purposes. You can find quality PLR in many places on the internet and use the content in your e-mails to customers, followers and subscribers.\n\nTo understand how your audience uses your website, you need to add analytics tracking to the site. Analytics gives you a lot of interesting intelligence about your website visitors including how many are visiting each day, how many are returning a second time, what content they are most interested in, and much more.\n\nTry your best to stay positive. Most readers don't care to read about someone's negativity. The more positive and happy you are, the more you may influence a potential consumer into buying your product. Make them feel as if they can attain your happiness and success, and this will translate into better sales for you!\n\nBuild an internet privacy policy and post it on your website. With the massive amounts of spam and scams all around the web, it is important to do anything that helps build trust with a potential customer. Posting a privacy policy lets your visitors know that you take their privacy seriously and builds the perception that you are a good company to rely on for future purchases or services.\n\nA great way to update an otherwise stagnant website is to include a blog. The thing here is that content is always king on the web. Any search engine out there eats up new info, so having a blog ensures that your business is always updated. If you update a blog regularly you will have fresh content all of the time.\n\nUse a lot of promos on your check out page. A customer can add another product for a discount as a thank you. This is an excellent method of getting rid of surplus inventory and stimulating sales. At the same time, the customer feels as if he or she is getting a deal.\n\nUse a banner that has your brand or slogan on it. This helps to make the web site more professional and communicate your intentions to your visitors. It's an easy and effective way to showcase your business.\n\nPull out all the stops for influential people. Try to link up with well known bloggers and websites. These powerful allies can send many a visitor in your direction, enabling you to increase traffic and productivity. Keep an eye out for these great resources, and take advantage of any friendships that may develop.\n\nAlways project a positive attitude. Even if you are marketing a solution to a problem, focus on the advantages of your solution rather than the pain or inconvenience of the problem. People viewing your website already know all about their difficulties and they would like to know how you can make everything better for them.\n\nGenerally speaking, consumers tend to place a great deal of trust and respect in the leadership of their favorite businesses. Capitalize on this sentiment by including a brief statement by the CEO or Director on your website, accompanied by a photograph and an inspiring quote that effectively communicates appreciation for customers.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nGet started using a video tour of your shop, presenting oneself and showing your very best goods and solutions. Performed correctly, video script can help personalize your company and reach new customers. So, first turn on that digital camera and present the planet why they ought to trade at your online shop. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "andersen hanne   internet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "plr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:51.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "71858bcd5a99a783ca853713cfb8a7442ef8acf0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS6GSgEwbIsqAxTseJtRA_RQ-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "71858bcd5a99a783ca853713cfb8a7442ef8acf0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS6GSgEwbIsqAxTseJtRA_RQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "package main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"os\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tif len(os.Args) < 2 {\n\t\tfmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, \"usage:\\n\\t%s [files]\\n\", os.Args[0])\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\n\tfor _, arg := range os.Args[1:] {\n\t\tfmt.Println(arg)\n\t}\n}", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:51.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f8df361280736103657d6cc3b3a9fc411c037d0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju37t.Xln3DWyf1wlCAWWluiOgLXG67Jq2_pl0JC8reMxVkZf5aMBKBKPhYVaHYs_AWo1Drnx.lMcbTAULf1avSMtK3vQjFD8dk1XgVF9CwQcDw--", "site_full": "www.ign.com", "site": "ign.com", "site_section": "http://www.ign.com/boards/forums/nintendo-lobby.80041/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Nintendo Lobby | IGN Boards", "title": "What Nintendo franchises still have no game announced for Switch?", "title_full": "What Nintendo franchises still have no game announced for Switch?

Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him! (Matthew 7:9-11) \nNotice the exclamation point at the end of the above verse. Let\u2019s say it again: God gives good gifts to those who ask Him! Don\u2019t ever forget that awesome truth. \nAfter reading that verse over and over, I decided to check out what else the Bible has to say about God\u2019s good gifts. Pray through the verses below and let God\u2019s good tidings of great joy fill your heart.\nGift of eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 6:23)\nKnow the Gift of God. If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water. (John 4:10)\nGift of the Holy Spirit. Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. (Acts 2:38)\nGod\u2019s Gifts Can\u2019t Be Bought. May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money! (Acts 8:21)\nDon\u2019t Bother Keeping the Receipt. God\u2019s gifts and his call are irrevocable. (Romans 11:29)\nOverflowing Grace. But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God\u2019s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many! (Romans 5:15)\nDifferent Gifts for Different Folks. We have different gifts , according to the grace given us. (Romans 12:6)\nDifferent Gifts But the Same Spirit. There are different kinds of gifts , but the same Spirit. (1 Corinthians 12:4)\nGod Gives Everything We Need. Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed. (1 Corinthians 1:7)\nBuild Up the Church. Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts , try to excel in gifts that build up the church. (1 Corinthians 14:12)\nServe Others. Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God\u2019s grace in its various forms. (1 Peter 4:10)\nThe Gift Ain\u2019t From Us. For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith\u2014and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God. (Ephesians 2:8)\nUse Your Gift. Do not neglect your gift . (1 Timothy 4:14)\nEvery Good and Perfect Gift. Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.

So why is everyone so quiet?\nSince Lujan Grisham first called on state Sen. Majority Whip Michael Padilla, D-Albuquerque, to step out of the race for lieutenant governor because of his history of creating a \u201csexually hostile\u201d work environment, there\u2019s been a deafening silence. Yes, we\u2019ve heard from Padilla about consulting with his friends and family; we\u2019ve seen handwringing from legislative leadership about their sexual harassment polices (or lack thereof); and we\u2019ve even had a reporter apologize for not taking the story seriously sooner.\nBut we have not had the chorus of amens and thank-yous that I expected. Only a few people have said anything at all. Why are we so tight-lipped when we\u2019ve been waiting since the Anita Hill hearings to finally have a moment in which women are believed and men are held accountable?\nThe answer is that silence is what sexual harassment and sexual assault victims, which so many of us are, have always been relegated to. Not by choice, but by the painful reality of what it would be like to be shamed, blamed and humiliated by speaking out. It is and has always been scary to speak out. But this is our moment to break our silence, to be heard and to stand by women who, like Lujan Grisham, say enough is enough.\nI\u2019ve also been surprised by the whispered rationalizations and excuses for Padilla\u2019s behavior that I have heard, quietly, from people who are typically outspoken advocates for women.\nOne person even said that by bringing up Padilla\u2019s record of sexual harassment Lujan Grisham is dwelling in the past, when she needs to be focused on the future.\nBut focusing on the future is exactly what Lujan Grisham is doing: a future in which women won\u2019t be second-class citizens in the workplace and in which they will know that their harassers will be held accountable. And a future in which we no longer have to be silent. That\u2019s certainly the future I want for my daughter and stepdaughter.\nThankfully, that future is finally possible Things are actually changing. We too can speak out, just like the hundreds and hundreds of women who recently shared their stories through the #MeToo campaign or those who\u2019ve recently taken action against their abusers.\nToday, at last, when we speak up, we are believed and action is taken. We no longer respect and admire sexual harassers; we thank them for their service and show them the door.\nNPR gets it. NBC gets it. All of Louis CK\u2019s contractors get it. Even Fox News sort of gets it.\nWhy, then, are we in New M\u00e9xico \u2013 and Democrats in general \u2014 having so much trouble talking about it?\nA big part of it for us in New Mexico may be that Padilla is pretty darn likeable. He\u2019s a hard-worker. He\u2019s a self-made man who overcame great odds to find success and, as a state senator, he hasn\u2019t forgotten his roots.\nBut sexual harassment is unacceptable and we must hold the line \u2013 even when the allegations come against people we like.\nThe fact is that it is possible to be a great advocate for working families, as Padilla has been, and to have created a \u201csexually hostile\u201d work environment as court documents say he did. Likewise, it is possible to be a beloved national progressive standard-bearer and still have groped women during photo-ops as Sen. Al Franken has done. It\u2019s even possible to be a civil rights leader, like Rep. John Conyers, and to have abused your power.\nWe are all complicated people with complicated stories. Human gifts and human failings are not mutually exclusive.\nMr. Conyers, you are an icon. Your work to advance civil rights and equality has truly changed our world, and, from the bottom of our hearts, we thank you. Now, it is time for you to let someone who has not fired an employee for refusing to have sex with him carry on your work.\nMr. Franken, you made us laugh. You definitely brought U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions down a peg, and we thank you for it. Now, it\u2019s time to go and let someone who has not posed for pictures while groping the breasts of a sleeping woman take your place.\nAnd, Mr. Padilla, thank you for all you have done for your community. Thank you for advocating for early childhood education and increasing the minimum wage. Now, it is time for you to step aside and let someone for whom the City of Albuquerque has not paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars in sexual harassment settlements take your place.\nIt\u2019s hard to speak up. I know. But sexual harassment thrives when women are silent. If we really want change\u2014and I believe we do\u2014we must stand together and speak up.\nThat\u2019s exactly what Michelle Lujan Grisham did. I appreciate her leadership. I agree with her. And I\u2019m ready to use my voice to break the silence and help her and other leaders bring real change to our state.\nBy Heather Brewer\nHeather Brewer is a New Mexico-based Democratic consultant.

You also have direct beach access, and the snorkeling is not bad as long as you go at the right time/tide (as the ocean visibility is poor at certain times due to the sandy beach). The venue is a little bit secluded, but I personally see this as a plus. There are two grocery stores within walking distance. Like all food in Nassau, the Marley's restaurant is not cheap, but it was a pretty good deal/value as far as taste and price (lobster salad was my favorite, but the crack conch and conch fritters are also great, but a little less healthy).

Use the novel \u201cIntimacy\u201d as a source.\r\n\r\nIntimacy by Hanif Kureishi is a voyage inside the mind of Jay, a man who has decided to leave his wife and children to pursue a lifestyle of sexual exploration and individual freedom. The plot of this novel lies not in whether Jay will desert his family, but in exploring and discovering the reasons behind his decision.\r\nIt is a widely accepted fact that there are two factors that should be present for a couple to decide on marriage: sexual compatibility and communication. If body and mind are in the same wavelength, then marital success is well on its way. Do people actually ask themselves if this is so when they are in a steady relationship? Probably not. Jay definitely did not. It was only after the fact that he decided to reflect upon this. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are other factors that come into play when marriage becomes a possibility, to a greater or lesser extent. Does the couple share the same interests? Do they both come from similar socioeconomic backgrounds? Do they have compatible life aspirations? Every couple is a world in itself, fiction or reality, hence the reason why we can only dream of putting together all the pieces of the puzzle.\r\n\r\nJay is a well-educated man with a career as a writer. Similarly, Susan is a successful woman that runs a family and keeps an important executive job. Insofar as their interests are concerned, they both enjoy a glass of wine with their meals, as well as a taste for music, literature and recreational drugs (even though everything seems to suggest that Susan views these pleasures as part of her youthful years rather than her present). Nonetheless, their marriage fails.\r\nIn conclusion, are all the above mentioned factors in fact vital to the success of a marriage? They were present, at some point or another, in Jay\u2019s marriage, yet he did not manage to make it a lifelong contract. I believe then that, in order to understand the importance of these things in a relationship, a change of focus is in order. Having things in common with your spouse does not guarantee marital success. It is the lack of these, in other words, it is the lack of intimacy that determines its failure.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanif kureishi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "susan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:52.045+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6a1bd60d90ac1a88067cb96a062eff3d8df4805b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_NqdZ3Fddu3tGep1nbQabhH9Ru7Hf.uFCg_MLfWJ3PofKwJY9n.h40as0oAWH6mos1M_6qStCIDYeXwp2ezryXLt_b5iRCh_z.PC0i_JpFoQ--", "site_full": "www.cityam.com", "site": "cityam.com", "site_section": "http://www.cityam.com/feeds/main.xml", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "City A.M.

I took the incident/disaster as an opportunity to do an S54 swap, which was a fantastic decision (despite hating it at first). It took a little less than 3 month of working on it in my spare time, but many very long nights.\nTo start, here is a photo by a local car enthusiast of my car at Road Atlanta the day it came apart on the front straight.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/zcZPIjY.jpg\nAnd one more by another friend:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/BDVAtJr.jpg\nLast session of Sunday is when I got VACed, 5 VAC titanium retainers failed (about 8 track days since a full build/blueprinted S52). One of the valves broke from hitting the piston and at 110mph and 7k rpm things did not stand a chance. Worst of all, the oil lit up on the exhaust and the car caught on fire and that made an industrial grade disaster. Wiring got burned, painted Mashaw hood got trashed, windshield got trashed as the fire guys threw the hood over it (small price to pay for not burning the car though), pretty much every plastic piece got messed up and everything got really tarnished.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/RWpybqD.jpg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/gMICp6S.jpg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/s9P4tew.jpg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/G2PbX4e.jpg\nFirst step of the swap, the engine harness had to be done. It was the most tedious wiring harness ever.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/fMy095k.jpg\nI decided to do a CSL conversion and mounted a GM MAP sensor by where the vacuum amplifier used to sit. One day I\u2019ll be baller and get a carbon plenum. That day is not today though.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/YwDnNcD.jpg\n3D printed an adapter for the Walbro 255, its made from Nylon.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xYdmE6l.jpg\nWhile making things I decided to redo my projector mounts a bit in the headlights. ****s Given = 0; and yes its also Daytona Violet.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/QPUZvhi.jpg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/IkAgZB4.jpg\nThis was my solution to mount the coolant temp sensor for the cluster:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/sxHH8kF.jpg\nThis is a quick and dirty way to adapt the E46 P/S pump to the E36 line:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/LnJogjF.jpg\nIn the future I\u2019ll use a 318 line as it has the correct fitting.\nFor the coolant reservoir I decided to go with a VW unit (I am an old time fan, had multiple Corrados and GTIs). I think it looks elegant, has a built in level sensor, mounts nicely, and $20 shipped to my door.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/56KHYNv.jpg\nNext was the cleaning, sanding, taping. I think this took over 20 hours to do. Good time to fix my cracked strut towers too. Just BMW things\u2026\nhttps://i.imgur.com/55Hb57L.jpg\nAnd all painted! This was my first ever paint work aside for rattle cans, I kind of enjoy doing it.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xpzSGZP.jpg\nI nearly had a heart attack multiple times while installing the engine and not hurting my snazzy paint job. Found a purple silicone reducer, it goes from very large to slightly smaller.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/s7kZpVM.jpg\nThe night I finished it all up:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/rJW1QqE.jpg\nDaytona Violett + on the jump post:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/cbNcPxD.jpg\nAll tidied up!\nhttps://i.imgur.com/gtfSWch.jpg\nHad to get the correct stickers too:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/JXoZhsw.jpg\nAnd that is a proper S54 emission decal. I hope I am the first to do so!\nhttps://i.imgur.com/a4JYcRu.jpg\nI know these pictures look like everything fell into place, but don\u2019t be confused. Things didn\u2019t work right away, things didn\u2019t fit right away, certain ways I designed bits did not go to plan. My car is a constant evolution as it is always being changed and improved. I learn with it and have learned a great deal building it and tracking it.\nBonus, got to work on this car which was pretty cool:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/BfBMsuN.jpg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xPFPlfu.jpg\nI will keep updating this thread to fill in all the prior work that I have done. If you guys and gals have any questions or would like details on how I did something, do ask and I will do my best to explain.\n-Pasha", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://i.imgur.com/IkAgZB4.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/LnJogjF.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/a4JYcRu.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/QPUZvhi.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/gMICp6S.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/s7kZpVM.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/xYdmE6l.jpg", "https://imgur.com/a/a90iY", "https://i.imgur.com/zcZPIjY.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/BDVAtJr.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/xPFPlfu.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/56KHYNv.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/cbNcPxD.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/fMy095k.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/55Hb57L.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/xpzSGZP.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/sxHH8kF.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/JXoZhsw.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/gtfSWch.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/RWpybqD.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/BfBMsuN.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/G2PbX4e.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/rJW1QqE.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/s9P4tew.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/YwDnNcD.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:53.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9b0ceb172327295065f82af25c8df6910c6a977d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQApyRnPnOVUtrgrNxjsuz4rAkxQfnkX7g-", "site_full": "vk.com", "site": "vk.com", "site_section": "https://vk.com/id438860478", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Lev Leynveber", "title": "Lev Leynveber", "title_full": "Lev Leynveber", "published": "2017-11-19T13:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "RU", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 21, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9b0ceb172327295065f82af25c8df6910c6a977d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQApyRnPnOVUtrgrNxjsuz4rAkxQfnkX7g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lev Leynveber", "published": "2017-11-19T13:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "Lev Leynveber", "text": "Lev Leynveber", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:53.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b80c6903440b0832b4f390d989f5a77a4134a87f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYJSqdF3XkZcLOjCKxCjetf_7uCty5eVl3I1jtVloBefAP.e4qk4b45WFbBLqjfZ9KV6yDTacaKjYaNtHoExccm0A6fxJUDmTfz9DilvrXc0ZAtnnqLD1HdAdd6e2wVnC1CpSkyDptLrC3n54AMVh8z38JOn7n7aWEH0Nbn73W560-", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.in", "site": "tripadvisor.in", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowForum-g293860-i511-o20-India.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "India Forum, Travel Discussion for India -

I'm supposed to be getting the same things you described but they said they're 80mg but will be less strong than US making them 40mg. Please let me know before I waste money. Thank you!!! Wed, Aug 12 '15, 12:38 PM Hi, just saw your post and another person's post, yours is way over a year old.. Hopefully you will get an update email from here.. My curiosity is peaked. Did you figure out what you received? I would have wrote or caked around to testing lab and had it tested but someone said you can buy kits to test for opiates in pills in stores? Wow. I did not know it was available in India? I was always told.. If it sounds too good to be true, it is. I would like to know the ending of your story. Wed, Sep 02 '15, 4:45 PM via mobile Hi Helena! Definitely NOT oxycodone :(... Lol, I actually did buy the kit from Walgreens & sent it to the lab. Nothing came up... I'm almost positive they were Tramadol & just added Tylenol or something to them to pass them off as something else. Since then I've found out that India DOES NOT MAKE OXYCODONE , or anything like it for that matter... Definitely a waste of $300, but lesson learned! Hopefully my foolishness helps other people before they get scammed. Thu, Jul 28 '16, 1:55 PM via mobile Sat, Jul 30 '16, 1:46 AM via mobile Hi Nhculber, definitely NOT,unfortunately. Read by post below. I ordered Tramadol through them too, and they couldn't even tell me which was which, lol. They felt like Trams to me, same effect, kept me \"at bay\", not sick. There's soooo many of these places online & not enough money in my pocket to burn =/. I tried another place & ordered the same thing. They sent me what appeared to be Vicodin , but we're a weird mixture of browns & light browns, even stamped them with the 10/350 imprint. Pretty crafty, eh? Nope, they made me feel weird as $h!t & not in a good way, pretty sick feeling & dizzy/hazy. I got those 2 years ago & still have 26 out of 30, haha, idk wtf is in them!

The larger carry-all makes me feel like I meant to carry a bag with flowers on it, you know what I mean?\nOpinions?\nView attachment 3898660 Click to expand... Thank you everyone! I decided to keep the smaller one. It actually is very roomy and fits everything I put in my regular Rogue except will need a smaller lipstick case. The one I'm using is actually more of a wristlet so I can definitely scale down. I think this bag will come out every now and then so I won't need the larger carry all size in this color.
