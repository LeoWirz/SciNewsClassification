Believe it or not, new research now poses severe risk to human health, finding an association between Climate Change and malaria. A question many of us ask is how global climatic changes can influence the spread of a disease. Here we explore this query, determining why areas around the globe, that are not currently transmitting malaria, will soon be at the centre of this epidemic. First of all, malaria is a non-infectious disease transmitted from an Anophales mosquito bite. This type of mosquito carries a Plasmodium parasite, which is harmful to the human body, causing a range of symptoms from high fever and vomiting to anemia. After a while, the parasite will target the liver and cause life threatening complications. Flickr | Wellunwell This disease is typically prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical climates such as those of Sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia. These climates are almost perfect for the Anophales mosquito to survive and subsequently transmit the disease from human to human. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), malaria is considered the most deadly tropical disease, infecting 212 million people per year in 109 countries throughout Africa, Asia and South America. How is Climate Change increasing malaria prevalence? A key concern is that malaria is majorly climate-sensitive. A slight change in climatic conditions and the Anopheles mosquitos will migrate into new areas, spreading malaria further. Changes in temperature, rainfall and humidity will cause proliferation of the disease, carrying mosquitos into the high-altitude tropics and infecting people in previously malaria-free regions. The implications of this are worrying, as people in malaria-free regions have not been exposed to the disease, consequently not naturally or economically protected against it. For the areas already battling malaria, the growth cycle of the parasite will be disrupted, where it will be developing at a faster rate, increasing the burden of disease. Flickr | Environmental Illness Network Rainfall Rainfall changes will be dramatic. High rainfall provides good breeding conditions for mosquitos. As soon as rain stops, the Anophales mosquitos start breeding as they favour fresh water collected after a rainy season. The incidence of malaria has already risen in South Africa and north-west India following unusual rainfall throughout the last couple of years. However, in areas where rainfall is expected to decrease, the opposite can occur and malaria transmission rates will be low. A lot of research considers future predictions of the malaria incidence. A journal published by the European Commission states that even a small increase in rainfall across the Horn of Africa will cause a marked increase of malaria, where it is likely to spread into highlands above 2000m, areas previously malaria-free. These changes are expected between 2020 and 2040 and calls for important future planning to combat the epidemic. Flickr | Rafa\u0142 Herszkowicz Temperature In terms of a warming climate, research in the rural Debre Zeit region on Ethiopia suggests the 37 million people who live in the area will be at a higher risk of malaria exposure. Even a 1 degree increase can result in doubling of malaria transmission! Although rural regions are currently prone to the exposure of malaria due to abundant water sources, we are already seeing a shift into highland regions. Malaria has \u2018climbed\u2019 mountains in Ethiopia and Colombia, to the extent that in warm years, cases of malaria moved into higher regions, whilst staying at lower elevations in cooler years. These mosquitos thrive in the warmth and really support the fact that malaria migrates as the planet warms, and is becoming dangerous to more people. Flickr | D. Brandsma Malaria\u2019s shifting distribution to new regions is definitely a cause for alarm. The lack of preventative measures and protective immunity in these populations makes the epidemic severe for morbidity and mortality rates. As the globe battles Climate Change, we will almost definitely see a change in prevalence in malaria. With knowledge of variables such as rainfall and temperature altering the incidence, preventative interventions need to mitigate the impacts.

The CatLight utility places a small icon on your status bar and employs different colors to signal that a build is currently being created, that it has been partially built, or that its is broken and needs your attention. Connect to various collaborative software development servers with ease Right off the bat, within the CatLight main window, you must select the servers you want to connect to and provide the necessary configuration details. The utility is able to connect you your AppVeyor account with the help of the web API token, or to your Jenkins server if you provide the server's URL and your credentials. If you want to connect to Team Foundation or Visual Studio Team servers, just input the collection URL, and CatLight can automatically detect the correct settings Browse your projects collections and choose the ones for which you want to see build status notifications Once a connection is established, CatLight can detect all the projects available on the server and offers you the possibility to choose which ones you want to monitor. Note that all unselected projects, including the newly created ones, will be ignored. To add new projects to the watched list, you must go back to the Setting panel via the CatLight Dashboard. Even though the project build status can be tracked via the CatLight status bar icon, in the app\u2019s Dashboard window you get to see the state of all followed projects together with details about the last build attempt, who broke the latest build and when, and so on. View the build status for your projects in the status bar and know instantly when a project requires your attention To sum up, CatLight is a simple OS X application that enables you to keep track of the build status for various projects hosted on AppVeyor, or on Jenkins, Team Foundation, and Visual Studio Team servers. The CatLight utility is quite easy to configure, updates the build status periodically, and comes with a simple system that enables you to continue your work while the project is building, but know immediately if your attention is needed.

By keeping just click the next webpage that are listed below in mind, you will soon find out how to find the most affordable auto insurance plans with good coverage for your vehicle.\nTo save just click the following web page on your car insurance, choose a car make and model that does not require a high insurance cost. For example, safe cars like a Honda Accord are much cheaper to insure than sports cars such as a Mustang convertible. While owning a convertible may seem more desirable at first, a Honda will cost you less.\nWhen considering auto insurance for a young driver, be sure to check with multiple insurance agencies to not only compare rates, but also any perks that they might include. It also cannot hurt to shop around once a year to see if any new perks or discounts have opened up with other companies. If you do find a better deal, let your current provider know about it to see if they will match.\nIf you have developed a history of trouble-free driving over the course of several years, inquire with your car insurance company about a no-claim discount. hop over to these guys offer these discounts for reliable customers they have not had to pay-out for. Some companies apply no-claim discounts automatically; with others the driver must inquire. It never hurts to ask!\nAs long as your auto insurance is in accordance with state law, you should not have to purchase a more comprehensive package. This is a great way to save money. If you are a safe driver in a relatively safe area, you can drop certain features like collision coverage and end up saving a bundle of money.\nMove to a rural area. The closer you are to the city, the higher your premiums will be. Accidents, break-ins, and vandalism all increase inside city limits, so premiums have to be higher to cover the damages. The farther away from the city you go, the lower your premiums get.\n\nYoung drivers can save money on their car insurance if they register an older driver as a part-time user of their car. There is no group of drivers subjected to higher insurance premiums than teenagers. However, insurers will be encouraged to see an older, more responsible driver sharing the driving duties with a teenager. They will reduce premiums accordingly in such a situation.\nTake a driving class or a superior driving lesson. This will show your insurance company you are interested in safe driving or preventing accidents and lower your rates even more. Your insurance company wants to have safe drivers and will reward you for your attempt to show them you are a good driver.\nDrive safely and observe the rules of the road to lower your car insurance rates. If you avoid accidents and tickets, you may qualify for a discount as a safe driver. Of course, being a safe driver will save you money all around in terms of ticket expenses and wasted gas, as well as getting you the lowest insurance rates.\nIf you are thinking about purchasing a new vehicle, you should look for a large vehicle. If you buy a van or a truck, chances are damages will not be too bad if you get into an accident. Most insurance companies know this, and offer relatively low rates for these types of vehicles.\nWhen you get older, you will want to have your vision checked regularly. Some states have made mandatory eye testing a requirement for a senior license. This will keep you and the others around you a bit safer; even if your state does not require the test, be safe and have it done on your own.\nIt should really go without saying, but you should never leave an accident unreported to your insurance company. If another victim in the accident makes an insurance claim or a police report is filed, the chances that your insurance company will catch wind of it rise exponentially. While an accident you report might raise your premiums, an unreported one definitely will \u2013 and by much more.\nThose who do not drive a lot, or who drive short distances, can sometimes get low mileage discounts on their policy. Normally, you will have to stay under 7,500 miles in a calendar year to get a price break. You may also qualify for a commuter rebate by taking public transit to work instead of driving.\nPart of the cost of your auto insurance is based on where you live. In particular, people who live in urban areas, generally pay a significant amount more for their auto insurance than people who live in rural areas. If you live and work in a city, you might want to consider trying to find a place in a rural area, from where you can feasibly commute to work.\nWhen you\u2019re looking at auto insurance, whether it\u2019s to buy a new policy or to renew an existing one, be aware of what your state\u2019s minimum requirements are. Most states require a certain level of liability coverage, so it\u2019s important to ensure that your policy does not fall short of these standards.\nIf you want to get affordable rates on auto insurance one of the best things that you can do is to buy insurance from the internet. This is because most companies offer reduced rates for online applications because the process is automated. You can get reductions that range from 5 to 10 percent.\nWith the information you just learned you should already have a better idea of the type of auto insurance coverage you want to get for yourself. This information is only but a portion of all there is to know about the type of coverage you might want to get. Be on the lookout for more information and when you feel confident get the coverage that suits you the best.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "honda", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:12:46.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a127ce8e5bcc9d595724dc5f2500883582116b85", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9lYheV1JyURrAdyM.2V3rVORW4pn6LXjWvTChP1.Iq7UoIfF9OEICH", "site_full": "www.boards.ie", "site": "boards.ie", "site_section": "http://www.boards.ie/b/forum/845", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Farming &amp; Forestry - boards.ie", "title": "Feed bin price", "title_full": "Feed bin price - boards.ie", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//static.boards.ie/www/i/boards.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9111, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0fdfee11ed4c6756619fe2f7a232d378e57da558", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9lYheV1JyURrAdyM.2V3rVORW4pn6LXjWvTChP1.Iq7ctxRNgmGVPxqXjIlu2QrgI-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "jntsnk said: Got a Quote: of \u20ac2600 incl VAT for a 5 ton bin.\nOutlet pipe is 6 ft long with 8\" width.

Every paper or magazine you read will also have the same thing. Auto insurance is important for every driver, and this article will help you out by giving you the best tips you can find.\nThe year and options on your vehicle will play a large roll in how much your insurance premium is. Having a newer car with lots of safety features can save you some, but if you have it financed you will also have to pay more for full coverage.\nWhen you are looking into car insurance you need to think about things like what kind of vehicle that you have. If you like the small, sporty cars your premium is going to be higher than if you had something like a truck. That\u2019s because prices are based somewhat on what you paid for the vehicle but also how much it would cost to repair the vehicle. They even look at if it\u2019s the type of vehicle that gets stolen a lot.\nOne, less well-known way to get further discounts on auto insurance, especially if you have a teen driver around who is only going back and forth to school, is to request whether your insurance offers a discount for low mileage. If you can accurately estimate the actual mileage your teen drives and report it accurately, you will pay less.\nSaving money on auto insurance does not have to be a difficult thing, especially if you are loyal to the same company. Most policies are only for a term of around a year, so make sure you re-up with the same company. If you show loyalty to the insurer, you will be rewarded with lower monthly premium payments.\nCarpooling or taking public transit can save you money on your auto insurance. Insurance companies like when their policy holders show responsibility, keeping your mileage low is something they really appreciate. Try to use public transport more often, and you may be eligible for a discount.\nThere are http://business.borgernewsherald.com/borgernewsherald/news/read/35356354 of factors that determine the cost of your automobile insurance. Your age, sex, marital status and location all play a factor. While you can\u2019t change most of those, and few people would move or get married to save money on car insurance, you can control the type of car you drive, which also plays a role. Choose cars with lots of safety options and anti theft systems in place.\nIf you are looking to get auto insurance, do not commit to any company until you have gotten multiple quotes. You can do this online without having to speak with an insurance agent or sales representative. By getting multiple quotes you are reducing the chances of auto insurance companies cheating you.\nOne of the absolute greatest factors in the price of your auto insurance remains, unfortunately, completely outside of your control, this is your age. The majority of companies consider people under 25 to be a higher risk and due to this you will end up paying more. Remember, especially when you are younger, to check constantly with your agency for discounts based on age year by year.\nCheck the costs to insure cars before you relocate. Annual insurance in New York is about $2,800, as compared to the national average for 2011, of $1,446 per year. Different states and different cities will cost you more or less for auto insurance, but remember to also check the prospective state\u2019s minimum insurance requirements.\nAlways consider the costs of insurance before purchasing a car. Keep in mind that cars with better safety features get lower premiums. Many sports cars are not favored by insurance companies. Remember to include this expense when buying a new car.\nOne way you can save money on your auto insurance premiums is to pay the full annual cost up front. Many insurance companies charge an extra fee for people who pay monthly premiums. Talk to your insurer to see how much you could save by switching to an annual payment.\nYou can save money on car insurance if your car is an older car, a sedate car (like a 4-door-sedan or hatchback) or has lots of miles on it. When this is the case, you can simply buy liability insurance to satisfy the requirements of your state and not bother with comprehensive insurance.\nIf you are going to be late on an auto insurance payment, call your agent. Your agent should be able to help you get an extension, or reschedule a payment, so that your credit rating does not go down. If auto insurance usaa miss payments and lose coverage, you could be at a higher rate for a year or more.\nBe sure to contact many different insurance providers for quotes. Have them explain the exact coverage that you will get for the price, this way you will be able to compare apples to apples. By comparing prices like this you can save yourself quite a bit of money, because different companies have different rating systems and they can offer surprisingly varying prices.\nIf you have just gotten married or if your spouse has auto insurance from a different company, consider combining your policies into one. Most insurers will give significant discounts on each additional vehicle in a household. You\u2019ll also save yourself some hassle by not having to deal with multiple insurance companies.\nMake sure you know what kind of coverage you have in your policy. Be aware of what your auto insurance is actually insuring. Many things affect the final cost of the policy. There is bodily injury liability, property damage liability, medical payments, uninsured motorist protection, collision coverage, and comprehensive coverage.\nBeing http://markets.financialcontent.com/wral/news/read/35356354/Signature_Insurance_Offers_New_Auto_Insurance_Packages to rely on your insurance after an accident is wonderful. It alleviates stress at a time when you really need to be able to relax. The advice in this article will be a great help in your search for auto insurance.

Currently I have a single state machine that handles the locomotion for Cover Stand, Cover Crouch, Surrender, Rifle Stand, Rifle Crouch, Rifle Prone, Crouch, and Stand animations.\nI'm about to start adding some more states (scared, and pistol locomotion animations). Here are my questions. My single state machine is starting to become too cumbersome. Is it better practice and/or better performance to use multiple state machines rather than a single large state machine? How should I split up the animations into state machines? I'm thinking just having Rifle, Pistol, Scared, Cover, No Weapon, and Surrender as all different states. How should I handle transitioning between the states? Blend by int or enum?

As a result, we have a higher rate of unintended pregnancy. We know that when women can plan their pregnancies the health outcomes are better for them and their families. That is why the continued funding for the effective Colorado program providing low-income women with access to long acting, effective methods of contraception is so important.\nLatinas are more likely to live in areas with poor access to family planning services. We are less likely to have health insurance or the financial resources to be able to afford to access contraception or see a reproductive health professional. There are also specific and significant limitations to the ability of immigrant Latinos to access health information and services.\nBy ensuring that care is both available and affordable, we are able to support women in Colorado. The Colorado Family Planning Initiative provides comprehensive contraceptive services, including hormonal implants and IUDs for those who may not be able to access them otherwise and helps to expand clinic hours and availability of care.\nWe need to support people in being able to become parents when they are ready, to ensure access to the reproductive health care that people need, and to support the health of women and families in our state.\nThe number of young women facing unintended pregnancy fell 48 percent from 2009 to 2014. It is difficult to deal with an unplanned pregnancy at any age, but with the stigma and lack of support that many young parents face, it is that much harder for teens.\nFrom 2009 through 2016, the program provided 43,713 no- or low-cost IUDs or implants to women at 75 family planning clinics across Colorado. Between 40,000 and 50,000 women annually have received benefits through this program with clear improvements in public health. The ability to plan our families is an issue of reproductive health, but it is also one of financial stability.\nWe have worked hard to support continued funding, but we need to make sure that we do not advocate for contraception for young people in a way that judges or demonizes young parents. Young parents are not incapable. They are not more likely to hurt their children and poverty does not just happen to them. They are more likely to face huge obstacles to completing their education and getting the support and services they need to care for themselves and their children. They are more likely to struggle to find affordable childcare or to find a position that pays a living wage and provide workplace protections to help them juggle the needs of their job and their family thereby increasing the likelihood that they are stuck in a cycle of poverty. This does not just happen.\nWe should continue effective programs like the Colorado Family Planning Initiative that help to close gaps in access to healthcare while also working to break down systems of oppression that make it harder for young people when they face unintended pregnancy and challenge rhetoric about young people and young parents.\nWe need to support people in being able to become parents when they are ready, to ensure access to the reproductive health care that people need, and to support the health of women and families in our state. Continued funding for this program is an important step.\nBy Karla Gonzales Garc\u00eda\nKarla Gonzales Garc\u00eda is the Program and Policy Director for the Colorado Organization for Latina Opportunity and Reproductive Rights (COLOR).\nRead More Commentary: www.elsemanario.us", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "karla gonzales garc\u00eda karla gonzales garc\u00eda", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "colorado organization for latina opportunity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado family planning initiative", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:12:49.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "940fca21b7c26affa9e8de476e789a24ac7610da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7AP5IGPYQw38ACQwzfGyr4-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "940fca21b7c26affa9e8de476e789a24ac7610da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7AP5IGPYQw38ACQwzfGyr4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aternius", "published": "2017-12-07T11:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "with open(\"C:/Users/Aternius/Desktop/quotes.txt\", encoding='utf-8') as file:\r\n    text = file.read()\r\nlines = text.replace ('\\uffef', '')\r\nstroki = lines.splitlines()\r\nfirst_word = stroki(' ', 1)[0]\r\nf = len(first_word)\r\nfor x in lines:\r\n        len_lines += 1\r\n        dlina = len(x.split())\r\n        \r\n        if dlina <= 10 :\r\n            if f < 5 :\r\n                print (lines)\r\n\r\n        #\u0435\u0431\u0430\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0435\u0446", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:12:49.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "91c31ab409802106027ad000853f20885681ba84", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_yLlSe5Zl3DbbR4yeBsD2Uv", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/x/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/x/ -

But the fact thats appeared since X3 absolutely reproducible in each version (okay, i can only talk about X3, X4 and 2018) and no other from germany or with regard to the other guy who has the same problem with the netherlands localization, i'm very surprised thats such an major problem was never discovered/criticised in nearly 8 years since X3 was released. I could imagine thats the root cause lies in the tabbed workspace switching introduced with X3. As i learned now, PSP does hide just these menu items when switching to the simple workspace. Could be possible thats here is an bug in relation with some windows-specific settings and when these present, PSP does faulty hide the customization menu items.Currently i'm annoyed that not reported the problem 8 years ago. I thinked really it was willfully dismantled by Corel. It was fashionable at the time, thats software would be simplified (refer to Win 8 which was came w/o an start menu and so on). That's why it looked logical the customize options wasn't present. LeviFiction wrote: Your best bet is to go talk to Corel directly. But in the meantime lets get some information down shall we?

I didn't want to walk a marathon trough dozens of callcenter people and repeat my story a dozen times.EDIT: And before i'm forget it: I tried the workspace restoration with holding SHIFT some times. A few of them PSP hungs while splash screen tells \"Cache-Einstellungen werden aktualisiert\" (refer to Deepl translate \"Cache settings are updated\") for minutes. On a Kaby Lake 7700K, 16 Gigs RAM and an Intel M.2 PCIe SSD !!FURTHER EDIT: It seems there is more than one problem. When i try to change the toolbar icon size from small to large, hungs also for a couple of seconds and the task manager tells that PSP consumes 100% of one CPU core. And more peculiarities: When im go to File > Settings \"Speicherorte\" (\"Save places\" in english?) so i see TWO pathes for the workplace storing. The upper one links to a net share defined by a GPO: Code: Select all \\\\ourdomain.int\\some\\path\\UserData\\My Username\\Eigene Dateien\\Corel PaintShop Pro\\2018\\Arbeitsbereiche This path is valid when i copied and pasted it into file explorer. I can found a Test.PspWorkspace file here, which i had created during my experiments yesterday.The second path refers to the local programs folder: Code: Select all C:\\Program Files\\Corel\\PaintShop Pro 2018\\Corel\\Corel PaintShop Pro 2018 (64-bit)\\Languages\\DE\\Arbeitsbereiche This path seems to be INVALID. The most right part of this path, the \"Arbeitsbereiche\" folder does not exist.

has risen steadily over the past two decades, barring small setbacks during the financial crisis which have now been left well behind.\n\nTotal land value has recovered from a fall of almost \u00a31tn recorded in 2008 amid a crash in house prices during the credit crunch, recovering to its pre-crisis peak in 2014 and rising by \u00a3280bn over the course of 2016 to stand at \u00a35tn at the end of last year.\n\nAccording to a 2010 report for Country Life , a third of Britain\u2019s land still belongs to the aristocracy, while some of the oldest families in the country have held onto their land for several centuries . Some of the most famous noble landowners include the Duke of Westminster, who owns large chunks of Mayfair and Belgravia in London. The Queen\u2019s Crown Estate owns most of Regent Street and swaths of St James\u2019s , as well as thousands of acres of farmland, forests and coastline. There are also vast tracts of land owned by the government, including areas controlled by the Forestry commission, which is thought to be the country\u2019s biggest land manager, with about 900,000 hectares.\n\nThe ONS analysis measures the total net worth of the country by estimating the market value of financial assets, such as loans, and non-financial assets, such as land and dwellings. The figures show households and non-profit institutions such as churches, trade unions and social and cultural organisations account for the vast majority of the nation\u2019s wealth.\n\nThe \u00a3803bn increase in UK net worth from 2015 to 2016 is the largest annual rise on record\n\nThe statisticians estimate the net worth attributable to central government stood at negative \u00a31.2tn as a consequence of borrowing to fund the budget deficit.\n\nThe former Labour prime minister said the new tax \u2013 which would be a levy on underlying land rather than property on it \u2013 should replace council tax and business rates to create a \u201cfairer and more rational system of property taxation\u201d.The stark illustration of the gains made by land owners come days after Tony Blair endorsed the idea of a new \u201cland value tax\u201d put forward in Labour\u2019s last manifesto to help solve the country\u2019s housing crisis. \n\nBlair said the new tax, which sees the value of underlying land taxed rather than property, should replace council tax and business rates to create a \u201cfairer and more rational system of property taxation\u201d.\n\nPhilip Hammond placed a stamp duty cut for first time buyers and more money for housebuilding at the heart of the budget last month , pledging to boost the number of new homes built to 300,000 a year on average by the mid-2020s \u2013 up from 217,000 last year \u2013 in the \u201cbiggest annual increase in housing supply since 1970\u201d.\n\nThe chancellor also said he would do more to tackle land banking \u2013 where housing developers sit on land waiting for its value to increase before selling properties for higher prices \u2013 with a promise to reform planning rules. Conservative grandee Oliver Letwin, who was David Cameron\u2019s head of policy, will also review the gap between planning permissions and housing starts on behalf of the government.\n\nLetwin\u2019s panel will provide an interim report in time for the Spring statement next year, which Hammond could use as grounding to intervene in the market should it find land being withheld for commercial reasons, rather than technical ones. \n\nThere are as many as 270,000 residential planning permissions unbuilt in London alone. Hammond has said that options open to the government could include compulsory purchase powers. https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/05/landowners-reap-benefits-of-soaring-british-land-prices?utm_term=Autofeed&CMP=twt_b-gdnnews#link_time=1512513172 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david cameron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oliver letwin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hammond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mayfair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "letwin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony blair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philip hammond", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "duke of westminster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "office for national statistics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belgravia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:12:50.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a7a42662c4a45e8e6c978801b1e54f9532c8c4fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWW42ULL2PYTa1FpIdCDWXZhRAgCsooktboDhMEKZb_3VUXKh7YJV.9.RxlW_QVywuNCRysvNxrQI0YGCLacYlE9zYmTEEoG.KIZzr97rijnX38XjkpcRTrE2zinH2bYDFIXGZc0c_ks73hmalMiWLz4BjiCLE5JwsN985Ura580I-", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-men-bags/?spm=a2o4k.category-090200000000.0.0.oQh0l7u0026itemperpage=120", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Men Bags -
