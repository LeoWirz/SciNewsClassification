Here we provide the list of important tips which helps you to prepare for the last month before the GATE Exam. GATE Exam is a gateway for many opportunities in career after the under graduation. GATE Score is useful for taking admission in premier institutes (IITs, NITs, and other institutes) in India. You can also apply for getting a job in more than 30 PSUs (IOCL, ONGC, BHEL, HAL, GAIL, NTPC, etc.). GATE Exam preparation depends on your time management, dedication, understanding concepts, memorizing with regular practice, and hard work. 1. GATE 2018 Syllabus Checklist: What is important at this stage is to check how much of the syllabus for GATE has been completed. An ideal situation would be most of it but that is not always the case. Candidates taking coaching would have gone with the flow as taught in their coaching centers and candidates preparing on their own by their schedules. Whatever be the case, the litmus test is that at least the major portion of the syllabus must have been completed. Strong topics made stronger and weak topics less weaker. 2. Study Hours for GATE 2018 : This is a common question asked by many candidates in many forums. The question is seemingly deceptive. How does someone else judge what is the right amount of hours that a candidate needs to devote for GATE? It is what we believe is a person-centric issue to be decided by the candidates themselves. All candidates who are serious about their GATE chances will have planned, worked and honed up their study strategy. However when one looks at the topper efforts, expert opinion etc, it is to be realized that a minimum of 8 to 10 hours need to be put into the GATE efforts. This is easy to say and hard to implement especially for the final year students who have to study for their graduation and the working aspirants as well who have to juggle their office commitments with their study. Not easy at all but doable and achievable considering that many have done it before. What is the Ideal GATE Preparation Strategy for the last month? Once you ascertain that the basic concepts are in place, you hone them further. To do that, you must adapt the Practice- Analyse-Revise strategy which is exactly as it says; attempt a question paper, analyze your weak points and finally revise the same to get the concepts and subject right. This is a sure mantra that works well with if followed properly and diligently. Click here to check and practice with the GATE 2018 Sample papers to improve your speed in the exam and also hone your time management skills for the exam day Familiarity with the GATE 2018 Exam Pattern : Understanding the exam pattern for GATE is just now enough. It is vital to get to understand how it works because the exam day strategy can be properly planned then. GATE Mock Tests : IIT Roorkee has announced the mock tests for all the 23 papers except for the new GATE paper- Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences. Candidates must attempt the Mock test at least once to get familiar with the exam system. The mock test is a simulation of the actual exam with the incorporation of the virtual calculator, timer. With GATE 2018 Mock test, IIT Roorkee has incorporated the complete test with all the questions as they will come in the actual GATE exam. Candidates would be advised to practice at least once. GATE Virtual Calculator : The online calculator is a facility for calculations. It has been noticed that candidates are not comfortable with the calculator due to varied reasons. The general preference and consensus is that it should be used for large simple calculations and not for those that can be worked out. Candidates are advised therefore to acclimatize themselves to the workings of the GATE 2018 Virtual Calculator. Special Mantras for GATE: The General Aptitude and Engineering Mathematics consist of 30 marks and this means that it is a substantial number of marks These are sections that can be strengthened with practice and not so much effort. Candidates must therefore not leave these sections absolutely to the last days. Instead, they must prepare for these sections from the start and hone them properly. Some books to refer for these sections are:\n   a. Quantitative Aptitude by R.S Agrawal\n   b.Higher Engineering Mathematics by B.S. Grewal GATE Exam Day Strategy While preparing, candidates must chalk out a strategy for the actual GATE exam. This will be clear when aspirants practise with the sample papers or mock tests. It is best to answer what is known for sure. Answers that require a bit of time to answer can be marked for review and answered once all the sure answers are submitted Answers not known and carrying negative marks should be avoided at all costs. The greatest wealth is health  \u2013 a maxim that holds true under any circumstance. Candidates who keep good health will have no worries on that front before and during the day of the exam. Some small tips that can help are: Take small breaks between bouts of studying Listen to music, take a walk or do such activities that help you relax. Eat healthy food and avoid junk food for this last month. Keep in mind that this is just an exam and you are attempting to qualify in it. It is certainly not a matter of life or death. Do your best! What should you avoid during the last month GATE Preparation? Don\u2019t start with new topics that are tough for you to learn. There will be no time to study them leave alone perfect them. The time can instead be utilized in strengthening your existing subject knowledge. Build your strengths and focus more on them Don\u2019t take to your friends about the preparation levels reached and compare. It won\u2019t help in anyway other than eroding your confidence.

Along with the development, Alibaba and local authorities have improved roads, broadband internet services, power supply and logistics to support farmers in setting up their online stores.

Let\u2019s begin!\nNew York at Christmas while it\u2019s snowing, I would love to see all the huge store window displays and see the large Christmas Tree at the Rockefeller Centre. Lapland in Finland. Where according to there website is 190,000 reindeer, 749 fells and 1 Santa Claus, I mean how friggin\u2019 festive is that and the northern lights. Make and build a gingerbread house with Mia and Robyn. Drive around Cornwall at night and look at all the Christmas lights. Ice skating in the Snow (I suppose I could do this anywhere in the world that snowed) Go to Germany and visit the Erfurt Christmas Market, google it. It\u2019s magical! Go to London\u2019s Winter Wonderland with Nick, Mia and Robyn. Have a Christmas movie marathon from the 21st of December to the 24th of December. Go to Disney World! I mean what could be more perfect, Disney + Christmas = Pure Magic. Lend a helping hand to someone who needs a little help. Give some cuddly toys to your local hospital for the children who are having to spend Christmas in hospital. That last one guys is something Nick and I have done now for the second year. A group of bikers come together and take up a large amount of donated teddy bears to the children having to spend their Christmas in hospital. \nDo you have anything on your Christmas bucket list, you\u2019d love to do?

She is 42 as the series starts, and lives with her husband and younger daughter in Wareham. Her elder daughter is studying in London. Sophie has a law degree and a master\u2019s in criminal psychology. Her brilliant mind conceals some dark secrets from her past.\n\nDS Barry Marsh is based at Swanage police station.

I live in the west-country counties of Wiltshire and Dorset, and set my novels in this area. The early novels in the Sophie Allen series are based on the Isle of Purbeck, that most beautiful of coastal areas. But the rest of the county of Dorset does get a look in.\n\nI'm a retired teacher who has tinkered with writing for much of my life. My previous efforts have usually been directed towards short stories but I have always felt that crime novels would be one of my final choices, particularly if a developing storyline allows me to introduce one or two social issues, albeit with a light touch.\n\nI write because I constantly create scenes, people, imaginary conversations and unusual situations in my head. I have always done so, ever since I was a child. Using the richness of the English language to set down these creations in words is a great joy.\n\nhttp://www.michaelhambling.co.uk/ \n\n\n\nPUBLICATION DATE : 28 November 2017\n\nPUBLISHER : Joffe Books\n\nGENRE : Mystery,Crime Thriller\n\nPURCHASE HERE \n\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/CRIMES-gripping-crime-thriller-twists-ebook/dp/B077TFQLZP/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1512640234&sr=1-1&keywords=evil+crimes ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael hambling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sophie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sophie allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rose simons", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "dorset", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:15.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "34329569a918aa2fe28356e3ebc2c5ed219eafa7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9k72.YxEPp6L7PEdG0tZI9SFLAsF26W9WZAEW1jlNGpuTS7xE8FK5ZMRtS_vqC__Jtsl5b8Ige7GuT2ETeDmrBuZcrBoC0Vmk-", "site_full": "worldwidejops.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://worldwidejops.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "WORLD WIDE JOPS", "title": "Google Alert - Canadians Jobs", "title_full": "Google Alert - Canadians Jobs", "published": "2017-12-07T12:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "34329569a918aa2fe28356e3ebc2c5ed219eafa7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9k72.YxEPp6L7PEdG0tZI9SFLAsF26W9WZAEW1jlNGpuTS7xE8FK5ZMRtS_vqC__Jtsl5b8Ige7GuT2ETeDmrBuZcrBoC0Vmk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jop Online (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "Google Alert - Canadians Jobs", "text": "Canadians Jobs Daily update \u22c5 December 7, 2017 NEWS Making digital technologies more accessible to Canadians with disabilities Markets Insider OTTAWA, Dec. 6, 2017 /CNW/ - As a result of a new $22.3-million program, more Canadians with disabilities will have access to the digital tools they need to fully participate in society and get access to the well-paying jobs of today and tomorrow.

Exaggerations that may mislead consumers are not allowed. \n\"Currently there is no medicine that can effectively prevent or cure cataract,\" Cui Hongping, director of ophthalmology of the East Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Tongji University, told thepaper.cn. He said all eye drops and oral medicine available in the market, including Shapuaisi, are not effective to treat cataract. \nCui is one of the domestic experts that first questioned the effectiveness of Shapuaisi. In 2013 he published an article on social media criticizing the exaggeration and misguidance of Shapuaisi. \n\"Some cataract patients I know have kept using Shapuaisi for about two or three years, and their crystalline lenses are getting worse, from slightly opacious, to medium, and to serious.

It does not begin and end with elections. It practically involves the act of working hard to perfect deeper knowledge and understanding of the local context. \nThis democratic practice implies making governance a collective enterprise. In other words,it makes the ordinary citizens in the local communities indispensable stakeholders in the day-to-day running of the government. This makes government sensitive to the wishes and aspirations of the people.  Modern civilization has witnessed a global shift towards the democratic practice which makes room for the inception of majority inclusion in the affairs of the state. In this day and age, whereby human thinking and activities are controlled by the sweeping influence of the information super highway, there is no hiding place for practices that emanate from autocratic intents. \nThe digital culture has made people increasingly conscious of their inalienable fundamental democratic rights. These do not only involve the rights to vote and be voted for. They include the right to participate and contribute meaningfully to the nitty-gritty operations and activities of the government. \nThese untouchable rights of the citizens also include the rights to ask pertinent questions, demand for answers and effectively promote values that would pave way for the emergence and prevalence of good governance. This provides no room for politics of exclusion and intimidation. \n We are now in a new dawn. And this new dawn marks the triumph of freedom over tyranny. This is an era defined by equality and fairness over abuse of power and aristocratic privileges. After all, \u201cpower corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely,\u201dthey say. This depictsthe great danger associated with any civil culture that allows the prevalence of politics of god-fatherism which has hitherto become the bane of the Nigerian democratic practice. \n In every journey of discovery, the critical point of departure is from where the rain starts beating us. Nigeria has suffocated! The sustenance of Nigeria\u2019s fledgling democracy is the responsibility of all of us.This is the most vital challenge on our pathway to greatness. It is the most compelling task for all Nigerians to address if, and only if, our vision to build and sustain a virile society where political, economic, environmental, religious, social and cultural justices would prevail is anything to go by. \n In the face of the forgoing stance, it is arguable that there must be something shocking, if not paralyzing, about the strange notion still holding sway at some quarters that certain individuals has what it takes to single-handedly impose a candidate on a particular political party. What in the world has become of the traditional democratic tenet that \u201cdemocratic power belongs to the people?\u201d \n I, therefore, enjoin all Nigerians, particularly the good people of Rivers State, to march together and face out the obnoxious civil culture of politics of ordination and leadership by imposition. And internal democracy within the respective political parties is the take-off point. \nThe tenet of modern civilization reveals thatpolitics of imposition or leadership by ordination are as dangerous as leadership by an organized mob.  It threatens progress and democratic advancement. And this obnoxious virus must be expunged from our fledging democratic system. \nMass participation is very key to a workable and result-oriented democracy.Collective participation in democracy helps to spread the responsibilities of nation-building.And it must be reiterated that the take-off point for democratic advancement is internal democracy within the political parties. This is the true panacea for peace and progress. The time for the indispensable change isnow. We must banish the mockery of democracy. And now is the time for the singing of the birds. Dr. Terry M.

(AP Photo/Alex Gallardo) comments ANAHEIM, Calif. \u2014 Until the Anaheim Ducks get back to full strength, they're counting on Adam Henrique to play a major role for his injury-plagued new team.\nHenrique has been quite capable of shouldering that burden so far, and now he finally has a victory and a goal or two to show for his efforts.\nHenrique scored his first two goals for the Ducks in his home debut, and Ryan Miller made 29 saves for his first shutout for Anaheim in a 3-0 victory over the slumping Ottawa Senators on Wednesday night.\nOndrej Kase also scored, and Henrique added an empty-netter to his second-period opening goal in the Ducks' first victory since they acquired Henrique in a trade with New Jersey a week ago. The veteran has a point in all four games for his new team while centering the top line for the Ducks, who have played most of the season without centers Ryan Getzlaf and Ryan Kesler while dealing with major injuries for several supporting players.\n\"I didn't even realize how many guys were injured,\" Henrique said. \"But that's certainly an exciting part of it, to think about what we can do when we're healthy.\"\nHenrique has five points in four games for the Ducks, who gave a fundamentally sound effort to open a three-game homestand one night after ending a six-game trip with a shootout loss at Vegas.\nHenrique thought he had scored his first goal for Anaheim last Saturday at Nashville, but a scoring change two days later took it away.\nNo scorekeeper could deny Henrique when he beat Craig Anderson with a sharp one-timer after Rickard Rakell put the puck in the slot.\n\"It's actually been a pretty good transition,\" said Henrique, who has combined with right wing Corey Perry for nine points in their four games together. \"The guys have been great on and off the ice, talking to me a lot. As far as the systems, I felt pretty good jumping in and playing right away. It's been great so far.\"\nKase got his career-best sixth goal during the second period on an exceptional move in front. With Henrique and Kase filling the Sens' net while Miller kept his net empty, the Ducks snapped their three-game losing streak.\nMiller, the 37-year-old veteran signed by Anaheim last summer, posted his 40th career shutout with a confident performance. Although he hasn't played regularly behind John Gibson, Miller remained unbeaten in regulation for his new team (3-0-4).\nThe Ducks played without key injured regulars Hampus Lindholm and Jakob Silfverberg, depleting the already shaky depth on a roster that leads the NHL in man-games lost to injury.\n\"We've got a few more guys to go, but the guys who are playing are pulling their weight and doing their job,\" Miller said. \"It's good for our depth as we grind through the year.\"\nAnderson stopped 19 shots in the Senators' ninth loss in 10 games. They've scored more than two goals in just one game during this skid, and they've been shut out in back-to-back games.\n\"You never know exactly what is causing it and what is going on,\" captain Erik Karlsson said. \"When things are not going your way, you try and look for answers that are not there. You try and get out of your comfort zone and do different things, but at the end of the day, you need to do the things you are good at, and I think that we are starting to get to that.\"\nOttawa's scoreless streak reached 138 minutes, 22 seconds.\n\"This is a tough one,\" forward Zack Smith said. \"For the most part, the work ethic was there. Offense was hard to come by. We believe in this group here. We've showed all through last year and the playoffs that we can score. Sometimes you're guilty of overthinking.\"\nNOTES: Both teams wore helmet decals in honor of Bryan Murray, the former coach and general manager for both franchises. Murray died of colorectal cancer in August. ... Miller is the fourth American-born goalie to post 40 NHL shutouts. ... Ottawa D Fredrik Claesson was a healthy scratch, missing only his second game of the season. The Sens dressed D Ben Harpur instead.\nUP NEXT\nSenators: Up the I-5 freeway to face the Los Angeles Kings on Thursday night.\nDucks: Host former coach Bruce Boudreau and the Minnesota Wild on Friday night.\n___\nMore AP NHL: www.apnews.com/tags/NHLhockey", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://embed.sendtonews.com/player3/embedcode.js?fk=KG5SCeOG&cid=4407&offsetx=0&offsety=0&floatwidth=400&floatposition=bottom-right"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "miller", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "henrique", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rickard rakell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fredrik claesson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antoine vermette", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ducks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam henrique", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bruce boudreau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zack smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erik karlsson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john gibson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hampus lindholm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig anderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan kesler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben harpur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gallardo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan getzlaf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ondrej kase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bryan murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jakob silfverberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corey perry", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ducks", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nhl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anaheim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anaheim ducks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles kings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ottawa senators", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ottawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press anaheim ducks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "anaheim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "czech republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anaheim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota wild", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nashville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ottawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new jersey", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:16.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "615025b9e3913ffb0316d2b2b671094ad3e54275", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9D2Qkpp6vWSMwMM8NxS2qQ4nMVF4sMvv9Bob7v5bEBItOjajtAGVrj0BDnCdR7NxAAskxwM7QeQZ0J03poIIMIEhyWJPhnEWg6rRXXhTEUe1yA_7H.6RmM", "site_full": "www.lse.co.uk", "site": "lse.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.lse.co.uk/shareChat.asp?view=thread&ShareTicker=KIBO", "site_categories": ["united_kingdom", "travel", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Kibo Mining Share Chat - Chat About KIBO Shares - Stock Quotes, Charts, Trade History, Share Chat, Financial Terms Glossary ", "title": "Kibo Mining Share Chat - Chat About KIBO Shares - Stock Quotes, Charts, Trade History, Share Chat, Financial Terms Glossary", "title_full": "Kibo Mining Share Chat - Chat About KIBO Shares - Stock Quotes, Charts, Trade History, Share Chat, Financial Terms Glossary", "published": "2017-12-07T11:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 22289, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "177d343349a6ef75553a42fd80eeab6da1942969", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9D2Qkpp6vWSMwMM8NxS2qQ4nMVF4sMvv9Bob7v5bEBItOjajtAGVrj0BDnCdR7NxAAskxwM7QeQZ0J03poIIMIEhyWJPhnEWg6rRXXhTEUe42SH_yxcfPOx3LN54dVQDubIvwfk2CY3_.B.P9jOwOP", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "s0n1cb00mb0y", "published": "2017-12-07T10:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "....but quite chuffed.

They pick up on very subtle non-verbal clues, feeling the energy and emotions of others, even if they are not obviously displayed. Body language, facial expressions or simply the energy of a person are enough to perceive what is really going on. Sensitives notice when someone is inauthentic and are not easily fooled by outward appearances. \nEmpaths and sensitives don\u2019t necessarily have to work things out in their mind. Often they just know. They may not be able to pinpoint how they know, but their inner radar receives information beyond the five senses. It makes many of them highly psychic or at least very intuitive. Their ability to tune into others at a very deep level is useful if they are working in a helping profession. \nBut often there is a price to pay for those gifts. What allows empaths and sensitives to be finely tuned to environmental and finer energies is also a source of potential problems. \nTheir extreme sensitivity can create a kind of energetic overload that is hard to handle. They are also susceptible to absorbing other people\u2019s energies. Especially negativity can clog up their receptive channels and drag them down into fuzziness, feeling heavy and ungrounded. Many only feel well \u2014 and safe \u2014 in their own space and limit their exposure to the outside world. \nFrom a psychological perspective, boundaries are about knowing how to set limits, say no and stand your ground in an assertive way. Interlinked with the psychological boundaries are invisible (to \u201cnormal\u201d perception) layers of electro-magnetic energies. They have been described in many religious traditions as Aura and in modern science as Biofield. Like an energetic spacesuit in the form of an upright egg, it surrounds the physical body and acts as an important interface between your own energies and those of others. \nIn less sensitive people their \u201cspacesuit\u201d is quite cohesive and defined. But empaths and sensitives tend to have a finer, more permeable and fluid aura resulting in foreign energies to penetrate and attach more easily. This makes it very important to adopt measures for regular physical and energetic self care. Honor who you are. Practice self-awareness and become aware of how you tick. Accept yourself. Be realistic about your wonderful attributes and those that could do with a tune-up. Don\u2019t deny your perceptions \u2014 even if people tell you otherwise. Trust your intuition \u2014 it is your most powerful inner compass. In their early years, many empaths and sensitives have been discouraged and programed to override their own wisdom. Later it requires special effort to overcome this and regain a true sense of self. Avoid or remove yourself from negative influences. \nYou will be more affected than less sensitive people. Sometimes it\u2019s best to put distance between yourself and whatever impinges on your peace of mind. This might even include limiting your exposure to the news, horror movies or anything else that acts as bombardment of negativity. Manage your own emotions. \nLearn to ride out emotional storms, a technique described in earlier posts. Even if they not as turbulent, recognize and name your own negative emotions, then challenge your self-talk associated with them. Are your thoughts realistic and true or is there a more rational way of looking at what upsets you? The way you manage your thinking about a situation will greatly affect your emotional wellbeing. Take care of your auric field. \nDevelop regular clearing and strengthening routines. Make sure the energies in your home are positive and light. Feng shui, sage, incense, space clearing sprays or other methods you find useful will keep them as pure and supportive as possible. For clearing your aura, use sprays, essences, essential oils, self healing or whatever else you find effective. If you still feel out of sorts, you may need help from a healer. \nStrengthening your energetic boundaries can be achieved through specific exercises. For example, Energy Medicine (check out Donna Eden\u2019s Youtube video: Daily Energy Routine, original version, add the \u2018Celtic Weave\u2019), yoga, chi gong, are just some of the effective ways of knitting your energies together.

they did was change around how it's managed. Instead of one centralized program of helping homelessness they moved it to the local hospital level and each of them has to use the money to help homelessness. Maybe it'll work better, maybe it won't...but that's not cutting a program. #8 to #7 - anon id: bc222036 Reply 0 (7h ago) [-] actually from a legal perspective it is, you're cutting one program and instituting a second, the program for building houses for homeless no longer exists, it doesn't matter that the money is still going to help them. Semantic's and legal wrangling aside the article stipulates that the money can be spent on whatever provided they can show evidence of \"dealing\" with homelessness. might be providing showers I know someone who works at a hospital and homeless people would come claiming to be sick so they could get a shower (helps in the examination if the patient is clean), it got to the point where the hospital just started asking if they wanted a shower so they could free up doctors. theoretically they could devote 1 doctor to helping homeless patients and pocket the rest for whatever they want. It will depend strongly on how the program is worded, also I'm not sure how local hospitals will fight homelessness, they can help with the health of homeless people but it's not like the hospitals will be able to provide places for them to live and help finding them work.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:17.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2848a18642ff04590fbdbc9e92b771a70bf8a766", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg96x0tCX6dqpWKxloN3TISRsqjpL5VOe0hD0r6IGWGwE_Mk4Ii7y1rQ2n5.kAf8PC4y_suj6GSpaL6ttz6AfqcT.qjSwRXVS.ZtvdKIpW1ILNOEHxuGDtERQx58VTqjO_4-", "site_full": "www.abbey.com.ng", "site": "abbey.com.ng", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Apply For Fuelling Station Cashier At Virgin Forest Energy Limited", "title_full": "Apply For Fuelling Station Cashier At Virgin Forest Energy Limited", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7EBvB0J4bj8/Wija4Yec2GI/AAAAAAAAOeY/SxTEJDUnUVg6bTsIWBuRSKCutp057QMyQCHMYCw/s640/images%25283%2529.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2848a18642ff04590fbdbc9e92b771a70bf8a766", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg96x0tCX6dqpWKxloN3TISRsqjpL5VOe0hD0r6IGWGwE_Mk4Ii7y1rQ2n5.kAf8PC4y_suj6GSpaL6ttz6AfqcT.qjSwRXVS.ZtvdKIpW1ILNOEHxuGDtERQx58VTqjO_4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Abbey News Forum", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Apply For Fuelling Station Cashier At Virgin Forest Energy Limited", "text": "11 Views Virgin Forest Energy Limited is a wholly-owned and well capitalized Nigerian energy downstream oil trading company.

Despite its widely utilization, there seems to be a great variability in their organization, clinical practice, and safety among centers.Aim of the studyTo obtain updated information on clinical practice in different perioperative areas of the CRS-HIPEC.Patients and MethodsAll 25 members of the Spanish Surface Peritoneal Malignancy (GECOP), were invited to answer an online survey, to describe their usual practice in different perioperative areas of the CRS-HIPEC.ResultsSurvey was responded by 100% of centers. This study represents more than 800 patients treated annually. Seventy per cent of respondents perform CRS-HIPEC for more than 5 years. The most frequent technique was Coliseum (88%). Routinely non-invasive monitoring of cardiac output is used by 92% of centers. More than 50% of centers administer oxaliplatin (74%), or mitomycin-C (65%) in colorectal cancer; cisplatin in gastric cancer (73%) and mesothelioma (74%).

The US President admitted the move will cause dissent, but says it could help resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict. \"Today, we finally acknowledge the obvious - that Jerusalem is Israel's capital. This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality,\" said Trump in a pre-scheduled speech at the White House. \"Israel is a sovereign nation with a right like every other sovereign nation to determine its own capital. Acknowledging this is a fact is a necessary condition for achieving peace. Trump also left the door open for a two-state solution. \"The United States would support a two-state solution if agreed to by both sides. In the meantime, I call on all parties to maintain the status quo at Jerusalem's holy sites including the Temple Mount, also known as Haram al-Sharif.\" In a recorded statement released minutes after Trump finished talking, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that his people would be \u201cforever grateful\u201d for the \u201chistoric decision\u201d and urged other countries to follow America\u2019s example. \u201cJerusalem has been the focus of our hopes, our dreams, our prayers for three millennia, the President's decision is an important step towards peace, for there is no peace that doesn't include Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel.\u201d He vowed that there would be \u201cno change whatsoever to the status quo at the holy sites\u201d and promised to \u201censure freedom of worship\u201d for the three main religions for whom Jerusalem is a holy city. The President of the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas said that Trump\u2019s decision meant that the US \u201cabdicates\u201d any role in mediating the Arab-Israeli conflict. In a televised speech, he said he \u201ccondemned and rejected\u201d the US decision, which he said will \u201cserve terrorists\u201d and \u201cbring never-ending wars to the region.\u201d He insisted that Jerusalem remains the capital of any Palestinian state, and said that the decision would serve to unify all Palestinian factions at a \u201ccritical moment,\u201d which he promised to gather for a discussion of the appropriate response. Hamas, which is control of Gaza, and is regarded as a terrorist organization by the United States, said that Jerusalem\u2019s new status would \u201copen the gates of hell.\u201d It called upon other actors to \u201cundermine\u201d American interests in the Middle East, and reiterated its promise to stage \u201cthree days of rage\u201d in response to Trump\u2019s statement. \u201cTrump\u2019s decision will not succeed in changing the reality of Jerusalem being Islamic Arab land,\u201d said a spokesman for Hamas, which officially does not recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist. archive.is/a0bKq L.A. skirball fire A wind-whipped wildfire raged on Wednesday into a wealthy Southern California neighborhood, destroying at least six homes, threatening hundreds more and scorching a building at a winery owned by billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch. The so-called Skirball Fire, which erupted early on Wednesday as the latest in a rash of major blazes fueled by hot, dry Santa Ana winds, had burned about 150 acres near large estates in the Bel-Air neighborhood of Los Angeles by nightfall and was only 5 percent contained. Firefighters battled to save multi million-dollar homes in the path of the flames, which also forced the closure of the San Diego (405) Freeway in both directions. \u201cWe are expecting some extreme wind behavior this evening,\u201d Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby told reporters at an afternoon news conference. The new fire also prompted the nearby Getty Center museum to close the doors at its hilltop campus to prevent damage to its world-class art collection. The Skirball Fire in the area south of scenic Mulholland Drive and north of Sunset Boulevard was just one of several major out-of-control brush fires that have sprung up in Southern California since Monday, when Santa Ana wind conditions set in. In Ventura, some 50 miles (80 km) northwest of Los Angeles, more than 1,000 firefighters battled the largest, the Thomas Fire, which has already destroyed more than 150 homes and threatened thousands more. California Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency, freeing state funds and resources to assist firefighters. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it approved grants to help cover the cost of emergency work for the Thomas Fire and two others. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday his thoughts and prayers were with everyone in the path of the wildfires. Although no casualties have been reported, the fires have forced mass evacuations, cancellation of classes at dozens of schools and resulted in the loss of power at more than 250,000 homes in Ventura County. archive.is/bs95v Putin announces run for presidency Vladimir Putin has confirmed that he will seek another term in office in next year\u2019s presidential election. Yes, I will run as a candidate for the Russian presidency,\u201d Putin said. He was meeting with workers at the country\u2019s historic manufacturer, GAZ (Gorkovsky Avtomobilny Zavod), in Russia's Nizhny Novgorod on Wednesday. The upcoming election on March 18 will be the fourth in Putin\u2019s political career. He held the office of president for two terms from 2000 to 2008, and served as prime minister from 2008 to 2012. Putin then won a third term as president in 2012. Earlier, Russian media reported that he may run as an independent candidate. The Russian president enjoys a high approval rating, with over 82 percent of Russians supporting him according to a poll conducted by state-run VTSIOM in late September. Several other people, including an unprecedented number of women, have announced their candidacy. Liberal-Democratic Party head Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Communist Party\u2019s Gennady Zyuganov, the liberal Yabloko party\u2019s Grigory Yavlinsky, journalist and singer-songwriter Ekaterina Gordon, celebrity and activist Ksenia Sobchak, and business ombudsman Boris Titov have all announced their plans to run. archive.is/oThqT Bitcoin Heist After a mysterious 12-hour service outage, the popular cryptocurrency mining exchange NiceHash announced hackers stole an unknown amount of money from users. However, one bitcoin wallet gained more than $64 million within a matter of minutes. On Wednesday, NiceHash announced there was a security breach involving the company\u2019s website which compromised their payment services, and the contents of the users\u2019 bitcoin wallets. The announcement came 12 hours after NiceHash suddenly informed users that they were undergoing maintenance. Two hours later, a user by the name of Erik Callesen posted an image showing an outgoing transaction he claimed he did not make. \u201cEither I got hacked or something is up,\u201d Callesen wrote. Callesen added that $56 million had been sent to one bitcoin wallet address. \u201cI think I got jacked and probably a lot of other folks?\u201d Callesen wrote. Many other users responded to the company\u2019s maintenance tweet, saying that they had money stolen. When NiceHash admitted that they were hacked, they did not confirm the amount that had been stolen. The service said they were \u201cworking to verify the precise number of BTC taken.\u201d However, CoinDesk reported that as many as 4,736.42 bitcoin, worth more than $62 million at the time, was stolen and transferred to one account. Several users pointed to a Bitcoin wallet address that was opened Tuesday at 9:07pm, which went from a balance of 0.01 bitcoin, valued just over $123, to a balance of 4,655.25 bitcoin, worth $57.7 million, after the user made more than 3,000 transactions around 9:17pm. In addition to conducting an internal investigation, NiceHash said that they have reported the incident to \u201crelevant authorities and law enforcement\u201d and are \u201cco-operating with them as a matter of urgency.\u201d The wallet currently has a balance of 4,736.42 bitcoin, worth $64,080,393. Monster black hole Astronomers have discovered the most distant \"supermassive\" black hole known to science. The matter-munching sinkhole is a whopping 13 billion light-years away, so far that we see it as it was a mere 690 million years after the Big Bang. But at about 800 million times the mass of our Sun, it managed to grow to a surprisingly large size such a short time after the origin of the Universe. This relic from the early Universe is busily devouring material at the centre of a galaxy - marking it out as a so-called quasar. Matter, such as gas, falling onto the black hole will form an ultra-hot mass of material around it known as an accretion disk. \"Quasars are among the brightest and most distant known celestial objects and are crucial to understanding the early Universe,\" said co-author Bram Venemans of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany. This quasar comes from a time when the Universe was just 5% of its current age. At this time, the cosmos was beginning to emerge from a period known as the dark ages - just before the first stars appeared. The quasar's distance is described by a property called its redshift - a measurement of how much the wavelength of its light is stretched by the expansion of the Universe before reaching Earth. The newly discovered black hole has a redshift of 7.54. The higher the redshift, the greater the distance, and the farther back astronomers are looking in time when they observe the object. The discovery of a massive black hole so early on may provide key clues on conditions that abounded when the Universe was young. ht tps://www.nature.com/articles/nature25180.epdf?referrer access token=5RlSk8gkA9WngEj3Zco4INRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OqRPXsjjgScsA9vtiwnFwpAueweX49aDc6-IVNl xsYDrsUJmqfxXvdkDuuDrCn26r1Lx27LCsrtXbLy9pM3iWV-k-dD4L1HDKZIfFJe2cA622MdC7mjtIXWz8odZENiJMrr1Ws36835V8oE9tHIWO4GG0Z E 3 nE24WgF2kSq TksRa2tFFdRZhI9e3-lzY%3D&tracking referrer=www.bbc.com Dinoduck Synchrotron scanning reveals amphibious ecomorphology in a new clade of bird-like dinosaurs. The latest dino discovery was announced Wednesday in a study by the journal Nature. It walked like an ostrich, was 18 inches tall, had flippers and could swim like a penguin, had a bill like a duck and a neck like a swan but had killer claws and teeth like a crocodile, which it needed because it was a meat-eating dinosaur. It was named Halszkaraptor escuilliei, or \u201cHalszka\u201d for short, after the late Polish paleontologist Halszka Osmolska. According to the study, the skeleton of the tiny bird-like creature was discovered in a sandstone rock and is believed to have roamed Mongolia 75 million years ago. Lead author Andrea Cau, a paleontologist from Bologna, Italy, said he was at first highly suspicious about the fossil's authenticity, both because of its appearance and the fact that the rock containing the skeleton had been smuggled out of Mongolia and left in a private collector's hands. \"I asked myself, 'Is this a real, natural skeleton, or an artifact, a chimera? If this is a fake, how could I demonstrate it? Assuming it was a fake instead of starting assuming that the fossil is genuine was the most appropriate way to start the investigation of such a bizarre fossil.\" Researchers used a Synchrotron, a powerful X-ray generator, to create three-dimensional images of the fossil, which showed the creature was indeed a single animal and not a concoction built from several sources.

His leadership on and off the court will be missed.\u201d\nA fifth-year graduate transfer from Illinois State, the 6-foot-8 forward was averaging 12.7 points and 10.0 rebounds through the first seven games.

Can you even imagine hollies with bright golden berries? These would show out in the landscape like small trees or shrubs adorned with a thousand little golden lights and the same for the mantle too! My preference, however, would be to see birds celebrating with a Christmas feast. \nHere at the Coastal Georgia Botanical Gardens, we are like the holly headquarters for the Low Country. We've got the imports, the hybrids, and fantastic natives that most have never seen. Two of my favorites are outstanding deciduous natives, the possumhaw (Ilex decidua) and the winterberry (Ilex verticillata). \nThe possumhaw is native to 19 states from Texas to Illinois, eastward to Maryland and everything south. The possumhaw has been known to feed nine species of birds including the beloved bobwhite quail. The winterberry, on the other hand, is native over a much larger area, including 33 states and much of Canada. It feeds at least 20 species of birds and has been in cultivation since 1736. That's heirloom status in my book. \nDon't let the fact that they are deciduous discourage you from trying them in the landscape; when the leaves diminish or fall the berries are even more dazzling. As you are probably guessing, both the winterberry and the possumhaw have a superior selection in both red and golden berry form.   \nFinch's Gold is the selection of possumhaw holly we are growing, and your first thought is that it gets its name from a bird you might see devouring the fruit. The truth is, it is named for Bill Finch who discovered it in Mobile, Ala. This terrific plant is cold hardy from zones 5-9 and can form a small tree 12-to-15 feet in height with a spread to 10-feet. We are also growing Warren's Red a superior selection that loads up with uncountable red berries. \nOur winterberry hollies are more shrub-like reaching 5-to-8 feet in height. The winterberry is more cold-hardy with zones from 3-9. We are growing Winter Red and Winter Gold both of which offer staggering beauty with their colorful fruit. \nPossumhaws and winterberries are easy to grow, and good nurseries usually have them. Regardless of the variety you choose, plant in sun to partial sun and in the same places, you might plant a crape myrtle. Use them to frame entryways for special accents or along driveways and around the patio. Anywhere the landscape looks drab in the winter is an excellent place for the possumhaw or winterberry holly to brighten. It is always a good idea to include a male variety nearby to ensure maximum berry production. \nOne well-known horticulturist said you could garden for 12 lifetimes and never see an insect or disease bothering the plant. In most years however our berries are stripped by cedar waxwings, American robins, or mockingbirds which always seem to stake a claim. These pests will most likely cause a family celebration and bring out the cameras. \nThis winter and spring when you are at your garden center choosing new trees or shrubs, look for hollies loaded with fruit and bearing no leaves you just may strike gold with a great selection of one of our native species. \n(Norman Winter is director of the Coastal Georgia Botanical Gardens at the Historic Bamboo Farm, University of Georgia Cooperative Extension, and author of \"Tough-as-Nails Flowers for the South\" and \"Captivating Combinations: Color and Style in the Garden.\" Follow him at: @CGBGgardenguru.)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bill finch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "finch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norman winter", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ilex verticillata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of georgia cooperative extension", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "historic bamboo farm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "winter red and winter gold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coastal georgia botanical gardens", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "illinois", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "low country", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mobile", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:19.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "221e4e7948be15c7b2e1486e36304edc841dc3ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.irEX7KvLpUJgFJDuHaVojyFbtCKVzBnbauB6CUu5wYSC7VSBxD3OZADd9pC403Rr.2D2U46cQTxXJR58REpl.", "site_full": "www.cnet.com", "site": "cnet.com", "site_section": "http://www.cnet.com/forums/discussions/how-to-put-music-on-kindle/", "site_categories": ["shopping", "media", "cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "How To Put Music On Kindle? - Forums - CNET", "title": "How To Put Music On Kindle? - Forums - CNET", "title_full": "How To Put Music On Kindle? - Forums - CNET", "published": "2017-12-07T06:10:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.07, "main_image": "https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/fly/bundles/cnetcss/images/core/redball/cnet-meta.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 164, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "221e4e7948be15c7b2e1486e36304edc841dc3ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.irEX7KvLpUJgFJDuHaVojyFbtCKVzBnbauB6CUu5wYSC7VSBxD3OZADd9pC403Rr.2D2U46cQTxXJR58REpl.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "lillianwrightus", "published": "2017-12-07T06:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "How To Put Music On Kindle? - Forums - CNET", "text": "How To Put Music On Kindle?

They are looking at shutting down. They want to have illegal immigrants in many cases, people that we don't want in our country, they want to have illegal immigrants pouring into our country.\"\nDemocrats say that's wrong on multiple counts \u2014 that they don't want immigrants streaming into the country illegally, nor do they want a shutdown. That speculation by Trump further heightened tensions ahead of a planned Thursday with the president and congressional leaders at the White House.\nAt issue are protections for immigrants known as DREAMers \u2014 the roughly 700,000 people who are in the U.S. illegally and were brought to the country as children.\nMovie Interviews Actor Who Came Out As Undocumented Is Fighting For Hollywood To Stand With DACA While it's true that Democrats want to include a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers in some kind of year-end legislation, they say they also want to avoid a funding catastrophe. Congress needs to pass a spending bill and have it signed into law by Trump before midnight Friday if they hope to avoid running out of money to fund the government. The House is set to vote Thursday on a two-week extension, pushing the threat of a shutdown off to just before Christmas.\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters Tuesday that he didn't think the immigration issue would lead to a government shutdown.\n\"We don't think we're going to get to that,\" Schumer said. \"There are good negotiations occurring between Democrats and Republicans to come up with a good DACA program as well as some good border security.\"\nDemocrats want to pass permanent protections for people who were once protected under DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program started by former President Barack Obama. Trump rescinded the program in September and said it was up to Congress to pass a law if they want the DREAMers protected from deportation.\nPolitics Here Are 4 Options Congress Could Take On DACA National Oops, We Lost Your DACA Application Trump approached a deal with Democrats to create a permanent legal fix for DACA shortly after rescinding the program, infuriating many of his conservative supporters. \nRepublican leaders have promised to pass some kind of immigration bill early next year. They say they are open to working with Democrats on the legislation, but GOP leaders don't think there's a huge rush to get it done.\nTexas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, told reporters that the immigration talks can wait until next year.\n\"We are certainly willing to enter into those good-faith negotiations, but they do not belong in an end-of-the-year spending appropriations debate,\" Cornyn said. \"I hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will take our word for it, as demonstrated by our good faith in making an offer to them, that we do want to resolve this, but it's not going to be before the end of this year.\"\nBut activists and many Democrats are specific they want a path to citizenship, and they say they're tired of waiting.\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris, one of several Democrats who spoke Wednesday at an immigration rally outside the Capitol, said there is an urgent need to find a solution now.\n\"I'm not sure what to think about where this administration stands, but I know that we as a country, and leaders of this country, in particular in the United States Congress, need to sand with these DREAMers and give them the protections they deserve. And we need to do this by the end of the year,\" Harris said. \"It's a false choice, also, to suggest that these two issues need to be connected.\"\nDemocrats don't have much leverage in Congress, except when it comes to spending bills. Those require 60 votes to pass the Senate, so the 52 Republicans don't have enough votes to keep the government open on their own. Democrats could demand an immigration deal in exchange for their votes.\nRepublicans have warned that combining the two could risk preventing a bipartisan deal on immigration at a time when there is renewed hope that such a solution is possible. Senate Republicans, including Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley of Iowa and Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, say they want to reach a deal.\nIn the House, 34 Republicans wrote to Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., this week calling on him to do the same.\nThat's why activists like Jeremy Robbins of the group New American Economy say this is a perfect time for Congress act.\n\"This is not a hard policy issue,\" Robbins said. \"There is huge and broad support to find a solution, so absolutely we think there should be a solution now.\"\nHis group is working with people on the left and right. They say they don't want a government shutdown either, but they do want an immigration bill this month. Their coalition includes major employers and manufacturers, faith groups and an organization run by powerful Republican fundraisers, brothers Charles and David Koch.\nPolitics Democrat Pushes Vote On Trump Impeachment. It Didn't Succeed New American Economy set up what members call a war room inside the Capitol on Wednesday as part of a day of protests and lobbying by immigration activists.

Visitors to the war room included Republicans Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida.\n\"We need to find solutions to our nation's current immigration problems starting with a solution for DREAMers,\" Ros-Lehtinen said in her message. \"Our country was funded and grew prosperously based on providing opportunities and fairness for all.\"\nThe whole idea is to build outside pressure to get a deal before Congress leaves for the holidays.

Punch reports that the incident which happened on Sunday November 17, 2017 saw the victims in a Toyota Corolla, driven by an estate agent, Jerry Akinlabi. Ogogo and Emeagwai are Akinlabi\u2019s girlfriend and friend respectively. . . Their car was stopped by 5 policemen including Abua, at a checkpoint along Igbuzo Market. One of the policemen, identified as Nwokolo, was said to have demanded money from Akinlabi and the driver told him that he did not have N200 to give him. . . Nwokolo then reportedly demanded one of the N1,000 notes Jerry had on him. As Akinlabi drove off from the checkpoint, Abua reportedly shot at the car and bullets pierced the back of the vehicle, hitting Ogogo, who sat at the back seat. . . The bullet also grazed the back of Emeagwai, who was at the passenger\u2019s seat. Akinlabi revealed that four cops, including the team leader, one ASP Akhabue, were detained by the police, while Abua evaded arrest. . . Akinlabi said he took the victims to a general hospital in Igbuzo, from where Ogogo was referred to the Federal Medical Centre, Asaba. He said he called a senior police officer at Asaba who notified the state Commissioner of Police of the incident. . . He said, \u201cThe CP and the DPO of the Igbozo Police Station came to the FMC and deposited N100,000, but I have spent much more than that. Meanwhile, the policeman who shot at us had gone to drop the gun at the station and fled. . . Emeagwai urged the police authorities not to sweep the case under the carpet, saying the policemen must be punished. The Delta State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Andrew Aniamaka, said the policemen would be brought to book if found culpable after investigation.

How to hunt a Fox: The latest wrinkle in the race to acquire 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets involves Disney boss Bob Iger. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Iger is likely to extend his tenure as CEO beyond his 2019 retirement date if Disney ( DIS ) lands the Fox ( FOX ) assets. Comcast is also said to be exploring a bid for the assets, which likely include Fox's movie studio, FX, National Geographic and Indian business Star. \nWhy does this matter? \nIger has repeatedly extended his tenure in recent years amid a troubled search for a successor. \nThe Financial Times reported earlier this week that James Murdoch, the current chief executive of Fox, could join Disney as part of the deal. The newspaper suggested he could even succeed Iger. \n2. Bitcoin hits $15,000: Another day, another bitcoin ( XBT ) record. \nThe digital currency has shot above the $15,000 mark for the first time -- the fourth big barrier it's broken in less than two days. \nIt had already zipped past $12,000, $13,000 and $14,000 within 24 hours before hitting $15,000 on Thursday morning in New York. \nDespite a flurry of warnings from top economists and business leaders, its upward trajectory has continued -- albeit with a few sharp dips along the way. \nAfter breaking above $11,000 last week, it abruptly plunged by more than $2,000 before resuming its climb. Buyer beware! \n3. Brexit bites: British Prime Minister Theresa May is trying again to make progress on the Irish border, one of three key issues that must be addressed before negotiators can discuss trade terms with the EU. \nMay is racing to get a deal before a key EU summit next week. \nBut she is being hobbled by divisions within her own party, which remains at loggerheads over its plans for Brexit. \nOpposition lawmakers aren't happy either: They've been angered by news that the government department charged with negotiating Brexit hasn't examined its potential economic impact. \nThe pound, which has been under pressure all week, dropped 0.1%. \n4. Media deal in court: AT&T ( T ) and the U.S. Department of Justice will be in court on Thursday. \nThe Justice Department filed a suit to block AT&T's bid to buy Time Warner ( TWX ) , CNN's parent company, citing antitrust concerns. The first big question the judge needs to decide is when to schedule a trial. The two sides disagree when that should be. \nThe case could have implications for other big mergers, including CVS' ( CVS ) $69 billion acquisition of Aetna ( AET ) . \n5.

He grew out his hair and his beard and wore the shortened trousers required by the extremists. He forced himself to witness the beheadings and stonings, so he could hear killers call out the names of the condemned and their supposed crimes. \nBy night, anonymously from his darkened room, Mosul Eye told the world what was happening. If caught, he too would be executed. \nBut after more than three years, his double life has grown too heavy to bear. He misses his name. \nHis secrets consume him, sap energy he\u2019d rather use for his doctoral dissertation and for helping Mosul rebuild. In conversations with The Associated Press, he agonized over how to end the anonymity that plagues him. He made his decision. \nMosul Eye is Omar Mohammed, historian, scholar, blogger. He is 31. \nThe revelation of his identity is for his thousands of readers and followers, for all his volunteers in Mosul who have been inspired by a man they have never seen. But above all, it is for the brother who died in the final battle and for his grieving mother. \n\u201cI can\u2019t be anonymous anymore. This is to say that I defeated ISIS. You can see me now, and you can know me now,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \nMohammed first posted about the Islamic State group under his own Facebook account, in the first few days after its fighters swept into Mosul, but a friend told him he risked being killed. So in those first days he made himself a promise: trust no one, document everything. \nA newly minted teacher with a reputation for secular ideas, he had lost his university job. \nHe found another calling. \n\u201cMy job as a historian requires an unbiased approach which I am going to adhere to and keep my personal opinion to myself,\u201d he wrote on that first day, June 18, 2014. \nMosul Eye became one of the outside world\u2019s main sources of news about the Islamic State fighters, their atrocities and their transformation of the city into a grotesque shadow of itself. \nDuring Friday sermons, Mohammed feigned enthusiasm. He collected propaganda to post online later. He drank tea at the hospital, fishing for information. \nMuch of what he collected went on the blog. Other details he kept in his computer, for fear of giving away his identity. Someday, he promised, he would write history with them. \nThe most sensitive details initially came from two old friends: a doctor and a high school dropout who had joined an Islamic State intelligence unit. \nMohammed\u2019s information sometimes included photos of the fighters and commanders, complete with biographies surreptitiously pieced together during the course of his normal life \u2014 that of an out-of-work scholar living at home. \n\u201cI used the two characters, the two personalities to serve each other,\u201d he said. He expanded into a Facebook page and a Twitter feed to parcel out information at a time when little news was escaping. \nIntelligence agencies made contact as well and he rebuffed them. \n\u201cI am not a spy or a journalist,\u201d he would say. \u201cI tell them this: If you want the information, it\u2019s published and it\u2019s public for free. Take it.\u201d \nIn March 2015, his catalogue of horrors got to him. \n\u201cI was super ready to die,\u201d Mohammed said. \u201cI was so tired of worrying about myself, my family, my brothers. I am not alive to worry, but I am alive to live this life. I thought: I am done.\u201d \nHe cut his hair short, shaved his beard and pulled on a bright red sweater. His closest friend joined him. \nThey drove to the banks of the Tigris blasting forbidden music. They shared a carafe of tea. Heedless of people picnicking nearby, Mohammed lit a cigarette\u2014 banned by IS. Somehow, incredibly, he wasn\u2019t caught. \n\u201cAt that moment I felt like I was given a new life.\u201d \nHe resumed what he had taken to calling his duty. He grew out his hair and beard, put the shortened trousers back on. \nHe tested out different voices, Christian, Muslim. Sometimes he indicated he was gone, other times that he was still in the city. \nFinally, after leaving Mosul a thousand times in his mind, he decided it was time to get out. \n\u201cI think I deserve life, deserve to be alive.\u201d \nA smuggler agreed to sneak him out for $1,000. Mohammed left the next day, the contents of his computer transferred overnight to a hard-drive that he packed with him. \nNo one gave him a second look during the two days and some 500 kilometres (300 miles) it took to reach Turkey. \nOnce there, Mosul Eye kept at it: via WhatsApp and Viber, from Facebook messages and long conversations with friends and relatives who had contacts within IS. From hundreds of kilometres away, his life remained consumed by events back home. \nBy mid-2016, deaths were piling up faster than he could record. The Islamic State group was on a hunt for traitors and the airstrikes were taking an increasing toll on everyone. His records grew haphazard, and he turned to Twitter to document the atrocities. In February 2017, he received asylum in Europe. \nOnly after his elder brother Ahmed was killed in a mortar strike and IS was gone from the city did Mohammed reveal his secret to a younger brother \u2014 who greeted the news with a shock of pride and happiness. His sibling spoke on condition of anonymity from his refuge in Iraq because he was fearful for his life. \n\u201cPeople in Mosul had lost hope and confidence in politicians, in everything,\u201d his brother said. Mosul Eye \u201cmanaged to show that it\u2019s possible to change the situation in the city and bring it back to life.\u201d Join the conversation Sign in to comment (not connected to your Insider Club login).

They have decent-ish buffs, can some medium-tier plate armor (though almost always opt for robes instead), can use hammers + shield (rare, except in Final Fantasy 1), wands + shield, or staves, have some minor offensive magic, and can of course heal. They can survive on their own a bit better than other mage classes, but unless they are wearing plate armor (again, rarely done) are still going to be very squishy compared to any physical class. One time in Final Fantasy XI (the first MMO Final Fantasy), I saw a white mage taking on a crowd of enemies that had just killed off ~20 other players.

Eventually, something will drive us from our home, and whether that something is our Sun\u2019s eventual death, some type of natural cataclysm, or the damage we\u2019ve caused to our own environment, we\u2019re going to need to find a new home if we want humanity to live on. When we finally decide to make the move, a planet called K2-18b might be our destination.\nK2-18b orbits the star K2-18 (see how that works?), and while it\u2019s quite a ways from our own Solar System, it might be worth the trip. First discovered back in 2015, the planet is thought to lie within its star\u2019s habitable zone, and if it does indeed have a rocky core as scientists believe, it may well have liquid water on its surface. If we\u2019re particularly lucky, it might even already support life.\nRenewed interest in K2-18b after its initial discovery is the result of new research that determined the planet was both larger than Earth, and likely rocky, which is enough to classify it as a \u201cSuper Earth.\u201d The data that painted a more vivid picture of the planet was gathered by the HARPS planet-finding tool at the La Silla Observatory located in Chile.\nAt present, the researchers have been able to narrow down K2-18b\u2019s makeup to just two possibilities. They believe that, due to its mass and size, it is either a rocky world like Earth with a gas atmosphere (which would be the most promising) or a water-heavy world covered by a thick layer of ice. In the not-so-distant future, NASA\u2019s incredibly powerful James Webb Space Telescope could possibly get a better look at the planet and help answer that question.\nIn an unexpected surprise, while researching the behavior of K2-18b, astronomers noticed something that they thought might have been signal noise but eventually determined was an entirely new planet orbiting K2-18 much closer than K2-18b does. Dubbed K2-18c, the planet is also a Super Earth, though because of its proximity to its star it\u2019s not likely that liquid water could exist on its surface, which makes it a lot less appealing to humans.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "la silla observatory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james webb space telescope", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chile", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:20.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c1e61bd0f9928b031d98b66627bce3fa0026f572", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Pm9O0pnfNEm70SyS4RFvg1nBOFgi0rVCzLqfC.bIQ6ndl1GwzOpf8XPNeWWKQHttiUndnbL2AaA--", "site_full": "www.seasoned.com", "site": "seasoned.com", "site_section": "http://www.seasoned.com/Article/Rss/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Seasoned Cooking", "title": "Taste the Spicy Rainbow", "title_full": "Taste the Spicy Rainbow", "published": "2017-12-06T08:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://seasoned.com/sites/default/files/nav_logo_0.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c1e61bd0f9928b031d98b66627bce3fa0026f572", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Pm9O0pnfNEm70SyS4RFvg1nBOFgi0rVCzLqfC.bIQ6ndl1GwzOpf8XPNeWWKQHttiUndnbL2AaA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ronda L.

Halpin \nFor me the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas is a perfect time for plannedovers. Plannedovers are leftovers that are created with a plan in mind. They can be comprised of nearly anything, but some of my favorites include chopped poultry, rice, and those little odds and ends bits of produce that always seem to want a purpose. This time around, that purpose is gumbo. \nGumbo really is just a spicy rice casserole with lots of protein, produce, and heat . I like to add some seafood to the mix and use Penzeys Cajun Seasoning , although you can choose spicy sausage and seasonings to suit your tastes. You can also tweak the vegetables in this gumbo, but make sure you've got a juicy mix, as they help create the sauce in this quick dish. \nWhile a meal on its own, I do enjoy serving gumbo with cheesy cornbread. You could even whip up a batch in the oven as you put together this quick meal. Warm and comforting while taking less than a half hour is just what we all need as gift-giving, big meal, and party seasons descend upon us all. Meals like this help us stay on top if it all! 1 T. cooking fat (I used bacon fat) 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 small red onion, peeled and slivered 1 c. diced red and orange pepper 2 tsp. Cajun seasoning 1 - 14 oz. can fire roasted tomatoes with juices 2 c. cooked rice 1 handful yellow pear tomatoes 1 c. diced cooked chicken or turkey 6 oz. raw shrimp, peeled and deveined \nHeat the cooking fat of your choice over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet. Add the garlic, onion, and diced peppers. Saut\u00e9 for a couple of minutes before adding the Cajun seasoning and continuing to saut\u00e9 for another few minutes until the vegetables are softened and fragrant. Add the tomatoes with their juices and the rice. Stir well to combine, cover, and turn to medium-low; allow to cook for another 5 minutes. \nRemove the lid and add the remaining ingredients. Replace the lid and allow to cook for another 5 minutes. Stir once more and serve immediately.

Although many infrastructure players are still struggling with their highly leveraged balance sheets, infrastructure companies with exposure to the airport and the highway sectors have started witnessing an improvement in their operational and financial performance. As per ICRA\u2019s sample study of infrastructure companies across segments, the aggregate debt at a standalone level as of March 2017 had increased only marginally from Mar-2016, while at the consolidated level there was a 12 per cent YoY decline in debt from Rs 1.58 lakh crore to Rs 1.39 lakh crore, primarily due to divestment of stake in subsidiaries or projects. The debt level indicates that borrowings have peaked and the companies are now focussed on deleveraging. With improved balance sheet, an improvement in operational performance will help improve the credit metrics of entities. According to Shubham Jain, Vice President and Sector-Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA: \u201cWhile it is still early to comment on whether the tough phase for infrastructure companies is over, things have certainly started improving. We have seen deleveraging, and focus on execution as the drivers of this improvement. Infrastructure segments like airports and highways have been outperforming with improved operational performance supported by healthy traffic growth in both the segments.\u201d A major push from the government on roads and urban infrastructure segments has helped construction companies improve their order book position. The ICRA sample of construction companies witnessed improvement in order inflows over the last couple of years with a major push coming from segments like roads, metro and urban infrastructure. Currently, the order book position of most construction companies stands at over three times their last reported annual revenues. According to the three-year action agenda devised by the NITI Aayog, the total capital development expenditure is projected to increase to Rs 2427 billion in 2018-19 (up by 19 per cent) and further to Rs 3,585 billion in 2019-20 (up by 48 per cent). This will further help strengthen the order inflow for the construction sector. The opportunities for the construction sector remain robust. The recently approved Bharatmala Pariyojana has the potential to transform the road sector in India and provide significant opportunities for construction companies. Similarly, on the Railways, the work on the first bullet train project of India is likely to start as the project funding has been tied up. The Rs 1,080-billion project will be funded by a Rs 880-billion soft loan corpus from Japan and will provide a sizeable opportunity for the large construction players. Similarly, a few projects involving interlinking of rivers are also expected to be taken up over the next few quarters. However, funding issues continue to be a challenge. With the banks grappling with high NPAs, the banking credit to infrastructure and construction sectors has been on a gradual decline. However, a part of this is also due to the increased share of NBFCs, and the corporate bond market (for higher rated entities). The issuances in the corporate bond market by infrastructure players have shown a strong traction over the last 15-18 months. On the alternate funding avenues, Jain adds: \u201cAlternate funding avenues like Infrastructure Debt Funds (IDF), Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) have not picked up after initial issuances. The weak market response to the listed InvITs and pending clarity on tax liability arising at the time of transfer of assets to the InvIT has made other prospective InvIT issuers put their plans on hold. As InvITs are more of a fixed-income type instrument, investor interest is expected to come primarily from the institutional investors.\u201d Tags Cloud", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shubham jain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bharatmala pariyojana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nbfcs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "icra", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:21.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "952fa6920ef9520cb383b6a0a1d2703c46317fd7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTA1aUJdH9sPXZIDF1r8w1DPXLRGEuc2QZwfQYu_6wpca6OdzQbUqCtadkQ4wI7wLcB96p7TEImypwUMaeedwECWIsuZ6avG8y5CJYtm0vQtstRclzVMike7qJ1o4BhSCkaPgSXtxi_UD7Yr5mzallSDcI3AmciDhQ-", "site_full": "cybraxo.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://cybraxo.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Participate in Digital Vidya\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 8th Anniversary Digital Marketing Scholarship Test \u2013 CYBRAXO", "title": "Participate in Digital Vidya\u2019s 8th Anniversary Digital Marketing Scholarship Test", "title_full": "Participate in Digital Vidya\u2019s 8th Anniversary Digital Marketing Scholarship Test", "published": "2017-12-07T12:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "952fa6920ef9520cb383b6a0a1d2703c46317fd7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTA1aUJdH9sPXZIDF1r8w1DPXLRGEuc2QZwfQYu_6wpca6OdzQbUqCtadkQ4wI7wLcB96p7TEImypwUMaeedwECWIsuZ6avG8y5CJYtm0vQtstRclzVMike7qJ1o4BhSCkaPgSXtxi_UD7Yr5mzallSDcI3AmciDhQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CYBRAXO", "published": "2017-12-07T12:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "Participate in Digital Vidya\u2019s 8th Anniversary Digital Marketing Scholarship Test", "text": "Digital Vidya, one of Asia\u2019s leading Digital Marketing and Data Analytics training institutes announces a Digital Marketing Scholarship Test as it marks its 8th anniversary of delivering over 1500 successful training programs.

Whether one of the millions of stateless people roaming the earth, or people we encounter on the streets of our towns and cities \u2013 the problem looms ever greater.\nI wrote and illustrated a children\u2019s Christmas story 15 years ago entitled \u2018Christeve the Cat Finds Her Home\u2019. Based on a true story, it focuses on the arrival of a little cat into my life on Christmas Eve 1996 when I was living in Crickhowell, Wales. \nI have been displaced a couple of times in my life, and know what it is to yearn for a home of my own. In many ways this story is autobiographical. It is filled with symbolism including of course the magical hummingbirds.\nIn the story the little cat was homeless and had been living in a tree across from my cottage. I believed that she belonged to Mr. Pickford, one of my neighbours and so had not been concerned about her.\nMy neighbour, Mr. Pickford. Here is the lonely little cat wishing she could live in a nice warm cottage like the one across from her tree. \u201cSitting between mountains and watched by the moon, with magical hummingbirds weaving their love\u201d this story takes place in The Magical Town of Crickadoon. \nThe little cat looking over the Magical Town of Crickadoon. During the long dark cold nights, every noise would give the little cat a fright, and sometimes she would cry. One night when the winds began to roar and howl, the little cat had a visit from a wise old owl. The wise owl told the little cat to be patient and trust. To close her eyes and dream of magical hummingbirds. \nSomething inside of her always knew that there was nothing to fear and that help was always near\u2026\u2026.. The little cat began to make friends with the birds and animals that lived beneath her tree. After days of fun and play with her new friends the little cat would fall into a deep sleep and dream about finding a home of her own.\nSome of the little cat\u2019s new friends One of her new friends, a red robin, told the little cat that she would never be alone because hummingbirds were always near, helping her to find a new home of her own. One morning red robin and little cat woke to see that the Magical Town of Crickadoon was completely covered in snow. everywhere the little cat looked, there was a special glow. Later that night when little cat was dreaming in her tree, a beautiful white hummingbird appeared. White hummingbird told little cat that there was nothing to fear, and that after a terrible storm, all would be clear. The next morning when the snow swirled and whirled and the winds roared and howled, the little cat felt so cold and alone was beginning to think that she would never find a home of her own. In her dreams the little cat heard White Hummingbird say \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t give into your fear, soon all will be clear. \u2013 Follow the light through the storm and there you will find your home, so cosy and warm\u201d. \nAs the little cat came closer to the only light she could see, she realised that it was shining from the cottage across from her tree. As little cat reached the door and raised her paw she called out as loudly as could be\u2026M , I am here, I am here\u2026\u2026.\nThe door to the cottage across from her tree opened wide and there was Janet the Artist waiting inside. Janet the Artist scooped up little cat with tenderness and love, and from high above the Magical Town of Crickadoon, hummingbirds of every colour were flying under the moon. Janet the Artist named the little cat, Christeve the Cat because she had arrived on a very special Christmas Eve. \nTHE END \nThis is the actual cottage where Christeve the Cat and Janet the Artist lived together in The Magical Town of Crickadoon. \nChristeve the Cat settled into her new home and sitting on her favourite chair . Christeve the Cat (on the left) with one of her friends sitting in her favourite place in the garden of her new home. http://www.janetweightreed.co.uk http://www.zazzle.com/janet+weight+reed+gifts \nA bient\u00f4t.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pickford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christeve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janet the artist", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "white hummingbird", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crickadoon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "magical town of crickadoon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crickhowell", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:21.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "532323858eba4b752fc9f4b737a87ef2e5728773", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xac2znsWB8JUot4M.5bxXP0Q2wyOkZ49lhelp8EU2qAhlGDyZcspAc8UN1nQs4SsEAf", "site_full": "www.nairaland.com", "site": "nairaland.com", "site_section": "http://www.nairaland.com/jobs", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Jobs/Vacancies - Nigeria - Nairaland", "title": "Good Looking Ladies To Work As Ushers For A Two Day Summit Coming Up In Major Ci", "title_full": "Good Looking Ladies To Work As Ushers For A Two Day Summit Coming Up In Major Ci - Jobs/Vacancies - Nigeria", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.47, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 951, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "532323858eba4b752fc9f4b737a87ef2e5728773", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xac2znsWB8JUot4M.5bxXP0Q2wyOkZ49lhelp8EU2qAhlGDyZcspAc8UN1nQs4SsEAf", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "zealousb", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Good Looking Ladies To Work As Ushers For A Two Day Summit Coming Up In Major Ci", "text": "Beautiful and Good looking ladies are needed to work as Ushers for a two day summit coming up in Lagos, Abuja,\nContinue Reading...\nhttps://mobiletori.com/web/news/newsdetails?cat_id=1325&user_id=&news_id=25169", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://mobiletori.com/web/news/newsdetails?cat_id=1325&user_id=&news_id=25169"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:21.012+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15095828, "moreResultsAvailable": 15095728, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512640941012&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 293}
