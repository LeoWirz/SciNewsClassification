This year\u2019s edition of the festival\u2019s $10,400 Main Event saw huge turnout that broke several important records in WPT\u2019s history. \nThe tournament attracted a record-breaking 812-person field , becoming the largest ever Five Diamond World Poker Classic Main Event. What is more, it become the largest ever WPT event with a buy-in fee of over $10,000. \nThe great interest in the prestigious tournament generated a prize pool of $7.876 million. The top 81 finishers will receive a payout, min-cashes beginning from $19,691. And the top nine finishers will leave the event with a six-figure payout. \nAs for the winner, they will be awarded the amount of $1,958,065 for their deep run. The second-place finisher will also receive a seven-figure payday. They will collect $1,134,202 upon leaving the record-breaking tournament. \nLas Vegas\u2019 emblematic Bellagio Casino is playing host to the Main Event. By the time Day 2 of play concluded last night at the host venue, there were just 320 players left from the gigantic field . The remaining hopefuls are set to return to the Bellagio today at noon local time to bring themselves closer to the money. However, the money bubble is not likely to burst before Day 4 of the tournament. Day 2\u2019s Chip Leader and Other Notables Still in Contention \nDay 2 of the Main Event was completed with Brandon Meyers as the chip leader. The player actually started the day as the one to lead the survivors from the tournament\u2019s starting flight. He bagged and tagged 388,100 in chips last night. Earlier throughout the day he even passed the 400,000 mark . \nCommenting on his performance last night, the player said that action was going smoothly for him. The player won several key pots, most of which against Ray Qartomy, to cement his chip leader position for the start of Day 3. \nMeyers is a Las Vegas-based poker pro with experience on the felt of more than a decade. The player has accumulated more that $1.2 million over the course of his career . His best live cash came back in July, when he finished 42nd in the WSOP $10,000 Main Event, good for $176,399. If the player maintains his momentum from the past several days, he can almost double his current bankroll. \nFormer WPT champion Daniel Streilitz will enter Day 3 play second in chips with 310,900. Todd Hovenden bagged the third largest stack last night to secure himself with a nice start of Day 3. \nNotables still in contention include defending champion James Romero . The player bested a field of 791 entries last December to win the amount of $1,938,118. He will begin Day 3 of this year\u2019s edition of the tournament with a total of 45,300. J.C. Tran, Gus Hansen, the winner of the first-ever WPT Five Diamond World Poker Classic Main Event, and Darren Elias are too among the popular poker players that will return for Day 3.

"text": "in Other Football News 5 mins ago 7 Views \nMorgan Schneiderlin is determined to revive his Everton career having been one of the few senior players sent to Cyprus for a Europa League fixture that Sam Allardyce will miss. \nAllardyce, appointed as manager only last week, is not in Nicosia for Everton\u2019s dead rubber against Apollon Limassol due to a pre-arranged medical assessment and several key players have remained home, too, given the club\u2019s elimination has already been confirmed. \nWayne Rooney , Gylfi Sigurdsson and Jordan Pickford are among them, with Allardyce conscious of Sunday\u2019s Merseyside derby, and Schneiderlin\u2019s presence on the other side of the continent could be interpreted as a reflection of his place in the Goodison Park pecking order. \nThe 28-year-old French midfielder has not started the previous two fixtures and last month both Schneiderlin and Kevin Mirallas, another also in Cyprus, were understood to have been left out of the squad to face Watford having been involved in a training-ground incident. \nAt the time Schneiderlin denied reports he was sent home due to concerns over his attitude and while once more dismissing that as \u201cfake news\u201d on Wednesday, he did admit he is keen to make a fresh start under Allardyce. \n\u201cFirst I read about it in the newspaper and I was as surprised as I could be because there was no incident,\u201d he said. \u201cI made a statement on my social networks saying it was fake news and it wasn\u2019t true. \n\u201cI want to turn the page. It was not nice for me to see that and it is part of football. I have to deal with it. \n\u201cI want to prove (myself) in every game and of course there is a new manager coming in so it\u2019s a fresh start for everyone. I haven\u2019t had the chance to play the last few games and it is going to be up to me to show what I can do and that I can make a difference to the team. \n\u201cIt needs to be the aim of everybody to show themselves and show that they can play.

And I would guess nothing in Chiang Mai or Northern region.\nI noticed multiple times increased health effects and wound healing when flying on long 18hr flights. But then I read that \"Although aircraft cabins are pressurized, cabin air pressure at cruising altitude is lower than air pressure at sea level.\"\nSo are the health effects from the oxygen concentration and not the pressure? Or something else about the altitude that changes environmental factors?\nCan anyone comment if any relationship that exists between: flying on an airplane VS breathing in pure oxygen from a tank VS hyperbaric chamber?\nAt max altitude (41,000) the 737NG cabin provides a max cabin differential of 8.35psi. Therefore the partial pressure of oxygen in the cabin is equivalent to approximately 8000 feet above sea level. Newer designs such as the B787 and A350 have achieved lower cruising cabin altitudes around 6000 feet. Certain business jets are even better. Any improved health effects you noticed on 18 hour flights are entirely psychosomatic and fanciful, unless wound healing and well being is increased on top of a mountain.

ALARMING! 270,000 Children Living With HIV in Nigerian \u2013 UNICEF. by 10:37:00 in NEWS   The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund ( UNICEF ) has said that at least 270,000 children aged 0 to 14 years were living with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in Nigeria as at 2016. The figure represented the lion share of half of the 540,000 total infected children in West and Central Africa over the same year, News Agency of Nigeria reports. Nigeria also recorded 37,000 new HIV infections among children out of the total of 60,000 new infections in West and Central Africa over the same period, representing 62 per cent of the new infections. The UN children\u2019s agency warned that the West and Central Africa were lagging too far behind the rest of the world in access to HIV treatment and care. The UNICEF Director, West and Central Africa, Ms Marie-Pierre Poirier , in a report released on Tuesday, called for improvement of early diagnosis and access to HIV treatment and care for children. The report said four in five children living with HIV in West and Central Africa were still not receiving life-saving antiretroviral therapy. It warned that AIDS-related deaths among adolescents aged 15 to 19 years were on the rise. \u201cIt is tragic that so many children and adolescents today are not receiving the treatment they need just because they have not been tested,\u201d Poirier said. According to UNICEF, West and Central Africa has the lowest paediatric antiretroviral treatment coverage in the world. The region has only 21 per cent of the 540,000 children (aged 0 to 14 years) living with HIV receiving antiretroviral treatment in 2016 \u2013 compared to 43 per cent globally. \u201cA major cause behind this is the limited capacity of the countries to perform the tests needed for early infant diagnosis of HIV. \u201cWithout knowing a child\u2019s HIV status, his or her family is less likely to seek the treatment that could prevent the tragedy of a child\u2019s death from AIDS-related illnesses. \u201cThe situation is worse among adolescents: the annual number of new HIV infections among those aged 15 to 19 years in the region now exceeds that of children aged 0 to 14 years. \u201cThese new infections occur mostly through unprotected sexual contact and among adolescent girls,\u201d the UN agency warned. \u201cLeaders of the region have endorsed a Catch-Up plan aiming to triple the number of people on treatment in the region \u2013 including children \u2013 by the end of 2018, the key issue now is to accelerate implementation. \u201cCountries should urgently put in place more effective strategies for early infant diagnosis of HIV, and start reducing inequity in children\u2019s access to treatment,\u201d Luiz Loures, the Deputy Executive Director of the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) said. Equally concerning, according to Step Up the Pace: Towards an AIDS-free, a recently released UNICEF report, is that the region has seen a 35 per cent rise in the annual number of AIDS-related deaths among adolescents aged 15 to 19 years. This was the only age group in which the number of AIDS-related deaths increased between 2010 and 2016. \u201cWith the region\u2019s youth population expected to grow significantly within the coming decades, especially in countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Nigeria. \u201cThe numbers of children and adolescents becoming infected with HIV and dying from AIDS is likely to remain high, unless the HIV response \u2013 both prevention and treatment \u2013 improves dramatically,\u201d the report warned. To overcome these hurdles, the report called for key strategies to enable countries accelerate efforts to curb the spread of the disease. In particular, it proposed a differentiated HIV response focusing on unique epidemiological and local contexts in each country and community. It also proposed the integration of HIV services into key social services including health, education and protection. According to the report, community ownership and local governance of the HIV response including working with families to help reduce stigma, access prevention and treatment. The others are investment in innovations to remove barriers to diagnostic and biomedical approaches such as point of care diagnostics, HIV self-testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis.

By 0 18 \nYou are trying to build your practice and you know that online marketing is the key to the future. You\u2019ve tried social media posts \nyoutube videos, blog posts, and none of them seem to really move the needle. You have internet advertising, SEO, Facebook gurus bugging you on the phone, \nYou may even have paid them some money with little to no effect. \nWhat\u2019s going on? What are you doing wrong? \nThere is a core failure at the root of all these efforts. These are all TACTICS and tactics without an effective strategy are doomed. \nSTRATEGY you ask? The feared word STRATEGY, that vague, expensive sounding money pit that consultants like to throw at you when they are asking for money without any indication of how you are going to get a return on your investment? \nYES! Thats what I am telling you. You need strategy. \nSo how do we get you strategy? Well its not really all that mysterious. And this blog post is going to lay it all out for you in a nutshell, so you can build one yourself (or yes hire me to guide you). \nThe elements of a chiropractic marketing strategy are not all that complicated. They consist of: Identifying Your Story & Your WHY Defining your target Audience. (Optional) Building your Marketing Story \nThe Power of WHY in your Marketing \n\u201cYou can only become truly accomplished at something you love. Don\u2019t make money your goal. Instead pursue the things you love doing, and then do them so well that people can\u2019t take their eyes off of you.\u201d \u2014 Maya Angelou \nYour \u201cwhy\u201d makes a difference. It makes a difference in your life, and it makes a difference to the people serve. Surveys of high performing leaders have proven that aligning with your passion makes you a forceful achiever. \nYour patients want someone who they can believe in. When your patients see how much you love to heal, not only will they trust you, but they\u2019ll support your passion by giving you their business. \nYour story is your connection to your core principles. Don\u2019t compromise your integrity as you grow or you\u2019ll create doubt in your customer and sabotage the authenticity of your marketing. \nI have a list of questions to help you write the \u201cWhy\u201d for your marketing. Answer as many of these questions as you can: What would I do if I had all the money I needed? What did I do as a child that made me feel good? When people talked me out of a career. What was that career, do you remember? What do I think I am a genius at? What makes me feel good, no long how long I do it for? What core beliefs are the most important to me? What would I do if I was guaranteed success? What is the underlying belief that drives me in my practice? \nI encourage you to take some time with these questions. Write down the \u201ceasy\u201d answer like \u201cI would move to Bora Bora and do nothing\u201d. Then think about what you would do after that. Put these questions in the context of a mission that will make you feel good. \nThe goal is to write down these answers until one of them jumps out with an obvious trigger to your WHY. It may have a ring to it, or it evokes a strong physical response in your body. It may explain EXACTLY why you do what you do in an instant. \nYour WHY is critical to your marketing because it gives you the passion to spread your message, no matter the cost. It gives your marketing the authenticity it needs to connect with your audience. \nNow that we have our WHY we can use it to help us find our Ideal patient. Our Ideal Patient is someone whom your WHY can help. It is someone who will resonate with your WHY. It is someone who will understand, appreciate, and benefit from our WHY. \n2. Find your \u201cHERO\u201d Patient (AKA your \u201cIdeal\u201d Patient) in 3 Steps \nNo matter what type of chiropractic specialty you follow your focus on your ideal patient is critical to a thriving practice. You need to be understand who is your ideal patient, and who is not. And you need to understand the ideal clients thoughts and emotions. \nThe good news is when you have those figured out, finding new clients will go from being a struggle to simple. \nStep 1: Identify your ideal patient. \nThis means creating a patient profile with identical or very similar: health problems marriage status, income, education, occupation, etc\u2026 pain \nOnce you do that give this fictional profile a name, if possible get an artist to draw him. \nThis is your ideal client in the flesh. In the marketing industry we call it an \u201cAvatar\u201d. Its a symbolic person who fits the profile of your actual ideal clients. \nHaving this profile is the ONLY way you are going to find out what makes your client tick. You need an individual in order to get inside his head and find out what will move him to action. If you select an ideal patient who is too general the motivation factors will simply be two different between people to have an effective marketing campaign. \nStep 2: Get to know them. \nOnce you know who your ideal client is we need to get inside their heads. We will develop a profile that identifies what will move them to action, what will cause them to seek out your treatments, what will motivate them to trust you with their healthcare. You have to understand the emotional pain they are experiencing if you want to be heard by them. \nThe key to marketing is \u201cWIIFM\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s In It For Me\u201d. That is what the patient cares about, and we have to create marketing material that breaks through all the media and content clutter we all see each day. \nHere are some questions to help us get inside the head of our Heroes. \nYou can either ask them, or answer the questions yourself based on your knowledge of conversations with them. \nOnce you can visualize your ideal patients, the next step is to get into their heads. Basically, you have to think like them if you ever hope to reach them on a level that they understand. In an effort to help with this, here are some questions you will want to answer: What does he/she worry about What does he/she believe about their medical condition? What does he/she dream about for their life? What\u2019s currently holding them back from that dream? What\u2019s their biggest struggle? What makes him or her the happiest? What goes through their head as they consider working with you or buying your products? What are their biggest worries or concerns? What are the most important things in life to them (rank them) \nStep 3: Find out WHERE they hang out. \nNow that we know who they are and what moves them we need to find where they spend their attention. We do this so that we can put marketing content in the right places for our ideal clients to see and act on it. \nWe can do this much as we find out what they care about. Ask them, find out what magazines, websites, books they read. Find out where the brick and mortar places they visit, like gyms, doctor offices, physical therapists, retirement communities, etc. Not only can you place your marketing material in these places, but you can ask the managers of these places to help promote you. \nIts also important to find out where they DON\u2019T hang out. For example, if they don\u2019t hang out on Facebook, then you can save a bunch of money by not advertising on that platform. \nAgain, you can ask them where they hang out in casual conversation, or just make note of it when you see them around town. If there is a special place where they all hang out , make a note of it. You can also find out where they hang out by asking your current clients to fill out a survey. 4. (Optional) Building your Marketing Story \nAt this point you\u2019ve discovered your Why. You know who your Ideal Customer (Hero) is and you know what their pain points are. Honestly this is enough for most practices, especially if you are starting up. \nTake what you\u2019ve learned here and put it into your Emails, your website, your Facebook campaigns, Google Adwords. Then pay for or hustle up some traffic for all this new content you\u2019ve created. I PROMISE your customer prospect numbers will skyrocket. \nBut there is one last part. This is where you can put it all together to build a long term BRAND that will grow your business by presenting cohesive stories that resonate with your audience. \nThis last \u201cextra credit\u201d is called STORY. Stories are what people attach to, its how we communicate as a culture, and when you put your content into a compelling story with a beginning a middle, and an end, you\u2019ll capture people\u2019s attention, like never before. \nThe formula for a powerful story is about the CUSTOMER Hero, its not about you. The formula essence is simple: A Hero (Patient) ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "james jordan",

Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box - although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action. \n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" \nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. \nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" \nTrump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \n\"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\"  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "catherine lucey", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron david miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilan goldenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill galston", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for a new american security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east security program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faith and freedom coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:50:17.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dfeeac3d744e421d075c5a5a2a44338eb6afae08", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_dlGaiyHn9kDUa_u6LiPoacx9EhguERruduwRn.rLi8pF1JeT3oVkFUTXBkimsy_OGDrDjkfMxE5VvPyFTnVfd", "site_full": "www.aldeer.com", "site": "aldeer.com", "site_section": "http://www.aldeer.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=postlist&Board=10", "site_categories": ["hunting_shooting", "sports"], "section_title": "Aldeer Classifieds - Aldeer", "title": "Browning Gold Hunter", "title_full": "Browning Gold Hunter - Aldeer", "published": "2017-12-02T02:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.013, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "744882cb864dd26b0edbebbacd104dd60b9ad14d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_dlGaiyHn9kDUa_u6LiPoacx9EhguERruduwRn.rLi8pF1JeT3oVkFUTXBkimsy_OGDrDjkfMxE_uoVoUn.XzxdydBQYiSKo6P7SGZJUhZsA--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "MANGLER", "published": "2017-12-06T14:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Price drop 500 firm.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:50:17.040+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dfeeac3d744e421d075c5a5a2a44338eb6afae08", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_dlGaiyHn9kDUa_u6LiPoacx9EhguERruduwRn.rLi8pF1JeT3oVkFUTXBkimsy_OGDrDjkfMxE5VvPyFTnVfd", "site_full": "www.aldeer.com", "site": "aldeer.com", "site_section": "http://www.aldeer.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=postlist&Board=10", "site_categories": ["hunting_shooting", "sports"], "section_title": "Aldeer Classifieds - Aldeer", "title": "Browning Gold Hunter", "title_full": "Browning Gold Hunter - Aldeer", "published": "2017-12-02T02:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.013, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dfeeac3d744e421d075c5a5a2a44338eb6afae08", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_dlGaiyHn9kDUa_u6LiPoacx9EhguERruduwRn.rLi8pF1JeT3oVkFUTXBkimsy_OGDrDjkfMxE5VvPyFTnVfd", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MANGLER", "published": "2017-12-02T02:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "Browning Gold Hunter", "text": "This gun is in like new condition.

Defying dire, worldwide warnings, President Donald Trump on Wednesday broke with decades ... Updated: Thursday,   \nJERUSALEM (AP) - The Latest on the fallout from President Donald Trump's recognition   (all times local): \n11:35 a.m. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says President Donald Trump \"bound himself forever\" to the history of Jerusalem by recognizing the city as Israel's capital. \nNetanyahu claimed other states are considering following the U.S. lead and recognizing Jerusalem. He spoke on Thursday at the Foreign Ministry. \nNetanyahu says that \"we are already in contact with other states that will make a similar recognition.\" \nHe says the \"time has come\" and expressed confidence that others will follow suit and move their embassies to Jerusalem. \nMeanwhile, the Israeli military said it will be deploying additional troops to the West Bank ahead of Friday, when mass Palestinian protests are anticipated in response to Trump's move. \nThe army statement on Thursday says it will deploy several battalions to the territory while other troops have been put on alert to address \"possible developments.\" \nPalestinians went on strike across the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip on Thursday and protests are expected on Friday after midday prayers. \n___ \n11:25 a.m. \nThe top leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas is calling for a new uprising against Israel in the wake of President Donald Trump's recognition  . \nIsmail Haniyeh spoke to his followers in the Gaza Strip on Thursday and called the U.S. decision an \"aggression on our people and a war on our sanctuaries.\" \nHe says the uprising should begin Friday, the Muslim holy day. \nHaniyeh then added: \"We want the uprising to last and continue to let Trump and the occupation regret this decision.\" \nHamas killed hundreds of Israelis during an armed uprising in the early 2000s. But Hamas' ability to carry out attacks is more limited. Israel has imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip, and many of Hamas' supporters in the West Bank have been arrested. \nEven so, Hamas possesses a large arsenal of rockets in Gaza capable of striking many areas in Israel. \n___ \n10:30 a.m. \nSaudi Arabia's royal court, led by King Salman and his powerful son, are condemning the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nIt's a rare public rebuke by the royal court of U.S. ally and President Donald Trump. \nSaudi Arabia, a regional powerhouse that could help the White House push through a Middle East settlement, said on Thursday the kingdom had already warned against this step and \"continues to express its deep regret at the U.S. administration's decision,\" describing it \"unjustified and irresponsible.\" \nTrump's move puts the Sunni nation in a bind. The kingdom, particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. \nU.S. Embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa have warned American citizens of possible protests as a result of Trump's decision. \n___ \n9:40 a.m. \nSchools and shops are closed in the West Bank, as Palestinians are protesting President Donald Trump's recognition of contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nPolitical groups have called for protest marches in West Bank town centers at noon on Thursday. \nTrump's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. \nThe Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. In recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Trump was seen as siding with Israel which claims the entire city. \n___ \n9:30 a.m. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is accusing his American counterpart of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" by declaring the divided holy city  . \nErdogan also compared President Donald Trump to a \"blender\" that is stirring up trouble in the region. \nThe Turkish leader said, addressing Trump: \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it.\" \nErdogan added that \"political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace.\" \nHe also said: \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right,' he is mistaken.\" \nErdogan spoke to a group of workers on Thursday who had gathered at Ankara's airport, before he departed for an official visit to Greece. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nPalestinians, Israelis and the wider Middle East are bracing for the fallout after President Donald Trump's seismic shift in recognizing the bitterly contested Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was to travel to Jordan on Thursday to meet with King Abdullah II. The monarch is seen as Abbas' closest Arab ally, and the two leaders might try to coordinate a response to Trump's policy change. \nIn Wednesday's move, Trump defied worldwide warnings and insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, describing his decision as merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. \nTrump also said the United States would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable for that.

Panobinostat solubility dmso Thirty-six intervention features were included in the analysis, of which 11 were associated with a positive rate difference (see Table 2). Refer to the online supplemental data for more information on percent success rate differences (Table 3) and analysis of features within each individual outcome (Tables 4\u20137). DSME programs are complex interventions with various content and delivery components necessary for the education and skills building required for diabetes self-management. However, limited efforts have been made to investigate which intervention features are associated with a positive outcome, specifically for women of diverse ethnic backgrounds. Studies mainly concentrated on glycemic control (i.e., HbA1c levels) (10 studies) or anthropometric outcomes (11 studies), as opposed to behavioral outcomes such as diet (5 studies) and physical Ion Channel Ligand Library activity (5 studies). Since \nbehavioral outcomes strongly reflect the lifestyle changes needed to achieve the desirable metabolic outcomes [18] and [44], it is imperative to understand how intervention features affect these intermediary outcomes as well. Only five (of 38) intervention features had positive success rate differences for at least three of the outcomes examined in this review: hospital-based intervention setting; group intervention format; situational problem-solving; high intensity (10 or more intervention sessions); and incorporating dietitians as interventionists. Because of their broad influence, we recommend the features \nthat demonstrate success across multiple outcomes in DSME programming for the populations of interest. Many of these features are also recommended in DSME programming for the general population by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA). Specifically, group programming and situational Succinyl-CoA problem-solving are recommended by both national organizations [45] and [45], as these features are shown to be effective in improving HbA1c outcomes [46]. Furthermore, the CDA recommends nutritional counseling of clients with diabetes by a dietitian, either one-on-one or in small group settings, to lower HbA1c levels [45]. A recent study supports this recommendation; it found that visits by a dietitian are associated with lower hospitalization rates and charges in persons of varied cultural backgrounds compared to diabetes classes and one-on-one visits from non-dietitian health professionals [47]. Our analysis suggests that incorporating dietitians has positive success rate differences on anthropometrics, and physical activity, in addition to HbA1c. We are unsure why hospital-based interventions appear more successful across outcomes. This entry was posted in Uncategorized by admin . Bookmark the permalink .

Wilfrid Sellars was ambivalent as to the prospects of deriving the \u201creality\u2026of an ethical community consisting of all rational beings\u201d (SM 7.XX.144/p. 225), and hence vindicating the moral point of view\u2014and particularly ambivalent that the moral point of view could be rationally justified vis-\u00e0-vis rational egoism (RE). Sellars\u2019s ambivalence reflects a common set of assumptions in analytic philosophy: either (a) that the moral point of view stands in opposition to self-interest, or (b) that the moral point of view must be justified by appeal to self-interest. I think the prospects are rosier than he anticipated, and set out to prove the reality of this community\u2014and hence to vindicate the moral point of view. I argue that rational egoism (RE) cannot be established just by considering the nature of practical reason. Nor does RE embody the most plausible theory of the good: an agent cannot consistently hold that her welfare is the only good (for her). I will argue that central elements of rational agency are constituted by collective attitudes, which essentially depend on the community, its practices, and its attitudes. Thus, rational agency itself cannot be understood apart from the community.

Democrats unloaded on Gov. Chris Sununu after he told reporters Wednesday that he has \u201czero tolerance\u201d for sexual misconduct by public officials. And Republicans accused Sen. Maggie Hassan of weeks of stalling before calling on Sen. Al Franken to resign. \nShortly after Hassan joined fellow Democratic U.S. senators in calling for Franken\u2019s resignation amid mounting reports of misconduct, Sununu was questioned about Republican Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore.
