[aImage] [caption] \nConservative MP for Waveney, Peter Aldous, will introduce the Bill, which comes as a response to the UK construction industry\u2019s financial crisis, with some contractors in severe financial distress. \nCash retentions are ostensibly withheld as security in case a firm fails to return to rectify non-compliant work. However, research commissioned by the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has revealed that the monies are primarily withheld to bolster the working capital of the party withholding them. \nFurthermore, the practice gives rise to widespread abuse with the monies being withheld for three or more years. The research also showed that over a three year period, \u00a37.8 billion worth of retentions were left outstanding. \nMr Aldous said that he was concerned about the impact on SMEs: \u201cI have been aware of retentions as an issue for a while, and with construction being a tough industry and uncertainty surrounding many aspects of the economy, small businesses need as much support as possible. There are a number of specialist engineering firms in Waveney, and what this Bill aims to do is to protect them and their livelihoods as well as 280,000 other construction SMEs nationwide. \n\u201cOver the past three years, \u00a3700 million worth of retention payments to small businesses were lost due to the insolvency of a client, and if a small business suffers from an upstream insolvency of this kind, they are punished twice: firstly with the loss of work, and secondly with the loss of retention money. We therefore need action on this before more millions are lost. \n\u201cSMEs are the backbone of the UK economy, which is why they need support and protection. This Bill is not about abolishing payment retentions; it is about making sure that people\u2019s money is safe so that businesses can grow and invest in their future.\u201d \nBacking the introduction of the Bill, SEC Group chief executive Professor Rudi Klein stated: \u201cI\u2019m very grateful to Peter Aldous for initiating this. All that is required is mutuality of security. If cash retentions are required as a form of security, there must also be security for the cash, as exists in many other countries around the world.\u201d \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peter aldous", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aldous", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rudi klein", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bill latest news sec group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department for business, energy & industrial strategy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waveney", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:34.038+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cb874d15df425468bf68e446b3ae7d1915478b50", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZlkNBx_DtAun0EEpnJRi4Fa", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/int/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/int/ - International - 4chan", "title": "What is our relationship like?", "title_full": "/int/ - What is our relationship like?

For most people this is not due to a lack of initial motivation. As time passes we tend to forget about our goals. There are ways you can keep up your motivation and be successful. Continue reading this article to learn the secret to keeping weight off.\nYou should first determine what your weight loss goals are. Is it your desire to wear clothes in a specific size? Do you know how much weight you want to lose? Is your goal to simply get in shape and live a healthier life?\nEvery week you should keep track of your weight loss. It is important to keep track of every single thing you eat. Detailing what you have eaten in a written format allows you to take responsibility for your decisions. You will be inspired to make healthier decisions on what you choose to consume.\nAllowing yourself to become overly hungry is a huge mistake. It is hard to control what you are eating when you are really hungry. Decide what you are going to eat ahead of time, and take snacks with you to eat when temptation strikes. Pack your own lunch whenever you can. By packing a lunch, you are saving money and avoiding potentially bad choices while at work or school.\nFor your weight loss plan, be sure that you have a good work out plan as well as a healthy diet. For steady weight loss, try a combination of diet and exercise. You can also have fun by doing activities that involve exercise. Get a friend to exercise with you if you don\u2019t have the willpower to exercise on your own. Have your family join you for some exercise. Before you know it, you will have put in a good workout without ever having to call it exercise!\nIf all you have in the house is junk food, it should be no surprise that you reach for it first when you are hungry. However, following the same logic, we can determine that when the refrigerator is full of healthy, nutritious snacks, then that is what you will reach for. Stock your pantry with lots of healthy alternatives to junk food, such as veggies, fruits, and healthy, low-fat snack foods. The simplest way to cut back on your junk food consumption is to not buy it at all. Once you replace the junk food with healthier options, then you\u2019ll be more likely to make healthy food choices. \nHaving other people around you that can help support you, and help keep you motivated, is a valuable asset when it comes to losing weight. Your friends can encourage you when you feel like you have hit rock bottom and just can\u2019t go any further. Communicate your needs whenever your motivation starts to wane, and you will be better equipped to achieve your objectives.\n\nClick Read This Story ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:36.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6e52c79bd888645296db6fe7c91f4651ff074d5d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9pCWBam6bguFZYUSIjP5RYMswlKEK4mNbXQCmdmEuvRPlP4PgCZFqJDT1ohdj_zi8-", "site_full": "www.heavyequipmentguide.ca", "site": "heavyequipmentguide.ca", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "3H50TI - Diesel Engine - Heavy Equipment Guide", "title_full": "3H50TI - Diesel Engine - Heavy Equipment Guide", "published": "2017-11-29T19:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.138, "main_image": "http://www.heavyequipmentguide.ca/files/slides/locale_image/medium/0132/32813_en_70d76_35556_20160307-8156-3h50ti-web.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6e52c79bd888645296db6fe7c91f4651ff074d5d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9pCWBam6bguFZYUSIjP5RYMswlKEK4mNbXQCmdmEuvRPlP4PgCZFqJDT1ohdj_zi8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-11-29T19:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "3H50TI - Diesel Engine - Heavy Equipment Guide", "text": "3H50TI Diesel Engine \nSince beginning of 2014 a new engine family extends the Hatz product portfolio: The H-series.

Together, the agencies gathered feedback from patient, scientific, and drug development communities to develop \u201c Gaucher disease: A strategic collaborative approach from EMA and FDA \u200b.\u201d \nThe document was released today as an FDA guidance, using Gaucher disease as a model. However, the described approach could be extended to other rare pediatric diseases, according to the FDA. \n\u201c The proposed approach, if adopted by sponsors, has the potential to ultimately help speed products to market by minimizing the time it takes to conduct drug studies \u200b,\u201d FDA trade press officer Jeremy Kahn told Outsourcing-Pharma.com. \n\u201c Having an approach agreed upon by FDA and European regulators can facilitate collaboration among study sponsors and regulators and get studies started in a time efficient manner \u200b,\u201d he added. \nAs Kahn explained, the proposed strategy includes two elements: \u201c the use of statistical models and simulations that may eliminate the need for certain clinical studies and the development of multi-arm, multi-sponsor clinical trials that reduce the total number of patients needed for placebo control groups \u200b.\u201d \nThe FDA previously encouraged the use of modeling and simulation \u200b as it unveiled its plans to implement aspects of the 21 st \u200b Century Cures Act. \nThe FDA is seeking comments on the draft guidance for 60 days.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "melissa fassbender email", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "outsourcing-pharma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeremy kahn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kahn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ema", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european medicines agency", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:37.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f6f474e9f918e9a445666c602264bafab621b3ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg80FY9LQQ34c_DGgapqa1GYGA5GiNiNZYq3GiBChvo_o1MWf3TwqQDSsB2Y1DSlki2zXFImXgL0uw--", "site_full": "www.10mm-wargaming.com", "site": "10mm-wargaming.com", "site_section": "http://www.10mm-wargaming.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "10mm Wargaming", "title": "Slingshot 315", "title_full": "Slingshot 315", "published": "2017-12-07T11:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7sZVJ47bj6c/WikKIW1olII/AAAAAAACXOA/nVMNrpLJBPQp76Hv4fM_JJ2P1KGuVOiUQCLcBGAs/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/Slingshot-315.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f6f474e9f918e9a445666c602264bafab621b3ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg80FY9LQQ34c_DGgapqa1GYGA5GiNiNZYq3GiBChvo_o1MWf3TwqQDSsB2Y1DSlki2zXFImXgL0uw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "noreply@blogger.com (Andrew Bruce)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "Slingshot 315", "text": "10mm Wargaming Welcome to my world of 10mm Wargaming I am intending to use these pages to document my ongoing wargaming projects, and the various rules i use.

During his visit, Gandhi also addressed a huge rally in the city's Patidar strongholds - Varachha and Katargam. \n\nOn December 3, quota agitation leader Hardik Patel led a mega road show in Varachha. Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani led the BJP 's road show in Majura area the same day. \n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi last month addressed a rally at Kadodara, located on the city's outskirts. \n\nThe Congress is hoping to snatch some seats from the BJP this time by capitalising on the 'anger' factor of Patidars and the traders. \n\nOn the other side, the BJP is confident of retaining its bastion, as its leaders claim the 'ground reality' is different from what the Congress is projecting. \n\nOut of the total 12 constituencies in Surat city, nearly half of the seats - Varachha Road, Kamrej, Katargam, Karanj, Olpad and Udhna - have a concentrated population of Patidars, who mostly migrated here from Saurashtra. \n\nThe remaining six seats are - Surat-East, Surat-North, Surat-West, Choryasi, Limbayat and Majura. \n\nTo some extent, Surat-North and Majura seats also have a significant population of Patidars, who are into various businesses, including diamond cutting, polishing, trading and in different trades associated with textiles. \n\nThe city has been a bastion of the BJP since long. \n\nBut, the political scenario in this bustling business hub seems to have changed after Hardik Patel started the agitation to get reservation for his community two years back. \n\nAt that time, Surat witnessed large scale violence and arson, mostly in Varachha and adjoining areas. \n\nOut of the two sedition cases lodged against Hardik, one was registered in Surat. Since then, the Hardik-led agitating body - Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti ( PAAS ) - is up in arms against the ruling BJP and has vowed to defeat it. \n\nNotably, BJP president Amit Shah had to cut short his speech at a function in Varachha area in September when some PAAS agitators created chaos by shouting slogans and throwing chairs. \n\nNow, in an apparent bid to thwart the anti-incumbency factor following the Patidar 'anger', the BJP has dropped six of its sitting MLAs - from Kamrej, Surat-East, Surat-North, Karanj, Udhna and Katargam seats. \n\nThese leaders include sitting MLA of Katargam, Nanu Vanani, who is a minister in the Rupani government. \n\nOut of the nearly 1.98 lakh voters of Varachha Road seat, the Patidars are in the driving seat with their number being over 1.5 lakh. \n\nIn Kamrej, where the total electorate is about 4.28 lakh, the Patidars alone account for over two lakh. \n\nIn Katargam, having around 2.77 voters, the Patidars are in a dominating position with over 1.18 lakh electorate. \n\nBesides the 'angry' Patidars and traders, there are various other factors which could breach the hull of BJP's ship in this coastal city. \n\nSince a large population, mostly Patels, of this city belongs to Saurashtra region, the agrarian crisis back home could also add fuel into their 'anger' here, Surat city Congress president Hasmukh Desai said. \n\n\"Many decades back, Patels and other communities from Saurashtra region started settling here. Since they still own agricultural land back home, they are holding the BJP government responsible for their dwindling farm income. It is possible that their anger could reflect in the voting here,\" Desai said. \n\nApart from Patidars, the Congress is also banking on small traders and entrepreneurs whose businesses were claimed to have been hit by demonetisation and the implementation of GST by the BJP-led government at the Centre. \n\nIn July, the textile traders of Surat city called a massive strike against the GST. The Congress was quick to take up the issue and party vice president Rahul Gandhi held two back-to-back visits last month. \n\n\"On one side we are getting full support from the Patidars, while on the other the trading community and the shopkeepers, who are spread across the city, are seeing a ray of hope in Congress after Gandhi's visit. All the factors are in our favour,\" Desai claimed. \n\nHowever, the BJP discarded the argument, claiming that the ground reality is totally different. \n\n\"Though traders were unhappy initially, they now understand the benefits of GST. This so-called anger will never convert into votes. If the people were still against us, then why so many had turned up for the chief minister's rally?\" BJP's sitting MLA from Majura, Harsh Sanghvi, asked. \n\nMeanwhile, the PAAS members have already hit the streets in the Patidar-dominated areas to convince people not to vote for the BJP. \n\nAccording to PAAS convener for Surat, Dharmik Malavia, they have set a target of defeating the BJP on at least five seats - Varachha Road, Karanj, Kamrej, Olpad and Surat-North. \n\n\"When we tell people do not vote for the BJP, it implies that vote for Congress if you want to uproot the party which committed atrocities on us,\" Malavia said. \n\n\"The people are in our support and the BJP candidates are finding it difficult to even enter into the Patidar societies for canvassing,\" he claimed. \n\nThe 182-member Gujarat Assembly will go to the polls in two phases -- on December 9 and 14 -- and the counting of votes will be taken up on December 18.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "malavia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narendra modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hardik patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gandhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hardik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rahul gandhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patidar anamat andolan samiti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amit shah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "desai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dharmik malavia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vijay rupani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nanu vanani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hasmukh desai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harsh sanghvi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olpad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rupani", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "mla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gujarat assembly", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "surat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmedabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "majura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "varachha road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saurashtra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patidar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gujarat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kamrej", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surat-north", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmedabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karanj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patidars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "limbayat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kadodara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "udhna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "varachha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katargam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "choryasi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olpad", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:38.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "334f1b2fd5af5afe57923a81ca58af977b9e14ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWCcaE8CyNtfejJaDlg2zatU_DHeu.LFbU_h.ONQEJyveID9scHurCvp6D2Nt.5OKtIeU5nVUadWoFfHRBNDNyHPyiGRPOYlzHpXf09kDkLkfDzmk1C5BTXjZR0nf07qX43OZx6xT2HRY-", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-womens-flat-shoes/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Flat Shoes -

But have there been other fights? The Sports and Social Bar in Parliament is notoriously filled with young Parliamentary aides and older House of Commons pass holders Where is Parliament\u2019s Sports and Social Club Bar? \nThe dingy bar is close to the Peers\u2019 Inner Court in Parliament\u2019s basement. \nThe members only \u201cman cave\u201d can also be accessed through a door and down the stairs from the corner of Central Lobby. \nA plate hanging on one of the walls warns, \u201cWhat happens here stays here!

How many fights have taken place there? \nThere have been calls for the bar to be closed as its drinking culture is said to have fulled a number of assaults. \nOn December 7, a fight broke out between two male parliamentary staffers. \nThe bust-up started inside the bar, before it spilled into the alleyway, close to nearby bins. \nA 57 year old was arrested on suspicion of GBH, and a 64 year old was taken to hospital. \nWitnesses claim one male was glassed in the face. \nBut it has been the only recently reported fight to have escalated to such an extent, police were called. \nIn 2013, former MP Eric Joyce was arrested on suspicion of assault following a v iolent frackas. \nBut last month, a barmaid who worked at the club for nearly four years claimed she was routinely preyed upon by MPs. Dan Charity - The Sun 3 Alice Bailey worked as a bar manager at Parliament\u2019s notorious Sports and Social Bar \nAlice Bailey told The Sun : \u201cThey fancied their chances because I was just a young barmaid and in their minds they were very important people who presumed I would be available.\u201d \nIn a bid to control rowdy behaviour, the House of Lords took back control of the bar , after it was previously owned by an outside company. \nN ew restrictions on guests and opening hours were also introduced, as all other Parliamentary boozers shut at 9pm. \nAndrea Leadsom, the Leader of the Commons, said: \u201cThere should be no place here on the estate, or in our constituency offices, where people can be abused or their allegations not taken seriously.\u201d MOST READ NEWS Dad and daughter murdered 'over gambling win' were strangled 'WON'T YOU FLY MY SLEIGH' This is how many reindeer does Santa has and what they are called SHOCK DELAY Mum whose baby stopped breathing told to 'sit down and wait turn' at A&E GET A VROOM!
