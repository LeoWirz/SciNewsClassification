For Trump, the proclamation was an important way to make good on a pledge to his political base, which includes evangelical Christians and pro-Israel Republicans eager for such a move. \"While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver,\" the president declared Wednesday in announcing his decision. \"Today, I am delivering.\" Those were words to savor for a president who's been frustrated to see a number of key campaign pledges stalled or slowed - sometimes by a bitterly divided Congress, some by larger national or international concerns. Repealing the Obama era health care law is a promise unfulfilled, much to Trump's frustration. Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. The president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. On Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box - although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. Steve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. Observers were divided on how to score the president's action. \"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" But Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" A host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. But after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. An email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" Critics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. Aaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" Trump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" The president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. During a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" Trump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "catherine lucey associated", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron david miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilan goldenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill galston", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east security program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faith and freedom coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:40.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "06264226bf27fa3d5cec701374e6005f2465f17d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ50HWkEALmJMhgrQ5d93EilL3B29ELNT2tB5Eehjds8T5hCaP4TNQc3h92s5XZ0BiyDzYRgiQOzA--", "site_full": "thefiringline.com", "site": "thefiringline.com", "site_section": "https://thefiringline.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=9", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Handloading, Reloading, and Bullet Casting -

It was a deception. Philippe Coutinho had his first hat-trick for the club. The players of Spartak Moscow looked in need of smelling salts and the only slight oddity was that it took until the 86th minute before Mohamed Salah, Liverpool\u2019s leading marksman, added his name to an already extensive scoresheet. By that stage Sadio Man\u00e9 had scored twice. Roberto Firmino added the other in that early blitz when  Liverpool  scored three times inside the opening 19 minutes and there was another statistic that made Klopp beam proudly. No other English team had ever qualified from the Champions League group stages with so many goals \u2013 23 from six games. Not even the great Barcelona and Real Madrid sides had accumulated these numbers. Paris Saint\u2011Germain, who scored 25 times to qualify this season, are the only side ever to do better. Liverpool will find out their prize, as group winners, in the draw on Monday, though first there is the small matter of a Merseyside derby. Everton might be sturdier opponents now Sam Allardyce has been parachuted in but, on this evidence, Klopp\u2019s team will take some stopping. Coutinho, in particular, looked irresistible. Wearing the captain\u2019s armband on a night when Jordan Henderson was relegated to the bench, the Brazilian has been directly involved in 15 goals in his past 11 appearances, scoring nine and setting up another six. The only downside for Liverpool was the first-half injury to Alberto Moreno and the fact Emre Can will be suspended from the opening leg of their last-16 match because of the yellow card he received for an early challenge on Z\u00e9 Lu\u00eds. Can went into the match knowing a booking would make him ineligible and it was strange, in such a one-sided contest, he felt it necessary to lunge in that way. That apart, Liverpool can reflect on a hugely satisfying evening and it would have felt slightly impudent to point out that not even the most optimistic Kopite can expect Everton to defend as generously as the team who are fourth in the Russian Premier League. Georgi Dzhikiya\u2019s bewildering challenge on Salah, four minutes in, set the tone, presenting Coutinho with the chance to open the scoring from the penalty spot, and the same Spartak defender carelessly lost the ball to Man\u00e9 in the buildup to Firmino making it 3-0. In between, Liverpool\u2019s quick, incisive passing had carved open the visiting defence for Coutinho\u2019s second and thereafter it was difficult to keep count of the scoring opportunities. Liverpool might not have just emulated the Besiktas score \u2013 they had enough chances, without exaggeration, to inflict the damage that Stromsgodset endured here in 1974, on the wrong end of an 11-0 whipping in the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup. This was also the night when Coutinho identified himself as the club\u2019s new penalty-taker, ending a difficult run during which Firmino, Salah and James Milner, twice, have failed to convert from 12 yards during games at Anfield in 2017. Yet the game will be remembered for the stylish, attacking football from Liverpool once they had realised their passage to the next stage was not in danger. The move for Coutinho\u2019s second goal was particularly illuminating, with Salah and Firmino prominently involved, and there was an even more beguiling exchange of passes later in the first half, spoiled only by Man\u00e9\u2019s wild shot. Firmino\u2019s expertly taken finish, after a lucky ricochet off a Russian defender, demonstrated his own high confidence and Liverpool\u2019s attacking quartet never eased off once the game had become a rout. The outstanding goal came two minutes into the second half when Milner, who had replaced Moreno, sent over a cross from the left and Man\u00e9 smashed in a volley with so much power it might have done serious damage to someone in the Kop had it not rocketed into the roof of the net. Coutinho\u2019s hat-trick goal came via a deflection off Salvatore Bocchetti and, with 40 minutes still to play, Liverpool were 5-0 up, closing in on their record win in this competition. They could not quite get there but it was a close-run thing. The substitute Daniel Sturridge set up Man\u00e9 to poke in the sixth goal. Salah rammed in the next one for his 18th goal of the season and Liverpool freewheeled into the knockout stages for the first time since 2009. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "j\u00fcrgen klopp", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "liverpool", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:40.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "447a3b920b40102a4ee09fcd63f77ea77a92787e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqIBRdCDNqED82VwYLDn_1XFN9rRPeDOZvrW7280w4hLzgrgXA81CwAZyNc9V2N6oWuDEs4OYq3crxdTBvh7Uabg--", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/politics/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Politics links", "title": "(9829974) White is not a shared ethnic identity", "title_full": "FARK.com: (9829974) White is not a shared ethnic identity", "published": "2017-12-07T05:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 102, "participants_count": 95, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "http://img.fark.net/images/cache/orig/E/EJ/fark_EJEldwAs4WOjqLmndzlwGsZSIgU.jpg?t=3LoRk8CqeckQiETlCpiTPA&amp;f=1512968400", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3382, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "015a6e5716947fba98ddeb5ebf6f23c12e891714", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqIBRdCDNqED82VwYLDn_1XFN9rRPeDOZvrW7280w4hLzgrgXA81CwAZyNc9V2N6oWuDEs4OYq3cpGUGKnfaAfaFju8BUnGstV", "ord_in_thread": 33, "author": "#2", "published": "2017-12-07T06:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Leishu : In the US, there absolutely is such a thing as LGBT culture.\nThat is not to say that it is without nuance, or that it includes all LGBT individuals, but only an idiot would deny that it exists.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://img.fark.net/images/cache/850/C/CP/fark_CPftOL0Gda2x-7uoGbuHHbTx11Q.jpg?t=pdhKZ1T2QDJJ52-Bvk0LKA&f=1512968400"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:40.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "447a3b920b40102a4ee09fcd63f77ea77a92787e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqIBRdCDNqED82VwYLDn_1XFN9rRPeDOZvrW7280w4hLzgrgXA81CwAZyNc9V2N6oWuDEs4OYq3crxdTBvh7Uabg--", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/politics/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Politics links", "title": "(9829974) White is not a shared ethnic identity", "title_full": "FARK.com: (9829974) White is not a shared ethnic identity", "published": "2017-12-07T05:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 102, "participants_count": 95, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "http://img.fark.net/images/cache/orig/E/EJ/fark_EJEldwAs4WOjqLmndzlwGsZSIgU.jpg?t=3LoRk8CqeckQiETlCpiTPA&amp;f=1512968400", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3382, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "46e40cc2da8e66cbd989c9a310a5ed2f6f5381da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqIBRdCDNqED82VwYLDn_1XFN9rRPeDOZvrW7280w4hLzgrgXA81CwAZyNc9V2N6oWuDEs4OYq3cpxJn8u2V2Iaqz5eE6_MIaN", "ord_in_thread": 43, "author": "MrPoopyPants", "published": "2017-12-07T06:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "thurstonxhowell : Ooba Tooba: Unright: Black Pride: \"Hey, the new local news anchor is a black woman.

Being proud of being not a person of color is pretty racist.\nMixed heritage White/Native American.\nYou do realize that there is no singular Black/African, Asian, et al., culture either, right? I mean, using your definition, we'd have to single it out across the board. No singular black pride movement but Nigerian, Zimbabwean, et al., and Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, et al., instead of Asian pride. Heck, even we Native Americans would have to be broken into specific groups since there isn't one cultural identity. Since there isn't one cultural identity it would fall into the same boat as \"White Pride\" where you're pride movement is based solely on genetically determined skin color.\n/just sayin'\nSure, but with regard to black americans, most of them had their heritage stolen from them by slavers, so \"black\" is by and large what they've got.\nThis. I guess my family is fortunate that we know who our African ancestor was. We don't know her name for certain (Elizabeth?), but we do know that she was kidnapped by French slavers from \"Guinea\" when she was a 6 y/o child. We know she was taken to Martinique and then, while on a French ship heading somewhere, a British ship intercepted it and she was taken to New York where a Delaware Indian bought her and she had a daughter by him. So she must have been captured by the British during the 7 years war (so before 1763.)

Since it comes only once a year - I like to make the most of it, yanno? - and that includes basically spending the entirety of December slathering as many festive-themed lacquers onto my nails as possible. Although you can technically wear metallic, glittery finishes all-year-round ( I know I certainly do ), it's certainly the time of year when it's more socially acceptable to go proper 'in' with the stuff. So, I figured today I'd give you lovely lot a rundown of some of my personal favourite festive colours and finishes that I love, love, LOVE at Christmas-time. I've actually done a post very similar to this two #DitsyDecember's ago here , but me being me, I've built my collection up even more since then and so it'd safe to say there's a fair few changes to be made to the line-up. Let's get started... \n\nBARRY M SPEEDY QUICK DRY NAIL PAINT IN 'DEAD HEAT' - Starting of with the festive classic - a true red. If you want to go pretty simple on your nails, but still keep things Christmassey - a traditional red creme finish is just perfect . You can wear it alone, or use it as a base for shimmers or glittery topcoats to be layered over the top of (ushc as some of the ones featured in this very post) and it works amazing either way. This one from Barry M is one of my personal faves - it's got that bright, blue undertone of reds that I typically associate more with Christmas-time and sometimes, I can get away with getting it opaque in just one coat. Winner! SEE IT IN ACTION HERE . \n\nSEVENTEEN GLITTER NAIL POLISH IN 'RED' - Yanno I was talking about glitters that you can layer over your creme polishes to give them extra festive 'pizzazz'? Well, this is one of them. This does basically exactly what it says on the tin - a mixture of smaller and larger hexagonal red flecks suspended in a clear polish - and with it being pretty sheer in coverage, it acts the ideal glittery topcoat. It may not be the most interesting, exciting glitter polish out there - but it's a good staple to have in your stash - and I actually find that it work in its favour as, in my opinion , that is exactly what makes it so universal and multi-purpose. You can layer it over a contrasting festive hue such as a gold or green, or even pair it with a red creme lacquer like the above to keep things more tonal and matchy-matchy. Whatever way - it's awesome . SEE IT IN ACTION HERE . \n\nRIMMEL GLITTER BOMB NAIL POLISH IN 'MIDNIGHT MISTLETOE' - Now for the ultimate festive polish, in my opinion. Wanna go all-out Christmas on your nails? look no further than this lacquer. A glitter topcoat comprised of a mixture of large red, green and silver flecks - you quite literally cannot get any more Christmassey than this polish. This is a great way of turning a perhaps more ordinary lacquer into something far more festive and fabulous and I really rather love it. I don't know if Rimmel even sell this anymore - if they don't, boo! - but if they do, I'd definitely recommend picking it up this festive season.  \n\nMAYBELLINE COLOR SHOW NAIL POLISH IN 'PINK PARTY DRESS' - Copper may not be such a 'traditional' Christmas colour, but over the past few years especially - it has become a huge colour craze that everyone loves - and actually, it can be a nice alternative if you don't fancy going down the more 'classic', Christmas colour scheme. I have a fair few polishes in my stash that I could include - obviously - but in the end, I went for this one. This is a super-stunning warm, rich, copper colour and the glitter inside is more finely-milled and shimmery - so, unlike the glitter lacquers I've featured so  far, while you can sheer things out and rock it as a topcoat-type situation, you can equally build it up for a full coverage finish. SEE IT IN ACTION HERE . \n\nBARRY M MOLTEN METAL NAIL PAINT IN 'PINK ICE' - I guess Copper and Rose Gold kinda go hand in hand - both have really grown in popularity in recent years and are very similar - but if you fancy something a little lighter and pinkier, rose gold is the hue to go for. Again , I have a tonne of different polishes that I could include - but that'd make this post about ten times longer and perhaps rather repetitive too - so instead, I've tried whittling it down to my favourite , favourite and that is this one from Barry M. I feel like so far, things have been pretty glitter-heavy and so, why not throw in a good ol' metallic finish, right? Metallised polishes are a great 'meet in the middle' point for if you want something more shimmery than your everyday creme's, but don't want full-on glitter - or maybe you want something to act as a sheeney base for one or the other. A classic rose gold colour, this makes for another great alternative option for if you don't want to go for the standard festive colours, but still want something a little extra-special for this time of year. SEE IT IN ACTION HERE . \n\nBARRY M NAIL PAINT IN 'PURE SUNSHINE' - Then - we're going for Gold . Gold has to be the ultimate Christmas colour in terms of whatever you're talking about - makeup, clothing, homeware, or in this case, nails. It's an oldie, but a goldie ( quite literally ) and though it's very 'typically' festive; it's always a fail-safe, in my opinion. So, I guess it's no big surprise that in this line-up, it's the colour that features the most in some way or another. This is a fairly new addition to the Barry M line-up and it's actually pretty unique in my collection - I feel it combines a lot of different, festive tones, into one. I'm featuring it in the 'gold' category as it definitely is a light, pearly gold - but it's actually got flecks of silver and green running through it and so, depending on what colour you place underneath - it reflects in varying ways. Again, I love a good multi-purpose polish that can be worn in different ways for different effects and this is certainly one of the best I've found for this festive season. \n\nMAYBELLINE SUPER STAY 7 DAYS NAIL POLISH IN 'WINNER TAKES IT ALL' - Another metallic effect lacquer that's a real winner (even down to the name itself) come Christmas-time is this one from Maybelline. As I've said, metallic polishes are a real go-to for me come the festive season as they can be easily worn alone for a more 'subtle' take on the glitter hype or they can be used as a base for a clear glittery topcoat to be applied as a finishing step and this true gold is just an essential in my collection. It's neither too ashy, nor too warm and yellow-y and so not only really complements my skintone, complements a variety of glittery topcoats too.  \n\nH&M BEAUTY NAIL POLISH IN 'GOLD RUSH' - Then - for a full-on, gold glitter goodness - this one is your guy. This one, like a couple of others I've mentioned, is a tad more higher in coverage and so can be sheered out as a topcoat or built up as a stand-alone colour and I love it equally worn both ways. This gold is a little more orange-y than the above, but I still find it a really pretty, easy colour to wear and I feel like the super-glittery finish - combined with the slightly warmer undertone - makes it even more of a festive-inspired colour. SEE IT IN ACTION HERE . \n\nBARRY M NAIL PAINT IN 'GOLD MINE GLITTER' -  Then, rounding up the 'Gold' colours nicely - this one is a bit of a different one. At first glance you might think this is a normal black polish but peer a little closer and you'll see that ruining throughout it, there's tonnes of golden glitter flecks. I feel like this one is ideal for if you want to keep things fairly 'neutral' and perhaps less outright Christmassey on your nails - but maybe fancy adding a light touch of that somethin' somethin' .  \n\nMAYBELLINE COLOR SHOW NAIL POLISH IN 'UNICORN ADDICTION' - Last, but certainly by no means least - I feel like I just had to throw something like this in here. Over the past year or so, the whole holographic effect has just blown up and become a real huge deal and it seems right now, everything and anything comes in Unicorn-form. So, I felt like I just had to incorporate that into this line-up somehow as to be honest, I do quite like a bit of holographic goodness on my nails myself and it's probably the most 'trendy' way of going all glittery, sparkly and fun on your nails right now. I picked this polish up a few months ago and while I really had fun experimenting with it during the Summer - who says you can't rock it over the festive season, right? This is probably the most versatile polish of all all of these I've featured today as it really can be worn over anything from red to gold, pink to green - and basically everything in-between. Whatever you layer underneath - the effect will be totally different and if you wanted to go all-natural- ish , I guess you could even layer it over your bare nails too. If you haven't guessed by now - I love a good multi-tasking nail polish... SEE IT IN ACTION HERE .

Scott", "text": "A Review by Wendy  \n\n4.5 Taking the Risk Stars \n* * * *1/2    Spoiler Free \nFame, Achievement, Vast Wealth... They may all seem like winning the Lottery Ticket to Life's Dreams. And in many ways they are...but there is also another side that comes with those experiences... and many of them are not all they are cracked up to be...\n\nNow I know first instinct may be... hey, I will take whatever comes with all that and deal... because it must be so much better than not having them...and Yes, there is no denying Life Is Much Easier with Financial Security. However, there can be a downside to being this Entity... this known person and in Everest, we are given firsthand how this can impact a person's life. \n\nWe first meet Everest as a guy who has the world on a string... He developed a Social Media Network... Shades of Facebook, maybe and over the course of the years he worked it, grew it to be become profitable and now at 26, he is a billionaire. He is this presence, a man who enters the room and without knowing anything about him, you would be drawn to him. \n\nEverest has not been the most guarded, relying on his close friends who knew him Before... those he can trust. He still has a free and easy way... with the enjoyment of women who are thrilled to have only a look or touch by him. We are first at a party in the Bronx where Everest and his best friends are surveying the crowd. \n\nThere Everest is caught with a vision, a woman who is nothing like all the others... She sits on a futon, unassuming and taking in her surroundings. She wears a sweet blue dress with red lipstick calling to him. There is something about her... she is an innocent in this sea of others...others ready for a quickie in a bathroom or a try to snag the brass ring with a billionaire...\n\nBut not her...\n\nSinger Davis can remember all about that night at the party when she first saw Everest. She had been there only because her best friend brought her and it really wasn't her thing. She had seen this hunk of a man looking and she looked back a few times... She decided to get out of the room and took the idea of sitting on the fire escape as the way to figure out if she should stay any longer. \n\nEverest comes out and sits right next to Singer. He is intrigued and deep down feels she is a person who doesn't want anything of him because of \"Who He Is\"...He feels he could have a real conversation with her and as they start to talk to each other... he realizes he is right...\n\nIt only was a few moments, a sharing of beer and conversation...Somehow her seeing how happy and confident he is...cause interest in the brief the time with him. He is warm, charming and true... but there is this thing, this more...and a moment happens...\n\nA serious moment where they connect so strongly. Without any words, he leans in, is about to risk it all and kiss her...\n\nBut it never happens...\n\nInstead, he is whisked away by the model who was the draw of the night, the shiny object of everyone's desires...and Singer's and Everest's moment is lost...But never forgotten by either of them.\n\nA year goes by... And a lot can happen in a year. Everest learned some very hard life lessons. He is fighting the good fight but it is not over...he is still deep in the mix. The lessons have taught him not to trust as everything is not as it seems...It has caused him to do things differently, live differently and it has taken a toll on the man...He is alone.\n\nSinger and her friend, Melanie, have seen Everest over the last year here and there...but there has been no contact. They are at a bar and both see Everest. The friend teases Singer and Singer does that sweet blush. Singer only has wistful thoughts of that moment out on the fire escape.\n\nBut now Everest is walking towards her after a year of sightings...plunks down next to Singer and says Hey...Mentions he thinks they should hang out... Stunned, Singer just nods and Melanie pushes hard for Everest to commit to a Sunday afternoon meeting in the park. \n\nHuh????\n\nThis is the start which will grab you and not let you go, if you let it. This story is current with all of the references to what happens when the playing field of business and betrayal is clear. It shows how everything can have an impact that was not intended; how things can be manipulated.\n\nBut it also gives us two main characters who are meant to be together It is their second chance, the first woefully interrupted. I loved both of them and the power of self by Singer; her goodness and understanding of love did it for me. Her love of her friend and the support each gave to each other was beautiful. These character were not drawn in crayon... but cared for and felt from the start. Singer is a very special and it is easy to love and admire her. She sees the good and is a glass half full person. \n\nEverest is a man who has been hurt and needs to power through and let go with Singer. Their chemistry - off the charts and the swoony parts <333\n\nThis story has many layers and you are there in the moment through it all. There are many secondary characters who, when on the page, do not feel secondary at all.... I couldn't stop reading this and even when I suspected outcomes, I didn't care because I was so invested. I lost sleep but it was worth it for me. \n\nTake the time, follow this tale and you will have a love journey.  \n\n  A gifted copy was provided by author/publisher for an honest review. \n\n  \nAbout S.L.

It peaked at 14.58, scaling a crest it hadn\u2019t seen since mid-August, nor has touched more than a dozen times or so in 2017. \nThe VIX remained elevated\u2014well, relatively at least\u2014for much of the day on fears that the tax bill would hit a hurdle in the Senate. But later in the day, as it became more certain that the Senate had enough votes to carry the bill forward, the VIX returned to the 10-11 range, where it has spent most of the last 6 months. In the year through November, the index has averaged 10.68, compared with an average of 19.50 since 1990. Investors Hungry for Vol? \n\u201cFriday showed us that there is a hunger for volatility,\u201d says JJ Kinahan, TD Ameritrade\u2019s chief market strategist. \nThat volatility craving comes after a long spate of complacency as the market has ticked forward to a series of all-time records. Remember that the VIX measures the market\u2019s expectations of implied volatility over the next 30 days by using implied volatilities on options among S&P 500 Index components. Investor anxiety roils the VIX upward while calmness tempers it. When the VIX is higher, it typically means investors are willing to pay more to hedge their investments. For more on the VIX and volatility indexes, read this primer . The Signal and the Noise? \nThough the rise and fall in the VIX is linked to option prices in the S&P 500, it\u2019s generally viewed as a fear proxy for all the major asset classes, like stocks and bonds. When equity prices rise, the VIX tends to fall, and vice versa . Friday\u2019s leap appeared to be directly tied to what was going on in Washington, falling 1.3% in the minutes after the Flynn plea was announced. See figure 1 below. Kinahan usually refers to Washington events as \u201cnoise\u201d because they don\u2019t reflect the fundamentals of the markets, which are, of course, the profits and losses of equities, and the sectors in which they sit. \nFIGURE 1: ROLLER COASTER FRIDAY. \nThe E-mini S&P 500 futures contract (/ES) had quite a wild ride Friday, as a mid-morning news report about former national security adviser Michael Flynn was followed a few hours later by a report the U.S. Senate had secured enough votes to pass its version of the tax bill. Data source: CME Group. Chart source: The thinkorswim \u00ae platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. \nSo why does the VIX appear to be rising on noise? Because Friday\u2019s clatter was deemed by investors as a negative sign that the Trump White House\u2014and everything it has promised to help cut corporate taxes and grow the economy\u2014could be in jeopardy, according to Kinahan. The thinking goes that cutting corporate taxes should juice earnings, and provide a boost to stock prices. \nThe VIX subsided after the tax bill cleared its first major hurdle. Though the House and the Senate must hammer out one bill between their two proposals, the VIX now seems to be telling investors that the likelihood of a compromised bill reaching President Trump\u2019s pen this month is high. End-of-Year Jockeying \nBut don\u2019t let that complacency lull you into a false sense of perceived VIX security. The VIX may move to higher ground amid a level of flux this month, Kinahan says. That might be especially true if the House and Senate tax bills don\u2019t get reconciled by Christmas, as Senate leaders have promised. What\u2019s more, trading can be heavy toward the end of the year, as investors rebalance their portfolios for tax considerations, and fund managers shift out of lagging positions in favor of those that have performed well throughout the year. \n\u201cAs we sort out the sector winners from the sector losers for the year, we may see an added level of volatility as people start to adjust their portfolios to invest in these sector winners,\u201d Kinahan says.

In June 2016, McMillan first rolled her Pastrami Zombie food truck into Portland. It nestled at 5429 NE 42nd Avenue for several months before moving to Mississippi Marketplace this past August 16.\n\nThis past August, news broke that McMillan would open a brick-and-mortar spot on SE Division . In mid-October, Sammich announced a second brick-and-mortar to open on Burnside by December 1. The SE Division spot has faced delays, but was still slated to open at some point (citing the October article). \n\nIt's clear McMillan is a Chicago Cubs fan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pastrami Zombie truck is a pared-down menu of the Sammich restaurant. Of course, the pastrami is the signature item, but also consider their burger, albacore, and other listed specials.\n\n\nThe Pastrami Sandwich ($12) starts with their signature pastrami, with cole slaw and Swiss on rye. Choice of house Russian dressing or mustard. I got the Russian dressing this time. It comes with a side of Tim's kettle chips.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, killer good pastrami.

The directive was given at the FEC meeting held on Wednesday. The meeting was presided by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo in the absence of President Muhammadu Buhari who is in Kano on a working visit. \nFuel queues have since Monday surfaced across the country with the NNPC blaming it on panic buying. The Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, briefed State House correspondents on the resolution after a meeting of the council which held inside the council chamber of the presidential villa Abuja. Mr. Mohammed said Mr. Kachikwu was supposed to be the one to brief Nigerians on the matter, but that he had \u201cto attend a very important meeting so that this crisis would be resolved.\u201d Mr. Mohammed said part of the reason for the scarcity is because it was only the NNPC that has been importing petrol. He said Mr. Kachikwu assured that the problem will be resolved and that \u201cthere is no cause for alarm.\u201d \u201cThe council gave him a matching order that this fuel scarcity should not last beyond this weekend and they are going to work very hard to ensure that it is curtailed\u201d. The minister also dispelled rumours that the government is planning to increase the price of petrol. \u201cThe government has no intention at all to increase the pump price of PMS,\u201d he said. He also said Mr. Kachikwu had, while briefing the council, assured that the country has \u201cenough products till next one month or even till the end of January.\u201d Giving reasons for the sudden scarcity, Mr. Mohammed said it is due to the current cold weather that has necessitated more buying.. \u201cThere is always more demand for refined products for petroleum during winter period in the colder countries, this is what we are experiencing now,\u201d he said.
