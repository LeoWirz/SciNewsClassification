Securing more than a dozen awards in 2017 alone the company recently added five Best in Biz awards to the list. Winners are chosen by a panel of editorial thought leaders who evaluate companies' social and economic impact. \nFinancial Finesse's programs, which are delivered as an employee benefit to a fast-growing roster of the nation's largest Fortune 1000 companies, beat out hundreds of firms to become the \"Most Awarded\" company by Best in Biz, passing giants like Ernst & Young and Aflac for innovations in the financial industry. \nAlong with four other awards, the company took home the coveted Gold award for the Most Innovative Product of the Year for its proprietary Behavioral Change Model\u2122.\nThe company's Behavioral Change Model\u2122 is rapidly setting the standard for the financial wellness industry due to its success in both reducing employer bottom line costs and improving employees' financial wellness. It provides employees with unlimited access to personalized financial coaching through a combination of in-person consultations, phone-based coaching, group education, online and mobile services. All services work seamlessly together to deliver the ongoing financial coaching and guidance employees need to achieve their financial goals. Eighty-nine percent of employees who participate in the company's programs make at least three significant changes to their finances within 30 days, with the most common changes being reducing their debt, cutting expenses, and increasing savings for long-term financial goals. \nAccording to Davidson, the Behavioral Change Model\u2122 is at the core of the company's innovation strategy. Nick Lapworth , who heads product development for the firm  adds, \"our Behavioral Change Model\u2122 has created a whole new paradigm that puts the employee at the center of the experience and builds a support structure and system of accountability based on the way they manage their financial life.\"\nDavidson says being recognized by Best in Biz is a tremendous honor, crediting her team for their commitment to continual innovation in what is a very rapidly changing market. She adds that Financial Finesse's team is passionate about helping other companies focused on making a significant social impact innovate their products and services. She recognizes that the majority of innovation is driven from small teams with big ideas and a new way of looking at problems.

Vertebrate genomes generally contain gene loci for 15\u201321 different CA isoforms, three of which are enzymatically inactive. CA VI is the only secretory protein of the enzymatically active isoforms. We discovered that non-mammalian CA VI contains a C-terminal pentraxin (PTX) domain, a novel combination for both CAs and PTXs. Methods We isolated and sequenced zebrafish (Danio rerio) CA VI cDNA, complete with the sequence coding for the PTX domain, and produced the recombinant CA VI\u2013PTX protein. Enzymatic activity and kinetic parameters were measured with a stopped-flow instrument. Mass spectrometry, analytical gel filtration and dynamic light scattering were used for biophysical characterization. Sequence analyses and Bayesian phylogenetics were used in generating hypotheses of protein structure and CA VI gene evolution. A CA VI\u2013PTX antiserum was produced, and the expression of CA VI protein was studied by immunohistochemistry. A knock-down zebrafish model was constructed, and larvae were observed up to five days post-fertilization (dpf). The expression of ca6 mRNA was quantitated by qRT-PCR in different developmental times in morphant and wild-type larvae and in different adult fish tissues. Finally, the swimming behavior of the morphant fish was compared to that of wild-type fish. Results The recombinant enzyme has a very high carbonate dehydratase activity. Sequencing confirms a 530-residue protein identical to one of the predicted proteins in the Ensembl database (ensembl.org). The protein is pentameric in solution, as studied by gel filtration and light scattering, presumably joined by the PTX domains. Mass spectrometry confirms the predicted signal peptide cleavage and disulfides, and N-glycosylation in two of the four observed glycosylation motifs. Molecular modeling of the pentamer is consistent with the modifications observed in mass spectrometry. Phylogenetics and sequence analyses provide a consistent hypothesis of the evolutionary history of domains associated with CA VI in mammals and non-mammals. Briefly, the evidence suggests that ancestral CA VI was a transmembrane protein, the exon coding for the cytoplasmic domain was replaced by one coding for PTX domain, and finally, in the therian lineage, the PTX-coding exon was lost. We knocked down CA VI expression in zebrafish embryos with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides, resulting in phenotype features of decreased buoyancy and swim bladder deflation in 4 dpf larvae. Discussion These findings provide novel insights into the evolution, structure, and function of this unique CA form.\n\nfrom #MedicinebyAlexandrosSfakianakis via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2Ai0yMT\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:31.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6814e422c7a404f7787d42f21ec822bb645444ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSdORrmf8ohhT4nBgdPwGlvXwRpSSn2xjQDD6pdzetCpNaUtW3N96m5KfIkQR9oHkmbXnSfnbqegmBnBVPVBePvxzWxZLJktVo5p4XM.PDl3fy1vmBlisPhA--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Ethereum", "title": "Ethereum processed nearly 800k transaction today.

A small group of New York City women, including 28-year-old Charlotte Waverly, decide to do something about it, and end up changing the course of the war, despite criticism, ridicule and social ostracism. Charlotte leaves a life of privilege, wealth-and confining expectations-to be one of the first female nurses for the Union Army. She quickly discovers that she\u2019s fighting more than just the Rebellion by working in the hospitals. Corruption, harassment, and opposition from Northern doctors threaten to push her out of her new role. At the same time, her sweetheart disapproves of her shocking strength and independence, forcing her to make an impossible decision: Will she choose love and marriage, or duty to a cause that seems to be losing? An Irish immigrant named Ruby O\u2019Flannery, who turns to the unthinkable in the face of starvation, holds the secret that will unlock the door to Charlotte\u2019s future. But will the rich and poor confide in each other in time? \nWedded to War is a work of fiction, but the story is inspired by the true life of Civil War nurse Georgeanna Woolsey.

It spans a gross floor area of 11,494 sq m. The property has been 51% occupied since early 2015, when the existing tenant reduced its lease space, says the manager. \nMapletree Logistics Trust bought the property in 2007 at MYR25.5 million. It was valued by Savills (Johor) at MYR20.5 million as at Oct 31, based on the cost approach. \n\n(Credit: Mapletree Logistics Trust) \n\nAccording to the manager, the divestment was attributed to the property\u2019s \u201clow yield and limited future income growth\u201d, and was decided upon after considering a variety of asset options, such as redevelopment. The manager is looking to invest the capital released from the sale of the property in newer and higher yielding assets. In the meantime, the funds will be used for working capital. \nUpon the sale of the property, slated for completion in 1Q2018, the manager will receive a divestment fee of 0.5% of its sale price, or MYR140,000.

Retail: $100,000.\nA Tabitha baby doll from the popular TV show \u201cBewitched.\u201d Retail: $5,000.\nA Star Trek metal lunchbox. An easy $1,000.\nThese are the childhood treasures and mementos pulled from attics and toy chests across the country that have landed in Joel Magee\u2019s sprawling estate west of West Palm Beach.\nNow Magee, who calls himself \"America's Toy Scout,\u201d is hosting events in Boca Raton and Dania Beach \u2014 on the hunt for rare toys that would make collectors\u2019 hearts flutter. Starting Thursday, you\u2019ll be able to sell your valuable toys.\nToy-scouting events have surged in popularity through the years, says Terry Kovel, the owner of Cleveland-based Kovels.com, a website about the values of antiques, including toys. \u201cToys are so hot, you can\u2019t believe it,\u201d she said. \u201cToys have always been good sellers. And if it moves and makes noise, it\u2019s better.\n\u201cYou remember what you loved as a kid,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to find it.\u201d\nToy owners with a piece they think has value may get it appraised by Magee, or sell it to him. More cash goes to those with toys already in good condition, or rare. Magee has his computer ready to double check an item he isn\u2019t sure about.\nMagee\u2019s South Florida Vintage Toy Buying Show will be 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Thursday and Friday at the Fairfield Inn & Suites, 3400 Airport Road, in Boca Raton. It will continue 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at the Fairfield Inn by Marriott, 2081 Griffin Road, in Dania Beach.\nJoel Magee, of West Palm Beach, goes coast to coast in search of collectible, vintage toys and comic books. Magee, also known as 'America's Toy Scout,' offers cash for old toys that he deems to be collector-worthy, and invites the public to bring old and vintage toys to his appearances Dec. 7-8 (Thursday & Friday) at the Fairfield Inn by Marriott, 3400 Airport Road, in Boca Raton and then Dec.. 9-10 (Saturday-Sunday) at the Fairfield Inn by Marriott, 2081 Griffin Road, in Fort Lauderdale.\n(Mike Stocker.Carline Jean, Brett Clarkson, Sun Sentinel; Courtesy Joel Magee) Magee, 56, has dealt with Pez dispensers, Star Wars and Beatles memorabilia, superhero figurines, baseball cards, comic books from the 1940s to 1960s, and Hot Wheels. There are board games from iconic TV shows, such as \u201cThe Brady Bunch.\u201d Metal lunchboxes are ready for sale from \u201cUnderdog,\u201d \u201cBonanza,\u201d \u201cThe Flintstones\u201d and \u201cThe Beverly Hillbillies.\u201d\nHe said toys make people happy \u2014 and he has turned that into a thriving business.\n\u201cThose were the happy times,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst thing we had to do is make our beds and get mom off our back. Our job was to go out and play. It\u2019s nice to go back and visit our childhood if only for a moment.\u201d\nEach year he treks nationwide at least 30 times a year to buy toys and then restores them to mint condition and sells them to buyers through Amazon or eBay.\nSome of the best goods came from events in snowy states, where moms tend to overbuy to keep their cooped-up kids busy, he said. He has hosted his event four times in South Florida, and it has led him to find some of the rarest comic books, among other great finds.\nHe said he sells about $500,000 worth of merchandise a year and his business, Toy Scout, has grown to include a staff of seven who package products for shipping and restore toys (Tips: The way to get gum out of Barbie\u2019s hair is with a drop of peanut butter, then rinse. To get the frizz out of her hair, steam it). There\u2019s a specialist for dolls and another for battery-operated toys.\nToys make up almost half of his 9,800-square-foot home. The toys are stored there and also fixed and shipped from there.\nMagee, an entrepreneur who said he made money in both the stock market and buying condos in Singer Island, rehabbing them and then flipping them to a developer, said he accidentally got into the toy business in 1986 while at a flea market in Iowa.

Besides having applications in the realm of security, the approach could lead to inexpensive devices to help construction workers easily locate conduits, pipes and wires.\u201cMost technologies that can see through walls use a broad range of frequencies, which makes them expensive,\u201d said Daniel Marks, associate research professor at Duke University in the US.\u201cThey also do not have very good resolution. So while they might be fine for seeing a person moving on the other side of a wall, they are terrible for finding thin conduits or wires,\u201d said Marks. Current approaches also typically rely on knowing what material the wall is made out of before trying to see through it. This allows the software to predict how the wall will affect the scanning waves so that it can separate the echoes and distortions from the solid objects being sought. Since walls are generally flat and uniform in all directions, they distort waves in a symmetrical fashion. The new technology described in the journal Optica uses this symmetry to its advantage.\u201cWe wrote an algorithm that separates the data into parts \u2013 one that shows circular symmetry and another that does not,\u201d said Okan Yurduseven, a postdoctoral researcher at Duke.\u201cThe data that does not have any symmetry is what we are trying to see,\u201d said Yurduseven. The technique uses only a single frequency to scan because it cuts down on the number of interference patterns created by the wall and single-frequency emitters are much less expensive than broadband emitters. Sticking to a narrow range also means that a future device would be easy to avoid interfering with microwave frequencies dedicated to other technologies, such as Wifi, cellular phone service and Bluetooth, researchers said. They built a prototype device to see how well it would work. In their laboratory, the researchers constructed a couple of different kinds of walls and then placed objects behind them that a worker might want to find, like studs, electrical conduits, wires and junction boxes. Looking at the raw data after scanning through gypsum plasterboard, it is difficult to make out anything other than a metal junction box, which is four inches wide and two inches thick.

CLARY, AFP/Getty Images) CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Just in case you haven't heard, thousands and thousands of people don a jaunty red stocking cap and many add Santa's entire red suit, reindeer antlers, and mistletoe scarves for one day of pre-Christmas revelry called SantaCon. This year's event is scheduled for Saturday. Expect streets and bars to be crowded with Santa wannabes, some of whom don't behave in the jolly, benevolent manner exemplified by St. Nick. NYC HOLIDAY GUIDE: What to see, do To curb such naughty behavior, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has banned alcohol on all Metro-North Railroad and Long Island Rail Road trains and in stations from noon on Saturday through noon on Sunday. \nA crowd of people dressed as Santa gather for a group photo during the annual SantaCon pub crawl in Brooklyn. It takes place Dec. 9, 2017. (Photo: Stephanie Keith, Getty Images) MTA police officers will be on duty at Grand Central Terminal, Penn Station, and stations throughout the region, as well as on trains to enforce the ban and confiscate alcoholic beverages. Violators may also be subject to removal from the train or station by police, according to the MTA press release. The exact areas where SantaCon takes place are announced the night before each celebration. The annual event is held at cities across the U.S. and internationally.

The partnership will leverage Honda's vehicle control system with SenseTime's AI algorithms to jointly create an autonomous driving solution. The two companies also announced they will work together to develop robot technology. \nRooted in computer vision technologies, autonomous driving solutions can be deployed even in the absence of high-resolution maps, allowing them to cover an even wider array of driving conditions. When a vehicle is driving without a detailed map covering its trajectory, for example, it will still be able to use the self-driving function. This autonomous driving solution offers great advantages to a variety of passenger vehicle scenarios and will also lower transducer manufacturing costs. \nSenseTime Japan CEO Lao Shihong said, \"Safety is the utmost priority when it comes to driving, and it also constitutes the core of our autonomous driving solution. By combining SenseTime's strengths in computer vision technologies with Honda's superior vehicle control technologies, we will together enable a safe and pleasant autonomous driving experience. Moreover, the fact that SenseTime provides core technology to a global enterprise like Honda marks a milestone.\" \nA fast up-and-coming field, autonomous driving is levying new, extremely high standards on AI algorithms and development platforms as it requires extraordinary technologies to deliver such a solution. SenseTime, with a set of core technologies and patents for autonomous driving, has also developed chips and embedded systems for smart AI cars. The partnership between SenseTime and Honda is expected to accelerate the research of developement of smart AI cars. \nAbout SenseTime \nSenseTime is a leading Chinese artificial intelligence company focused on computer vision and deep learning technologies. Besides from its technological strengths, SenseTime has achieved commercial successes.

They have the same age and he\u2019s football crazy. He loves to play football, he watches football, he knows all the players. And Thiago no, he likes cars, he likes motorcycles, he plays other things. He likes football, but just a bit.\u201d\n\nOn Mateo, Leo says: \u201cMateo does play a bit of football, right-footed. He\u2019s more coordinated . He hits it well.
