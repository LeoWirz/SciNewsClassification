The ITV presenter, who has blasted the model previously, ranted about the Gone Girl actress\u2019 latest sizzling promotion for the Love magazine Advent calendar on Good Morning Britain before bluntly telling her to \u201cget a proper job\u201d, The Sun reported. Morgan then took another shot at the model on Twitter. \u201cThis is Emily Ratajkowski 'promoting feminism'. Somewhere, Emmeline Pankhurst just vomited,\u201d Morgan tweeted. Loading content... However, Ratajkowski hit back on Wednesday, saying that she never said the video was a feminist statement. \u201cBut now it\u2019s worth saying that telling women what to do with their bodies and sexuality is actually just classic sexism.

look in pursuit of success MATT JONES, The Daily Telegraph December 7, 2017 7:15pm \nTRAINER Tim Martin is sending a handful of chances to Rosehill Gardens on Saturday and thinks his least experienced runner is his best bet. \nThe Hipster is second-up in a Benchmark 80 Handicap over 1200m and was impressive on return from a long break at Hawkesbury on \u00adNovember 15. \nANALYSIS: KINGSTON TOWN CLASSIC \nHe was coming off a year-long absence from the races after winning on debut in \u00adDecember 2016 and showed he was back with a good \u00adeffort behind the very \u00adimpressive Marble. \nMartin has put plenty of time into his promising four-year-old, who was off racetracks following a paddock accident, as he steps out for just the third time with Adam Hyeronimus on board. \n\u201cThe Hipster has improved since that run so hopefully he can run well in a hard race on Saturday,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI\u2019ve thrown him in at the deep end but I want to win a Saturday-class race with him over the summer.\u201d \nMartin conceded the horse was still immature and is a big, soft galloper, but is sure he\u2019s got some quality about him and will progress nicely through the grades starting on Saturday. \nHe wants to test him. type_quote_start \u201cI did put him in this race for that reason, to see what he\u2019s got, and I think he\u2019ll be hard to beat,\u201d Martin said. type_quote_end \n\u201cIf he\u2019s as good as I think he is he\u2019ll be right in it. The horse that beat us last start is a very good horse and we\u2019re in this with no weight. \n\u201cHe\u2019s my pick of the day.\u201d \nFrom barrier seven, Martin will instruct Hyeronimus to find cover rather than look for the lead like he\u2019s done at his only two career runs. \n\u201cIf he gets that we can see how good he is,\u201d Martin said. \nHyeronimus, who has ridden The Hipster at his two starts, feels the horse is adaptable and described him as \u201cpretty cool and easygoing\u201d. type_quote_start \u201cI don\u2019t think it matters where he races. It just depends on the tempo and keeping him in a comfortable rhythm,\u201d he said. type_quote_end \n\u201cIt was a great run last time because the Godolphin horse is pretty good. And he had such a long time off so it was pleasing to see him come back well. \n\u201cHe\u2019s got a good turn of foot but he\u2019s also got a high cruising speed and a lovely action.\u201d \nMartin and Hyeronimus will combine in three more races including the National Jockeys Trust Handicap (2000m) with perennial placegetter Gambler\u2019s Blues, who is coming off a second placing to Dagny over 1800m on November 25. \nHe\u2019s had eight starts at his home track for six seconds but is yet to win. \n\u201cHe\u2019s well named, isn\u2019t he? But he\u2019s never been going better. He just always finds one that gets past him,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI think going up to 2000m will suit him and we\u2019ll ride him a bit quieter this time.\u201d media_camera Cool customer: trainer Tim Martin has plenty of time for his four-year-old The Hipster. \nThe difference between winning and another second could come down to the ride by Hyeronimus. He\u2019s got to times the seven-year-old\u2019s run to perfection. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll be trying to get to the front as late as possible. We can\u2019t get there too early,\u201d Martin said. \u201cHe half-waits. You can\u2019t get in front on him too early. The other day he did that and thought it was all over after he hit the front and pulled up. The horse is right so let\u2019s see if it\u2019s his turn this weekend. He\u2019ll sit midfield and hopefully the tempo is good.\u201d \nHyeronimus said judging the race wasn\u2019t too hard as long as he gets an even share of luck. \n\u201cI\u2019ll let him keep building into it and hopefully I get the timing right and he hits the front in the last few strides,\u201d he said. \nMeanwhile, Martin said Pick Me Up has to improve off last Friday night\u2019s third to Invincible Quest if he\u2019s to win a Benchmark 89 over 1100m on Saturday. \n\u201cHe had a good blow last week so I thought it would be good to back him up,\u201d Martin said. \u201cHe\u2019ll sit off them and drawing a bit wider will help him this time.\u201d \nKing Darci is another Martin runner who is in the market in the last event of the day over 1500m. \n\u201cIt looked like he raced flat last time but he too had a good healthy blow and pulled up well,\u201d he said.

Bitcoin began the year below $US1,000 but continues its sharp rise despite warnings of a dangerous bubble. The cryptocurrency hit the latest milestone during early trading on Thursday but by late Asian trade it had pulled back to $US13,960, up about 2.5 per cent on the day. A number of institutional investors are still avoiding Bitcoin, after seeing it rise around 1,100 per cent since the start of the year.

Picture: Jason Edwards Jayco Herald Sun Tour to host inaugural women\u2019s race Sam Edmund, Herald Sun December 7, 2017 7:19pm \nAUSTRALIA\u2019S oldest stage race has been given a new look, with an inaugural women\u2019s race set to elevate the Jayco Herald Sun Tour . \nThe 65th edition of the event has also secured new government and sponsorship deals, with the iconic race taking on a new sheen at Thursday\u2019s official launch. \nThe first UCI-sanctioned Women\u2019s Herald Sun Tour will see riders from 17 teams lock horns in a Healesville road race and Melbourne CBD time trial from January 30-31. \nTOUGH: CHAVES \u2018EXCITED FOR LONHER, HARDER TOUR \nRising Australian star Macey Stewart, who has just returned to the pro circuit with Wiggle High5 after a 12-month break, could scarcely believe her timing. \n\u201cIt\u2019s so exciting for me, especially in this period of my life and getting back into it,\u201d Stewart said. \n\u201cI raced the NRS (National Road Series) this year, signed a professional contract and now I get to race in the Aussie Summer of Cycling and the Jayco Herald Sun Tour; I think I\u2019m going to be in awe of everything around me but I\u2019ll race as hard as I can. \n\u201cI\u2019ve watched the Herald Sun Tour and it\u2019s always been a really inspiring event, so for the women to be a part of it and to be able to race it at this level is very exciting for women\u2019s sport.\u201d media_camera Cyclists Macey Stewart and Koen de Kort at the official launch of the Jayco Herald Sun Tour. Picture: Jason Edwards \nStewart, 21, will juggle track and road commitments in 2018, with the Tasmanian\u2019s major goal the Tokyo 2020 Olympics with the Australian track endurance squad. \nThat means Stewart will be more suited to the 1.6km time trial on January 31 than the 123.5km road race the day before, but she was nevertheless looking forward to mixing it with some of the biggest names in the sport, including Orica-Scott world time-trial champion Annemiek van Vleuten. \n\u201cThe opportunity to race against people like Annemiek is a massive inspiration. I aim to be like her one day so hopefully I can learn a lot from the amazing female athletes who will be racing and try to beat them,\u201d Stewart said. \n\u201cIt will be really good to take it to Orica-Scott. I first went pro with Orica so they\u2019re still quite close to my heart and it will be interesting racing some of my close friends. But as soon as we get on that start line it will be all guns blazing.\u201d media_camera Macey Stewart, race director John Trevorrow, Orica-Scott owner Gerry Ryan, Cycling Australia CEO Nick Green, Koen de Kort, UCI vice president Tracey Gaudry, Herald Sun editorial business manager Tom Salom. Picture: Jason Edwards \nThe Victorian Government has committed to a new three-year deal with the race, while recreation vehicle giant Jayco have signed on for another three years as naming rights partner. \n\u201cIt\u2019s an iconic event and it\u2019s growing year on year,\u201d Jayco Australia owner Gerry Ryan said. \n\u201cWith the government making a three-year commitment through Visit Victoria and the Herald Sun, I had to get on board.\u201d \nMinister for Tourism and Events, John Eren, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve signed up because it\u2019s such a great event and has been going since 1952. Next year will be the most exciting and I am very excited about it being the first time that we will have female racing involved.\u201d DAYS OF \u2018FUN\u2019 NO MORE \nKOEN de Kort remembers how relaxed the Jayco Herald Sun Tour used to be. \nSunny days, straightforward stages and laid-back racing for the European elite keen to enjoy the Aussie summer as much as starting their seasons. \nBut de Kort didn\u2019t need to see the brutal course laid out for the 65th edition of Australia\u2019s oldest stage race to realise this was going to be a very tough race. \nThe veteran Dutchman, a regular on these shores, said the days of cycling\u2019s big names merely rolling the legs over on jaunts Down Under were long gone. type_quote_start \u201cMaybe 10-15 years ago it used to be that way. I can remember some guys referring to it as the Herald Fun Tour, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case any more at all,\u201d de Kort said. type_quote_end \n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the change in the Tour Down Under where it\u2019s really serious now and it seems like every race on the calendar now is super important. \n\u201cI\u2019m sure everyone here at the Jayco Herald Sun Tour will be taking it very seriously.\u201d \nDe Kort, 35, will form part of the World Tour Trek-Segafredo squad at a January 31-February 4 race shaping as the toughest in decades. \nA leadout specialist for sprint superstars Marcel Kittel and John Degenkolb, and a key helper for Grand Tour legend Alberto Contador down the years, de Kort was relishing racing against some of Australia\u2019s best young talent. \nBut at the pointy end of the race de kort acknowledged Orica-Scott star Esteban Chaves would be hard to beat for the title in a race that finishes with two days of climbing. \n\u201cIt will be pretty tough. He\u2019s obviously one of the world\u2019s best climbers and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to be in really good shape and he will be trying to win it,\u201d he said. \n\u201cBut he\u2019s been beaten before so we\u2019ll try again.\u201d \nAsked if he saw an opportunity for a rare stage win, the man who has made a career of making his teammates look good offered a very Dutch answer. \n\u201cEarlier this year I got a look at the (Stage 1) Warrnambool finish, so if it\u2019s a bit windy it could be a good chance for me. But it would have to be windy,\u201d he said.

Another benefit of trendlines is that they almost always keep you on the \u201cright\u201d side of the market. When using trendlines, it\u2019s difficult to hold a security for very long when prices are falling just as it\u2019s hard to be short when prices are rising\u2013either way the trendline will be broken. \nTaking a glance from a technical standpoint, Michelin Cie Gen Des (MGDDF) presently   78.73.

How Technology Can Help Improve Our K-12 Education System 12/06/2017 03:43 pm ET Digital Vision/Getty Images \nAnswer by Joseph Philleo , USC Undergraduate, on Quora : \nThe main problem with our K-12 education system is that school is closer to a daycare than an academy. \nBecause the primary focus of administrators, budgets, and curriculum is monitoring student behavior and safety, schools are saddled with severe constraints that inhibit learning. \nFor instance, forcing curious, energetic children with a disparate range of capabilities, backgrounds, and interests to sit in isolated desks and listen to a common lecture for seven hours is obviously not the most efficient, effective way for students to learn. Nor is it the cheapest. Yet, because schools are responsible for keeping kids safe, they organize themselves into structures where adults can best monitor, control, and moderate their behavior (i.e. one teacher per classroom of ~25 students). \nAs long as schools have this daycare constraint, K-12 education cannot become radically better. Throwing more money at education may create marginally improved teaching methods, lower teacher:student ratios, and fund newer pencils and textbooks, but it will not help realize or implement the highest-impact solutions (e.g. personalized learning, adaptive testing and curriculum, etc.), because such solutions are in fundamental conflict with the daycare constraint. \nHow can schools effectively use digital books, leverage the Internet and MOOCs, employ personalized learning, or foster problem solving and creativity while also requiring students to be sorted by age, locked into classrooms, seated in rows, physically oriented toward teachers, and have their behavior monitored and controlled at all times? \nThey can\u2019t. \nTherefore, the only way to fix K-12 education is to free its constraints. The best way to do that, I think, is to build a technology platform that helps educators and administrators more effectively ensure student safety and participation without severely limiting their freedom. \nCreating a software workflow that significantly reduces administrator workload and helps identify students at risk of dropping out, skipping class, failing a grade, harming peers, or committing suicide is the first step. \nAfter that, the software system must be expanded to empower teachers with its insights. There are a lot of really interesting ways to do this (e.g. identifying which students are struggling and excelling in class, recommending individualized homework sets based on concept mastery, etc.), but the point is to leverage technology to help educators, not replace them. \nThe last foreseeable step in fixing the K-12 school system is converting this software system into a software platform that lets other ed-tech applications function on top of it. Building a platform allows developers to easily create and distribute great products to thousands of schools, thereby lowering the barrier to entry and inducing an explosion of progress in education technology. \nThis question originally appeared on Quora - the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.

Visenze, the Singapore-based artificial intelligence company that has established itself as the market leader in visual commerce has this week announced the expansion of its \u2018Visual Commerce Platform\u2019. Ecommerce has always been \u2018visual\u2019 to the extent that photgraphic and video content is used to showcase items. However, \u2018visual commerce\u2019 adds an additional technology layer to maximise the leverage of visual content and drive sales. \nUp until now, Visenze\u2019s visual commerce technology has been used exclusively by ecommerce sites. Partners such as UNIQLO have already integrated Visenze\u2019s technology on their ecommerce sites. A potential customer in a UNIQLO store can snap an item that catches their eye in the aisle. Visenze\u2019s software then searches for items that match the image in the company\u2019s online store as well as in offline, in-store stock. \nAlternatively, by photographing an item being worn by a friend, family member or colleague and uploading it in a partner brand\u2019s ecommerce store, the user is taken directly to the item\u2019s listing. Similar items will also be highlighted and alternatives offered if a particular item is out of stock. An additional functionality that makes online retailers\u2019 life easier is using the image recognition technology to add automatic tags to listed products. This is particularly useful for online commerce sites with large numbers of products that tagging manually would be hugely time consuming. \nVisenze\u2019s expanded visual commerce platform will allow the software to be integrated into a wide variety of applications, from instant messaging apps to smartphone cameras and social media platforms. Images exchanged in chats between friends, appearing in social media or elsewhere online or even pictures taken in the street will now be able to run through the software, either manually or automatically. Items from clothing to interior design elements and logos will then be paired with matching or similar items available for purchase. \nThe artificial intelligence and machine learning incorporated into the Visual Commerce Platform helps with the aggregation and categorisation of products based on visual qualities such as colour, shape, pattern and style. \nVisenze currently has a catalogue of over 100 million different items, including many available on Amazon. The more flexible new functionalities mean smart phone manufacturers will be able to directly monetise social commerce trends. Photos taken by a smartphone could use the visual commerce principle to directly link the owner to buyable items that match or are similar to those in a picture. Built in affiliate tracking then means that the smartphone maker receives a commission if any purchase is subsequently made. A subtle snap of a handbag a user has spotted and liked could lead to a sale within minutes and a payday for smartphone maker.

The other two are tricky to be separated: Nikolaus of course has his own day, today, December 6th. But I always believed he made a return on Holy Night, I thought he and Weihnachtsmann are the same. Then, on Sunday, I accompanied a friend and her two children to the local christmas market, where a St. Nik - or Weihnachtmann? - was handing gift bags to children.

I never grasped the latter when I was a child myself, I thought of the Christkind as a girl-angel - it never occurred to me that the baby boy Jesus is the christ child! The other two are tricky to be separated: Nikolaus of course has his own day, today, December 6th. But I always believed he made a return on Holy Night, I thought he and Weihnachtsmann are the same. Then, on Sunday, I accompanied a friend and her two children to the local christmas market, where a St. Nik - or Weihnachtmann? - was handing gift bags to children. My friend explained that she wants her kids to differentiate between St. Nikolaus, a bishop with mitra, white-and-gold gown and bishop's staff, and the Weihnachtsmann in red and white coat and fur with reindeer, who is a commercial, American invention by coca-cola.

The way in which the diocese handled allegations of child sexual abuse shows there was a large gap between the diocese's policies and its practices.\nCommissioners found that ,where an alleged perpetrator had moved to another diocese, that diocese was generally not warned of the allegations.\nBishop Herft's inaction with respect to Father Rushton contributed to the systematic failure of the diocese to make perpetrators accountable for their conduct.\nCompassion and pastoral care were often not shown to survivors under the leadership of these two bishops, the report found.\nHowever, in exposing the allegations, later Newcastle bishops Brian Farran and Gregory Thompson took appropriate responses against alleged perpetrators and provided survivors with pastoral care. They faced a considerable backlash over their actions.\nThe report found the diocese did not address conflicts of interest. There was a lack of awareness of, or policies on, avoiding conflicts of interest in responding to child sexual abuse matters. The report found that conflicts of interests often involved lawyers who held positions in the diocese and acted as legal representatives for those charged with child sex offences.\nWhen Father George Parker was charged with child sexual abuse in 2000, Keith Allen, a member of the diocese and friend of Father Parker, acted as his solicitor.\nMr Allen then retained Paul Rosser, QC, as Father Parker's barrister. Mr Rosser was at the time also the diocesan deputy chancellor.\nMr Rosser accepted instructions to appear for Father Parker at the criminal prosecution for offences against survivor CKA and his brother.\nDespite Mr Rosser's submission to the contrary, the commissioners found there was clear conflict of interest between his duty to the diocese and his duty to his client, Father Parker.\nIn his capacity as deputy chancellor, Mr Rosser was involved in sending a message to CKA that the diocese would help him. In his capacity as Father Parker's legal representative, he was involved in undermining CKA's allegations.\nThe report also found that Mr Allen did not consider whether it was appropriate to act for Father Parker in a criminal prosecution given the various governance roles he held in the diocese at the time.\nThe cumulative effect of a number of systemic issues allowed a group of perpetrators to operate within the diocese for at least 30 years.\nThe report found that systemic issues included a focus on protecting the reputation of the church and its powerful and influential member. Abusive and predatory sexual relationships were misrepresented as consensual homosexual relationships.\nBefore 2007 those who reported allegations of child sexual abuse to senior clergy were treated as if they had fabricated the allegations and were sometimes threatened with legal action. Father Peter Rushton often threatened alleged victims or their families with legal action after hearing allegations of child sexual abuse made against him.\nThere was a lack of turnover of positions of governance leading to entrenched positions, conflicts of interest and a narrowed pool of expertise. There was a permissive and timid leadership by successive bishops.\nThe report found that allegations of child sexual abuse were not consistently or regularly reported to police and record keeping about complaints was inadequate.

The opposition has slammed the move and vowed to scale back the investment if voted into office.\nA petition on change.org calling for NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian to overturn the decision had gained almost 135,000 signatures at the time of writing.\nThe NRL is the big winner in the investment into the Moore Park and Homebush Bay precincts. The governing body has granted NSW 25 years of grand finals in return for the funding, thwarting Queensland's attempts to pinch the marquee event.\n\"It's a brave decision, it's great for rugby league and I think it's the right decision,\" Grant said.\n\"There are going to be people with different points of view and that's what we're seeing.\nAdvertisement \"There are competing forces for the allocation of funds. In this particular situation, the government has decided this is the way it will use its funds and we think it's a really good investment.\n\"You can debate how funds are going to be allocated, but at the end of the day you're trying to achieve multiple objectives in allocating the appropriate funding for education, the right funding for schools and health, etc and getting the appropriate funds to attract investment.\n\"I think the balance is right, irrespective of the benefit to rugby league.\n\"The government is to be commended for making the right broad-based decision.\"\nThe money spent on the rebuild of Sydney's stadia network is more than half the entire cost of venue construction for the 2000 Olympics. Labor leader Luke Foley has described the $2.5 billion spent on the city's stadia infrastructure as \"obscene\" and believes much of the money could be better spent on schools and hospitals. If Labor wins power, he will redirect a large chunk of the funding into those areas.\n\"If that were to happen, it would cause massive damage to the goodwill that's been created by people who look at the city and see what people in the state are doing,\" Grant said.\n\"That would be a very big decision for an opposition that got into government to make. It's convenient for them with a political view now. The reality of damaging the goodwill created by people who want to invest in this city, that's a big play.\n\"It's a much bigger play than just getting football fields for rugby league elite competitions to be played on.\n\"One of the things that's in the minds of decision makers for the government is to attain Sydney's No.1 position as a destination and to attract investment. The secret to everyone being better off is to create investment.\n\"These to me are an investment, getting money coming into the city. That's a very big deal that manifests in a lot of ways. We'll all be better off if we can attract that.\n\"To not make this decision is quite significant because you would lose a lot of the ability to attract long-term investment.\"\nThe NRL grand final will again be up for grabs if the ANZ and Allianz stadiums don't get the funding required to rebuild them from scratch.\n\"Ultimately, the job of the Australian Rugby League Commission and the NRL is to maximise revenues to the game,\" Grant said.\n\"We need to maximise distributions to stakeholders.

The company will start testing its new fleet of \u2018robotaxis\u2019 on roads in March of next year according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. From early spring, two of Nissan\u2019s new \u2018Leaf\u2019 cars, equipped with cameras and an array of self-driving sensors, will start to be a regular fixture on the streets around Nissan\u2019s Tokyo HQ. \nDuring the first stage of testing the Leafs will still have a human \u2018safety driver\u2019 in the vehicle to offset any risk of early teething problems with Nissan\u2019s latest technology. The world is expected to see the end result of testing in the form of a driverless fleet of Nissan taxis called \u2018Easy Ride\u2019 servicing the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. \nThe driverless technology that Nissan\u2019s robotaxi fleet will use is being developed in partnership with Nikkei 225-listed tech company DeNa Co. The initial period of testing will allow members of the public to participate. Early adopters keen to sample some of the latest technology in the world will be able to summon one of the cars from a handful of pick-up points and travel to one of several designated drop-off locations. The initial limits on pick up and drop off locations means the cars will travel a set number of routes. This will reduce the potential variables the driverless technology has to cope with while any kinks in the system are ironed out. \nDespite the fact that precautions are being taken by having a safety driver present during the first testing phase and sticking to a limited number of well-travelled routes, Nissan and DeNa Co., are confident their technology is close to ready. Several other big international auto makers are also in the race to be among the first to launch genuinely driverless vehicles. In the U.S., Waymo, the company that started out as Google\u2019s self-driving cars project, has been ferrying passengers around Phoenix in self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans since early this year. \nNissan\u2019s fleet will not only be able to take clients to a destination they know they want to go to. Technology included in the robotaxis\u2019 armoury will also mean the driverless cabs will be able to give tourists less familiar with Tokyo a helping hand. If the passenger tells the car what they would like to do, instead of giving an exact drop-off location, the robotaxi will suggest destinations and provide some background information.

His divorced mum Margaret, her friend Ray and his bestie Pritti support him, but his dad, his school and some of his classmates don\u2019t approve. He\u2019s befriended and coached by Hugo, a former drag queen, now owner of a shop supplying drag outfits, and starts developing an act for an invited audience at the local drag club where three other drag queens also provide advice and support. The showcase goes ahead, followed by the even bigger challenge of the prom.\nDan Gillespie Sells score and Tom Macrae\u2019s book and lyrics are excellent; they bring a fresh pop sound, rather than a bog standard musicals one, the style of songs changing to match the characters. Kate Prince\u2019s choreography is simply terrific, again fresh rather than standard musicals movement. The school scenes in particular have extraordinary authenticity and high energy. I liked Anna Fleischle\u2019s design, with projections by Luke Halls, and it\u2019s staged with great pace by Jonathan Butterell.\nIt seems like a very happy cast, visibly enthusiastic, many of them transferring from Sheffield with the show. Lucie Shorthouse is outstanding as Pritti, comfortable with both her Muslim culture and Jamie\u2019s personal choices. The relationship between Jamie and his mum is at the heart of the show and Josie Walker invests a lot of emotional energy into Margaret, with her big second act song feeling like a big hug from your mum. Mina Anwar is lovely as the ballsy Ray, who\u2019s love for Margaret and Jamie knows no bounds. John McRea towers over all of this with a supremely confident, passionate performance; an astonishing West End debut.\nI watched the documentary after seeing the show and it proves it\u2019s very faithful to Jamie\u2019s story. The show\u2019s message of tolerance, of everyone being allowed to be who they are, comes over loud and clear in what is clearly a populist and critical success. Lets hope it\u2019s a commercial success too, so that we can get more fresh air like this into the West End.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

claimed that the State government had totally failed to stop \u2018dalali\u2019 of paddy in the last 14 years\nTaking a dig at the State government, Congress has demanded Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into all scams and irregularities committed in the last 14 years in the Department of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection.\nTalking to mediapersons at Congress Bhavan here on Wednesday, former Minister and senior Congress leader Mohammad Akbar alleged that over Rs 11,000 crore paddy scam took place in 14 years in the state.\nIrregularities are being reported from all levels like purchase of paddy, transportation of paddy, custom milling and storage of rice at godowns of the FCI.\nThere is a nexus between the officers and leaders of the ruling party in the state. So no action is being taken by the State government against corrupt officers guilty in paddy scams committed at Kunkuri, Balodabazaar, Bhatapara and other places of the state, he said.\n\u201cThe State government agencies are not capable to inquire about these scams. So a CBI inquiry should be conducted into these scams,\u201d the Congress leader added. Citing former Chhattisgarh BJP In-charge and present Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan\u2019s statement-\u201cBJP leaders should not do dalali of paddy\u201d, Mohammad Akbar claimed that the State government had totally failed to stop \u2018dalali\u2019 of paddy in the last 14 years.\nCommenting over the statement of Minister for Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Punnulal Mohile, who highlighted the achievements of his department, the Congress leader alleged that corruption is at peak in the State.\nAkbar further claimed that Global Positioning System (GPS) had not been installed in vehicles engaged in transportation of paddy and rice to trace the locations even after assurance of Chief Minister Dr Raman Singh to install GPS in all the vehicles.\nFormer CPCC President Dhanendra Sahu said that the State government had issued an order, in which it has been mentioned that farmers should not take out water through pumps for irrigation of Rabi crops.

If you would like a good job for a reasonable price look up ITD in ohio. He can supply a Douglas barrel or use one you provide.\nIf you don't mind a road trip but would like to drop it off yourself there is Hart barrels just south of Syracuse. Hart is a barrel manufacturer and does installs as well.\nAnother good one is Larry Racine in Swanzey, NH, you will need to provide a barrel to Larry or wait until he orders one. He is more focused on target rifles but does a nice sporter as well. Larry is a character and a trip to his shop is rarely a quick one.\nI am sure there are several guys closer, but I have used both Hart and Racine with excellent results.\nThe collection of taxes which are not absolutely required, which do not beyond reasonable doubt contribute to public welfare, is only a species of legalized larceny.

Each vendor has their own preference for minimum barrel wall thickness. On my Model Seven the rebore to .358 would leave a muzzle thickness of .100\". Plenty enough for safety. But, not everybody that rebores will work with a barrel that thin. One reason why often times I prefer to rebarrel rather than rebore as I can end up with a lighter barrel profile.\n#12450763 - 12/07/17 Re: Model 7 243 converted to 358, need help!

It turned out that most of the leaks, speculations, and rumors about these devices were true. Both devices come in Black, Light Blue, Gold and Rose Gold colors and they are scheduled to go on sale by December 12 in China. Let us take a look at the details of these smartphones. \nXiaomi Redmi 5 \u2013 The Details The dual-sim Xiaomi Redmi 5 which weighs only 157 grams is powered by an Octa-Core Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 processor clocking 1.8GHz and built using the 14nm Mobile Platform. This processor is supported by 2GB RAM and 16GB of internal storage. There is also the 3GB RAM and 32GB internal storage option. The internal storage of both variants is expandable up to 128GB with a microSD. This smartphone is equipped with a 5.7-inch HD+ 2.5D curved glass display with 18:9 aspect ratio and 1440 \u00d7 720 pixels resolution. It runs on Android 7.1.2 (Nougat) with MIUI 9 on top and its display is handled by an Adreno 506 GPU. In the camera department, we have a 12MP rear camera with LED Flash, 1.25\u03bcm pixel size which is supported by a 5MP selfie camera with LED flash. The lights of the Redmi 5 are kept on by a 3300mAh battery which delivers 12-days standby and 2 days usage (average usage). Other features include a rear Fingerprint sensor, Infrared sensor, 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 ac (2.4GHz + 5GHz), Bluetooth 4.2, GPS + GLONASS and others.   Xiaomi Redmi 5 Price As for its pricing, the Xiaomi Redmi 5 (2GB RAM+16GB storage) sells for 799 yuan or $120 or Rs. 7,795 approx while the 3GB RAM+32GB storage variant goes for 899 Yuan $135 or Rs. 8,770 approx. Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus Specs The Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus comes with a dimension of 58.5 x 75.45 x 8.05mm and weighs 179.5grams. Just like the Redmi 5, it is a dual-sim smartphone but it is powered by a larger Octa-Core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor clocking 2GHz and built using a 14nm process. It comes with two options in terms of RAM and internal storage. We have a 3GB RAM and 32GB internal storage variant and another 4GB RAM with a 64GB storage option. The internal storage of both variants is expandable up to 128GB with a microSD. Its display is larger than its sibling as it comes with a 5.99-inch HD+ 2.5D curved glass display with 18:9 aspect ratio and 2160 \u00d7 1080 pixels resolution. It also runs on Android 7.1.2 (Nougat) with MIUI 9 on top and its display is handled by an Adreno 506 GPU. The camera department and other features are the same as Redmi 5 Plus above but the lights of this smartphone are kept on by a large 4000 mAh battery which gives 17 days standby and over 2 days usage (average usage). Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus Price As for its pricing, the Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus (3GB RAM+32GB storage) sells for 999 Yuan or $151 or Rs. 9,745 approx while the 4GB RAM+64GB storage variant goes for 1299 Yuan $195 or Rs. 12,675 approx. From these, we see that the major advantage of Redmi 5 Plus over its sibling Redmi 5 is in its better processor, larger screen/size, and larger battery.

Throughout his junior & senior years he got into drugs, hanging with shady kids, etc. Long story short he blew all his opportunities and got arrested multiple times for possession. I even had to bail him out once. He'd get so desperate he'd steal coins out of my mom's coin jar in her room. He even stole shit from me to pawn that I inherited from my grandfather. He stole my stepdad's power tools in the garage, pawned those. He stole my mom's car (twice), got found by the cops parked alongside some street in a subdivision with the car running, the door open, and him passed out at the steering wheel with his friends in the back seat passed out too.\nHe's got a job as an electrician's apprentice now by referral from my stepdad who had referred him at other companies for job and he no-called/no-showed.

Fantastic opportunity right? He started a year before me. I had taken the same course and by the time I'd graduated, he was still getting through his first year due to failed exams. Yes, we consumed a lot of drugs and partied damn hard, but whilst we all moved forward, he remained in the same year retaking the same modules. I don't think he ever quiet adjusted to taking exams and he was always on that stupid LoL game. I even tried super hard to get him to focus and pass his exams.

At the heart of his vision is the belief that capitalism could evolve into a less materialistic phase, providing that businesses see the light and turn their attention to serving consumers' \u2018higher needs\u2019. The Drum\u2019s assistant publisher Sam Scott put some further questions to Alain. \nThe Drum: Brands like Coca-Cola clearly trade on our desire for friendship, happiness, and so on. But many consumers share your suspicion that most brands are not, as you put it, \u201cdevoted to meeting the needs that their marketing people have so skilfully evoked\u201d. Could brands somehow get serious about satisfying these needs, or should they quit pretending? \nAlain de Botton: It\u2019s not black and white \u2013 many brands have no doubt \u2018hijacked\u2019 the purpose conversation or just gone at it clumsily like Pepsi. But for many other brands it\u2019s perhaps a choice where the opportunity is to innovate and grow what they offer. For example, we worked with Capital One, an American bank, to develop a series of workshops for their customers on how to tackle the really tricky emotional topics around money \u2013 how to discuss it with your partner, how to get into good habits for saving, and so on. This is a genuinely helpful service and a totally new business area for a bank to pursue. \nThe traditional division between product or service innovation and marketing is now out of date, and many companies are seeing that investing in nice superficial ads without adapting the core product or service is not a good long term strategy; consumers are getting much more cynical about brands who just rely on advertising to sell a product that doesn\u2019t really help improve our lives \u2013 at least in some small way. \nIn your article you claim that capitalism has (in many parts of the world) met our basic needs, but that it has failed to serve our \u2018higher order needs\u2019: love, belonging, self-esteem, self-development, to name a few. To some it might seem distasteful or even immoral to expect private firms to operate within these traditionally intimate, and in many cases \u2018free\u2019, domains. How would you go about convincing them otherwise? \nThe first thing to say is that there are many goods and services available that genuinely meet people\u2019s higher needs, and which do so for a price: things like private psychotherapy, continued adult education, membership to museums and social clubs, and so on. This isn\u2019t new and few find it morally distasteful. So the problem isn\u2019t that it\u2019s wrong to provide for these needs for a fee; it\u2019s that as a society we haven\u2019t yet figured out how to provide for these higher needs consistently and at scale \u2014 capitalism is still very young in this area. \nThese are huge and very pressing human needs (not to mention business opportunities) that have so far been largely relegated in terms of sector to charities, non-profits, and individual providers. Which is really a shame, because larger brands can often provide greater choice and consistent quality \u2013 and people\u2019s money would often be better spent on goods and services like these rather than another car or a weekend trip. \nBusinesses also need to get over their fear that they can\u2019t make money in these areas. We need to move past the idea that when it comes to business we face a choice between making \u2018bad\u2019 profit and doing good \u2018charitable\u2019 things (often through a CSR team). Often it\u2019s quite the opposite, and companies doing virtuous things by treating higher-order needs are doing a lot better. If you look at Unilever\u2019s portfolio of brands for example \u2013 the ones which are to some extent addressing \u2018higher order needs\u2019 \u2013 even in fairly small ways, are doing noticeably better. In other words \u2013 there is money to be made here, and there is good to be done. \nYou imply that capitalism could evolve to tackle environmental concerns when you write, \u201cIf we could just address our deeper needs more directly, our materialism would be refined and restrained\u201d. If the economy were to grow into the higher needs space, might the extraction of natural resources plateau, or even fall, as we realise we no longer want the fidget spinner in the window? \nI\u2019m not the only one \u2013 many commentators have suggested that the future for many brands might be selling less of better quality stuff. That\u2019s not to say I\u2019m entirely against materialism. Buying some things can help. But I am against the kind of materialism that is unrestrained and does us no good. \nIf we look at brands like Patagonia or Vitsoe for example, who design their products in such a way that they are intended to last a lifetime, they are environmentally sustainable of course \u2013 but they are also emotionally sustainable too in the sense that they that gently nudge us away from an anxiety inducing acquisitiveness. \nWhen goods and services that purport to improve people come onto the market they sometimes generate anxiety around new inequalities \u2013 the concern that consumer biotech will create a class of superhumans, for instance. Isn\u2019t it likely that many of the offerings you conceive of will be the preserve of the wealthy few? And because we are imagining products and services capable of altering us at a \u2018high\u2019 level, should we expect new forms of inequality between people to emerge? \nOf course someone who is on the breadline and struggling for work might have other concerns than self-actualisation; at The School Of Life we know that not everyone can afford everything we do (although we provide quite a lot of our most popular content for free, including hundreds of videos and our new app). But there are still very good reasons to provide these types of services (even when it costs a bit of money) to those who can afford it. \nThe wealthier are in a way the bellwether for us all \u2013 they are showing us a future for all of us to aspire to; what they choose to focus on helps shift cultural values. Those who can afford these services can also have a big influence on the future \u2013their introspection should help generate policies and businesses that are good for everyone. \nUltimately, if self-development is done right we never just develop for ourselves. We also develop in relation to other people and help them too \u2013 whether that\u2019s emotionally, socially or in other ways \u2013 thereby reducing some key forms of social division and inequality in the process. \nDoes the concept of a market that serves our needs for things like self-development and belonging presuppose more free time than most of us have? Perhaps many of us remain unfulfilled because we don't have adequate free time to participate in our communities, make and sustain great friendships, explore and develop our talents, and so on? \nOf course, but most of us have more time than we think. We spend loads of time on the internet, attending \u2018obligations\u2019 we don\u2019t really care about, or working long hours on a job we hate because we\u2019re too afraid to try something new, or dealing with people we find difficult because it\u2019s tricky to set clear and firm boundaries. Sometimes we need self-development in order to realise we\u2019re spending our time poorly \u2013 so for many people, making time for self-development allows them to then make time for a lot else as well.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alain de botton", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sam scott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "coca-cola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "csr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unilever", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "school of life", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pepsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "school of life", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "patagonia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:29.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "69991508d7ddc3f36da3e1b6ce95f1170f32f974", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W71RMVnhXXMoULNS.T9zDJSCwfZDBHD1lTmTZzQrVJrwWChij01wM35m8wFaYgY3VhHiRync1jyD3VET9xO4eE_hsHRxkG2IRw--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Ask Reddit...", "title": "What's the fastest way you've seen someone fuck up their life?", "title_full": "What's the fastest way you've seen someone fuck up their life? : AskReddit", "published": "2017-12-06T15:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 192, "participants_count": 170, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "44599ad54831b574257281665f5a6525b044d155", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W71RMVnhXXMoULNS.T9zDJSCwfZDBHD1lTmTZzQrVJrwWChij01wM35m8wFaYgY3VhHiRync1jyD3VET9xO4eE_h5d2yt_mGnY7oUJ4OvXOd3Rk2XwGR1.k-", "ord_in_thread": 184, "author": "ReauLeau", "published": "2017-12-07T10:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Does Kevin Spacey count?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:29.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d2d7effe21425a59ebfc2c0ed27d43303975d6c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UfwkTU22zBuCZiaZdWD2BDdj3_nY6X6qZXo2BTfxlyktma09GS53t_uIZN65yTgcVz8WnpB_6LSnEM0vYYVs7WTY2xW5cz.hulV6K4lnJp2Ug--", "site_full": "damontucker.com", "site": "damontucker.com", "site_section": "http://damontucker.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "legal_issues"], "section_title": "Hawaii News and Island Information", "title": "Six Hawai\u2018i Students Receive Culinary Scholarships", "title_full": "Six Hawai\u2018i Students Receive Culinary Scholarships", "published": "2017-12-07T06:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d2d7effe21425a59ebfc2c0ed27d43303975d6c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UfwkTU22zBuCZiaZdWD2BDdj3_nY6X6qZXo2BTfxlyktma09GS53t_uIZN65yTgcVz8WnpB_6LSnEM0vYYVs7WTY2xW5cz.hulV6K4lnJp2Ug--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Damon", "published": "2017-12-07T06:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "Six Hawai\u2018i Students Receive Culinary Scholarships", "text": "Six Hawai\u2018i Students Receive Culinary Scholarships   \nThe American Culinary Federation Kona Kohala Chefs Association awarded six $2,000 scholarships Saturday, Dec. 2, 2017, at the Christmas with the Chefs gala on the grounds of Courtyard King Kamehameha\u2019s Kona Beach Hotel on Hawai\u2018i Island.
