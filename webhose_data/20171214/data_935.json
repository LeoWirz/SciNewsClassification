This is the first platform in the world that offers P2P service for direct trading of cryptocurrency of any volume or kind (bitcoin, altcoin, etc.) CoinPlace is eBay for the whole variety of cryptocurrencies and tokens. It is PayPal for new businesses based on the ICO model. \nNow users buying crypto assets face a number of challenges: high service fees, loss of anonymity while working with exchanges, a time consuming verification process, complex user interfaces that most exchanges use (see, this one for example), and a very limited number of payment methods. \nAs a result people who are unfamiliar with the crypto market, get a feeling that it is impossible to enter the market off the street and that \u201cthis whole subject is too complicated and incomprehensible, you try to make sense of this crypto enigma\u201d Founders of CoinPlace platform themselves walked the same path several years ago. \nAfter studying the subject thoroughly they founded the Cryptocurrency Investment Fund Nakamoto Capital. Having been successfully operating for a year they have finally decided to hold an ICO of their own platform.CoinPlace CEO George Blagov says \u201cby the end of this year we are planning to operate with more than 100 digital assets, and in five years to hold more than 50 percent of the ICO tokens market and more than 40 percent of P2P crypto assets trading market. \nThe team of CoinPlace has a rather ambitious goal \u2013 to bring the crypto market into mainstream and to make it universally accessible. \nThe visionary and the founder of the project Stan Teo emphasizes the difficulties currently awaiting any participant in crypto economy. \u201cToday only one percent of people in the world who have the financial resources can buy ICO tokens because they know how. With the help of CoinPlace we want to increase this number to 50-70 percent. \nOn top of that, people have to use several third party organisations (banks or exchanges) to buy altcoins with fiat currency. This means excessive service fees, a time consuming verification process and delayed reception of funds. CoinPlace platform allows anyone to trade crypto assets in just a few clicks directly avoiding the middleman. Moreover, any beginner will be able to buy any digital currency or tokens also in just a few clicks, and we will help them make an informed decision as to which asset is worth acquiring.\u201d \n\u0421oinPlace is not just an idea, it is already a functioning product (at alpha testing stage). Its market already exists and is growing rapidly. CoinPlace business model implicates that it will meet operating revenue in six months. \nIn summary, CoinPlace provides an opportunity to securely exchange digital assets. All transactions are made directly between users, and the platform acts as an escrow. The project team ensures the security of transactions via smart contracts with minimal oversight of the buying and selling process. \n\u201cWe are also implementing an innovational system beneficial to both buyers and sellers: it will allow to trade real crypto assets below the exchange price. We are now testing three radically new protocols that we plan to gradually implement in our project within eight months after launch of the platform\u201d says George Blagov. \n\u201cWe are going to change the whole crypto world for the better, and provide easier access to this world. For that we need to substantially simplify all operations for every participant of crypto processes to enable more people who now have no access to the crypto market to invest in an ICO\u201d explains Stan Teo. \u201cWe will give them an opportunity to buy tokens not just with crypto assets as is currently possible, but with fiat money.\u201d \nCoinPlace is excited to announce that it supports almost every means of \u04202\u0420 payments: from interbank transfers to quasi cash and payments through Contact or WesternUnion. \nProject leaders believe that precisely such a symbiosis of payment methods, fiat and crypto assets, the combination of simple and familiar with the new and complex, promotion of the Cryptoeconomics phenomenon itself, and informative explanation of its benefits, is the most direct way to develop the new digital economy \u2013 a new relationship between people and the crypto world. \nPerhaps due to CoinPlace the crypto geek community will lose its aura of elitism, and the phenomenon of crypto knowledge will no longer be inaccessible and incomprehensible. Crypto economy will become user-friendly, uncomplicated, easy to understand and secure. At least that is what the members of CoinPlace team strive to achieve. \nVisit coinplace.info for details. \nContact us for more information: Or +7 (977) 775 51 46 or + 7 (917) 577 81 81Oxana Ivanchenko \nOur company collects the information and distributes it to the press from all over the world. \nVandal Media CenterRussia, Moscow, 9 Maslovka Sttel. +79175778181 \nThis release was published on openPR.

The accumulation of our online footprint and its collection could be called the \u201cbig data\u201d but how big is the Big Data in reality?\nNote : The relevance of the information is based on the country of interest, as legal standards for data collection differ between countries. For the purpose of this discussion, our primary focus will be on the United States and Great Britain.\nWhat We Are Aware Of First, let\u2019s talk about the data that we are aware is collected within legal norms. Most of this data is the type that we give away consensually. For example, we know that loyalty cards are used to collect data about our shopping patterns, but we do not consider it to be an issue because we know that this data is used to optimize our shopping experience, cater ads to us, and we give us bonus points.\nWe also realize that our online browsing information is regularly collected so that advertisements we see and services we use are adjusted to our interests.\nWe are also aware that the government keeps record of demographic and legal characteristics of the population for security and public organization reasons. But what are the legal types of data collection methods that are around us and that we don't pay attention to?\nGovernments Anyone who has ever thought about their online browsing privacy has heard about NSA and GCHQ (British apprentice). When these names are mentioned, we feel very insecure about our privacy. But let's discuss publicly available information about the types of data these organizations can collect legally, on a subject that is not involved in criminal activity that needs special attention.\nWiretapping is a 20th-century tool for intelligence collection, but it has been adapted to the modern environment. Snowden leaks provide the information about the bulk data collection that GCHQ and NSA are involved in. On the most basic level, GCHQ taps into the fiber networks carrying the data about phone and internet use (this operation is called Tempora), meaning that they have access to not just metadata (such as who is communicating with whom, what devices, etc.), but to the actual content, too. Content may include emails, internet browsing information, Facebook messages, and recorded phone calls. This data is stored for a month for analysis and, if needed, transferred to NSA because of the joint cooperation effort. If you thought that NSA was the biggest player in the data collection, it might be a surprise that GCHQ collects more metadata than NSA. As leaked documents were reviewed by The Guardian :\n\u201cThe documents reveal that by last year GCHQ was handling 600m 'telephone events' each day, had tapped more than 200 fiber-optic cables and was able to process data from at least 46 of them at a time.\u201d Once again, it is important to highlight that this is not the data of people who are suspects in any crime, but of anyone. In response to this monitoring/spying program, a case has been filed in the European court of human rights, but it is important to understand that GCHQ and NSA operate within the legislative loopholes. For example, GCHQ can only collect the data that is entering from outside Britain, but due to modern internet infrastructure, even the data that is sent and received by individuals within a country goes outside of it and then reenters.\nNow let's talk more about NSA. NSA's program XKEYSCORE collected data about internet users' emails, messages, images, passwords and even VOIP. Similarly to GCHQ, this is achieved by intercepting fiber optic cables. The content of the data is stored for a short period while metadata remains for months. The sites for the \"interception\" are located not just in the U.S. but all around the globe. If you have a sweet tooth, it will be hard to accept \u2014 cookies that are constantly created actually create our online identity, which helps NSA identify the user in the vast amount of collected data. Cookies are created for our own browsing convenience as well as company usage (ads, etc.). See the technical representation of NSA's XKEYSCORE . In summary, the main tool used for bulk data collection is interception of transatlantic fiber-optic cables.\nMonitoring Now that we know how NSA and GCHQ collect bulk data on the most basic level, let's talk about the implications. There are two primary concepts: privacy and security. Governments say that the cyber counterintelligence is necessary to monitor illegal activities and prevent terrorism. Ex-director of NSA Keith Brian Alexander stated in 2013 that so far NSA bulk data collection and phone interception programs helped avoid more than 50 terrorist events. The information about these events is not published as it may compromise NSA's strategies for dealing with terrorism.\nThe data collection also helps address online crime such as selling illegal substances and piracy. As the methods of obtaining pirated and non-pirated material, through torrenting or streaming on FireTV using external applications , become simpler, companies and governments take more effort to address it.\nIn theory, although the abuse of data is possible, the cases are not very frequent. Since the actual content is only stored for a short period because of its sheer size and metadata for months, we could say that our privacy is compromised to that extent. However, it is important to consider that this data goes through machine analysis and if no suspicious activity is detected, it is later discarded. So the actual identification of a user does not happen until the suspicious patterns in the online ID are detected. So, in reality, we are compromising our short-term privacy for security, and it is not as if our whole online footprint is accessible at the click of a button because of bulk data collection (at least for now).\nAlternative Big Data Use In collaboration with Peter Thiel\u2019s Palantir , the U.S. government is using big data to do something that would have been considered impossible. They are using crime data to predict future crime events and catch repeat offenders.\nGovernmental support for agricultural research and data collection also helps create higher yields for products. In general, governments could and should use big data analysis for every public service, given that it is cost-efficient. Beginning with education (understanding what works best for students), public healthcare (analyzing the implications of different medications and diseases), transportation, city planning and analysis of different public policies. This can improve the quality of the medication and diagnosis, improve the satisfaction of public towards governmental policies, create better-planned cities and increase return on investment in education. In reality, the positive effects of big data usage by governments can be tremendous and widespread across multiple industries.\nConclusion When discussing governments and big data, we often focus on the surveillance data, which is important for a country\u2019s security and global cyber stance. This is important, as it helps address terrorism before it happens, as well as helps track suspects in illegal activities. This is achieved at the cost of compromising individual privacy to a certain extent. Opinions on whether or not this practice is acceptable can vary, but one outcome is clear. There is a large potential for governments to utilize big data in order to improve the quality of life in a country. Directing more effort towards this matter would be more acceptable, as the data collection methods in these cases are less intrusive as well, although the cases of NSA\u2019s data abuse are not frequent and one could argue that they do not exist.

The project was listed as the top project in the Equity and Royalty Acqusition section of the news release. I have copy and pasted the details bellow. It's nothing we don't already know. I just salivate at the closing statement that I have highlighted. I feel like to do an NI-43-101 we will need to drill more holes than we currently have capital. I believe events are coming that will fasciliate one more capital raise at a dollar amount significnatly higher than the most recent raise. I think this will occur in early 2018 after we slowly appreciate along with the price of Zinc to inexcess of $1.00/share. This has bought deal, big money in the future written all over it!!\nEquity and Royalty Portfolio Addition Activity\nIn addition to the investments described above, concurrent with a royalty based financing, the Corporation subscribed for 14,200,000 equity units of Wolfden Resources Corporation at C$0.25 per unit, which includes a half warrant exercisable at C$0.35 for 5 years. These units were acquired after the end of the quarter and are not included in the portfolio value described above. The royalty and equity financing facilitated Wolfden\u2019s acquisition of the Pickett Mountain VMS base metal project in Maine. Pickett Mountain features very high-grade zinc-lead-copper-silver mineralization in historic drill holes and Wolfden intends to carry out an aggressive exploration program and to prepare a NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate . Additional details are available at http://www.wolfdenresources.com/files/News-Nov16-2017.pdf .\nDo the math, we need money to do this. The money WLF needs is not in their accounts....Yet. But you know the bod here has unprecidented access to capital. Next raise is done at near or over $1.00 mark my words!! Maybe higher if Zinc is raging and the historic grades keep up in definition and expansion drilling!!\nZincboy1", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wolfdenresources.com%2Ffiles%2FNews-Nov16-2017.pdf&esheet=51719995&newsitemid=20171122005282&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wolfdenresources.com%2Ffiles%2FNews-Nov16-2017.pdf&index=2&md5=021cd69abe3596285b46f959be08e6cb", "http://www.wolfdenresources.com/files/News-Nov16-2017.pdf"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:25:00.051+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a7ae598f18fc7d83da80941265ffb07084074bda", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9zKytBPrqRTdGW8VMKnULjv.3UrUflphjUyUA3wmskLwh3JLJFlr5NNIpQSAz7RQRmYHdUf66OXg1.dxM17_O8", "site_full": "www.cafepharma.com", "site": "cafepharma.com", "site_section": "http://www.cafepharma.com/boards/forums/abbvie.838/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "AbbVie | Cafepharma Message Boards | Pharma Sales, Device Sales, Lab Sales", "title": "WH Expansion | Page 2", "title_full": "WH Expansion | Page 2 | Cafepharma Message Boards | Pharma Sales, Device Sales, Lab Sales", "published": "2017-11-16T16:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.cafepharma.com/boards/styles/rogue/xenforo/avatars/avatar_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3b1e6eff84828deaed25148aaecc4688900f39fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9zKytBPrqRTdGW8VMKnULjv.3UrUflphjUyUA3wmskLwh3JLJFlr5NNIpQSAz7RQRmYHdUf66OXmwiinJXoBhJ2QBjicxXFVH2UQzNkHFp8Q--", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "Buck Ofama", "published": "2017-12-07T05:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "anonymous said: \u2191 you don't need experience.

Here goes the question. I plan to use a small 24v DC motor, 315rpm free spin, 220rpm under load, 4Ncm stall torque. When spinning freely, it draws less than 50mA current, at max torque it draws 120mA. My goal is to make the dc motor stop spinning when it reaches specific load, torque, external resistance, lets say at about 3.5Ncm, it stalls at 4Ncm. My assumption is that the dc motor itself draws from 50mA up to 120mA current dependind on the load, the biger the external load, the more current it draws. So if I need it to stop just about before its max torque (120mA), I should set it to stop spinning when the current reaches around 100-110mA. Stronger current - bigger load, right?!? The motor will otherwise be controlled by an on/off switch. As a bonus, it would be nice if I could make a 3-way switch, to have 3 preset points at which the motor would stop spinning, i.e. at 70mA, 90mA and 110mA, but thats highly optional. I hope I presented all the necessary specifications, if I am missing something, please let me know. So, is this doable, if it is, how can I achieve it?

Eventually, the US might have to issue a domestic dollar for the impoverished citizens of the USA which they could use only at a steep discount to buy gold or SDRs to pay for imports.\nThe Chinese have their own international money transfer system to replace America\u2019s SWIFT. It is called CIPS (Cross-Border Interbank Payment System.)\nThe Saudis cannot sell Aramco as an IPO in America because, thanks to our politicians, American lawyers have frozen their assets through judicial orders. The Saudis need to sell Aramco because they are desperate for the money. The Saudis have been lying about their oil reserves. The reserves are not there.\nIn fact the Yemen war is a Saudi attempt to steal Yemen\u2019s untapped oil. If China can persuade the Saudi kingdom to sell Aramco in part to them for US Treasury bonds, the Chinese will get rid of unwanted US paper and persuade the Saudis to sell oil for yuan. That would be a financial coup and send the US Federal Reserve Note into the dust bin of history. I do not expect that to happen until after Chinese New Year.\nAs for Jerusalem, instead of declaring war I think all 1.5 billion Muslims should refuse to use dollars whenever possible. They should buy gold and silver if they have the means. I think everyone in the anti-war movement should buy gold and silver as well.\nAbout 3 months ago insider trading in NYSE became one sided with some sectors recording 200 insider sells for every buy. The Plunge Protection team has to intervene daily to prop up bonds and stocks. There is a lot of money to be made when, not if, the market crashes. A stock analyst said the other day that for every 7 days a stock has risen it will take one day to go down. The rise from 2010 to today took 7 years and gave investors X dollars in profit. Now the table is set for short sellers with insider knowledge to make that same X dollars in a year or less.\nBe prepared. Housing markets are crashing. The dollar even if devalued as it has been is suffering from a widening trade imbalance. People don\u2019t want to buy weapons from losers. They want Russian missiles and anti-missile systems. And nobody wants our GMO agriculture. We are headed to a round of devaluations, lower wages and rising prices. My prediction for Nationwide Food Riots will come true as soon as the world begins that transition away from the dollar to the SDR. 120 million Americans will soon enough be too poor to buy food. But they will still have 350 million guns and 11 billion bullets.\nChina will pull the plug on America after their New Years. That could be when the Petrodollar Dies and the American Empire of Debt crashes with it.\nBe prepared. Buy gold, silver and food. Start a garden.\nJerusalem, Damascus, Tehran, Moscow and Beijing have all become stumbling blocks for Wall Street and the Jewish Lobby.\nI might have voted for Trump as Hillary was the only real alternative but that does not mean I have to support moving our embassy to Jerusalem.\nI expect major changes to be made public by China after February 16th though we could have a market correction after the December 13th FOMC meeting. I do expect a major decline in stocks before election day 2018. That will both enrich Wall Street and give electoral strength to the Democrats who are thoroughly opposed to arresting people who commit treason, sell out American workers and rob taxpayers by the trillions.\nIf you don\u2019t believe that last claim, read this:\n$21 Trillion Went Missing From 2 US Agencies Since 1998.\nhttps://vidrebel.wordpress.com/2017/10/03/21-trillion-went-missing-from-2-us-agencies-since-1988/ \nThe CIA has made trillions over the years selling illegal drugs and weapons.

Flynn, President Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, told a former business associate that economic sanctions against Russia would be \u201cripped up\u201d as one of the Trump administration\u2019s first acts, according to an account by a whistle-blower made public on Wednesday.\nMr. Flynn believed that ending the sanctions could allow a business project he had once participated in to move forward, according to the whistle-blower. The account is the strongest evidence to date that the Trump administration wanted to end the sanctions immediately, and suggests that Mr. Flynn had a possible economic incentive for the United States to forge a closer relationship with Russia.\nMr. Flynn had worked on a business venture to partner with Russia to build nuclear power plants in the Middle East until June 2016, but remained close with the people involved afterward. On Inauguration Day, according to the whistle-blower, Mr. Flynn texted the former business associate to say that the project was \u201cgood to go.\u201d\nThe account is detailed in a letter written by Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. In the letter, Mr. Cummings said that the whistle-blower contacted his office in June and has authorized him to go public with the details. He did not name the whistle-blower.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/...IQ7f56gRz?amp=1#click=https://t.co/fIQ7f56gRz Click to expand... and another ABC type story but from the NYT.

Why pay someone who might charge more to spend 3x longer making sure a translation is beautiful and perfect, when you can just hire a guy that will slam out a quick translation and get as much work done as fast as possible?\nThe fact is that most people that watch anime on Netflix don't give a fuck . Who cares if the translation is bad if 99% of the audience will watch it on Netflix regardless? Yeah there are people like me and a few of my friends that will deliberately avoid Netflix releases, but we are definitely the minority. Most people don't notice that the subs are bad and can't be bothered to torrent the anime when they can just watch it on Netflix. Why doesn't Netflix hire fansubbers?

For Muslims, the city is the third holy land after Mecca and Madinah. \nAzril hence called on the United Nations Security Council to intervene and reaffirm the position of Jerusalem as subject to a final agreement between Palestine and Israel, consistent with international law and universal human rights principles. \n\"CENTHRA also urges the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation to meet on this issue, and take drastic and resolute steps in view of the US move, including a review and if possible, downgrading or severance of ties with the United States over the same. \n\"The US must be made to know that its recent action in this regard has consequences and these are not to be taken lightly,\" he stressed. \u2014 Bernama Related articles", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "azril mohd amin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "azril", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "human rights research and advocacy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "organisation of islamic cooperation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judaism", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernama related", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recognising jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine-israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mecca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:25:03.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c54656db103d0dd7fb9722d9ea7046d95d46ee8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLtZqyWX0qjG7JfzyJpLnqoVorzUJQr7DpQ6rBoLyJnYckJg5jC9fchfwIG3pWMHQg4ZTn1gkyxSHHUKhYjd5VgIAtJB6M1Ydlk-", "site_full": "stackoverflow.com", "site": "stackoverflow.com", "site_section": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/java?page=171&sort=newest&pagesize=30&days=7", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Newest 'java' Questions - Page 171 - Stack Overflow", "title": "c++ - Is std::any_of required to follow short circuit logic? - Stack Overflow", "title_full": "c++ - Is std::any_of required to follow short circuit logic? - Stack Overflow", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=73d79a89bded", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 51, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d0cdc5ef7be2fe81f37578093ec3b6f7abb01a30", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLtZqyWX0qjG7JfzyJpLnqoVorzUJQr7DpQ6rBoLyJnYckJg5jC9fchfwIG3pWMHQg4ZTn1gkyxSHHUKhYjd5VgIU9xmM2J7qew-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "answered 24 mins ago", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Taking into account the names of the algorithms\nall_of , any_of , none_of\nit is evident that they introduce logical operations on elements of containers like Logical AND, logical OR and Negation.\nSo for example all_of means that there is evaluated sequentially the following condition\npred( numbers[0] ) && pred( numbers[1] ) && pred( numbers[2] ) && pred( numbers[3] ) && pred( numbers[4] )\nWhat is the sense to evaluate for example pred( numbers[1] ) if pred( numbers[0] ) was evaluated already to false ?\nTo apply a function to all elements of a container there is already standard algorithm std::for_each .\nFor example it si clear enough from the description of the algorithm std::any_of\n1 Returns: false if [first, last) is empty or if there is no iterator i in the range [first, last) such that pred(*i) is true, and true otherwise.\nthat if at least one element of a sequence satisfies the predicate pred(*i) then the algorithm returns true .

care. \nStaff at Premier Travel\u2019s Halstead office, in High Street, are running the appeal until Wednesday, December 20 in a bid to bring a smile to disadvantaged youngsters this Christmas. \nThe travel agent is asking for new toys or other gifts to be donated that would be suitable for any new born baby and children up to the age of 16. \nDonations can be left directly at the office. \nOnce the appeal deadline has passed, a representative from social services will then collect all of the gifts that have been donated and aim to hand them out to children in time for Christmas. \nBranch manager Sarah Colson said: \u201cChristmas is such a special time of year, particularly for children, and we always try to contribute wherever we can to make the day extra special for those less fortunate. \n\u201cWe have launched our Santa\u2019s Sack appeal once again in order to collect donations for children in care, who might not receive a present at Christmas. \n\u201cAny contributions, no matter how big or small, will be greatly received and much appreciated.\u201d \nFor further information contact Premier Travel\u2019s Halstead branch on 01787 473452 or visit their website at

Stauff supplies all the necessary components for fixing Standard series C-profile rails by stud welding \nIncredibly simple and quick: fastening Standard Series C-profile rails by stud welding \nIn response to customer requirements from different sectors, the fluid specialists at the Werdohl-based Stauff Group have extended their stud welding system with a further application for the secure and permanent fixing of tube, hose and cable clamps to substructures: Standard C-profile rails from the company\u2019s own TS range can now be fixed to systems using fibreglass-reinforced polyamide adapters specially developed for this purpose, without them having to be point-welded or welded along their entire length, as was the case up to now in conventional processes. The plastic adapters per se are simply placed on the stud weld, which has previously been attached to the unit; both can be screwed together using M6 x 10 hexagonal socket screws or half-round screws. \nUsers therefore benefit from significant time savings, hence also cost savings, ease of use and improved flexibility in the assembly of profile rails. There is also much less need for time-consuming reworking of welding points. A further benefit lies in the fact that it is possible to ensure that the installed rails have a gap of approximately 1.5 millimetres from the substructure, eliminating the risk of through standing water. \nTwo versions of plastic adapters are immediately available for insertion into the open ends of the profile rails. Apart from fixing individual rails in place, this also enables several rails to be connected to each other. \nStud welding is used in many sectors as the most economical fastening method for components and is sometimes even the only technically feasible solution. As the entire surface of the copper-plated stud is jointed to the substructure, the connection is very strong. There is also minimal material distortion due to the short welding time, relatively low use of energy and isolated thermal stress, with the result that the system can also be used on comparatively thin-walled metal sheets and heat-resistant substrates. \nIn addition to supplying the individual components \u2013 weld studs, a wide range of different clamp bodies and fastening hardware, including for clamping belts, cable ties or corrugated cable protection hoses \u2013 Stauff also offers the correspondingly designed assembly tools, including a weld inverter, weld gun with positioning tube, weld stud retainer and distance adapters. No high-voltage connection is required to use the simple and compact tool. \nAbout the STAUFF Group \nFor more than 50 years, the companies of STAUFF Group, since April 2015 also including VOSWINKEL, have been developing, manufacturing and distributing pipework equipment and hydraulic components for mechanical and plant engineering and for service and industrial maintenance. \nThe overall range currently includes about 40000 standard components in ten product groups as well as a large number of special and system solutions, which are manufactured to customer specifications or based on in-house developments. \nWholly owned manufacturing, sales and service facilities in 18 countries and a tight global network of authorised distribution partners ensure high presence and service paired with a maximum of availability. \nWith around 1350 employees worldwide, including 550 at five sites in Germany, the companies of STAUFF Group achieved external sales of over EUR 210 million in the business year 2016. \nPress ContactWalter Stauffenberg GmbH & Co.

He does all this while ranting about how he is saving a woman from \u201cLove Jihad\u201d. In a social media post, the suspect said it was a \u201cwarning\u201d to those who commit \u2018love jihad\u2019. \nInternet services have been stopped in Rajsamand to stop the two viral videos from circulating. The videos were posted by the accused. He also posted two other videos, one where he is in a temple and taking responsibility of the murder and another one is of he sitting near to a saffron flag and is giving a speech on \u2018love jihad\u2019 and \u2018Islamic jihad\u2019. State Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria says that the accused, who has been identified as Shambhu Lal Regar has been arrested. The Police suggest that the video has been made by a third person. \nThe police found a half burnt body on the roads of Rajsamand early morning and suspect that the body might of the victim, 48-year-old Mohammed Afrazul , a labourer from West Bengal\u2019s Malda and who was living in Rajasthan for the last 12 years. The video \nThe video shows Shambhu Lal, leading Afrazul somewhere. Then all of a sudden he flung his axe from behind, repeatedly hacking Afrazul. Loud wails and screams can be heard and that is where the video becomes impossible to watch. \nThen the deranged Shambu goes on a rant about how by killing Afrazul, he is saving a woman from \u201cLove Jihad\u201d, while he burns the body. All of this has been filmed by someone else as claimed by the police. The accused circulated the video on Whatsapp. \nAccording to NDTV , Home Minister Kataria said, \u201cIt is shocking how he killed the man and made a video of it.
