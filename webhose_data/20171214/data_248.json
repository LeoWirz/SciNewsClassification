Managment Today has recently posted an article on Sheryl personal experiances and feelings towards this matter. \u2018It\u2019s the power, stupid,\u2019 Sandberg wrote in a lengthy and revealing post in which she spoke of her own experience of unwanted advances in the workplace. \u2018I didn\u2019t work for any of these men. But in every single one of these situations, they had more power than I did,\u2019 Sandberg said. \u2018That\u2019s not a coincidence. It\u2019s why they felt free to cross that line.\u2019 Now, more than perhaps ever before, people are willing to hold perpetrators responsible. This is of course a good thing, but Sandberg said that companies need to heed this call to more systematic action to end abuses of power. \u2018Too many workplaces lack clear policies about how to handle accusations of sexual harassment,\u2019 Sandberg said. Only through clear and consistent policy can there be a working environment in which workers are comfortable coming forward. Ultimately, as Sandberg acknowledges, what will bring the most change is if more women are in positions of power. There is no reason why companies can\u2019t seize this watershed moment as an opportunity to make real change happen. Sandberg outlines six principles that can make this a reality from having a clear and consistent process for dealing with accusations to making it clear to all employees that they have a role to play in keeping workplaces safe.

RafCycle services were launched in Changshu on December 6, 2017 during a customer event. RafCycle is also being promoted at Labelexpo Asia in Shanghai on December 5-8. The first RafCycle partner certificate in China was awarded to Hangzhou Changli, which is a label converter established in 2010. \nHangzhou Changli is also the 100th RafCycle partner globally.The number of RafCycle partners has grown increasingly over the years as sustainability has become one of the key drivers in the labeling industry. Today more than 10 000 tons of label liner waste is being recycled in Europe through the RafCycle program. UPM Raflatac is actively searching for new RafCycle partners and the expansion to China is an important step in this process. \nThe paper liner waste generated by the RafCycle partners in China will be delivered to Hangzhou Fulun Ecology Technology Co., Ltd. where the paper liner waste can be recycled back into pulp and paper. \nRafCycle is an innovative recycling concept that offers a new life for label liner waste which provides numerous benefits to printers, packers, brand-owners, and, of course, the environment. Turning waste into a resource is a key concept in the circular economy and an important part of our approach to sustainability. \n'The recycling of wood fibres in paper products is a closed-loop solution and a shining example of sustainability at its best', says Sharon Xiao , Sustainability Manager, APAC, UPM Raflatac. 'We see sustainability as a key for success and a driver of innovation.' \nPhotos can be downloaded at the UPM Photo Library \u00bb \nFor further information please contact: \nSharon Xiao, Sustainability Manager, APAC, UPM Raflatac , tel. +8618521710666 \nUPM Raflatac \nUPM Raflatac is labeling a smarter future by developing innovative and sustainable labeling solutions complemented with world-class service.

To accommodate this, areas are broken up into stages, with the dungeon's stages being much shorter than other Zelda games. There are other small changes as well, such as items being found much more commonly and are swapped out, or in the case of Four Sword Adventures , small keys being carried. In addition, in a manner similar to The Adventure of Link , some instances have the player enter side-scrolling mode (eg, when entering a cave or falling down a pit), which either have a GBA screen pop up or force the players to look at the linked up Game Boy Advances (depending on whether the mode is single player or multi-player). Edit \nThe series' next installment, The Wind Waker , saw more breakthroughs in graphics and changes to the way the game is played through the dungeons. While many people were neither pleased nor impressed at first with series' creator Shigeru Miyamoto 's arguably different approach (Miyamoto's idea was actually to appeal to all ages with the advent of cel shading , not necessarily just a younger audience); the game retains in spades the same basic puzzle and other elements that have made the Zelda franchise so popular. In this installment, the dungeon idea got another renovation: as new items are introduced in the game, The Wind Waker proves once again that a new spin on an old idea can work. With every item Link obtains throughout the dungeons, new abilities become available, but the puzzles change more than ever to conform to the usability of the items, and the series has continued more this way since. This game also makes significant use of the ability to manipulate other crucial characters and inanimate objects (such as statues), adding another layer to the gameplay and challenging puzzle elements that are hallmarks of the series. Edit \nThe Minish Cap once again uses the top-down perspective of many of its predecessors, and the overall plot is to tell the backstory to Four Swords and Four Swords Adventures . Although Link once again gains the ability to split himself into up to four Links (as in the other two games), this game does not feature a multi-player mode, but the complexity of the dungeons once again takes a turn and keeps the player on his/her toes. Adding a new layer of puzzle challenge to the game is the Minish Cap , which allows Link to shrink to the tiny size of the Picori who inhabit most of Hyrule . This item and ability combination grants Link access to places he could never have gone before, such as inside certain enemies and into the homes of the Picori, who live in everything from mouse holes to shoes to tree stumps. However, this newfound freedom to go where he wants is replete with new dangers, too, from cats to giant ChuChus , which become deadly enemies when Link is only the size of the Picori. Most of the dungeons Link visits in this game require him to be this size\u2014or require that he shrink at certain places while he traverses the dungeons\u2014to either enter the dungeons or access otherwise inaccessible areas. Edit \nThe Legend of Zelda series is well known for its innovations in gameplay and advances in computer graphics technology, always stretching the limits of all that is currently known. Twilight Princess returns the player to the 3D perspective, but adds a new element of puzzle and gameplay: the ability Link gains to turn himself into a wolf. Certain puzzles can only be solved and obstacles overcome by Link when he is in wolf or human form. The items play a heavy role in puzzle specifications once again. Statue manipulation also returns to stretch the player's abilities and test his/her puzzle-solving skills.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "picori", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shigeru miyamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miyamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zelda", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "hyrule", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:05.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "74aba61f3cf3dc3bf9e30ef125cf41b4cb45925a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrersk20g92Ik50wchZ0ppzd2noApq11HTr93Ie3G5vVMAyUusyjeXo0kMPXAfV6xgTLLHLg5fCDMVoVayu12VZ", "site_full": "texashuntingforum.com", "site": "texashuntingforum.com", "site_section": "http://texashuntingforum.com/forum/ubbthreads.php/forums/2/1/", "site_categories": ["hunting_shooting", "sports"], "section_title": "Trading Post \u0096 Swap \u0096 Classifieds | Texas Hunting Forum", "title": "12 Full Body Pintail Decoys w/ bag -

It was gathered that the heavily armed gunmen numbering about three, stormed a popular viewing centre, Kaneworld Resort located at 17, Idak Okpo lane, Uyo where their target was watching the match and shot him dead. The incident was said to have occurred few minutes to the end of the Champions League matches between some big European clubs including Manchester United, Chelsea, Bayern Munich. An eyewitness, Effiong Akpan, said when the criminals entered the viewing centre, everybody was ordered to lie down, while the deceased struggled with his Infinix phone and was shot at close range. Akpan, a Manchester United fan, said the deceased, Dominic Ubiat, a final year Microbiology student from Ibiono Ibom Local Government Area, was shot on his groin at close range. Another witness said: \u201cHe ran with patches of blood from the viewing centre and was chased by the hoodlums to his house located at about 500 metres and died before help could reach him.\u201d It was gathered that youths of the area arrived a little too late to take him to the hospital where medics confirmed he died from excess loss of blood. His parents, Mr and Mrs Ubiat, who visited the scene of the incident yesterday, mourned that all the years of their son in the University was in vain and vowed to go the extra mile to avenge the death of their son. \u201cLook at the blood of my son,\u201d Mr. Ubiat stated, declaring that \u201cthe blood of my son shall haunt those behind this dastardly act of cowardice.\u201d The deceased\u2019s mother, accompanied by other family members, class and schoolmates, wondered why her son could be left to die after being shot. \u201cFrom every indication here, help did not come early enough, otherwise my son would have survived if he had been rushed to the hospital at the right time,\u201d the mother complained. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Elkana Bala, confirmed the report saying the incident was \u201ca pure robbery attack.\u201d He urged parents to be in the vanguard of instilling the essential values in their children and wards, noting that \u201ca situation whereby a student is seen at wrong places in the wee hours of the night left much to be desired.\n\u201cIn this kind of situation, there is little the Police could do because anybody must work towards helping himself first\u201d, he added. The PPRO said no arrest has been made yet calling on members of the public to always shun danger-prone areas in the late hours of the night.

Cheers and applause broke out as ministers voted in favour of the bill following hours of debate and emotional speeches at the House of Representatives. Only four MPs voted against the bill, the Australian media reported. \u201cThis is Australia: Fair, diverse, loving and filled for respect for everyone,\u201d said an effusive Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull as he introduced the bill for a final vote. \u201cWhat a day, what a day for love, for equality, for respect. Australia has done it!\u201d said Turnbull following the announcement. \u201cToday we\u2019ve voted for love, for equality. It\u2019s time for more marriages, more love, more respect. This belongs to us all.\u201d Labour Party leader Bill Shorten said the new law spoke for a modern Australia, \u201cinclusive and fair\u201d, 9news.com reported. Gay rights advocates praised the landmark vote even as they said it was long overdue. Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, a staunch critic of same-sex marriage, seemed to have softened. \u201cWhen it comes to same-sex marriage, some countries have introduced it via the courts, some via Parliament, and others \u2013 Ireland and now Australia \u2013 by vote of the people,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cAnd that is the best way because it resolves this matter beyond doubt or quibble.\u201d The bill will now go to Governor-General Peter Cosgrove for royal assent. The country is now the 24th in the world to allow same-sex couples to marry, according to Pew Research. The move follows a two-month national postal survey that showed 61 per cent of more than 12 million respondents were in favour of marriage equality. Australia\u2019s first same-sex weddings will not take place until at least January due to a longstanding requirement for all Australian couples to provide a full month\u2019s notice of their intention to get married. \nThe post Australia legalizes same-sex marriage appeared first on Samachar Live .

Following the introduction of trucks for long-haulage and construction, the focus is now on urban and additional low-carbon transport solutions. \n'With today's release, Scania comprehensively sets the stage for the necessary shift towards sustainable transport, offering tailored low-carbon trucks for all transport applications,' says Christian Levin, Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing. \nThe new fuel-efficient future-oriented trucks all feature the widely acclaimed styling and product characteristics of the new truck generation. Among these are enhanced driveability as well as improved visibility, increased safety, ergonomics and comfort. With the new generation trucks, Scania is taking major steps in providing customer-adapted trucks for even better total operating economy. \nScania extends its urban range \nWith the introduction of the lighter trucks powered by the new 7-litre engine, Scania offers urban transporters a new level of transport efficiency with fuel savings of up to 10 percent. With its more compact dimensions, the new P-series cab can feature a lower engine tunnel, which opens up a more spacious cab interior. Drivers will enjoy the best driving conditions in the industry in vehicles that excel in handling, steering and driveability - all of which are essential in challenging urban traffic. \nLow entry for higher efficiency \nThe L-series is Scania's newly developed cab series for urban transport, such as distribution, refuse collection and maintenance. Drivers will benefit from vastly improved direct vision of the surroundings. Drivers will also be at the same height as other road users, with the added advantage of improved working conditions when repeatedly entering and exiting the cab. The Scania L-series features a kneeling mode and lower boarding steps on both sides of the cab. Drivers can also take advantage of the space in front of the engine tunnel to exit on the passenger side, thereby avoiding oncoming traffic. \nKeeping an eye on safety \nIn addition to the better view over surrounding traffic, Scania introduces the City Safe Window. Drivers will thereby have better opportunities to detect nearby pedestrians and cyclists. The window on the passenger side door is available for all P- and L-series cabs, those most common in urban transport, as well as for the CrewCab. \nScania CrewCab - protecting those that protect \nSince Scania's new CrewCab will mainly be used by firefighters, it has been specifically tailored for emergency assignments, keeping both ergonomics and safety in mind. For extra safety, there is an option for up to four roll over side-curtain airbags. The CrewCab accommodates up to eight passengers with a high level of safety and comfort, which includes a separate climate system with its own heating for the crew area. \nBreakthrough for gas-fuelled long-haulage operations \nScania already offers the broadest range of trucks for renewable fuels, including ethanol, biodiesel, HVO as well as hybrid technology. \nWith Scania's introduction of a six-cylinder 13-litre gas engine specifically designed for regional and long-haulage operations, climate-conscious hauliers now have a strong alternative to conventional fossil fuels. For a 40-tonne truck-and-trailer combination with tanks for liquefied gas, the range has been extended to 1,100 kilometres. In parallel, Scania also releases a 9-litre gas engine for the new truck generation. \nIncreased uptime with flexible plans \nScania Maintenance with Flexible Plans is now also made available for the gas engine range. Significantly greater maintenance precision can be achieved on the basis of the vehicle's actual usage pattern as continuously monitored through connectivity. The solution ensures that every single truck gets exactly the right maintenance at exactly the right time, thereby reducing time in the workshop and increasing uptime. \n'With the new generation trucks, Scania is taking major steps in improved safety, driver comfort and fuel economy. The released models have been universally praised and awarded for their innovative features and overall performance and we are certain that the new urban range will be equally successful,' says Levin. \nMore information available on www.scania.com/group/en/section/pressroom/presskit/ . \nFor further information, please contact: \nHenrik Eng, Product Director, Urban, Scania Trucks \nPhone: + 46 70 658 98 29, email: [email protected] \n\u00d6rjan \u00c5slund, Head of Product Affairs, Scania Trucks \nPhone: +46 70 289 83 78; email: [email protected] \nScania AB published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 09:16:03 UTC . \nOriginal document https://www.scania.com/group/en/scania-unveils-future-oriented-city-trucks/ \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/B077C6AB0208C450F0EF86B3EADC7BBBD89947A5", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christian levin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "levin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "henrik eng", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "scania", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hvo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "urban", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scania ab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scania maintenance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scania trucks  phone", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:06.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "07839f2fb2a33fb006c9a0fd7c3a2e2992962fbc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT6Pm0WQRVT0hGmnfQJjoC00es3jfNkk4q4MSdo_KzIGBT1br.xAxQGrbk.EtRlVy8JzuyRHsbwJEtss0sW0Nu5jmB0NUyKjiY-", "site_full": "poconos.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://poconos.craigslist.org/search/ppp?format=rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "craigslist poconos | personals search", "title": "Discrete well hung bi-friendly top male wanted-Looking for a roleplay - mw4m (pike/orange/sussex)", "title_full": "Discrete well hung bi-friendly top male wanted-Looking for a roleplay - mw4m (pike/orange/sussex)", "published": "2017-12-07T09:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_diyevHYnva5_600x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "07839f2fb2a33fb006c9a0fd7c3a2e2992962fbc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT6Pm0WQRVT0hGmnfQJjoC00es3jfNkk4q4MSdo_KzIGBT1br.xAxQGrbk.EtRlVy8JzuyRHsbwJEtss0sW0Nu5jmB0NUyKjiY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "Discrete well hung bi-friendly top male wanted-Looking for a roleplay - mw4m (pike/orange/sussex)", "text": "status: partnered   Discrete well hung bi-friendly top male wanted-Looking for a roleplay - mw4m (sussex/orange/pike co) hide this posting image 1 of 4 1 Discrete well hung bi-friendly top male wanted-Looking for a roleplay - mw4m (pike/orange/sussex) hide this posting Discrete well hung bi-friendly top male wanted---(not looking for just straight males sorry-want a guy who will be with us both at times and sometimes just alone with male for male/male ) Send your well-hung picture showing size--- (7inches or larger apply) If your not what we are seeking (be a bi-male friendly top who tops males as well as has 3somes m/f/m)---(then don't reply or waste everyone's time) Female checks cock size at first neutral place meeting/take a walk or meet in a semi-private setting -(then we can take to next level)- (So if you send fake cock pics or lie about your endowments there will be no further play upon inspection...7inches or larger apply! ) we are both D&D free... in our 50's youthful outdoors type---clean---shaven and open minded ...we always shower and wash up and then sex...on the spot shower if any sex is to happen we are about being clean ..soap/wash clean clean and then fun fun....

Drivers will enjoy the best driving conditions in the industry in vehicles that excel in handling, steering and driveability - all of which are essential in challenging downtown traffic. \nWith the lighter 7-litre engine, the new trucks have shed a full 360 kilograms in comparison with Scania's 9-litre variant, improving both fuel consumption and payload. \n'We have significantly broadened our offering to the growing number of customers operating in urban areas,' says Jorge Guttierez, Product Manager, Scania Trucks. 'The lower fuel consumption fits well into the sustainability focus of many cities, as well as improving total operating economy for operators.' \nThe 7-litre engine is primarily designed for urban applications such as distribution trucks , skip loaders and airport support vehicles. These lighter urban trucks are available in three engine outputs: 220, 250 and 280 hp. The engine is certified to use 100 percent HVO , which is a biofuel that gives a carbon dioxide reduction of up to 90 percent compared with diesel. \nWith the more compact dimensions, the new P-series cab can, in combination with the 7-litre engine, be specified with a lower engine tunnel, which will open up a more spacious cab interior. Additionally, due to the six-cylinder configuration, drivers will appreciate lower noise and vibration. \nScania P 220 4\u00d72 box distribution\nSolna, Sweden\nPhoto: Dan Boman 2017 Dan Boman 2017 \nFor certain urban transport applications, the larger 9-litre engine will remain the relevant choice, for example in heavy beverage distribution. But in many cases, the 7-litre engine is the perfect choice for urban applications, with a gross total weight of 26 tonnes. \n'For urban distribution, trucks will typically start their route with 18 tonnes of goods in the box, gradually reducing the load as deliveries are made,' says Guttierrez. 'It makes sense not to over-specify the truck, especially with the substantial fuel savings to be gained.' \nSCANIA'S 7-LITRE ENGINES \nDC07 111 220 hp \nDC07 112 250 hp \nDC07 113 280 hp \nType Inline Displacement 6.7 litres Cylinders 6 Compression 12.6:1 Emission control Scania SCR Exhaust brake 88 kW at 2,500 rpm Max. output 220 hp (162 kW) at 1,900 r/min \n250 hp (184 kW) at 1,900 r/min \n280 hp (206 kW) at 1,900 r/min \nMax. torque 1,000 Nm at 1,050-1,500 r/min \n11,100 Nm at 1,050-1,550 r/min \n1,200 Nm at 1,050-1,600 r/min \nScania AB published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 09:16:03 UTC . \nOriginal document https://www.scania.com/group/en/let-it-be-lighter/ \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/22E794D70BAEE2F678A2821EBD8AE6B754ABFD88", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dan boman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jorge guttierez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guttierrez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "scania", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "hvo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scania ab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scania trucks", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "solna", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:06.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e82de193f3a7f02f27c1ecef1fdbe7ef31e09067", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJ5iB6lAljbTm89Z.iPVnTg2atwIvffo1mpJr07W90P79HDgslaL9JUTK8GLuJIula2w5s765icyse7aLmRc5eQzIsEXfW8KU-", "site_full": "hiltonhead.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://hiltonhead.craigslist.org/search/ppp?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist hilton head | personals search", "title": "I need to get off - m4m (bluffton)", "title_full": "I need to get off - m4m (bluffton)", "published": "2017-12-07T07:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.craigslist.org/00M0M_8M6ilr1Lndx_600x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e82de193f3a7f02f27c1ecef1fdbe7ef31e09067", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJ5iB6lAljbTm89Z.iPVnTg2atwIvffo1mpJr07W90P79HDgslaL9JUTK8GLuJIula2w5s765icyse7aLmRc5eQzIsEXfW8KU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T07:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "I need to get off - m4m (bluffton)", "text": "age: 32   In need of a good bj.

It is hidden in an underground chamber accessed by moving a headstone in the Graveyard . When it is worn, Link becomes invisible; however, his shadow is still visible to the player. While invisible, Link can slip past guards unnoticed. He can also safely walk across spikes or other perilous areas. Wearing the cape drains his Magic Meter , so caution must be exercised while using it. The Magic Cape, though useful, is not needed to complete the game. Obtaining Edit \nThe gravestone covering the cavern containing the Magic Cape is located in the extreme northeast part of the graveyard next to the Sanctuary . \nOnly by going to the graveyard in the Dark World , can Link reach the area by dashing into a pile of small stones and using his sword to slice the small flower to the left of the area. Once Link is inside the area where the gravestone is in the Dark World, he can use his Magic Mirror to return to the Light World , where he will be inside the area and will be able to dash into the gravestone. Be careful not to warp while standing behind the pile of rocks as this will cause Link to become trapped in the area around the gravestone once it has been opened.

There is little point asking: Why is Mr Trump recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital now? What is his plan for the Middle East? How does moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv fit into it? As his record shows, that is not the way Mr Trump works. Instead, the more relevant questions are: Does he even realise the significance of what he is doing? Does he understand the likely consequences of detonating explosive charges along the region's fault lines like this? It is quite possible he does not.\nMr Trump certainly understands, though, that his move will cause uproar \u2013 but it does not worry him. Indeed, uproar has been Donald Trump's friend through much of his career. It has accompanied, and perhaps created, his political success. The bigger the row, the greater the opportunity for a chancer like the 45th President of the United States.\nSHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Donald Trump must have understood his move would cause outrage.  Photo: AP Part of his motivation is doubtless based in domestic US politics. Most obviously, he is fulfilling a campaign promise to Israel's backers in the United States, a large and powerful lobby. Coincidentally, he is also creating a major distraction from his own difficulties with the Mueller investigation into his campaign's links to Russia.\nAn optimistic interpretation might look like this: Donald Trump's taste for the limelight, his all-consuming self-regard, his brinkmanship and lack of restraint make him a wild card in international diplomacy \u2013 and a potential circuit breaker. He may yet play that role with North Korea where a long stalemate has allowed problems to fester. In the Middle East, perhaps this sudden jolt may break the long deadlock in the peace process. Yet in a region where hopes for peaceful, rational solutions are always slight, this seems the very longest of long shots. Neither his motives, nor the slim likelihood of success, justify it, and there are many reasons why recognising Israel's claim to Jerusalem as its capital just now may prove to be a bad move \u2013 despite, or perhaps because of, its historical significance and cultural and religious freight. Despite Mr Trump's protestations of even-handedness, Israel is the only country applauding. Australia, along with many other US allies, has condemned his initiative. Although Victorian Opposition Leader Matthew Guy also supports the move.\nThe measure has already unleashed a wave of protest across the Arab and Muslim worlds. The Palestinian Authority has called for three days of rage, and even though its representatives have said by rage they do not mean violence, will Israel's angry young Arab population stop to listen? Beyond Israel and Palestine, Mr Trump is stamping all over tentative pro-Western developments elsewhere in the region. In Saudi Arabia, will the new regime of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman be able to maintain its welcome moderating course, and restrain extremist opinion? In Iran, already alienated by Mr Trump's rejection of the nuclear deal and his revived travel ban, how can the relatively moderate regime of Hassan Rouhani do anything except close ranks against the West with the rest of the Muslim world \u2013 Iran's bitter Sunni rivals included?\nAs the UN's Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, has said, unilateral moves, such as Israel's claim to Jerusalem, will not solve the region's problems. Negotiations are the only way forward. Australia is right to maintain its support for a two-state solution to the core problem of the Middle East, in which the status of Jerusalem is to be negotiated between Israel and the Palestinian state.\nA note from the editor \u2013 Subscribers can get Age editor Alex Lavelle's exclusive weekly newsletter delivered to their inbox by signing up here: www.theage.com.au/editornote More Articles Franchisors' greed is causing massive harm Federal government must act on abuse report A vital move to tackle the scourge of modern slavery", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew guy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex lavelle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed bin salman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hassan rouhani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antonio guterres", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mr trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestinian authority", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:07.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bd75ccb345399efb9a76ca384cb9ba5096b6142c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf4JLGvXcXgEuj7c_NbHPnfcUvFSZkbx5DXrZyq4SJ349bzgrhUp3pEtv1Gtm0xGfBU2.Z.sDmo5ODnIamP6OwZIxBCKisZL3Do-", "site_full": "www.expedia.se", "site": "expedia.se", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.se/Alla-Hotell-I-Toronto.d178314.Reseguide-Stad-Alla-Hotell", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Alla hotell i Toronto", "title": "Montecassino Hotel and Event Venue", "title_full": "Montecassino Hotel and Event Venue (Toronto, Kanada) | Expedia.se", "published": "2017-09-29T10:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 96941, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2b24fc26e88629043c86855544e22b4b2eedd0c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf4JLGvXcXgEuj7c_NbHPnfcUvFSZkbx5DXrZyq4SJ349bzgrhUp3pEtv1Gtm0xGfBU2.Z.sDmo5ODnIamP6OwZIbuBySYhMpqxSjY79tSbUM9huhm23P05K.SO5VfA8Svc-", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-05T07:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I was in town for a class.

accused of trying to break into a sex offender's home after seeing a video of him molesting a girl were not just stopping by to borrow a cup of sugar, a jury heard on Thursday.\nThey were not \"politely knocking on the door for a chat\", the prosecutor Rebecca Christensen said.\nShe told the ACT Supreme Court jury the men were there with the intent of harming or threatening the 62-year-old man.\nBut barristers for the men said the Crown relied on a witness, the alleged victim, whose inconsistent accounts of what happened that morning raised doubts.\nThe trial has heard that one of the men, Paul Arthur Palmer, 39, had a video on his phone that the sex offender had filmed of himself molesting an underage girl.\nMr Palmer told police that he went to the man's home only to bang on the door, show the man he had the video and to educate him.\nAdvertisement He said police had the video days ago but had not done anything about it.\nThe Crown says that at about 7am on February 20, Mr Palmer, along with Daniel James Nicholas, 32, and Joshua Darcy Watson, 33, went to the house and, armed with a knife, tried to force entry to hurt or threaten the man.\nThey have all pleaded not guilty to one count of attempted aggravated burglary.\nIn her closing address, Ms Christensen said the men were frustrated by what they saw as the police's lack of action, though detectives were pursuing the case.\nShe said the Crown did not say the men should not feel upset, angry, or even livid about the sex offender's acts.\nShe said that explains why they did what they did.\nBut no type of vigilante justice was acceptable, the prosecutor said, and when people take the law into their own hands the law says it will not be tolerated.\nShe described damage to the front door that was consistent with people trying to break in, she said.\nThe knife police found outside the house had a bend in the tip consistent with being used in the lock, Ms Christensen said.\nThe alleged victim hid in his room and called triple-o, which was more consistent with people trying to break in, she said.\nThat the men tried to flee from police revealed their guilty mind, she said.\nBut barristers for the three men said there were inconsistencies in the victim's account, and a close look at the evidence would give the jury a doubt.\nBarrister for Mr Watson, Beth Morrisroe, said there was no damage to the lock despite allegations one man was using a knife and to try to open it.\nShe said the man never told the triple-o operator about a knife, but \"wouldn't a weapon be the first thing you'd scream down the line?\"\nBarrister Alyn Doig, for Mr Nicholas, questioned how a door with minor damage could show a serious attempt to enter the premises.\nHe said the man first told police he heard yelling for him to open the door, and there was a lot more reality in that than his different account months later.\nIt \"doesn't cut the mustard\", he said.\nAnd the barrister for Mr Palmer, James Sabharwal, suggested the alleged victim may have embellished what happened.\nHe questioned whether the alleged victim had really heard wire being used in the lock from his second floor bedroom.\n\"You might think he had bionic hearing,\" he said.\nThe jury retired to consider its verdicts about 1pm Thursday.\nThey will return on Friday to continue deliberating.", "highlightText":

We are working on the quotation and leaflet for more of our products including IP65 Linear light, IP65 wall light, microwave tube, compact flood light, down light etc., will send more information in a few days.  \nWe thank you for your time and look forward to supporting your LED lighting business.  \n\nHave a nice day \uff01 \nRay \uff01 \n\n \nCrystal-IQ Lighting Co., Ltd, A subsidiary of Azoteq Group    www.crystaliq-lighting.com Phone: +86-755-8695 6096    Fax: +86-755-   8670 1827 M   obile: +86-188 2284 8778    Skype: 18822848778 Whatsapp\uff1a+86-188 2284 8778 Email:   ray.zhu@crystaliq-lighting.com  \nAdd: Rm 802, Block 1, Shenzhen Overseas Scholars Venture Bldg.,  \nHi-tech Industrial Park, Nanshan, Shenzhen, 518000 China \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "xiaomi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "azoteq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rohs", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philips lighting", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crystal-iq lighting co., ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shenzhen overseas scholars venture bldg.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "azoteq group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bulb    product features", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pcb", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nanshan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shenzhen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:07.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bd75ccb345399efb9a76ca384cb9ba5096b6142c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf4JLGvXcXgEuj7c_NbHPnfcUvFSZkbx5DXrZyq4SJ349bzgrhUp3pEtv1Gtm0xGfBU2.Z.sDmo5ODnIamP6OwZIxBCKisZL3Do-", "site_full": "www.expedia.se", "site": "expedia.se", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.se/Alla-Hotell-I-Toronto.d178314.Reseguide-Stad-Alla-Hotell", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Alla hotell i Toronto", "title": "Montecassino Hotel and Event Venue", "title_full": "Montecassino Hotel and Event Venue (Toronto, Kanada) | Expedia.se", "published": "2017-09-29T10:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 96941, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ad3afc9df40033d6fe4542ebe6c47edb39c7b19b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf4JLGvXcXgEuj7c_NbHPnfcUvFSZkbx5DXrZyq4SJ349bzgrhUp3pEtv1Gtm0xGfBU2.Z.sDmo5ODnIamP6OwZIQIRE7ds60OuLoUW84fG13riPw73Ucf7NyzArmE5CIHA-", "ord_in_thread": 15, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-04T08:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "The staffs are very helpful and competent.

While the change of LDLc from baseline to follow-up was significant in the non-DM group (p < 0.001), it was non-significant in the DM group (p = 0.15). Distribution of LDLc changes is shown in Fig. 3 . We found a significant correlation between the change of LDLc and the change of mean plaque area for non-DM patients (R = 0.47, p = 0.002). No significant correlation was found in DM patients. Fig. 3 Distribution of LDLc changes in DM and non-DM patients The only significant difference in plaque composition was an increase of fibrous tissue in DM patients (0.21 \u00b1 0.75 mm 2 ) compare to a decrease in non-DM patients (\u2212 0.12 \u00b1 0.60 mm 2 , p = 0.001). Interestingly, both NC tissue and DC decreased in both group (differences between DM and non-DM groups were not significant). One of the most indicative markers for plaque composition risk\u2014NC abutting lumen\u2014increased in DM patients (1.27\u00b0 \u00b1 50.23\u00b0) and decreased in non-DM patients (\u2212 3.27\u00b0 \u00b1 41.79\u00b0). However, this difference was not significant (p = 0.47). Plaque components responsible for increase or decrease of plaque area are summarized in Fig. 4 . No change of plaque composition was significant when the DM and non-DM groups were compared. Plaque progression in DM patients was caused by an increase of fibrous and fibro-fatty tissue mean area. Progression in non-DM patients was negligible. Plaque regression was caused by decrease of necrotic tissue and calcified tissue mean area in both groups. Fig. 4 Plaque compositions responsible for either the plaque increase or the plaque decrease. F fibrous tissue, FF fibro-fatty tissue, NC necrotic tissue, DC calcified tissue Changes of the pro-inflammatory status were related to changes of plaque composition in the DM patients. The change of hs-CRP level correlated well with the increase of DC mean area (R = 0.57, p = 0.03), decrease of fibrous tissue mean area (R = \u2212 0.69, p = 0.01) and there was a trend for increase of NC mean area (R = 0.46, p = 0.09). All these changes were not significant in non-DM patients: correlation coefficients were much smaller (0.22 for NC, 0.21 for DC and \u2212 0.27 for fibrous tissue, with non-significant \u201cp\u201d values). However, the change of hs-CRP level correlated better with change of the TCFA number in non-DM patients (R = 0.36, p = 0.02). Glycemia levels correlated well in both the baseline (R = 0.55, p = 0.02) and the follow-up plaque burden (R = 0.57, p = 0.02) in DM patients. Glycemia changes correlated well with changes of the necrotic tissue (R = 0.41, p = 0.01) and the fibro-fatty tissue (R = \u2212 0.33, p = 0.04), but only in the non-DM patients. Baseline glycemia or change of glycemia did not correlate with number of TCFA locations during baseline examination or change of TCFA number during the study. Figures 5 and 6 show the direction of changes in plaque phenotypes between baseline and follow-up in DM and non-DM patients. It can be clearly seen that changes of plaque phenotypes from early lesions (NL, FP, PIT) into advanced plaque phenotypes (ThCFA, TCFA) were more frequent in DM compared to non-DM patients. However, TCFA plaque phenotype was found in 94 of 192 (48.9%) vessel segments in DM patients and in 228 of 506 vessel segments (45.1%) in non-DM patients (p = 0.96), in part because we labeled each vessel segment according to the most advance identifiable plaque phenotype. In fact the total number of \u201cTCFA frames\u201d was lower, but still without a significant difference between the DM and non-DM groups (24.8% vs, 23.4%, p = 0.29). Figure 7 is showing and example of new TCFA in DM patient. Fig. 5 Plaque phenotype transition in DM patients.

Orange line shows location of cross sectional frames. It can been seen significant progression of plaque together with increase of necrotic core The TCFA plaque phenotype can experience two types of behavior. It can remain as TCFA ( persistent TCFA ), or it can change into another plaque phenotypes (suggesting a healed TCFA ). An TCFA can also develop from another plaque phenotype during the follow-up period ( new TCFA) . DM patients experienced more new TCFA plaque phenotype compared to non-DM patients (20.3% vs. 12.6%, p = 0.01). Persistent TCFA plaque phenotype was more frequent in DM patients, but this trend was   (82.1% vs. 71.3%, p = 0.12). We also focused on differences between the DM and non-DM groups in morphological and plaque composition changes in early plaque phenotype (PIT) and advanced plaque phenotype (TCFA). Both PIT and TCFA types of plaques experienced plaque regression together with negative vessel remodeling in non-DM patients and plaque progression together with positive (TCFA) or neutral (PIT) vessel remodeling in DM patients. We found interesting differences between PIT and TCFA plaque phenotypes according to change of plaque composition. Plaque progression in PIT plaque phenotype was caused by increases of NC and DC plaque composition, but plaque progression in TCFA plaque phenotype was caused by increases of fibrous and fibro-fatty tissue. Results are summarized in Figs. 8 and 9 . Figure 10 shows a typical 3D analysis of coronary IVUS pullbacks in DM and non-DM patients. Note the visible differences in plaque area and plaque composition.

Values in \u201cy\u201d axis are expressed as relative amount Fig. 10 3D analysis of typical DM and non-DM patients differences in plaque area changes and plaque composition changes are clearly visible Discussion The main findings of this study are: 1. The coronary plaques in DM patients increased their plaque area and risk profile from baseline to 1-year follow up despite treatment with lipid lowering therapy and despite reaching a similar level of LDLc compared to non-DM patients. In comparison, plaques in non-DM patients experienced a decrease of the LAPS risk score. 2. The plaque phenotype with the highest risk of future cardiac events (TCFA) developed more frequently during the study in DM patients compared to non-DM patients. 3. Coronary plaques continue to progress in both early and advanced plaque in DM patients compared to plaque regression on these two plaque phenotypes in non-DM patients. 4. Morphological and plaque composition changes were more pronounced in the early lesions type (PIT) than in the advanced lesion type (TCFA), and these changes transitioned toward higher risk plaque types (increased mean plaque area and necrotic core content) in DM patients. The atherosclerotic process in diabetic patients seems to be different compared to non-diabetics. Larger plaques, with higher necrotic core content, were confirmed in DM patients during postmortem studies [ 27 ]. These findings were confirmed in vivo by studies using IVUS in plaques from both stable and acute patients [ 28 \u2013 30 ]. Studies assessing plaque phenotypes describe more-developed lesions in DM patients [ 31 , 32 ]. We found accelerated progression in DM patients of both plaque burden and plaque risk profiles in our study. These findings are supported by the study published by Bayturan et al. [ 10 ] with data from 7 clinical trials involving 3437 patients, where the presence of diabetes was found as one of the predictors of plaque progression despite the achievement of very low levels of LDLc. The impact of the presence of diabetes on clinical events was tested in a study done by Kennedy et al. Lesions not causing ischemia (with fraction flow reserve > 0.8) led to clinical events in DM patients in 18.1% compared to 7.5% in non-DM patients (p < 0.01), with hazard ratio for the presence of DM of 3.3 [ 33 ]. The same author published a provocative study where he suggests to routinely perform PCI of FFR negative lesions for poor outcome of such lesions for fast atherosclerosis progression in DM patients [ 34 ]. Factors that can play an important role in faster progression in DM patients are: inflammation, neovascularization, and intra-plaque hemorrhage [ 35 ]. Neovessels provide access for inflammatory cells, and thus correlate with plaque inflammation [ 36 ]. Cytokines coming from leucocytes decrease collagen production by vascular smooth muscle cells, and enhance production of matrix metalloproteinases, which further weaken the plaque stability through fibrous cap breakdown [ 37 ]. Metalloproteases are also important factor for development of positive vessel remodeling that is also known risk factor for plaque instability. Insulin resistance was shown as a factor related to positive vessel remodeling [ 38 ]. Neovessels are more fragile and therefore more prone to rupture, thus causing intra-plaque hemorrhage [ 39 ]. These processes are augmented in the diabetic plaques [ 35 ]. These studies give us the pathological background for our finding of the accelerated progression of plaque phenotype in DM patients, which now look more like expected results than merely accidental findings. These data are in agreement with our findings of plaque area, remodeling index (marker of positive vessel remodeling) and LAPS score progression contributing to disease progression in DM patients. Interestingly, the amount of NC significantly decreased in both groups of patients. Only the amount of NC abutting lumen increased in DM patient and decreased in non-DM ones, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Plaque progression and increased necrotic core in DM patients was previously reported in the TRUTH study 4 . Inaba et al. [ 40 ] performed a serial IVUS study using integrated back scatter analysis (IB IVUS) for examination of plaque composition. They compared 20 mm of non-culprit coronary artery from DM and non-DM patients and found higher total plaque volume and lipid content in DM patients at baseline. Both plaque volume and lipid content continued to progress only in the DM patients. However, comparison of plaque composition changes is difficult using their approach, because IB-IVUS uses a different technique for analysis of plaque composition and cannot distinguish necrotic tissue [ 41 ]. The possible explanations for differences in plaque-type and plaque-composition transition frequencies in DM and non-DM patients during the 12-month follow-up period can be attributed to a lower efficacy of lipid-lowering treatment in DM patients, which was documented by observing a significant reduction of LDLc levels only in the non-DM patients. Another factor contributing to the unfavorable plaque changes is a higher inflammatory status biomarker in DM patients. Levels of hs-CRP during baseline and their changes during the study duration were significantly higher only in the non-DM group. However, the change of hs-CRP levels correlated with an increase of the necrotic core percentage and calcification, and the decrease of fibrous tissue more strongly in the DM patients. These findings are in a good agreement with a study performed by Kwon et al. [ 42 ], who found a decrease of necrotic tissue inside coronary plaque in statin-treated patients with decreased levels of hs-CRP. This can also be seen as an indirect marker of the more important role of inflammation in DM patients compared to the non DM ones. Surprisingly, the increase of TCFA plaque phenotype correlated with increase of hs-CRP level only in the non-DM patients, despite the fact that the DM patients developed more new TCFA plaque phenotypes. Additional differences between the DM and non-DM patients included a higher glucose variability in DM patients leading to an increase of plaque burden and lipid content and a decrease of fibrous tissue in their atherosclerotic plaques [ 43 ]. Yoshida et al. [ 44 ] described an increase of necrotic core in plaque with DM patients with higher glucose fluctuations. We found a notable correlation of both baseline and follow-up glycemia with plaque burden in the DM patients. According to plaque composition, we found good correlation of he change of glycemia with the decrease of fibro-fatty tissue and the increase of necrotic tissue. Surprisingly these correlations were significant only in the non-DM patients (probably due to a negligible change of glycemia in the DM patients). These findings may explain the reported relationships between an increase of hs-CRP and an increase of TCFA plaques in the non-DM patients. TCFA is a plaque phenotype, defined as a confluent NC with a thin fibrous cap (less than 65 \u00b5m). Because this distance cannot be measured by intravascular ultrasound, TCFA plaque phenotype is sometimes named VH-TCFA (TCFA based on virtual histology) or ID-TCFA (IVUS-derived TCFA) in studies using virtual histology, where the main criterion for this phenotype is the lack of a visible fibrous cap over the necrotic core. This type of plaque is known as a risk factor for future development of coronary events [ 45 ]. We find similar numbers of such plaque phenotypes in both patients\u2019 groups. The same occurrence of TCFA in DM and non-DM patients is a surprising finding. But it is similar to a study done by Pundziute et al. [ 46 ], who did not find a higher occurrence of TCFA in DM patients. However, they found a substantially smaller number of TCFA type plaques (7% in DM and 10% in non-DM patients, p = 0.4), but they reported number of TCFAs per whole plaque, not per vessel segment or frame. Other trials [ 31 , 47 ] found TCFA more frequent in DM patients (21.6% vs. 13.6% and 75% vs. 41%). Based on these numbers, it is obvious that TCFA definition based on IVUS-VH yields different values the absolute numbers of which are generally incomparable. Because the determining part of the TCFA definition is fibrous cap thickness, studies using optical coherence tomography (OCT) seem to offer a better tool for its diagnosis. Kato et al. [ 48 ] published a study of OCT examinations of all three coronary arteries, and found only non-significantly higher numbers of TCFA plaque phenotype in DM patients than in non-DM ones (18.8% vs. 11%, p = 0.22). Niccoli [ 49 ] found the same number of TCFA in DM and non-DM patients (41% vs. 44%, p = 1). It seems that even OCT based TCFA definition is not ideal for discrimination of risk plaque phenotype in DM patients. The best approach may be a dual source of information composed of IVUS-VH for necrotic core detection and OCT for fibrous cap measurement [ 50 ] or even better near-infrared spectroscopy IVUS (for highly sensitive lipid pool detection) and OCT [ 51 ]. The behavior of TCFA over the period of 1 year has been studied by IVUS-VH in patients with stable coronary artery disease [ 52 ], and using non-culprit plaques     53 ]. During these studies (over a period of 12 months in Kubo et al. [ 52 ] and 13 months in Zhiao et al. [ 53 ]), 75% of VH-TCFA healed, whereas 25% remained unchanged in stable patients. Completely different results were found in acute patients: 78% of VH-TCFA plaques remained unchanged and 22% healed. We found an increased number of new TCFA plaque phenotypes during our study. From all TCFA plaque types found during baseline examination, 82.1% remained as TCFA in DM patients and 71.3%, (p = 0.12) in non-DM ones, despite dealing with stable patients only. The main difference between our study and the aforementioned studies is lesion definition. Kubo [ 52 ] defined lesions as an area of plaque with at least three consecutive frames with plaque burden \u2265 40%, and analyzed all such frames as one lesion. The same definition was used in the study by Zhiao [ 53 ] (where new lesions were separated by at least a 5 mm long segment with plaque burden < 40%). Unlike these two studies, we analyzed vessel segments of coronary arteries of uniform size (5 mm). This method allows more precise spatial accuracy for comparison from baseline to follow up. Acute cardiac events are not caused by changes taking place inside the whole plaque: the development of plaque rupture is a very focal event, and only detailed plaque analysis can help us understand why some regions behave differently than others. Vessel segments with new TCFA plaque phenotype were found in higher numbers in DM compared to non-DM patients in our study. This finding of higher incidence of new TCFA in DM patients despite lipid-lowering treatment correlates well with the study done by Lindsey et al. [ 54 ], who also reported correlation between prevalence of TCFA lesions and duration of diabetes. This is important, because DM patients with TCFA have higher occurrence of MACE within 3 years, compared to DM ones without TCFA. Plaque progression in DM patients without TCFA led to similar occurrence of MACE like in non-DM patients [ 55 ]. An interesting finding is the different plaque behavior in early plaque phenotype (PIT) and advanced plaque phenotype (TCFA) in DM patients compared to non-DM patients. Changes in plaque volume and plaque composition are more pronounced in PIT than in TCFA. Plaque regression was found only in non-DM patients in both plaque phenotypes. The relative amount of necrotic core in plaque between baseline and follow-up increased in the PIT phenotype but decreased in the TCFA plaque phenotype. A similar behavior of NC was described by Hwang et al. [ 56 ], who found an increase of NC in non-TCFA plaques and a decrease in TCFA plaques during statin therapy   coronary syndrome. Increase of NC closely correlated with changes of hs-CRP in that study. Unfortunately, we do not have data from our patients for this type of correlation. It seems that early lesion phenotype is much more active and it may be the main precursor of fibroatheromas despite statin therapy. Conclusions Atherosclerotic plaques in DM patients have more advanced risk profiles than plaques form non-DM patients, and these differences continue to progress despite lipid lowering therapy and despite reaching similar LDLc levels in both groups of patients. In contrary to the group of non-DM patients, the DM patients did not reach significant reduction of LDLc, which shows a decreased efficacy of the lipid lowering treatment in the DM patients. This finding can explain some differences that were observed in our study. The TCFA plaque phenotype detected by virtual histology is probably not the best discriminator for detection of high-risk plaques, because it was found in both groups of patients with the same frequency. Changes in a plaque morphology and plaque composition are more pronounced in early types of lesions such as PIT. Our findings result from a novel method for detailed analysis of coronary arteries, which divides plaques into 5 mm vessel segments based on 3-D vessel reconstructions. This was done by fusion of IVUS-VH and angiography. This type of analysis allows us to compare corresponding vessel segments of coronary arteries between baseline and follow-up, and to focus on changes of plaque phenotypes, which play a critical role in the development of acute coronary events. These findings should lead to further examination of plaque progression in DM patients and to development of new therapeutic strategies, which would increase the efficacy of lowering LDLc and slow the progression of atherosclerosis in DM patients. First recommendations come from the IMPROVE IT trial [ 57 ], where a combined lipid lowering therapy (statin + ezetimibe) was more efficient in preventing cardiac events in DM patients then in non-DM ones. The most potent lipid-lowering drug (inhibitors of the PCSK-9 protein) was shown as potentially causing a higher plaque regression in DM patients in GLAGOV trial. However this finding did   0.39) in a trial with only 20% occurrence of DM patients [ 58 ]. Limitations The main limitation of our study was the low number of patients, which was the result of strict inclusion criteria for high image quality of both baseline and follow-up IVUS examinations, with reliable and consistent pullbacks, and with unquestionably identified corresponding frames. On the other hand, the comparison of almost 600 corresponding 5 mm vessel segments of coronary arteries compensates for this disadvantage. A further limitation is the unequal number of patients with and without diabetes (17 vs. 44 patients). However, the roughly 38% presence of diabetes in our group corresponds well with the occurrence of diabetic patients among individuals with established coronary artery disease. According to our results, the TCFA plaque phenotype was the most frequent plaque phenotype found in both DM and non-DM patients. This finding is a result of our TCFA definition. We divided all examined segment of each coronary artery into 5 mm segments that were labeled according to the worst plaque phenotype they contained. So, every time TCFA was part of 5 mm examined vessel this segment was labeled as TCFA. Moreover, it is necessary to find three consecutive frames with TCFA features to satisfy our TCFA definition. In situations where those three frames belonged into two different 5-mm vessel sections, both were labeled as \u201cTCFA\u201d. One of the most important parts of TCFA definition is the required presence of a thin fibrous cap. It means fibrous cap thinner than 65 \u03bcm. This value is below the resolution of intravascular ultrasound and therefore cannot be used in an IVUS-based trial. These are all facts, which may lead to an overestimation of the number of identified locations with the TCFA plaque phenotype. However, our main goal was to compare plaque phenotypes present in DM and non-DM patients using the same approach for both groups. Based on our findings, our fundamental results are in general agreement with similar studies, despite using slightly different methods and our detailed analysis brings new knowledge about local behavior of DM and non-DM plaque transitions.

As has already been pointed out by one of the members, this expression appears in pANini's dhAtupATha with reference to the verbal root kR meaning 'to do'. This can be taken as a reference to the subject of grammar as a whole. The meaning of the particular line in Bhajagovindam would then be, \"Grammar will not save you when your end comes\". Does this mean that Sankara considers the study of grammar to be useless? That cannot be, because the knowledge of grammar is essential for understanding the meaning of the SAstras. It means only that the study of grammar will not save one from samsAra. But why grammar alone? What about other subjects? Can they save a person from samsAra? Here 'grammar' is 'upalakshaNa' (an indicative word) for all the SAstras, including even the vedas. The Mundakopanishad says that there are two kinds of knowledge\u2014the higher (parA vidyA) and the lower (aparA vidyA). The lower knowledge includes the four Vedas, the science of pronunciation, the code of rituals, grammar, etymology, metre, and astrology (including astronomy). The higher knowledge is that by which the Immutable (Brahman) is realized. The lower knowledge is necessary for all worldly purposes, but it is only the higher knowledge that will deliver one from the continuous chain of births and deaths. Sankara says in vivekachUDAmaNi, sloka 61, \"The mere study of all the SAstras is fruitless if the supreme Reality is not known; if the supreme Reality is known then too the study of the SAstras is of no use (they are no longer necessary)\". This profound truth is what is implied by the statement \"grammar will not save you\". Of course there is also an exhortation to worship Govinda because devotion is an essential means to liberation. The word 'mUDhamate' in the first sloka is generally translated as 'fool'. The meaning of this word is not just 'a person deficient in intelligence'. The word 'mUDha' is derived from the verb 'muh' which means 'to be deluded'. So the word 'mUDhamate' means 'one who is deluded'. Every one in this world, including the most brilliant scientists, is deluded by mAyA, until one realizes the Self. So 'mUDhamate' refers to 'all persons who have not realized the Self'. In a later sloka the last line is 'bhAryA bibhyati tasmin kAye'. This is generally translated as 'even his wife is afraid of his (dead) body'. But the snag here is that the verb 'bibhyati' is in the plural (though it looks like singular because it ends in 'ti' and not 'nti'. 'bibhyati' is the third person plural of the root 'bhI'. So the word ' bhAryA' is in the plural (bhAryAH) with the visarga at the end getting dropped because it is followed by the letter 'bi'. The meaning of the word 'bhAryAH' here is therefore not 'wives' but all those who were supported by him, i.e. all his dependents.

Things are not quite as simple as this multiplied by that. . . one has to start figuring out uptime of the debuffs, the percentage of extra damage that is added by simply casting haunts themselves, cast sequence priority, and more. Sorry, but while we think Malefic Grasp is significantly better, the truth is it ends up being only marginally better at best.\nBest case scenario is Haunt has a 40% uptime in a minute. Would you rather have 40% uptime on a 15% damage buff, or MG's 25% dot damage buff? Even factoring in that Haunt has a front loaded nuke (500% of spell damage) and the % modifier also affects Drain Soul, it's still not worth it.\nLike I said, I take the talent and play with it in lower content, but it doesn't have a niche compared to the other two talents (or maybe it'd best be said that it's niche, which is priority damage on short lived adds, isn't really all that great or suited to Affliction to begin with).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:09.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "14e9c8782232a654004b12af4bd6d8db109e6b5d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvv_6yOE1qHrrYsRV.wmTRQBMifti6NXX_Nq5iZBZqppA4eBM.WRPxMo0iYA5t9LCeGVzUGmSEt0bQ.l3xWL97rGg8VehQVANdFTIKpmWVkBAJe.ZoQXOa34_1pmOSVqIu7Jd.UJ8c6GuP4Fin_OGSCCeMyWaDBkJZVzNI7kjxxMkO9qn71Xbed3GfQoea8hFiR_ssxz2UOmIjy0vE8IsAuSJe8SXyHWYu0rUO0dmwneiY-", "site_full": "www.4-traders.com", "site": "4-traders.com", "site_section": "http://www.4-traders.com/rss/FeedNews.php", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Stock market news -

Would you rather have 40% uptime on a 15% damage buff, or MG's 25% dot damage buff? Even factoring in that Haunt has a front loaded nuke (500% of spell damage) and the % modifier also affects Drain Soul, it's still not worth it.\nHaunt has less variance and is more forgiving of mistakes. I will risk a 2% difference in performance to play something that feels more versatile to me. I like that I can adapt to hectic add high movement boss fights, council fights, and still do decent enough single target dps. Glad to see you are quite happy with MG though, good for you, enjoy it!\nFor me, versatile talent > niche.\nHaunt is FAR less versatile and extremely punishing if you make a mistake. Adds have to live 10-15 seconds. Any less or more than that, and haunt's effectiveness rapidly diminishes. Also requires adds to spawn very frequently.\nThere is only one fight in legion where haunt MIGHT be considered viable, and that is ellisandre. That fight is the perfect haunt fight, but even with perfect conditions is still inferior to MG. I am one of the few warlocks likely in the entire world that has used haunt on occassion in a serious raiding guild. It sucks, period.\nMG, on the other hand, is a useful tool in nearly all situations. It does not matter when adds spawn, or how long they live, or even if there are any adds to begin with. Its only competition is with writhe on heavy cleave fights.\nIf you enjoy haunt and want to play haunt, then by all means. I like haunt too.
