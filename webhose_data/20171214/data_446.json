The festival includes a little something for everyone in the 43-event schedule, including the \u20ac5,300 Main Event. \nThe Hilton Prague Hotel will once again play host to the competition, as it has ever since PokerStars began bringing players to Prague back during the European Poker Tour Season 4 in 2007. One of the more popular winter destinations for players, both for the action and the city that surrounds it, many memorable moments have been made over the years in Prague for the PokerStars crew. In 2009, local grinder Jan Skampa won the main event for over $1 million and two years later the live poker world was introduced to German superstar Martin Finger when he won his EPT Main Event in Prague. \nOf course, just last year, Dutch player Jasper Meijer was crowned the final EPT champion and as he hoisted the trophy in Prague, the final stop of Season 13, it marked the final stop of the entire tour. It was the end of the EPT era. \nNow PokerStars is back in Prague for the first time since that emotional finale, ready to start new traditions and anoint new champions in the Golden City. To help with that, PokerStars is bringing out a number of their pros to both mingle with the players as well as test their mettle on the felt. Andre Akkari , Marcin Horecki , Liv Boeree , Igor Kurganov and Bertrand \u2018ElkY\u2019 Grospellier , who makes his home in Prague, have all confirmed to be on hand. \nWhile there is plenty to do in the city of Prague like check out the city\u2019s Christmas markets, stroll across the Charles Bridge or visit the St. Vitus Cathedral at Prague Castle, the tournament schedule PokerStars has put together is likely to keep dedicated grinders indoors and on the felt. \nThe massive 43-event line-up hopes to have a number of events for players managing any type of bankroll. From the \u20ac330 multi-flight Prague Poker Cup for those looking for a big score on a modest buy-in to the \u20ac50,000 PokerStars Championship Super High Roller, which is likely to have big names vying for even bigger payouts and every buy-in level in between. \nOf course, all eyes will be on the \u20ac5,300 Main Event. Registering 1,192 runners in 2016, last years participants were the most the Prague stop had ever seen, making it a benchmark for comparison here at the start of the Championship years. The Main Event gets started on December 12 and has two starting days. Then, if one can't be in Prague, beginning on Day 2, would-be viewers can tune-in to all-star commentators James Hartigan and Joe Stapleton as they host featured-table action from the event on PokerStars.tv. \nPokerStars also is continuing their PokerStars Championship Player of the Year leaderboard promotion awarding the winner of the Prague tournament leaderboard a chance to win a $17,000 VIP package to the 2018 PokerStars Caribbean Adventure and a seat at a $100,000 free roll in the winner-take-all 2017 PokerStars Championship Player of the Year Sit & Go. If that sounds like an amazing opportunity, one had better be prepared to bring their \u201cA\u201d game as the list of players that have already qualified include some of the best in the game, including Koray Aledmir , Vladimir Troyanovskiy , Daniel Dvoress , Nick Petrangelo , Chris \u2018Big Huni\u2019 Hunichen and high roller regular Bryn Kenney . \nOnline satellites to the Main Event are currently running on PokerStars and, just in case the tournaments scene doesn\u2019t agrehoursth you, PokerStars will be running 24-hour a day cash games with all the action beginning on December 7.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "koray aledmir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bryn kenney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcin horecki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick petrangelo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jasper meijer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andre akkari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "igor kurganov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bertrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pokerstars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huni", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel dvoress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin finger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe stapleton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vladimir troyanovskiy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james hartigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jan skampa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liv boeree", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grospellier", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hilton prague hotel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pokerstars", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "prague", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "czech republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "golden city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prague castle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles bridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. vitus cathedral", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:14.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d286d811c5ab2f35a6e1bdf55135253303b25725", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8XwxMxID.veXiQjN6gTVTFj2is1Mci4iVZGpH1ZVOciJRC4enThr5D6i1gpFRlyqbZdAKKPyXaAkRr2OpDO1V.8oFzyludDduoKGqobPAEp3f5HCQXzZDF", "site_full": "writingthecommonapppaper.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://writingthecommonapppaper.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Writing the common app paper", "title": "'Tradition as Seen in Shirley Jackson\\'s The Lottery'", "title_full": "'Tradition as Seen in Shirley Jackson\\'s The Lottery'", "published": "2017-12-07T11:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d286d811c5ab2f35a6e1bdf55135253303b25725", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8XwxMxID.veXiQjN6gTVTFj2is1Mci4iVZGpH1ZVOciJRC4enThr5D6i1gpFRlyqbZdAKKPyXaAkRr2OpDO1V.8oFzyludDduoKGqobPAEp3f5HCQXzZDF", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jennifer Davidson (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "'Tradition as Seen in Shirley Jackson\\'s The Lottery'", "text": "'In approximately cases, impost changes from generation to generation.

(Alex Brandon, AP file) New allegation against Franken, this time met with silence \nWashington - His once-promising political career in shambles, Minnesota Senator Al Franken appeared on the verge of resigning after fellow Democrats led by female senators abandoned him on Wednesday over the mounting allegations of sexual misconduct that are roiling Capitol Hill. \nA majority of the Senate's Democrats called on the two-term lawmaker to get out after another woman emerged on Wednesday saying he forcibly tried to kiss her in 2006. \nThat brought to at least seven the number of women accusing him of sexual impropriety. \nREAD: 'Ashamed' US Senator Franken back at work amid groping claims \nFranken, the former comedian who made his name on Saturday Night Live , scheduled an announcement for Thursday. No topic was specified, but Democratic senators said they expected their liberal colleague to resign. \n\"Enough is enough,\" said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. \"We need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is okay, none of it is acceptable, and we, as elected leaders, should absolutely be held to a higher standard.\" \nTorrent of demands \nGillibrand was the first to call for Franken's resignation on Wednesday, but a torrent of Democrats quickly followed. \n\"I'm shocked and appalled by Senator Franken's behaviour,\" said Senator Patty Murray of Washington state. \"It's clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time. It's time for him to step aside.\" \nThough the writing appeared to be on the wall, Franken's departure was not certain. A tweet posted on Wednesday evening on Franken's Twitter account said: \"Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in DC tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate.\" \nLate in the day, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York added his voice. \n\"I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately,\" Schumer said. \nSchumer called Franken immediately after the latest allegation - and before the torrent of demands for Franken's resignation from Democrats - and told him he needed to resign, said a Democrat familiar with the events. \nSchumer met later in his apartment with Franken and Franken's wife, Franni, and repeated that message, and he did the same in additional talks with the senator throughout the day, said the Democrat, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. \nDemocratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez weighed in, too, asking Franken to resign and saying: \"Sexual misconduct, harassment and assault have no place in the Democratic Party, the United States Congress, the White House or anywhere.\" \nThe resignation demands came in rapid succession even though Franken on Wednesday vehemently denied the new accusation that came from a former Democratic congressional aide, who said he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006. \n'Right as an entertainer' \nThe woman, who was not identified, told Politico that Franken pursued her after her boss had left and she was collecting her belongings. \nShe said that she ducked to avoid his lips and that Franken told her: \"It's my right as an entertainer.\" \nFranken, in a statement, said the idea he would claim such conduct as a right was \"preposterous\". \nBut it was soon clear that his position had become untenable, and his office later issued a statement saying, \"Senator Franken will be making an announcement tomorrow. More details to come.\" \nFellow Democratic Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, who spoke to Franken, wrote on Twitter, \"I am confident he will make the right decision.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/news24", "https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234", "https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "al franken", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "franken", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kirsten gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "franni", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom perez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "politico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy klobuchar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patty murray", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic national committee chair", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dc", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:15.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd40b87bad6f3e01d1e511e5145438e79b49238f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSptx_IfmwzxXNprwW7uRXqWbbWfoN8sQnU0QXluSzFTULlmUn1D7W97LjS0zDKYQ8cMU7VrnEH7w--", "site_full": "forum.wordreference.com", "site": "wordreference.com", "site_section": "https://forum.wordreference.com/forumdisplay.php?f=6", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "English Only | WordReference Forums", "title": "where or that", "title_full": "where or that | WordReference Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T10:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn77f.wordreference.com/styles/default/xenforo/avatars/avatar_male_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 315, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5c7e66cce5d2b37396669bfc7c06d26d4bc320bd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSptx_IfmwzxXNprwW7uRXqWbbWfoN8sQnU0QXluSzFTULlmUn1D7W97LjS0zDKYQ.keyuVxEdMabAyKaAxfolJ", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Keith Bradford", "published": "2017-12-07T10:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Ask yourself: am I talking about the road as a location, or as a physical construction?\nIf it's a location, use where . \"The road where my grandparents' house is on ...\" If it's a construction, use which or that . \"The road which/that is paved by blacktop...\" To be honest, I'd never say \"paved by blacktop\", but \" surfaced in tarmac \".

Volume XXIII Winter 2016 Number 4 Dennis Jett Ambassador Jett (ret.) is a professor of International Affairs in the School of International Affairs at Pennsylvania State University.\nThey have a combined annual cost of $700 million, have been around for decades, are staffed by 14,000 soldiers and civilians and today do not seem to be accomplishing much of anything. What are they? The four peacekeeping operations (PKOs) in and around Israel. Put another way, why do all four of these operations continue to exist if there is currently so little peace to keep? There are a number of reasons for this paradox of peacekeeping, and an explanation requires taking a look at each of the four PKOs: the UN Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the Multilateral Force and Observers (MFO), which is not a UN operation.\nConsidering how peacekeeping and wars have evolved more generally will also help explain why these four PKOs exist, even though there is good reason to doubt they are worth the cost. It will also illustrate three other things. First, the United Nations is inflexible when it comes to adapting to changing circumstances. Second, peacekeeping has become an exercise in which poor countries send their troops off to perform tasks they cannot accomplish, while rich countries pick up the tab but refuse to put their own troops at risk. Third, peacekeeping as currently practiced would be incapable of making any contribution to implementing a peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians, were one ever to be drawn up.\nEVOLUTION OF PEACEKEEPING The United Nations got its start in peacekeeping in 1948 with the establishment of UNTSO, which was created to supervise the ceasefire ending the war that erupted when Israel was first established. Over the years, the other three PKOs were established to help monitor agreements resulting from other conflicts between Israel and its neighbors. UNDOF was created in 1974 following the Yom Kippur War with Syria and Egypt. After fighting erupted between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel in southern Lebanon, UNIFIL was established in 1978. The MFO came into being in 1981, after the Camp David Accords brought about peace between Israel and Egypt and required Israel to return the Sinai.\nAll four of these PKOs arose from wars between countries over territory. Of the 17 currently active UN PKOs, however, only five deal with territorial disputes, and none of them are new. There are the three UN operations around Israel, which are 68, 42 and 38 years old, and two more, which have been going for 67 years (UNMOGIP between India and Pakistan) and 52 years (UNFICYP in Cyprus). The reason these operations have lasted so long is that national pride, as well as national security, is involved in conventional wars between states over territory. It is easier for countries that have fought that kind of war to accept peacekeepers and an unresolved dispute than it is to draw an imaginary line on a map delineating the border. Invariably one country or the other will feel it has lost out in this demarcation. And since the United Nations is footing the bill for the peacekeepers, the political cost of a settlement is seen to be greater than not having one. Thus, the peacekeepers just soldier on year after year, whether or not there is any political process underway to resolve the underlying dispute.\nOne exception to this scenario of endless peacekeeping was the UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE). It came about in the traditional way: a war between countries over their common border. That PKO was begun in 2000, but it ended in 2008 after Eritrea imposed restrictions on UNMEE and cut off its fuel supplies, making it impossible for the peacekeepers to function. 1 The United Nations responded by shutting down the PKO even though the boundary issue remains unresolved, tension in the region is high, and fighting occasionally breaks out. 2\nUNMEE was also an exception because wars between countries over territory are rare today. Of the 28 UN PKOs initiated in the last 20 years, 3 only UNMEE was the result of a war between countries. All the others have been the result of civil wars. This distinction between inter- and intra-state wars is important; the stakes, combatants, victims and weapons are different. The starkest difference involves the demands placed on the peacekeepers in dealing with these conflicts.\nThe stakes in a war between countries is the territory being fought over. It pits the armed forces of one state against those of another. They can use any and all the weapons at their disposal, from naval and air assets to armor and heavy artillery. While the fighting is often intense, those killed and injured are usually soldiers. When the conflict is brought to a halt, the peacekeepers are tasked with the relatively straightforward job of monitoring the space between the armies to ensure neither side is violating the agreement that separated them and brought about a ceasefire. The peacekeepers report their observations to UN headquarters and facilitate communications between the parties, to try to prevent the conflict from starting again.\nCivil wars pose a different challenge to the international community. The combatants are the army of the regime in power and whatever group is violently opposing it, whether they are called rebels, freedom fighters, insurgents or terrorists. And the conflict is over political power, which, unlike territory, cannot easily be divided. Often in a poor country, the winner takes all and the loser is out of luck. Because these wars usually occur in poor countries with minimally trained combatants, the arms used are typically the ubiquitous AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenades. The weapons in a civil war are the kind a soldier can carry, and rarely rise above the level of something that has to be mounted on the back of a pickup truck.\nSince political power can be measured by the number of people under the control of a group, the victims of these wars are most often civilians. Killing, or driving off, the supporters of the other side is one way to weaken the opposition. The soldiers of both the government and the rebels are almost always poorly trained, equipped and led; therefore, they quickly discover another advantage of attacking civilians \u2014 they don't shoot back. And if there is an ethnic or religious difference between those who support the regime and those who do not, it makes targeting civilians even easier.\nIn these situations, civilian casualties and refugees spilling over into adjacent countries create humanitarian disasters that place great pressure on the United Nations to act. As a result, peacekeepers are often dispatched, preferably after a ceasefire has been agreed to by the various factions. Unlike in a war between countries, the peacekeepers are given a daunting list of things to do, not only on the military front, but frequently on the political and economic ones as well.\nMilitarily, the former combatants are usually assembled in camps, with the bulk of them demobilized and offered incentives to become civilians. The remaining soldiers are formed into a new unified national army and given some training, so that they might be able to act like one. The police are also encouraged to act like cops instead of another instrument of regime repression.\nOn the economic side, the country \u2014 usually poor to begin with and having spent the war years destroying what little it had \u2014 has to be provided development aid to get on its feet again. Refugees have to be helped to return home and resettle. Politically, in a country with little to no democratic experience, elections have to be organized in order to choose a government that has a claim to legitimacy and a mandate.\nThose are tall orders, especially when the participants start dragging their feet on implementation. Like all politicians, dictators and warlords define a free and fair election as one they win. The prospect of not winning gives them a strong incentive to rethink their commitment to a peace agreement, so they might try to hold back soldiers that are loyal only to them.\nAnother problem for the peacekeepers, and the source of the harshest criticism of their work, arises when the combatants in a civil war are not ready for peace. If they continue killing civilians, the peacekeepers have a stark choice \u2014 being bystanders to atrocities or becoming forced to take part in the fighting. One early example of how costly that can be occurred in the early 1960s when the UN Operation in the Congo got involved in the fighting. Taking sides in that conflict cost the lives of 250 UNOC peacekeepers, not to mention the second UN secretary general, Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, who died in a plane crash en route to the killing fields.\nWhether the UN peacekeepers use force, other than in self-defense, is never an easy decision and depends on two things. The first is the willingness of the international community to have the peacekeepers suffer, as well as inflict, casualties to protect the civilians. The peacekeepers' rules of engagement (ROE) are contained in the mission's mandate along with its goals. The ROE can be based on Chapter 6 of the UN charter, which means the peacekeepers can use force only to defend themselves when attacked. Or the ROE can include the authorization contained in Chapter 7, which states that the peacekeepers can use \"all necessary means\" to carry out their mission.\nIf the mission's mandate includes protecting civilians, the peacekeepers can use military means to do so if they have the ones necessary for the task. But that gets to the second and more practical limitation, the willingness of the individual peacekeeper to put his own life at risk. For instance, a soldier from Bangladesh might not be eager to use his weapon to prevent one Liberian from killing another if that means he might also be killed. Regardless of the rhetoric in New York, the mandate or the ROE, a modus vivendi can be informally arrived at on the ground even if that means civilians are not defended.\nThe issue of protecting civilians is less likely to arise in wars between countries. Therefore, the traditional three rules of peacekeeping are more easily applied: first, the peacekeepers must remain neutral; second, they can use their weapons only to defend themselves; third, they are there only if the warring parties agree.\nAs noted earlier, conventional wars, which were the first peacekeeping challenges of the United Nations, have been supplanted by civil wars in the last 20 years. However, it is the combination of the two that has now left the four PKOs in and around Israel teetering on the brink of irrelevance.\nUNTSO, the UN's first PKO, has been in continuous operation since 1948 in response to the conflicts between Israel and its neighbors. Today, it mainly supplies unarmed military observers to other PKOs like UNDOF and UNIFIL. UNDOF's main task was to monitor the area on the Syrian side of the ceasefire line, the de facto border, to ensure it remained demilitarized. The civil war in Syria, however, turned the ceasefire zone into a live-fire one. In 2013, a Filipino peacekeeper was wounded by a shell that landed in a UN camp on the Israeli side of the line as Syrian rebels drove government forces out of Quneitra. In response, Austria brought home its 380 soldiers, over a third of UNDOF's strength. 4 A year later, the United Nations pulled all its troops out of Syria as the situation deteriorated further. 5\nThat left some of the military observers trying to monitor the war through binoculars from an Israeli caf\u00e9 and tourist attraction on top of a mountain miles away from an area that was supposed to have been demilitarized. 6 UNDOF has plans to return, but the civil war in Syria will have to end before that happens. At a minimum, the Syrian government will have to regain control of the territory near its de facto border with Israel.\nIn Lebanon, the situation is more stable for the moment, but more complicated and potentially more harmful to the image of peacekeeping. In 2006, following fighting between Hezbollah and Israel, the Security Council added two tasks to UNIFIL's mandate. It was supposed to assist the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) to keep the area south of the Litani River free of any armed personnel, assets and weapons other than those of the Lebanese government. In addition, it was to help the government secure its borders to prevent the entry of illicit weapons. To aid in accomplishing this, UNIFIL added a naval contingent, the first UN attempt at peacekeeping on the ocean. 7\nHezbollah, considered a terrorist organization by others, has become the most powerful military and political force in the country, 8 thanks in large part to the support of Iran and Syria. 9 That power has left it free to operate in areas where its Shiite followers are most numerous, including the border area with Israel. There Hezbollah has proved more effective than the government at providing basic services, enhancing its popularity.\nThe reasons for the government's ineffectiveness are outlined in a recent report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace: \"Today, the Lebanese state is deadlocked. Lebanon has no president, and parliament has been paralyzed since 2013.\" 10 Part of this paralysis stems from the political power Hezbollah has accrued from its seats in parliament, its veto power over cabinet actions and its desire to avoid a debate over its role in the Syrian civil war, where it has suffered thousands of casualties. At the end of October 2016 it was announced that agreement had been reached among the various political factions on selecting a new president, but speculation immediately began on whether or not this would end the political crisis. 11\nThe LAF is therefore the ineffective army of a dysfunctional government; it is not going to seriously constrain Hezbollah and set off a renewed civil war in Lebanon. Since UNIFIL's orders are to assist only the LAF, its hands are tied. In his periodic reports to the Security Council, the secretary general reminds Council members of those limitations and points out that UNIFIL, following its mandate, \"does not proactively search for weapons or search private property unless there is an imminent threat of hostile activity from that location.\" 12 In addition, even though UNFIL comprises over 10,000 troops, neither the 40 countries that contributed them nor the United Nations have equipped them to engage in combat against a force that could field five times that number. 13\nAccording to Israeli security experts, Hezbollah has imported tens of thousands of rockets and stockpiled them in population centers. 14 On more than one occasion Hezbollah arms caches have exploded, but efforts by the United Nations to investigate further have always been thwarted. 15 If fighting on the scale of 2006 breaks out again between Israel and Hezbollah, the rockets will rain down on Israel and overwhelm its missile-defense systems. To protect its population, Israel will retaliate with artillery and air strikes that will cause many civilian casualties. 16 This will not bother Hezbollah; it cares more about a propaganda victory than the loss of people it purports to represent. And the presence of the 10,000 members of UNIFIL for so many years will have done next to nothing to prevent it from happening.\nThe naval contingent of UNIFIL, in its 10 years of existence, has checked the documents of many vessels, but it has searched only a handful and on only one occasion \u2014 according to one security analyst \u2014 did it actually find any weapons, and they were on the way to Syrian rebels. 17 According to a UNIFIL spokesman, troops from the mission are conducting 400 operations a day. He admitted that only 10 percent of them were carried out with the LAF, however, raising the question of how effective those operations could be. He also admitted that there was no political process underway that might ever bring an end to the hostility between Israel and Lebanon. 18\nThe MFO, which operates in the Sinai, faces a different situation. It is not a UN operation; the Soviet Union, at the request of Syria, threatened to veto any Security Council action designed to set up a PKO for the Sinai mission. So a handful of other countries set one up outside the UN umbrella. The situation in the Sinai is not as dire as that in Syria or as potentially dangerous as the one in Lebanon, but it is equally intractable. Islamic terrorists have been drawn to the area by the crackdown in Egypt and the chaos in other countries in the region. 19 Though few in number, these terrorists have attacked government forces in the northern Sinai. The response of the Egyptian army has been as inept as it has been heavy-handed, and it shows no capacity for responding effectively to the threat. 20\nScores of Egyptian soldiers have been killed and a number of MFO personnel injured, even though the terrorists have not specifically targeted them. 21 As a result, the MFO has closed vulnerable observation posts, made greater use of drones and other technology, and moved personnel from its base in the far northern part of the Sinai to another at the peninsula's southern tip. 22 This lack of proximity to the border with Israel is a problem. The Camp David Accords placed restrictions on the number of Egyptian forces in three zones in the Sinai with fewer assets allowed closer to the border. So, while the northern Sinai is where the peacekeepers should be doing most of their work, that is also where the terrorists are. The limits on military equipment specified in the agreement have largely been waived by Israel, however, in order to give the Egyptian forces more firepower to deal with the terrorists. Thus, aside from assisting the Egyptian and Israeli militaries in communicating with each other, much of the role of the MFO has been made irrelevant.\nAmong the proposals for dealing with terrorism in the Sinai is the suggestion that all civilians be evacuated from the area. 23 That would presumably provide the Egyptian military a free-fire zone and an even bigger sledgehammer for its attempt to kill a fly. The opposite has also been suggested \u2014 a billion-dollar, infrastructure project designed to convince the local population to forsake the jihadists and support the government, which has traditionally neglected them. 24 While the Egyptian government struggles to come up with an effective counterterrorism strategy, the peacekeepers will be forced to lower their risk and reduce their effectiveness.\nThe MFO has shown some ability to adapt; it can take action more easily than a UN PKO, which has to deal with the will of the Security Council and the bureaucracy at UN headquarters. Changes have also been driven by a desire on the part of the Pentagon to cut back on the 700 American soldiers in the operations. The reason, according to one American diplomat, 25 is that Pentagon officials thought they would have difficulty explaining to the parents of a soldier who was killed or injured why peacekeepers became casualties. This is a problem not unlike what the Clinton administration faced after the losses suffered in Somalia.\nHowever, the very purpose of the peacekeepers was to keep the Egyptian and Israeli armed forces apart. The threat of terrorism in the Sinai has driven the two countries into an alliance that includes not only economic cooperation, but Israeli drone strikes against terrorists in Egyptian territory. 26 It is worth asking how useful a PKO designed to keep two armies apart can be when those two armies are are conducting joint combat operations together.\nThe four peacekeeping missions in and around Israel were created long ago to deal with conventional wars. The use of peacekeepers in these cases was predicated on the parties to those conflicts being able to control their own territory. That is something the governments of Lebanon, Syria and Egypt are currently incapable of doing, and it makes effective peacekeeping largely impossible. Those arguing for continuing these PKOs, despite this new reality, cite the difficulty of restarting a PKO once it has been drawn down, the importance of the symbolic presence of the peacekeepers, the political implications of their removal, and their ability to facilitate communication between the various actors in these conflicts. But do these reasons justify keeping over 14,000 soldiers and civilians at a cost of nearly $700 million a year (and the deaths of over 400 of them thus far) engaged in a job that is impossible to perform?\nSome would argue that the presence of peacekeepers would make it more difficult for the countries to restart the war and is, therefore, justified. But President Nasser had no problem ordering peacekeepers to leave Egypt in 1956. And the Israelis had no hesitation brushing aside the peacekeepers when they invaded Lebanon in 1982.\nThis does not mean all peacekeeping is ineffective. It arises in these four cases because monitoring a ceasefire in a conflict between countries has morphed into trying to accomplish something positive in the midst of civil war, government dysfunction and terrorism. And what little good the peacekeepers can do does not justify keeping 14,000 of them engaged in it at a cost of $700 million a year.\nThe image of success or failure in peacekeeping matters; it has a bearing on the willingness of the international community to engage in such efforts. For the last five years of the twentieth century, there was a sharp decline in peacekeeping as a result of disastrous efforts in Somalia and Bosnia. Then, around 2000, peacekeeping increasingly became the default option for the international community when forced to deal with the humanitarian disasters caused by civil wars. As a result, the number of blue-helmeted soldiers increased tenfold around the world. Today there are about 122,000 people serving in the currently active PKOs. 27\nThis expansion in peacekeeping came about because of pressure on the United Nations to \"do something\" about these situations. But it has evolved into a way for rich countries to send the soldiers of poor countries off to attempt the impossible. The five permanent members of the Security Council furnish less than 5 percent of the soldiers currently serving in UN PKOs (and the vast majority of them are Chinese). The troops provided by the 32 member states of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the rich countries' club, only amount to a little over 7 percent.\nWhile wealthier countries don't want to put their troops at risk, as demonstrated by Austria's reaction to the problems of UNDOF and the American desire to cut back on its role in the MFO, they do at least pick up the tab. 28 The P5 countries pay a little over half the cost of peacekeeping, while the OECD nations together cover 86 percent of the bill.\nA recent UN report by a high-level independent panel charged with making a \"comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects\" reached an unsurprising conclusion: lasting peace is achieved not through military and technical engagement, but through political solutions. 29 And it is those political solutions \u2014 backed up with economic and, if necessary, military pressure \u2014 that the international community should pursue with greater urgency. For the five PKOs dealing with conventional wars, which are on average over half a century old, the bill for peacekeeping should be paid by the countries involved. If they had to bear the substantial economic cost of peacekeeping, they might be prompted to recalculate the political costs of failing to resolve their differences.\nFinding peace in the Middle East means looking for common ground and cooperation with countries like Russia and Iran, who could act as spoilers. It also means that, if the international community does not act more forcefully and with greater unity, using all the tools at its disposal, it will be a long time before peacekeepers have any peace to keep.\nIMPLICATIONS FOR A TWO-STATE SOLUTION Given the lack of leadership on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides, a peace agreement that leads to a two-state solution seems to simultaneously be an urgent necessity and a distant dream. Such an agreement would require security guarantees for both countries, but peacekeeping as it has been practiced thus far in the region cannot provide the assurances necessary. It could, as one Israeli analyst suggested half in jest, provide someone to blame whenever incidents occur, 30 but that will not be much of a contribution.\nIf forces are deployed to ensure the peace, they will not be faced merely with the situation of peacekeepers after a conventional war that are required to monitor a demilitarized zone. They will have to deal with the possibility of terrorism, perhaps a low-grade civil war on the Palestinian side and the infiltration of arms by those who don't support the peace agreement \u2014 circumstances not unlike those in Lebanon, Syria and the Sinai, where peacekeeping has become so ineffective.\nA better solution, rather than relying on foreign troops, would be close cooperation by Israeli and Palestinian security forces in order to provide their own guarantees. But that imagines a world in which the grievances of the past are overcome and there is a peace agreement that two states are willing to uphold. Nonetheless, as the coordination and joint operations of Israeli and Egyptian forces in the Sinai demonstrate, even former enemies can get along if national security is at stake.\n1 \"United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea,\" United Nations, http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/unmee/ .\n2 Kassahun Checole, \"Heavy Fighting Reported on Ethiopian Border with Eritrea,\" Graphic Online, June 22, 2016, http://www.graphic.com.gh/features/heavy-fighting-reported-on-ethiopian\u2026 .\n3 \"List of Peacekeeping Operations 1948-2013,\" United Nations, http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/documents/operationslist.pdf .\n4 Phoebe Greenwood, \"Austria to Withdraw Golan Heights Peacekeepers over Syrian Fighting,\" The Guardian , June 6, 2013, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/syrian-golan-crossing-isr\u2026 .\n5 Adiv Sterman, \"UN Evacuates All Troops from Golan as Syria Fighting Worsens,\" Times of Israel, http://www.timesofisrael.com/un-troops-leave-syrian-golan-amid-heavy-fi\u2026 .\n6 A fuller description of this officer and his job, as well as a number of the other points in this article, is contained in a piece that I wrote for Foreign Affairs : Dennis Jett, \"A Mission Impossible on Israel's Frontiers,\" Foreign Affairs, July 11, 2016, https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2016-07-11/mission-impos\u2026 .\n7 \"United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon,\" United Nations, http://unifil.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=11552&ctl=Details&mid=1\u2026 .\n8 Anne Bernard, \"Hezbollah's Role in Syria War Shakes the Lebanese,\" New York Times , May 20, 2013, http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/world/middleeast/syria-developments.h\u2026 .\n9 Jonathan Masters and Zachary Laub, \"Hezbollah (a.k.a.

Read LONDON (Reuters) - Honda has restructured its under-performing Formula One operations after the split from McLaren, with Yusuke Hasegawa to stand down as head of the Japanese company\u2019s F1 project at the end of the year. Honda, starting a new partnership with Red Bull-owned Toro Rosso from January, said in a statement on Thursday that Hasegawa\u2019s position would be split into two separate functions. Toyoharu Tanabe, an experienced Formula One veteran who worked as race engineer to Austrian Gerhard Berger at McLaren in the early 1990s, had been appointed as F1 technical director. Tanabe, who was also chief engineer to Britain\u2019s Jenson Button at BAR and Honda Racing between 2003 and 2007, will run operations at the racetrack and in testing. An operating officer, yet to be named, will take charge of research and development at Sakura in Japan while Hasegawa remains executive chief engineer. \u201cBy separating these areas of responsibility, we will evolve our structure so that both the development team and racing/testing team can assume their respective responsibilities more speedily,\u201d said Honda\u2019s brand and communications head Katsuhide Moriyama. Honda and McLaren split after the 2017 season that ended last month, bringing down the curtain on three painful years that saw the former world champions suffer their worst ever slump. McLaren, who had a dominant partnership with Honda in the late 1980s and early 1990s, last won a race in 2012 and this year finished ninth of the 10 teams with just 30 points -- 638 fewer than champions Mercedes. Their time together was beset with poor reliability and a lack of performance from a Honda engine struggling to compete with rivals. McLaren, who have Spain\u2019s double world champion Fernando Alonso along with Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne as their drivers, will have Renault power next season. Toro Rosso have New Zealander Brendon Hartley and France\u2019s Pierre Gasly.

Soccer Football - Champions League - Liverpool vs Spartak Moscow - Anfield, Liverpool, Britain - December 6, 2017 Liverpool's Alberto Moreno leaves the pitch after sustaining an injury as Emre Can and Philippe Coutinho look on Action Images via Reuters/Carl Recine A tearful Moreno was substituted close to halftime after a collision with Spartak\u2019s Roman Zobnin as Liverpool sealed progression to the last 16 as group winners but Klopp is hopeful that the 25-year-old\u2019s injury is not too serious. \u201cWe had a little shadow on the night when Alberto Moreno needed to get substituted. It was a strange situation. He is a tough guy and if he cannot continue the game then you should consider it could be something serious.\u201d Klopp told reporters. \u201dIn the treatment room then, he was a little bit more positive, so maybe we are lucky and it\u2019s not too serious. We will see. \u201cWe need all the boys for the next few weeks, but especially in this week for the next game on Sunday...\u201d Liverpool\u2019s last 7-0 win came in a Champions League game against NK Maribor in October that was followed by a thumping 4-1 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur and Klopp has urged his side to avoid another poor return to league action. \u201cWe showed tonight that we learned from the mistakes we made in Sevilla (where the side blew a three-goal halftime advantage to draw 3-3)... now we have to show we have learned from the mistakes after Maribor when we faced Tottenham,\u201d Klopp added. \u201cWe will be ready again on Sunday and if the crowd is ready to help us, it would be nice.\u201d Liverpool are fourth in the table and will be looking to reduce the 14-point deficit to league leaders Manchester City, who travel to second-placed Manchester United on Sunday, with a win in the Merseyside derby. After a poor start to the campaign, Everton have lost just one of their last five league games to climb to 10th in the standings but the Toffees have not beaten Liverpool in 14 encounters since a 2-0 league win in 2010.

It reinforced its refusal to join a new coalition after Merkel's talks with two smaller parties collapsed last month. \nHowever, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made clear that he doesn't want a new election, and Social Democrat leader Martin Schulz reversed course. \nAt a previously scheduled party congress Thursday, Schulz is seeking members' approval for a resolution approving talks on \"whether and in what form\" the Social Democrats can support a new government.

At least this made the meeting a little more casual, not to mention the cup of tea which was in fact poured for the merman. Taking a moment before finally grasping a hold of the cup-- blowing on it, in order to cool it down before finally he'd speak.\"Danbur sees... Well. It's weird. Danbur knows it's a thing, but doesn't know what the thing is?\" he'd speak, in a rather puzzled voice before continuing; \"Recently.. Danbur has been fighting a lot of people, to get stronger! But... Against this one guy-- Danbur thinks he heard a voice?\"\r\n(Danbur)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[08:52:08] LOOC - Tarquin Brubeck: [mm, not enough response to be worth a dot...]\r\n[08:52:26] Tarquin cocks his head slightly.\r\n(Tarquin Brubeck)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[08:52:35] Tarquin Brubeck says, \"Hearing a voice? Seeing things?

At all.\"\r\n[08:53:37] Tarquin Brubeck says, \"Hmm...\"\r\n[08:55:43] The Sirenian's upper teeth would become visable, being placed over his lip and bitting down a little. Making sure not to break his skin or worse, his teeth.\"...It said to do something bad. To the person Danbur was sparring. It was.. Trying to make Danbur kill him?\" he'd affirm, offering an even more lost glance towards the Neries. The merman clearly had zero idea what was happening right now, and was just attempting to get some clarity.\"The worst thing is... Danbur thinks he was close to doing it. It was like.. Danbur didn't have a choice? But managed to stop himself just in time...\"\r\n(Danbur)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[09:00:28] Sipping his tea, Tarquin hummed contemplatively.\"I... Confess I am not the most knowledgable on Sirenian physiology or culture. Are you a wielder of occult magics at all? If so, it could be the madness manifesting, or if not perhaps it was simply the heat of the moment driving your bloodlust.\" He sighed, a bit at a loss. It could be a number of things!\"Aside from that, I can't think of much else it might be. It was controllable, you said? In that you felt a compulsion but staved it off?\"\r\n(Tarquin Brubeck)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[09:04:36] The merman would raise the tea to his lips, sipping at it. Shaking somewhat.\"Yes. Danbur is a weilder of occultic magic. He is a master of Mournegale, the best around in fact! Hmmm... What why would the madness start manifesting now though?\" he'd question away. Clearly he was lost in whatever this thing could be and was looking for any answers which he could find at all. He refused to believe that it was himeself. That he was striving for blood so much, that he'd have even considered harming another Valmasian.\"Um.. Yes. It felt like... Danbur wasn't in control of Danbur. But-- Danbur could stop Danbur?\" he'd state, only going on to confuse himself even more.\r\n(Danbur)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[09:10:21] Danbur says, \"Chinese food is great\"\r\n[09:10:25] LOOC - Danbur: [omit\r\n[09:11:34] Tarquin, for his part, resisted the urge to shrug. This was obviously a serious issue for Danbur, and he didn't want to seem nonchalant.\"It's not unsurprising for it to manifest late. In fact, as time goes on and an occultist grows in power, it's more likely to come through, despite how in-control the magi might have been until then.\" Setting his teacup down, he smiled!\"There is a way to treat this, however! My wife, Rilla, is the wielder of a technique known as the Melody. It cannot... Cure such an affliction outright, as the root cause is the use of occultism, but it can mitigate the effects and suppress the madness it brings about. It's also known to be able to cure sin magi of their afflictions, if exposed to the Melody enough.\"\"Bishop Istvan is also learning it, though I don't know if he's gotten to mastering it just yet. It's worth a try though, the worst case scenario being that we eliminate that as a potential source.\"\r\n(Tarquin Brubeck)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[09:17:44] It would seem that Danbur had indeed found his answer, perhaps going to Tarquin bore all the fruits he needed. It offered him an explination at the very least; and that was better than anything which he had before. So for that, he was greatful. Not to mention, the means to an end which was described by the Neries. Something which the Merman certainly took note of.\"Ooo. So, the voice... Was the madness? Danbur sees. Still, controlling Danbur was far more than he had ever expected. We should get this seen to as soon as possible! Yes!\" he'd exclaim, slowly regaining his upbeat voice, before momentarily finishing his cup of tea.\"So... Miss Rilla an fix Danbur's madness? With a song? Are you sure... That sounds far-fetched. Even to a Merman! If it helps Danbur, he'll need it for sure! Last thing he wants to do is kill any of his friends! Or wose, Kvaja.\" he'd state, rather honestly; \"Yes! At the worse case-- It is not the madnesss!\"\r\n(Danbur)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[09:26:03] LOOC - Danbur: [Didn't realise how tired i am, after this rp. Shall we white text it?\r\n[09:26:10] LOOC - Tarquin Brubeck: [sure]\r\n[09:26:25] \"Well again, it does not cure it outright. It merely treats it, as long as you are an occultist it will still affect you. Still,\" he conceded with a nod and a gesture of open palms towards Danbur, \"It speaks to your willpower that you've gotten this far without experiencing any signs of it. If the worst you're experiencing are voices, your willpower is considerable indeed.\"He nodded cheerfully! \"And yes, her technique is a rare one indeed. Incredibly powerful under the right circumstances, but it requires a specific sort of temperament and a very tight control on your emotions. That, and a considerable mastery of sound magic, which should go without saying.\" He smiled a bit of a goofy smile thinking about his wife. She truly was something else.\"I believe she is stationed down at Fort Coming Dawn, at the moment, setting up a hospital proper to treat allies that are injured at Galeford at a place nearby but still safely away from the front. We put in a therapy room, that much I know, so it should be helpful!\" As if suddenly remembering he also had something to say, he started a bit!\"Ah! Is there aught else? If not, the thing I wished to speak to you about! It's simple enough, I assure you, and a good thing!\"\r\n(Tarquin Brubeck)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[09:28:07] Danbur says, \"Hmh. Danbur has been very focused... On doing his job! No time for madness! hmm.. Voices were, so weird. Danbur hadn't expereienced anything like it before.\"\r\n[09:29:02] Tarquin Brubeck says, \"Well, treatment is but one avenue to explore. She is likely busy at the moment, but if you swing by later she will likely be available.\"\r\n[09:29:09] LOOC - Tarquin Brubeck: [Rilla is offline]\r\n[09:29:14] Danbur exclaims, \"Miss Rilla is impressive! Danbur never knew she knew such advanced sound magic, something he would have never thought a human could have mastered!\"\r\n[09:29:29] Danbur exclaims, \"Yes, Danbur understands-- She is very busy!\"\r\n[09:29:47] Danbur asks, \"What is it, you wish to talk to me about?\"\r\n[09:30:05] Tarquin Brubeck says, \"Ah! Well...\"\r\n[09:30:39] Tarquin Brubeck says, \"Rilla and I, as you may or may not know, are awfully fond of Kvaja. She watches our children from time to time.\"\r\n[09:30:59] Danbur exclaims, \"Hmh. Kvaja mentioned she did that, yes!\"\r\n[09:31:18] Tarquin Brubeck exclaims, \"And well... She mentioned there not being very many opportunities for more... Traditional dating scenarios, here. Which is very true!\"\r\n[09:31:57] Tarquin Brubeck says, \"So we offered to treat you two to a nice, rather private dinner.\"\r\n[09:32:02] Danbur exclaims, \"Oooo!\"\r\n[09:32:07] Tarquin Brubeck says, \"Something romantic.\"\r\n[09:32:13] Danbur says, \"Danbur loves dinner, dinner is the best.\"\r\n[09:32:22] Danbur says, \"Beats spending date-night in the forest.\"\r\n[09:32:33] Danbur says, \"Doing thi-- Eating picnics.\"\r\n[09:32:41] Tarquin Brubeck says, \"Well she said you two liked looking at one another, eating, and doing... Yes, things.\"\r\n[09:32:55] Danbur exclaims, \"Hmh! Yes!\"\r\n[09:33:15] Tarquin Brubeck exclaims, \"Well, a romantic dinner for two covers two of those things, and the third often comes after!\"\r\n[09:33:32] Danbur exclaims, \"Yes!\"\r\n[09:33:40] Danbur says, \"Although-- It is a little odd at the moment.\"\r\n[09:33:54] Tarquin Brubeck says, \"Yes, we'll probably do it after the conflict is resolved.\"\r\n[09:34:05] Danbur says, \"No. Not that.\"\r\n[09:34:09] Tarquin Brubeck asks, \"Oh?\"\r\n[09:34:18] Danbur says, \"Kvaja told Danbur today, that she loved someone else too? A girl.\"\r\n[09:34:53] Tarquin Brubeck says, \"Mmh. She's got... A lot of feelings, it seems.\"\r\n[09:35:06] Danbur says, \"Yes. At first Danbur was against the idea.\"\r\n[09:35:23] Danbur says, \"But then she mentioned her joining us-- And now Danbur doesn't know what to think.\"\r\n[09:35:30] Tarquin Brubeck says, \"Ahh. I see.\"\r\n[09:35:31] Danbur asks, \"Do we invite the girl to the meal?\"\r\n[09:35:40] Tarquin Brubeck says, \"No, this one is for just the two of you.\"\r\n[09:35:44] Danbur says, \"Ooo.\"\r\n[09:35:55] Tarquin Brubeck says, \"As for the girl, well...\"\r\n[09:36:02] Tarquin Brubeck says, \"Hrm. How do I put this...\"\r\n[09:36:21] Danbur asks, \"Hm?\"\r\n[09:36:54] Tarquin Brubeck says, \"Sometimes, and I count myself among these people, people for... Varying reasons would prefer to not remain with just one individual.\"\r\n[09:37:24] Tarquin Brubeck says, \"It isn't that they aren't capable of loyalty or devotion, or love or any of that.\"\r\n[09:37:50] Tarquin Brubeck asks, \"It's that... It's hard to explain, really, but feelings often are, no?\"\r\n[09:38:16] Danbur says, \"Hmh! Yes! Feelings are all, difficult.\"\r\n[09:38:34] Tarquin Brubeck says, \"She cares about you, she certainly does. She is just capable of caring for more than one person in that way. It's no failing of hers, or yours. It's simply different.\"\r\n[09:39:14] Danbur says, \"It is different..\"\r\n[09:39:27] Tarquin Brubeck asks, \"But no, this dinner date is all about celebrating the two of you. I haven't met this girl, but apparently things are even more complicated there so, who knows what will happen?\"\r\n[09:39:45] Danbur exclaims, \"Hmh!

The ultracapacitor pack 200 includes structural assist, environmental safety, automated cooling, electrical interconnection of the ultracapacitors, remote ON/OFF switching, a safety pre-charge circuit, a security and computerized equalizing discharge circuit, a programmable logic controller, a digital interface to a control space information community for control and standing reporting, and an non-obligatory fire sensing and suppression system.\nAttaching the ultracapacitors 20 to the mounting assembly 112 by the terminals forty five instead of the exterior ultracapacitor casing 60 allows the ultracapacitors 20 to be more successfully cooled as a result of nearly all of the surface space of the ultracapacitors 20 is within the cooling air stream supplied by the cross-circulate air cooling assembly one hundred fifteen. As indicated above, every ultracapacitor 330 is related in parallel with the drain resistor 340.\nIn addition, ultracapacitor expertise now can do load-leveling to increase the life of EV batteries and supply the excessive energy essential for EV acceleration. With less vitality storage functionality than a battery, an ultracapacitor is not a viable substitute in UPS as a protracted-time period energy source. An added ultracapacitor can provide the intermittent pulse power while the battery provides the regular current. Different electronics with ultracapacitor functions include VCRs, CD gamers, digital toys, security systems, computer systems, scanners, smoke detectors, microwaves and occasional makers.\nThey have built an impressive pipeline of supercapacitor improvements with the target to take the market lead in the ultracapacitor market by 2015. Paper Battery Company has designed a transformational process to print an ultrathin ultracapacitor. As a worldwide high player in ultracapacitor (ultracap, supercapacitor), LS Mtron delivers the paradigm of power storage technology everywhere in the world.\nAs much as 200 Maxwell Applied sciences 48 V multi-cell ultracapacitor modules are installed in 750 V and 1.5 kV power recuperation systems which Woojin Industrial Systems has supplied for seven metro stations, as well as the Korea Prepare eXpress depot in Seoul. A pre-charge resistor and a pre-charge relay coupled to the ultracapacitor assembly and the control input, the pre-cost relay activated by the control input to cause the pre-cost resistor to limit pack incoming current until the ultracapacitor assembly reaches a minimal voltage.\nThough the ultracapacitor pack 10 and the half modules 15 are shown as being usually rectangular in shape, both or each could have shapes apart from generally rectangular similar to, but not by means of limitation, circular, oval, different curvilinear shapes, other rectilinear shapes, and different polygonal shapes. The vitality drain action is sluggish enough in order not to interfere with the normal operation of the ultracapacitor pack 200.\nThe proposed management system construction takes advantage of the parallel DC/DC power converter association, which permits independent charging/discharging management of the battery and ultracapacitor by way of respective current controllers, thus facilitating a excessive-performance battery/ultracapacitor hybrid vitality storage system. Along with Choudhary and Jung, the research staff included Chao Li, Julian Moore and Associate Professor Jayan Thomas, all the UCF NanoScience Know-how Heart; and Hee-Suk Chung of Korea Basic Science Institute in Jeonju, South Korea.\nThe present invention involves an ultracapacitor excessive-energy storage pack with structural assist, environmental protection, automated cooling, electrical interconnection of the ultracapacitors, remote ON/OFF switching, a safety pre-cost circuit, a safety and automatic equalizing discharge circuit, a programmable logic controller, a digital interface to a management space knowledge community for management and status reporting, and an elective fire sensing and suppression system.\nThough ultracapacitors are usually more expensive than battery packs for a similar functions and cannot store as much vitality as battery packs, ultracapacitor packs are projected to last the lifetime of the car and offer higher gas-environment friendly operation by means of braking regeneration energy seize and supplying of car acceleration energy.\nAn ultracapacitor tends to vary from an unusual capacitor due to its very high capacitance. Scientists from Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea made the breakthrough by creating an especially porous form of graphene (See below.) Extremely, a single gram of this specialised graphene has the same amount of surface area as a basketball. RF Camp has also introduced plans to resell and distribute the S/Cap tag in South Korea. The S/Cap employs a small solar panel mounted on the tag\u2019s face to energy the ultracapacitor.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "choudhary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jayan thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chao li", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hee-suk chung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julian moore", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "korea basic science institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "woojin industrial systems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ups", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gfi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paper battery company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maxwell applied", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gwangju institute of science and technology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeonju", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:19.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2bed59c90c2bcb30079964645dbada9ee6f0b357", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5V1QBYi_spNvE2irx3pmgzzitXpmvpvUAR9fnlB3mWAHqle0lQDiVJbiNvmgRpL3_kFcoYYGqf1kEmwktuBg2nLyEbad_9ycFPMPPDR1Zxg--", "site_full": "joshmckenna574.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://joshmckenna574.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Destiny 2 Weekly Reset \u2013 05/12/17 \u2013 Josh Mckenna", "title": "Destiny 2 Weekly Reset \u2013 05/12/17", "title_full": "Destiny 2 Weekly Reset \u2013 05/12/17", "published": "2017-12-07T11:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2bed59c90c2bcb30079964645dbada9ee6f0b357", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5V1QBYi_spNvE2irx3pmgzzitXpmvpvUAR9fnlB3mWAHqle0lQDiVJbiNvmgRpL3_kFcoYYGqf1kEmwktuBg2nLyEbad_9ycFPMPPDR1Zxg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "joshmckenna574", "published": "2017-12-07T11:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "Destiny 2 Weekly Reset \u2013 05/12/17", "text": "This week is the beginning of Season Two and the release of Expansion I: Curse of Osiris \nNext week Update 1.1.1 releases, which includes most of the big changes mentioned in the \u2018 State of Destiny 2 \u2018 blog post from Bungie last week. \n\nComing Later\u2026\nDestiny News This Week \n05/12/17 \u2013 Destiny 2 Update \u2013 12/05/17 \u2013 Blog Post from Bungie \nBungie have released the patch notes for Update 1.1.0 which released alongside Expansion I: Curse of Osiris and the beginning of Season Two.\n06/12/17 \u2013 Update 1.1.1 Releases Next Tuesday \u2013 Tweet from DeeJ_BNG \nUpdate 1.1.1 is the name for next week\u2019s update which brings most of the changes outlined in the \u2018State of Destiny 2\u2019 blog post.

Among the injured are three Los Angeles Fire Dept firefighters; all are reported to be in stable condition. The Thomas Fire threatens a home near Ojai, California, Dec. 6, 2017 (Photo courtesy Ventura County) \nTrees in two national forests are ablaze \u2013 the Los Padres National Forest in Ventura County, and the Angeles National Forest in Los Angeles County. \nIn Ventura County, the Thomas Fire started on the evening of December 4 in upper Ojai near Thomas Aquinas College in the city of Santa Paula. \nPushed by strong winds, the Thomas Fire spread rapidly and has now consumed more than 96,000 acres and destroyed 150 homes and other structures. \nThe blaze is established on the north and east side of Highway 150 and on the west side of Highway 30. The fire has pushed northwest of Ventura and has reached Highway 101. \nSome 1,775 firefighters are battling this blaze with 362 fire engines, 12 helicopters, air tankers, hand crews and bull dozers. \nEven so, fire officials say the Thomas Fire will continue to threaten the cities of Ventura, Ojai, Santa Paula, Casitas Springs and unincorporated areas of Ventura County and spread to the west toward the city of Ojai and continue to move to the southeast into the City of Ventura. \nWith the continuing forecast for northeast winds and low humidities, fire will continue to spread with high winds, warns the incident command team. Firefighters confront the Creek Fire in Los Angeles County, Dec. 6, 2017 (Photo courtesy LA County) \nA total of 1,510 firefighters are at the scene of the Creek Fire north of San Fernando on and south of the Angeles National Forest. \nIn Los Angeles County, the Creek Fire was reported at 3:44 am Tuesday. The large, wind-driven brush fire is burning in the hills near Sylmar and Sunland-Tujunga in chaparral, brush and tall grass. It has grown to 11,377 acres due to extreme fire behavior and strong, gusty winds. \nAt least 2,500 structures are threatened and 110,000 people have been evacuated. The fire is being managed under Unified Command with the U.S. Forest Service, Los Angeles County and Los Angeles City. \nThis fire is right in central Los Angeles; 55 L.A. Unified schools were closed and evacuated today due to the wildfires. \nLater tonight more evacuations were ordered as yet another fire broke out, this one in the area of the Getty Center and Skirball Center. \nThis fire is in the area of homes and evacuations have been ordered. An evacuation advisory has been issued for areas west of the 405 Freeway. Be prepared to evacuate in the areas west of the 405, between Mulholland to the North, Sunset Blvd to the South and Mandeville Canyon Road to the West. \nGovernor Jerry Brown has issued emergency proclamations for both these counties, freeing up resources to help them deal with these disasters. \nThere has been a heartwarming outpouring of help for the evacuees and of prayers for the firefighters on the front lines. \nVideo and film director Robby Starbuck said on Twitter, \u201cThis is going to be a terrifying 48 hours for our LA firefighters, their kids, their spouses and their families. Please pray for them and don\u2019t take their sacrifice for granted. They\u2019re on a mission to save lives and structures tonight in nearly impossible conditions.\u201d \nThe ridesharing company Lyft is offering free rides to evacuees. \nPeople are opening their homes to evacuees, offering couches if they don\u2019t have spare bedrooms. Neighbors are helping to lead threatened horses to safety. Horses in the path of the Creek Fire are led to safety, Dec. 5, 2017 (Photo by Harry Garvin / LA Fire Dept.) \nAndy Kenareki\u200f tweeted some good advice about the wild animals California residents may now see trying to escape from the fires. \u201cIf you live anywhere near the fires, please be aware that wild animals are fleeing the fires and they may show up in your yards. The CA Board of Forestry and Fire Protection is urging you to bring your domestic animals in at night and let the wild animals pass.\u201d \nThe American Red Cross is providing safe shelter and support for people with no other place to go, and about 430 people took refuge from the fires overnight in seven Red Cross shelters. \nThe Red Cross says everyone is welcome. People do not need to be American citizens to receive Red Cross assistance. \nThe Red Cross and partners are providing care for evacuated pets. Service animals and therapy pets are welcome at Red Cross shelters. \nThe South Coast Air Quality Management District says smoke from the Creek Fire and Skirball Fire is causing poor air quality in the San Fernando Valley and in Los Angeles County Coastal areas. \nThe air quality experts advise that if you are in an affected area, avoid unnecessary outdoor activity and keep windows and doors closed. People with heart or lung disease or asthma, the elderly and children should take extra precaution.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harry garvin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas fire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robby starbuck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerry brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy kenareki", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wind-whipped wildfires devastate southern california subscribe wind-whipped wildfires devastate southern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles fire dept", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas aquinas college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "creek fire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "red cross", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angeles national forest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la fire dept.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ca board of forestry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unified command", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. forest service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los padres national forest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "creek fire and skirball fire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south coast air quality management district", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skirball center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lyft", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sunland-tujunga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ojai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sylmar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "highway 101", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa ana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l.a.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa paula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "casitas springs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san fernando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mandeville canyon road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san fernando valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mulholland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:19.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc51ba13c51af0d0021c5e430abd3f48b62a15c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS0UnUau7k.dYJZyiC2GIJ4obiXrtrwrZzc.mNi7yVd6E2DYW36i9N3BWEFCzjwWcWDiCf52KKSJVkM9wrjlWXe1MZTjALDCwy4dnvK_ImCyKzVk0Is4ivy", "site_full": "newsline.com", "site": "newsline.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Australia celebrates 'day for love' as it allows same-sex marriage - Newsline", "title_full": "Australia celebrates 'day for love' as it allows same-sex marriage - Newsline", "published": "2017-12-07T10:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.277, "main_image": "https://newsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/LYNXMPEDB60HP_L.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dc51ba13c51af0d0021c5e430abd3f48b62a15c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS0UnUau7k.dYJZyiC2GIJ4obiXrtrwrZzc.mNi7yVd6E2DYW36i9N3BWEFCzjwWcWDiCf52KKSJVkM9wrjlWXe1MZTjALDCwy4dnvK_ImCyKzVk0Is4ivy", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "Australia celebrates 'day for love' as it allows same-sex marriage - Newsline", "text": "592 SHARES \u00a9 Reuters. A supporter of the \u2018Yes\u2019 vote for marriage equality wears a shirt as he celebrates after it was announced the majority of Australians support same-sex marriage in a national survey, at a rally in Sydney \nSYDNEY (Reuters) \u2013 Australia became the 26th nation to legalize same-sex marriage on Thursday, prompting cheers and singing from a packed parliament public gallery in a country where some states ruled homosexual acts to be illegal until just 20 years ago. \nLawmakers, who had cast aside a conservative push to allow religious objectors to refuse service to same-sex couples, waved rainbow flags and embraced on the floor of the chamber, where earlier in the debate a politician had proposed to his same-sex partner. \nFewer than five of 150 MPs voted against the law. \n\u201cWhat a day. What a day for love, for equality, for respect,\u201d said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. \u201c\u2026It is time for more marriages.\u201d \nThe laws, which will also recognize same-sex marriages solemnized in foreign countries, take effect from Saturday. Because a month\u2019s notice is required for the state to recognize a marriage, the first legal same-sex unions will be in January. \nAustralians had overwhelmingly endorsed legalizing same-sex marriage in a postal survey run by the national statistics agency. \nThe bill cleared the upper house last month and had been expected to pass on Thursday after Turnbull\u2019s Liberal-National coalition government and the main opposition Labor Party had previously said they wanted to pass it by Dec. 7. \nBut religious organizations and conservative lawmakers had voiced strong opposition and proposed dozens of amendments. \nDuring parliamentary debate, they pressed for broad protections for religious objectors, among them florists and bankers, to refuse service to same-sex couples. \n\u201cThese amendments, rather, are a shield for people and organizations that hold to a traditional view of marriage. They are not a sword to be wielded in the service of bigotry,\u201d government MP Andrew Hastie said in parliament. \nAmendments to permit lay celebrants to decline to solemnize same-sex marriages and businesses opposed to the unions to refuse service at wedding receptions were all defeated, one after the other, during three days of debate. \n\u201cLove has won, and it\u2019s time to pop the bubbly,\u201d Greens MP and same-sex marriage supporter Adam Bandt said.

Easley, AP Kentucky sexual harassment inquiry sent to ethics commission 1 / 1 Back to Gallery FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) \u2014 A taxpayer-funded investigation of a secret sexual harassment settlement signed by four GOP lawmakers in Kentucky was stymied because the lawmakers refused to talk about it or disclose documents.\nA report by a Kentucky law firm confirmed that former House Speaker Jeff Hoover, his chief of staff Ginger Wills and lawmakers Jim DeCesare, Michael Meredith and Brian Linder all agreed to settle a sexual harassment claim brought by a member of the House GOP caucus staff.\nAlthough all agreed to be interviewed, none would discuss the settlement, say how much money was paid or provide documents or emails to investigators. In Kentucky, legislative emails are privileged and can be released only if the lawmaker agrees.\nLATEST SFGATE VIDEOS Now Playing: Now Playing Behind the scenes: \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" sfgate Star Wars: The Last Jedi (official trailer) sfgate Muni bus and streetcar collide sfgate Time lapse of Bay Area traffic sfgate Mountain lion and kitten spotted for first time since fire sfgate Santa Rosa firefighters headed south to fight LA blaze sfgate The best views in Russian Hill sfgate Ventura resident shows view of massive fire sfgate Oakland city workers go on strike sfgate Smoke from Creek Fire smothers Lake View Terrace in Los Angeles sfgate In response, acting House Speaker David Osborne asked the Legislative Ethics Commission to take over the investigation. Specifically, he wants the commission to use its subpoena power to get a copy of the settlement and find out if any part of it was paid by political donors or lobbyists, which would be illegal.\n\"There is still information we don't have, and we believe the Ethics Commission can and should get it to give the people of Kentucky a full and complete picture of what happened,\" Osborne said in a news release.\nHoover acknowledged the settlement and resigned his leadership position last month after it was first reported by the Courier Journal. House GOP leaders have removed DeCesare, Meredith and Linder from their committee chairmanships. Republican Gov. Matt Bevin has asked for all four to resign, but none have.\nWills remains in her post as chief of staff, working with Osborne and other Republican leaders.\nShortly after Hoover resigned, House GOP leaders hired the Middleton Reutlinger law firm to investigate the settlement. While the firm interviewed 40 witnesses, the woman who made the claim declined to talk. Investigators could not get a copy of the woman's original demand letter or the settlement. And the public officials involved refused to talk about it because they said the settlement requires them to keep the details private.\nInvestigators said they were confident lawmakers did not use illegal political donations to pay for the settlement. They wrote that public officials assured them the settlement was paid for with their own money or borrowing from \"arms-length loan transactions\" from banks or \"family members or close family friends not involved in lobbying, government contract work or any other impermissible endeavour.\"\nRedacted documents included in the report show Hoover paid his portion of the settlement in part with a loan from First National Bank in Russell Springs, Kentucky.\nHowever, the ethics complaint filed by Osborne notes investigators could not be sure because the lawmakers \"would not share the amount of the settlement and legal fees paid.\"\nThe report, signed by attorney Dennis D. Murrell, said the firm found it \"untenable that legislators elected by the people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky can settle claims involving alleged workplace activity ... without disclosing it to the Ethics Commission\" or others. It also noted there was no policy in place for partisan staff to report workplace complaints.\nOsborne said he is considering appointing a task force to develop a formal system to address workplace complaints. He said Republican leaders are preparing to respond to the report but did not elaborate. A question-and-answer section included in Osborne's news release asked \"should any staff members be fired?\"\nOsborne responded by saying: \"Personnel decisions will be made by House Leadership, and we are planning to follow up with a memo on internal personnel issues in the coming days.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/67/65/34/14636817/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/qyZLykzv-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/ymIabdMc-720.jpg)", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/oT0P81gO-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/fPX3XJZJ-720.jpg)", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/67/65/34/14636817/5/920x920.jpg", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/r6YuJPz1-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/Y1yGNtl0-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/Kc2ifh3L-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/GTtCvdHL-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/5T4LjYVX-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/Gf0WUwLB-720.jpg)"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:20.077+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "803a412aa806c175a8cf4cc8b2b207cf3f1e1777", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKwsVX83iHME_02n3Qs439JdFIlOZinfctBJw6Q5THBpOqR9GtQdHM7L1weUmzBkTE1LEHnIr8rh4XkjO7sr5tn1h6t077rue2dPH1JmUDjcu85NcFVZ2CAdtczcmamS_OnOLvUaTkeYxlIsS2UY8N83zTxvn16CL.1brYQM4kykRjl3SpBfGkSkb6UrfaR8s-", "site_full": "www.ebay.co.uk", "site": "ebay.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.ebay.co.uk/b/Vehicle-Tool-Boxes-Storage/179443/bn_1633449", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Vehicle Tool Boxes &amp; Storage | eBay", "title": "Halfords-DIY-Storage-Garage-Workshop-Chest-Cabinet-8-Drawer-Tool-Centre-5", "title_full": "Reviews: Halfords-DIY-Storage-Garage-Workshop-Chest-Cabinet-8-Drawer-Tool-Centre-5 | eBay", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.062, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "803a412aa806c175a8cf4cc8b2b207cf3f1e1777", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKwsVX83iHME_02n3Qs439JdFIlOZinfctBJw6Q5THBpOqR9GtQdHM7L1weUmzBkTE1LEHnIr8rh4XkjO7sr5tn1h6t077rue2dPH1JmUDjcu85NcFVZ2CAdtczcmamS_OnOLvUaTkeYxlIsS2UY8N83zTxvn16CL.1brYQM4kykRjl3SpBfGkSkb6UrfaR8s-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "davidhassell1957", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "very easy to move around", "text": "brilliant bit of kit", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 5.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:21.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5465965d0d4e2179cf120a1189fd842118c6bc97", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwaez9tRfpoUmxJvWMzQZJex5c5aEJUVgCkDu4Si3nhcS0mio28WWPR0XTO2hnP72O0I5D9K0XzigFTO2qfKopRAQIipuP76_dnoyfRmVpkTnstjFUPkZHYCUMCV2nXTsxV.0OgdQzvjg--", "site_full": "feedjunkie.com", "site": "feedjunkie.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/feedjunkie", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Feedjunkie.com", "title": "Volkswagen exec gets seven years in prison over emissions scandal", "title_full": "Volkswagen exec gets seven years in prison over emissions scandal", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5465965d0d4e2179cf120a1189fd842118c6bc97", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwaez9tRfpoUmxJvWMzQZJex5c5aEJUVgCkDu4Si3nhcS0mio28WWPR0XTO2hnP72O0I5D9K0XzigFTO2qfKopRAQIipuP76_dnoyfRmVpkTnstjFUPkZHYCUMCV2nXTsxV.0OgdQzvjg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Engadget", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "Volkswagen exec gets seven years in prison over emissions scandal", "text": "Engadget Volkswagen exec gets seven years in prison over emissions scandal Volkswagen official Oliver Schmidt has been sentenced to seven years in prison and handed down a $400,000 fine.
