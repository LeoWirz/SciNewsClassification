The farmers market and surrounding properties, including the outlet, are owned by Mercedes Corporation.\nThe sale value is undisclosed.\nSchlegel\u2019s father, Ron, and the late Milo Shantz were friends in their youth and both shared Mennonite upbringings.\nMercedes Corporation, owned by the Shantz family, as well as about 40 individual investors, decided to divest.\n\u201cWhen they thought of divesting, we were one of the folks they thought of and that\u2019s how the conversation started,\u201d said Schlegel.\nSchlegel said he\u2019s pleased the market is staying local, as well.\n\u201cThe Schlegel family is part of our community and proudly part of our community and we were motivated by the fact that the farmers market district is really a gem of an institution in the community,\u201d said Schlegel, noting the community response after a fire destroyed the main building in 2013. \u201cWe think it\u2019s an important part of our community and we\u2019re happy it\u2019s staying local. We wouldn\u2019t have felt right about it if it went to some multinational corporation or private equity firm or something that doesn\u2019t have local ties.\u201d\nAs for changes to the market area, Schlegel said he\u2019s open to making changes to improve the area, but there\u2019s nothing drastic planned.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to make any sudden or drastic changes,\u201d said Schlegel. \u201cIn the medium and long-term, we certainly aren\u2019t going to make changes that are to the detriment of the farmers market. Our hope is to make the farmers market bigger, stronger and more vibrant.\u201d\nAs for Mercedes Corp., there are more properties remaining to be sold.

You can learn a lot just by peoples attitude and body language in addition to what is actually said on the subject of the discussions.\n\nAlthough I was disappointed that Susan Aitken has taken the decision to have a back seat in the negotiations, she was at least honest and clear and open with us. I also believe that she was genuine in her desire to see a resolution to these cases.\n\nUnfortunately, the same cannot be said for the officers. My impression was that there was still a concern on their part in protecting their reputations and decisions they were involved in in the past rather than looking forward and do what\u2019s best for the council and the staff. They also appear to still have a completely different view of the effect of the Court of session decisions and its implications to us. This is potentially a major stumbling block.\n\nNowhere is this clearer than in the approach to WPBR. Our view is that it should be scrapped and a new pay structure implemented as soon as possible. This will draw a line under the scheme and the litigation and enable everybody to move forward. Unfortunately the officers seem to think that this will be an admission they got it wrong and their approach is to simply try and find fixes to the scheme to enable it to continue but with some minor modifications.\n\nDespite all the litigation they still can\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with the scheme! They have asked us to prepare a paper setting out what\u2019s wrong with it! We will do this but it shouldn\u2019t be necessary and is going to cause delay.\n\nIn any event doesn\u2019t matter if we are right, what matters is what this reveals about the officers attitude. Rather than fresh eyes and a fresh approach it\u2019s a desire to preserve the past as much as possible.\n\nThis is going to be a long uphill battle if it stays like this.\n\nWe did make progress on their demand for secrecy. It was agreed that base line would be openness but items would be flagged up as confidential in the minutes. This means there might be delay in reporting back to you after meetings whilst minutes are circulated but it\u2019s a good step forward.\n\nWe also agreed twice monthly meetings. So not all bad yesterday. There\u2019s going to be a lot of work but good that there\u2019s a commitment to that as well.\n\nHope all that helps. \n\n\nStefan Cross ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "susan aitken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stefan cross", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hen houses   stefan cross qc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "improvement service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "snp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "city council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "glasgow", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:35:00.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "791aa269f34948996098b7d1eb1e6c74ba8c4915", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwrlKEagknWD2k4gGKhKwFCf27y01aD_KnXgarDqIF1_Znl_QKYAtHGv8rQ19iGzrI-", "site_full": "forums.d2jsp.org", "site": "d2jsp.org", "site_section": "http://forums.d2jsp.org/forum.php?f=204", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Football &amp; Rugby - d2jsp Forum", "title": "Rating The Job Security Of Every N F L Head Coach", "title_full": "Rating The Job Security Of Every N F L Head Coach - d2jsp Topic", "published": "2017-12-07T01:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.012, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46006, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fbf94a1e8efb57107d628e9cedb30e3ec13103c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwrlKEagknWD2k4gGKhKwFCf27y01aD_KnXgarDqIF1_Znl_QKYAtHGtbGhSirdF3rtqblxzJET6Q--", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "AmineA", "published": "2017-12-07T03:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: Pd\nYa u r", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:35:00.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9af7da352f0a382fbb5f172346292ed6bfb011b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_m5XyAWQMkMGK20ZFtS9CaVm_7BdSweq484mpWC_54J7seF6gyvZJRHwc3qnQuOIXKOuFrsus77MEka87bSquq", "site_full": "www.grapevinelive.co.uk", "site": "grapevinelive.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.grapevinelive.co.uk/feed/", "site_categories": ["music", "entertainment"], "section_title": "GrapevineLIVE", "title": "Scott Matthews UK Tour", "title_full": "Scott Matthews UK Tour", "published": "2017-12-07T11:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.grapevinelive.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1500Scott-Matthews-4-1500x800.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9af7da352f0a382fbb5f172346292ed6bfb011b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_m5XyAWQMkMGK20ZFtS9CaVm_7BdSweq484mpWC_54J7seF6gyvZJRHwc3qnQuOIXKOuFrsus77MEka87bSquq", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tony Bell", "published": "2017-12-07T11:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "Scott Matthews UK Tour", "text": "Last updated Dec 6, 2017 21 \nScott Matthews\u2019 new record, The Great Untold , is a career-defining masterpiece. The sixth studio album by the Ivor Novello Award-winning singer-songwriter is the one that many have craved: it is a masterclass in honesty, instinct and reflection. \nA largely acoustic recording, Matthews\u2019 sublime new record features sparse production. Recorded at home and in acoustically resonant rural churches, instrumentation has been jettisoned. His ten-song cycle is the sound of a man comfortable in his own skin, putting his neck on the line with a collection of otherworldly songs. \nThe ghosts of Paul Simon, Tim Buckley, Nick Drake and John Martyn loom large on a collection that ranks alongside work by some of the world\u2019s great singer-songwriters. On his sixth record, Matthews has created songs that are breathtaking in their beauty and audacious in their simplicity. \nThe absence of drums, bass, cello and flute on The Great Untold , however, should not infer that it lacks depth. Far from it. The richness in Matthews\u2019 new work comes from subtle playing and mellifluous melodies. He has improved again. He has become a master of his craft; a man who can play like Bert Jansch, sing like an angel and write songs that Joni Mitchell might admire. \nIn many ways, The Great Untold is the start of a new era for Matthews. Since his debut album, Passing Stranger, in 2006, the Wolverhampton-born star of bluesy acoustica has refined his craft. Writing deft and sensitive songs during a trajectory that begin with the ethereal \u2018Elusive\u2019, The Great Untold marks a new beginning. \nThe first great arc of his career was completed with his Home duology; a stunning pair of records that reflected on his journey thus far. The Great Untold is the sound of a man moving on. Matthews is recently married, soon-to-experience fatherhood and has new hopes and fears, new stories to tell. \u201cAfter Home Part 2 was finished, I was looking to move forward by marrying harmony with my experiences since the last record. The plan to write an acoustic record has always been there. And finally the time is right to do that.\u201d \nMatthews has tested himself as a songwriter. The absence of a band means he is vulnerable and exposed. But, in many ways, it was ever thus. He started as a soloist and is ready to fly alone. It opens new possibilities, a different type of challenge. \u201cIt takes me out of my comfort zone and has made me test myself. I\u2019ve pared it down to guitar and vocals. At the beginning, there was nobody else. It\u2019s time to surprise myself. It\u2019s time to go back to my own world. I\u2019ve gone full circle.\u201d \nLyrically, The Great Untold is a work with poetic intent. \u201cIt\u2019s a collection of songs that lots of people will relate to. It\u2019s a real mood-shift of a record. The songs always start from a personal angle, but listeners will hear them in different ways. When I\u2019m writing, I\u2019m almost hearing voices from The Masters and thinking: \u2018Would they approve?\u2019\u201d \nThe point is to make a connection. \u201cI want to move somebody with the power of moods and music. It\u2019s very powerful stuff.\u201d \nIt is in the right hands. And that\u2019s an apposite description for The Great Untold .

ADVERTISEMENT\nAs described by the police officer at the scene through a redacted PDF file , among the items found in the singer\u2019s room were a prescription for generic sedative Ambien with one pill broken in half, a glass of Corona beer less than half full and an empty bottle of Stella Artois pilsner.\nPolice also discovered a journal with a biography that was handwritten, but found no suicide note at the scene.\n\u201cAutopsy findings are characteristic of suicidal hanging. There was a history of suicidal ideation,\u201d the coroner\u2019s note read.\nWidow\u2019s fury\nChester\u2019s widow, Talinda Bennington, meanwhile, recently took to Twitter to express her disgust toward the tabloid outlet TMZ and the coroner for \u201csensationalizing\u201d her husband\u2019s previous suicide attempt in 2016.\n\u201cFun fact- When your husband dies by suicide, the LA County Coroner\u2019s office will PARAPHRASE your private conversation with them to dramatize and sensationalize the story and then SCUMBAG FILTH like TMZ post it for the world to feast on. It was redacted to protect all the kids!!,\u201d she wrote in a now pinned tweet.\nFun fact- When your husband dies by suicide, the LA County Coroner\u2019s office will PARAPHRASE your private conversation with them to dramatize and sensationalize the story and then SCUMBAG FILTH like TMZ post it for the world to feast on.

Her death was confirmed by the Ventura County Medical Examiner's Office, who revealed on Wednesday that she died of asphyxia due to hanging. \nAmes was in the midst of controversy a few days ago after passing derogatory comments about gay porn workers on her Twitter handle, after she dropped out of a project because her co-star had worked in gay porn before. whichever (lady) performer is replacing me tomorrow for @EroticaXNews , you\u2019re shooting with a guy who has shot gay porn, just to let cha know. BS is all I can say??\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Do agents really not care about who they\u2019re representing? #ladirect I do my homework for my body?\u270f\ufe0f? \u2014 August Ames (@AugustAmesxxx) December 3, 2017 \nAmes' tweet triggered huge controversy as many people started trolling her for being homophobic. She, however, defended her stance, claiming that she liked girls and her comment was about the freedom to decide about her own body. After a barrage of criticism and abuse, she posted an ominous tweet, which turned out to be her last. fuck y\u2019all \u2014 August Ames (@AugustAmesxxx) December 5, 2017 \nAmes had claimed that her reaction was not due to homophobia but she cared about her safety. To this, many Twitter users pointed out that gay-porn workers are also tested by the same agencies that test heterosexual-porn workers. However, she refused to apologize for her statements, saying that she does not know what these actors do in their real life. I don\u2019t have anything to apologize for! Apologizing for taking extra steps to ensue that my body stays safe? Fuck you guys attacking me when none of my intentions were malicious. I fucking love the gay community! What the fuck ever! I CHOOSE who I have inside my body. No hate. https://t.co/7dSbq27K2F \u2014 August Ames (@AugustAmesxxx) December 4, 2017 \u201cChoose who YOU want to work with\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable\u201d\u201cShare your thoughts\u201d \u2014 August Ames (@AugustAmesxxx) December 4, 2017 How am I homophobic if I myself am attracted to women? Not wanting to have sex with gay men is not homophobic; they don\u2019t want to have sex with me either? so by \u2014 August Ames (@AugustAmesxxx) December 3, 2017 \nKevin Moore, the deceased's husband, told AVN that Ames was \"the kindest person I ever knew and she meant the world to me.\" He also requested for privacy during this difficult time. \nOfficials do not suspect foul play as she had reportedly suffered from depression for a long time, which led her to possibly take her own life. \nHer death has prompted many heartfelt condolence messages on social media by her acquaintances and co-workers, who are all in praise for her. People are now attributing her death to the cyberbullying she received in the past few days. Five days later, she committed suicide after a series of web attacks on her. RIP #AugustAmes pic.twitter.com/68pgG3GOd5 Suicide is real. Be wise with your words.Saying things can cause people to kill themselves.Responsibility is relative & is bound in equality.Be kind to everyone online & in person as you don't know who is on the brink of taking their own life... #RIP #AugustAmes \u2014 Morgan Rockwell (@NODEfather) December 6, 2017 Twitter once again proving its mob mentality and extreme bullying tactics. Her blood is on your hands you self proclaimed \"virtuous\" assholes. #augustames \u2014 Lucidia (@DGTinfoilhat) December 6, 2017 I would like to point out the incredible amount of attacks that were made on me by the lgbt community when I voiced my opinion on a trans woman being in Playboy. I received death threats against me and my daughter. This went on for days. This mob mentality must end. #augustames \u2014 Jenna Jameson (@jennajameson) December 7, 2017 More I read into what happened to August Ames, the angrier I get. The online witch hunts have to stop. You can disagree with people but sending thousands of angry people at one person has killed someone. I'm truly disappointed with the people who engaged in this. \u2014 Empress Galina (@GallyTurbo) December 7, 2017 \nAugust Ames has appeared in more than 270 adult films and worked with all major studios. She had also won AVN awards twice and was nominated for the Female Performer of the Year award at the 2018 AVN Awards, to be held in January 2018.

REUTERS \nEmbattled commodities trader Noble Group is racing against time to meet its financial deadlines. \nThe company last month said it was in preliminary talks with \"various stakeholders\" to address the company's deteriorating financial position. \nNoble Group's results highlighted the worsening liquidity conditions for the Singapore-listed trader. Liquidity headroom gives an indication of how much spare capital it has available to fund its business. The figure slumped to $800 million at the end of September from $1.4 billion three months earlier. \nIn a bid to stay afloat, Noble agreed to sell most of its oil business to Vitol Group in October and will be holding a meeting in Singapore on December 15 for shareholders to vote on the sale . \nThe Hong Kong-based firm has been forced to shrink its business , exiting loss-making and non-core operations in order to survive. \nLast month, the company announced the surprise departure of its co-Chief Executive Jeff Frase, just days after it reported a third-quarter loss of $1.17 billion and warned that the operating environment remains challenging. \nNoble Group shares were down 2.9 percent at S$0.13 on the Singapore Exchange. The trader's market capitalization, which once topped $10 billion, has shrunk to $180 million.

READ: Advanced Oncotherapy making significant progress; in stronger position to assess funding options \nThe cash will come in three distinct tranches. Yantai CIPU Medical Technology, a medical devices firm based in the People\u2019s Republic, is directly investing in Advanced Oncotherapy . It is acquiring \u00a313.5mln in shares at 30p each, giving it a 29.9% stake in the business. \nIt is also paying \u00a316.5mln for the rights to sell the LIGHT system China, Macau, Taiwan, Hong-Kong and South Korea. Funding from investors \nA further \u00a37.4mln will come from other equity investors who are also buying stock at 30p each, which represents a 10% discount to last night\u2019s closing price. \nChief executive Nicolas Serandour said he was delighted to have concluded a deal that brought in longer-term financing as well as a new, experienced strategic partner. READ: Advanced Oncotherapy on track with development of first LIGHT system as it checks off another key milestone \n\"This deal is consistent with our strategy to focus our resources on the technological development of the first LIGHT system and to establish partnerships with those businesses that have a strong track record of market access and a unique expertise in their own geographies,\u201d he added. \n\u201cWith our long-term financing arrangements now well engaged we can continue to focus on making our unique proton therapy technology available to patients around the world.\" \nThe company in its update said work with Metric Capital Partners to conclude a \u00a324mln loan facility continues. \n\u201cTerms and conditions are being updated to reflect the developments since the initial announcement of the agreement with Metric in May 2016,\u201d it added. Shares motor \nThe shares, up 132% in the last week, advanced 13p to 46p in morning trade. That's an immediate 10p a share profit for investors who backed the latest fundraiser. \nLIGHT stands for Linac Image Guided Hadron Technology. The kit is cheaper and smaller than the current units, which are almost prohibitively expensive. \nIt has the ability to propel protons at the speeds generated by much larger machines. \nThe proton accelerator used by Advanced Oncotherapy was licensed from CERN, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, which is currently hunting the \u2018God particle\u2019. Increasing demand for proton therapy \n\u201cThere is an increasing demand for proton therapy globally, with millions of patients who could potentially benefit from this technology,\u201d said chairman, Dr Michael Sinclair recently. \n\u201cWhile the access to this technology remains scarce, there is a significant unmet medical need the LIGHT system is uniquely suited to provide. \n\u201cWe are in a prime position to provide a novel and disruptive technology that advances current methods of cancer treatment in the UK and worldwide. \n\u201cThere is mounting evidence for the clinical superiority of proton therapy over traditional X-ray radiotherapy. \n\u201cThis evidence will only increase as more proton beam centres are built and more patients are treated. LIGHT's modularity and linear design allow for mass production, shorter manufacturing lead times, easier installation/commissioning and offer both cost and clinical advantages.\u201d Top stories", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "george adams", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "akers biosciences", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ventripoint diagnostics", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:35:04.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "766f7dff5b368711d885ffef10cab635a8e6bd03", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmnnwrDkoc.QxCLu092WJ5Yzol2KsJi74kMqyjAkxJl6R9kGn.T_S9ChAIo7ahPBGmc-", "site_full": "russianinsects.com", "site": "russianinsects.com", "site_section": "http://russianinsects.com/forum/list.php?1", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Rusinsects Forum :: Coleoptera", "title": "light-colored wood flooring", "title_full": "Rusinsects Forum :: Coleoptera :: light-colored wood flooring", "published": "2017-12-07T05:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.107, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "766f7dff5b368711d885ffef10cab635a8e6bd03", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmnnwrDkoc.QxCLu092WJ5Yzol2KsJi74kMqyjAkxJl6R9kGn.T_S9ChAIo7ahPBGmc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "qizhen0809", "published": "2017-12-07T05:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "light-colored wood flooring", "text": "<p>is also very good, in particular, the use of patented Saint Lock Technology, the floor will not tilt or loose, no abnormal noise, cost is very high.

Though Singapore was not a signatory to the trilateral agreement, Singapore has been providing intelligence information and assistance about the presence of terrorism in the southern Philippines. \nMoreover, when the Marawi battle against terrorists ended last October 2017, many analysts warned that terrorists are building themselves to strike back again. \nRolly Pelinggon, a Mindanao redevelopment expert said, that with the destruction of schools in Marawi and the absence of formal education, children will again be vulnerable to violent extremist ideology. \n\"The government has to fast-track building more schools that will provide formal quality education otherwise, it will be too late for the government to react because thousands have already embraced violent extremism as a result of the absence of formal schools,\" Pelinggon said.
