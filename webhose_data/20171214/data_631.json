This is a splash screen that loads even before BIOS splash. It does complain that express gate installation failed (probably because I am using HDDs in AHCI mode).\nAs long as the express gate splash shows up on the display port monitor - then everything (express gate -> BIOS -> Marvell -> Bit Locker -> Win10) displays fine on display port monitor.\nHowever, if you happen to start the system when 4K monitor is not switched on (OR) for some reason monitor detects signal only at the point where BIOS splash has already shown up (missed express gate splash)- then the entire thing fails right at bit-locker screen prompt with a black screen.\nFor now, the most reliable way is to have a monitor on DVI-D & continue on until a motherboard upgrade.\n#21", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:07.068+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cb1f8a7bc7177968128f12075c58444ef2042a8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqIBRdCDNqED.CzgV4w9cxpAPu3bJnVKiwtNUhx3ZCC2h.1j157tVMcnUNVZw6L.lJhCqvxRsxseqNMGs.4PtowRQtQqrQASBFBYh1jh00oM0YWbZQw6ktbu.ac2s4APj2pkNLOoz8axmCg1u8dzzzjnqjbcPV7HB_o3Q_5kiaQF_T9fdWkXnfkpnPEPk1a_yb5FVhb_.s_hQnddspiHSc3w--", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/politics/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Politics links", "title": "(9828814) You're not the only one who thinks it's odd that Donald Trump would be the one to help open a new Civil Rights museum in Mississippi.

Your attention to detail and obvious bias does you credit. Try this, besides annoying tweets and a weird accent, what has Trump really done that was terrible? I mean truly awful? There is nothing he has done that other presidents haven't. Wall - Obama and Bush and many others put up border fencing. Travel ban - Obama and Bush put restrictions on travelers from other countries. DACA - Was never meant to be permanent, Obama even said so, democrats refused to compromise with him (like republicans refused to compromise with Obama). For all the hatred and animosity, he really has been sort of benign. Your day to day life hasn't changed one bit I imagine, you just are an angry person. His presidency so far is about average/par for the course. He just pitched a tent in your brain and dominates your life which is actually sad.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:08.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cb1f8a7bc7177968128f12075c58444ef2042a8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqIBRdCDNqED.CzgV4w9cxpAPu3bJnVKiwtNUhx3ZCC2h.1j157tVMcnUNVZw6L.lJhCqvxRsxseqNMGs.4PtowRQtQqrQASBFBYh1jh00oM0YWbZQw6ktbu.ac2s4APj2pkNLOoz8axmCg1u8dzzzjnqjbcPV7HB_o3Q_5kiaQF_T9fdWkXnfkpnPEPk1a_yb5FVhb_.s_hQnddspiHSc3w--", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/politics/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Politics links", "title": "(9828814) You're not the only one who thinks it's odd that Donald Trump would be the one to help open a new Civil Rights museum in Mississippi.

Your attention to detail and obvious bias does you credit. Try this, besides annoying tweets and a weird accent, what has Trump really done that was terrible? I mean truly awful? There is nothing he has done that other presidents haven't. Wall - Obama and Bush and many others put up border fencing. Travel ban - Obama and Bush put restrictions on travelers from other countries. DACA - Was never meant to be permanent, Obama even said so, democrats refused to compromise with him (like republicans refused to compromise with Obama). For all the hatred and animosity, he really has been sort of benign. Your day to day life hasn't changed one bit I imagine, you just are an angry person. His presidency so far is about average/par for the course. He just pitched a tent in your brain and dominates your life which is actually sad.\nHe's the worst President we have ever had so far. He has publicly told over 1000 documented lies since he took office, appointed a whole range of useless wankers and saboteurs - and that 56% disapproval has got to be the best poll you could cherry pick - most put it in the high sixties.\nHe has also systematically attempted to undo everything Obama did, from environmental regulations to rules intended to regulate puppy mills.\nPUPPY MILLS,. for f**k's sake.\nThe very question \"wha ...\nSo in other words you got nothing. Obama did everything by executive order because he couldn't be bothered to work with congress. Trump can therefore undo everything by executive order. You do realize Trump was elected to undo what Obama did by executive order right? So as I thought a lot of people so far have said basically, \"you're an idiot Trump sucks\" without bothering to answer the question. I will give you credit for talking about undoing Obama's environmental regulations but see, many people thought Obama's regulations were to large/intrusive. So a lot of people, probably about half, don't see this as a bad thing. Yes he has done unpopular things, but so has every president. What has he done that is truly above board?

Obama did everything by executive order because he couldn't be bothered to work with congress. Trump can therefore undo everything by executive order.

There is nothing he has done that other presidents haven't. Wall - Obama and Bush and many others put up border fencing. Travel ban - Obama and Bush put restrictions on travelers from other countries.

For all the hatred and animosity, he really has been sort of benign. Your day to day life hasn't changed one bit I imagine, you just are an angry person.

Lmao! Talk about pulling crap out of your arse!\nEverything you said after that has even less and less credibility!\nPresident Donald J Trump is, and will be considered by everyone eventually, the greatest President we have ever had!\nYou're absolutely correct, it's not 1000 lies.

Everyone involved would be grateful. At an almost 70% disapproval rating, he is literally the worst and least popular President we have ever had.\nActually it is a 56% disapproval rating and he literally isn't the worst president we have ever had as he literally hasn't finished being president yet. Your attention to detail and obvious bias does you credit. Try this, besides annoying tweets and a weird accent, what has Trump really done that was terrible? I mean truly awful? There is nothing he has done that other presidents haven't. Wall - Obama and Bush and many others put up border fencing. Travel ban - Obama and Bush put restrictions on travelers from other countries. DACA - Was never meant to be permanent, Obama even said so, democrats refused to compromise with him (like republicans refused to compromise with Obama). For all the hatred and animosity, he really has been sort of benign. Your day to day life hasn't changed one bit I imagine, you just are an angry person. His presidency so far is about average/par for the course. He just pitched a tent in your brain and dominates your life which is actually sad.\nYeah - and I lost count of how many times Obama and Bush talked about walking up to women and grabbing them by the pussy ... or how many twitter wars they got into ... or how many times they engaged in namecalling.\nBush had been accused of actual physical sexual harassment, not just words, lmao!\nAnd Obama? He endorsed a woman who's husband is one of the worst sexually predators/rapists in Washington, and that's saying something! Even worse, Hilary attacked those women, accused the of all kinds of things, then says when a woman accuses a Republican that we must believe her! Again, lmao!\nSeriously, you simply can't make up how hypocritical you leftists are!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:08.015+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15096773, "moreResultsAvailable": 15096673, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512640868015&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 305}
