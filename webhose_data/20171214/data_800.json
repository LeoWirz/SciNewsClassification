Tegan Mouton \nThe festive season can be a killer for your diet, and even the most self-controlled eater can have a difficult time. Whether it\u2019s the flowing alcohol, fatty roasts or delicious desserts, temptation is EVERYWHERE. The holiday season is even more challenging for those with dietary restrictions, like vegans. Whether it\u2019s the increased temptation or the anxiety of being the only vegan at the party, the pressure is on. \nWe caught up with two popular Instagrammers to get some tips on surviving the holiday season as a vegan. \nHow long have you been a vegan? \n\u2018I have been vegan for almost four years.\u2019 \nHow was your first festi ve period as a vegan? \n\u2018My family had accepted my \u201cspecial\u201d eating habits and, luckily for me, most of my favourite Ugandan dishes were pretty easy to make vegan. I am lucky to have a supportive close circle of friends and family who often are willing to go the extra mile by making festive food vegan-friendly when they can.\u2019 \nWhat tips do you have for newbie vegans who are going into their first holiday season without the usual festive foods? \n\u2018It\u2019s not going to be like it used to be \u2013 you have changed, so you will experience it all from a totally different perspective. Google and Pinterest are your friends \u2013 search for your favourite dishes in vegan versions. You might be the only vegan in your family or circle of friends, but not in the world and many of them love sharing their vegan hacks. Some might even actually taste better and lighter on the usual festive-food coma. \n\u2018If invited somewhere, call people ahead of time to warn them and \u201cexplain yourself\u201d. Ask if you can bring something vegan to share or if they are finding it hard to come up with something for you. As tempting as it might be, avoid the urge to preach and become the green grinch. Show compassion and understanding since you used to be munching away gleefully just a year ago. Understand that we all grow and change at different times and from different approaches.\u2019 \nHow long have you been vegan? \n\u2018I have been vegan for three years.\u2019 \nHo w was your first festive period as a vegan? \n\u2018My first festive season [\u2026] was a bit of a disaster, to be honest! I was a very new vegan. My family members are all farmers so they thought I was crazy. But I stuck to my convictions and I was determined not to touch any meat, eggs or dairy. Come Christmas day and my clean living saw me eating a little couscous, salad and roast vegetables \u2013 combine this with an abundance of champagne and ciders, and I ended up getting rather jolly a little too quickly!\u2019 \nWhat tips do you have for newbie vegans who are going into their first holiday season without the usual festive foods? \n\u2018Prepare, prepare, prepare! You honestly can make anything vegan these days, there are so many [\u2026] recipes online now compared to when I first made the change. Download a couple of great recipes and veganise your [festive] feast! A great resource for checking which South African grocery products are vegan is Vegansa.com \u2013 you\u2019d be surprised at how many shop items are actually [plant-based].\u2019 \n\u2018As a new vegan, you will probably have loads of questions from concerned and curious family members who are wondering why you\u2019re not tucking into the roast beef like you were [\u2026] before. It\u2019s up to you to pick your battles \u2013 if you think you can tell your story with no judgement or arguing, then go for it. But if you think you\u2019re going to be caught like a deer in the headlights with every family member firing sarcastic questions and hurtful comments your way, rather just say it\u2019s a discussion for another day.\u2019 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tegan mouton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:32.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "74d76e18200c6c270cf3117ae13bed21c4a812e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.91026zXfsQ52DTI59KEh06jHjEail1m9DONe35eqU4NT5i9XYP9PSDu305_dmnBvP5e_5CfcQI_E.t.szPB2", "site_full": "www.gamefaqs.com", "site": "gamefaqs.com", "site_section": "https://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/210930-pokemon-ultra-sun", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Pokemon Ultra Sun Message Board for 3DS - GameFAQs", "title": "How gen-8 will change when/if it abandons the island setting?", "title_full": "How gen-8 will change when/if it abandons the island setting? - Pokemon Ultra Sun Message Board for 3DS - GameFAQs", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.044, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 569, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fa613a1b235635ebb5d5127a085568263bba6c13", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.91026zXfsQ52DTI59KEh06jHjEail1m9DONe35eqU4NT5i9XYP9PSDu305_dmnBvP5e_5CfcQJd3xfo2XUr0vTUR3FOQp8U-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "User Info: SkyWolf78 SkyWolf78 6 days ago #2 pokeride's definitely getting dropped.

Take a Sneak Peek at the New Emojis for 2018! \nThis is just the beginning\u2026 Busang Senne \nJust when we were getting used to the emoji universe of new dinosaurs and expressive yellow smileys, the list of new emojis for 2018 has been released and it\u2019s the emoji pack of our dreams. \nIt\u2019s only a matter of time before emojis replace words. Before you know it, we\u2019ll have enough in the iOS lexicon to have entire conversations using only smiling turds and unicorns. Welcome to the future, folks. \nThe first emoji was created in 1999 by a Japanese web developer, Shigetaka Kurita. But since Apple introduced emojis to iOS in 2011, they\u2019ve become a pop-culture sensation. The colourful expressions and inanimate objects peppered in our everyday online conversations even have their own movie. Clearly, we\u2019re obsessed. \nvia GIPHY \n2018 emojis are giving much-needed representation for bald people, redheads and people with curly hair. Not to mention, they\u2019ve finally included a sad poo emoji, llama, stick of dynamite, and all the other items you didn\u2019t think you needed \u2026 until now. \nDon\u2019t get your hopes up too high just yet, though \u2013 some emojis you have your eye on may change or even be rejected when it comes to deciding the final batch early next year. Even then, the new emojis will only be up, running and ready to use in the second half of 2018. Ugh! \nStill, they look really cute and at least there\u2019s a sad poo to go with the happy one \u2013 it\u2019s all about balance.

forced out against its will?\nThat Titus and his army were ultimately defeated by a nation of orphans,\nBy an ever-dying people that never died?\nThere is no victory for those who fight a people\nThat never ceased praying, for thousands of years,\nTo return to its capital which they never left.\nWhere their bodies were resurrected\nAfter they were turned into ashes at Auschwitz.\nWhat to do with a

It all boils down to the unorganized nature of the industry Lata Jha Actor Rajinikanth in a still from \u2018Kabali\u2019. \nNew Delhi: Late last month, Tamil film producer Ashok Kumar hanged himself to death in his Chennai apartment. A cousin of popular director M. Sasikumar, Kumar blamed leading financier N. Anbuchezhian for his suicide in a two-page note, saying he had to pay exorbitant interest for loans taken for producing films, had been harassed for years and ultimately driven to the brink by the financier when he couldn\u2019t repay. The tragedy comes a few years after noted producer G. Venkateswaran, older brother of director Mani Ratnam, committed suicide, allegedly due to pressure from financiers, including Anbuchezhian. \nIndustry experts say financing troubles in Tamil cinema are about a lot more than loan sharks. It all boils down to the unorganized nature of the industry. Unlike Bollywood where the corporate-driven studio culture has only picked up in the last decade, the south Indian film industry, including Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam cinema was led by private studios like Prasad Art Pictures and Gemini Studios in the 1980s and 1990s. However, over time though, the system disintegrated, resulting in smaller, independent producers. \n\u201cAnyone can become a producer here (in the south),\u201d said independent trade analyst Sreedhar Pillai. \u201cEvery year, 200 Tamil films are made, out of which 190 are made by first-time producers.\u201d \nThe unknown record of these individuals necessitates financiers who are individuals providing funds for film production at interest rates of 36-48% per annum. Assuming it\u2019s even a Rs1 crore loan, the producer has to pay Rs4 lakh a month or Rs48 lakh a year in interest. A Bollywood production house, on the other hand, would get bank loans at 18-24% per annum. The crisis arises when films fail and individual producers have to take the hit, given that most of these are entirely personalized projects by people who have no experience in distribution or exhibition. \nFurther, Pillai points out, most producers in the south also get greedy for better pre-sales and don\u2019t sign satellite or digital deals till the film\u2019s release, expecting huge money. If the film bombs, prices come down to a fourth of what was expected. \nMoreover, institutional funding is not the easiest alternative in the south. D. Paranthaman of production house V Creations that has backed films like Kabali , said bank interest rates fluctuate depending upon the producer\u2019s track record and reputation. \n\u201cBanks will not give loans to everybody. It has to be a reputed company and artiste (in the lead),\u201d said K.S. Ravikumar, director of films like Lingaa and Dasavathaaram . \u201cEven then, there are many formalities which aren\u2019t easy to work around. You should either know the higher authorities or have recommendations.\u201d \nThe need for loans, in the first place, trade experts say, stems from the mandatory presence of a bankable star to make a project viable. The star-driven culture, particularly of Tamil cinema, translates into not just mainstream, big-budget films dominating but financiers (and occasionally banks) approving loans only when there is a known face on board. Ravikumar emphasizes that a financier will not even consider a Rs1-2 crore film without big names since there would be no guarantee on its release. \n\u201cIt (the funds given) depends upon the artiste. There are only four or five artistes who would be given big money; no one will pay for the others. They might give for directors, but without a star\u2019s presence, it\u2019s a risk for the financiers too,\u201d said P. Vasu, director of films like Chandramukhi and Kuselan . \nEarlier, the film would be in the hands of the producer who would decide on the director and story, except maybe in case of a Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan or M.G. Ramachandran-starrer. But today, the entire production process revolves around the leading man. And producers, especially in the Tamil industry, take loans to pay the hero in advance. \nTrade experts say Tamil superstars like Ajith or Vijay get about Rs30-35 crore as remuneration, of which they demand Rs15 crore as advance. Telugu actors like Mahesh Babu or Pawan Kalyan, on the other hand, would be given Rs20-25 crore of which only a token amount of Rs1-2 crore would be demanded while signing the film and the rest would be given after completion. \n\u201cToday, heroes are deciding who the director would be, and sometimes even the producer,\u201d Vasu said. \u201cIf the director has a story, he will go directly to the hero. If I have a big hero in hand today, any big banner or corporate will come to me. But if I say I have a good story, they will ask if I have a hero.\u201d First Published: Thu, Dec 07 2017. 02 19 PM IST", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ashok ku", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "d. paranthaman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vijay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kumar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mani ratnam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahesh babu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vasu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ajith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "p. vasu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ravikumar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pawan kalyan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "k.s. ravikumar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kamal haasan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sreedhar pillai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "m. sasikumar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lingaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n. anbuchezhian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "g. venkateswaran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pillai", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gemini studios", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prasad art pictures", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kabali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malayalam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kannada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuselan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chennai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chandramukhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bollywood", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:33.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "50c75d15a8eb10f7ddf0e4833f165ab5279b2c58", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJhI7FX87hXrkReKikj22JW8iNpqCLKXFXm0lKFEA5YWE1uNEwSM0IW1pOXZZ2Px7Hn_FxoBUSnGn5UBN4_iJ1qJ0FJNSe36lrdmlACIANchdTGUxGW9Ut6w--", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Building-Materials-Ladders-Scaffolding/N-5yc1vZaqfm/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "MetalTech Saferstack 5 x 5 ft. x 7 ft.

Finally earlier this year I got around to reading his most famous work, Slaughterhouse-Five, and now it\u2019s being adapted for television. I\u2019m not saying these things are related. I\u2019m not. \nSlaughterhouse-Five, or to give it its full name \u2013 Slaughterhouse-Five, or The Children\u2019s Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death \u2013 was first published in 1969 and is a darkly satirical sci-fi tale with strong anti-war, both hot and Cold, sentiments. It\u2019s also regarded as semi-autobiographical as Vonnegut (who passed away in 2007), like the protagonist Billy Pilgrim, was captured by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge in WWII and imprisoned in a slaughterhouse in the city of Dresden, where he was one of the few survivors of the Allied forces firebombing of the city. \nThat\u2019s, presumably, where the similarities end however. During his capture Pilgrim becomes in his own words \u201cunstuck in time\u201d and from his point of view experiences time in the way the novel is written \u2013 non-linearly \u2013 as he narrates the events of his life. This includes his recovery in hospital after being rescued, his career and family life after the war, being kidnapped by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore and forced to live in an alien zoo where he\u2019s paired with a gorgeous movie star and with whom he has another child, and his later life in New York City where his best friend is a Soviet spy. \nThe novel is probably best known for the fatalistic expression uttered every time something bad happens in Pilgrim\u2019s life, \u201cso it goes\u201d. It was previously adapted for the big screen in 1972, and is regularly attempted to be banned from schools in the US. \nNow (as per Variety ) Universal Cable Productions (UCP \u2013 and not to be confused with RoboCop\u2019s OCP), a subsidiary of NBCUniversal who\u2019ve predominantly worked on series aired through SyFy and USA, have snapped up the rights to the novel. They\u2019ve also tapped Patrick Macmanus (Marco Polo and the soon-to-air Happy!) to adapt the novel for the small screen. \nWhile the novel is fairly short and focuses exclusively on Pilgrim, Macmanus will look to expand the novel into the world Vonnegut created, saying: \u201cThere are no lines that Vonnegut ever throws away. But there are certain lines within the book that allude to a much larger world. I\u2019m not just talking about going off into outer space. He alludes to the Balkanization of the United States and to the hydrogen bombing of the United States. I feel like today\u2019s TV is the only way to tell this story. Even though it\u2019s only approximately 275 pages, I think that it\u2019s ripe to be expanded upon exponentially.\u201d \nUCP\u2019s Senior VP of Development Elise Henderson said they\u2019d been keeping an eye on the rights to the novel for a while as it was \u201ca favorite book for many of us\u201d and that they jumped at the chance when it became available: \u201cAs soon as they did, we jumped in. At that point, we needed a writer, and we had just been introduced to Patrick for \u2018Happy!\u2019 Having read his material, we knew that he has the ability to do the emotional character depth that we need but also the ability to figure out a complex story and how to crack it, and capture the humor and the tone.\u201d \nI\u2019m very curious to see what comes from this. I really enjoyed the novel, and a satirical TV series based in its broader world could be very entertaining indeed. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kurt vonnegut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vonnegut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elise henderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick macmanus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macmanus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marco polo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "billy pilgrim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ocp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dresden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:33.032+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b9aa05ce4d6aa69acbb194466349b23b31e78247", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg90J5ryLRQGL1xdpYtB6y8tU0LyEKwhxRNdTBL6PgA1EkCr.HkAZ5A3Ic4aYGQIb2xWUjQTaI6HeCxDicOlLQGt0.aH.d8xtpbXSbG5rCkMwhgBDRUe56ZS_ZpQBNG_U7hllyKebYyoxA--", "site_full": "www.topix.com", "site": "topix.com", "site_section": "http://www.topix.com/rss/ncaa/kansas", "site_categories": ["entertainment"], "section_title": "University of Kansas NCAA News", "title": "Arrowheadlines: Chiefs vs. Raiders coming to Arrowhead", "title_full": "Arrowheadlines: Chiefs vs. Raiders coming to Arrowhead", "published": "2017-12-06T17:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://picproxy.topixcdn.com/pics/up-", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1199, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b9aa05ce4d6aa69acbb194466349b23b31e78247", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg90J5ryLRQGL1xdpYtB6y8tU0LyEKwhxRNdTBL6PgA1EkCr.HkAZ5A3Ic4aYGQIb2xWUjQTaI6HeCxDicOlLQGt0.aH.d8xtpbXSbG5rCkMwhgBDRUe56ZS_ZpQBNG_U7hllyKebYyoxA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T17:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "Arrowheadlines: Chiefs vs. Raiders coming to Arrowhead", "text": "Topix \u203a University of Kansas NCAA \u203a Arrowheadlines: Chiefs vs. Raiders co...

it\u2019s for real \nAfter the phoney war of their first season in Manchester, the rivalry between Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola will resume for real in Sunday\u2019s seismic derby showdown at Old Trafford.\nThe two managers renewed acquaintances at the beginning of last season after Mourinho took the reins at Manchester United and Guardiola set up shop across town at Manchester City.\nGuardiola claimed first blood, leading City to a 2-1 win at Old Trafford in September 2016, but both teams fell by the wayside thereafter, finishing the campaign well adrift of Premier League champions Chelsea.\nFifteen games into the new season, City are eight points clear of United at the head of the table and Sunday\u2019s game is being billed as Mourinho\u2019s big chance to stick a spoke in Guardiola\u2019s wheels.\n\u201cWe have a big week, with Swansea and Tottenham following the United game,\u201d says City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne.\n\u201cIf we lost two out of three and they win everything, they are there.\u201d\nThe arrival in Manchester of the two pre-eminent managers of the age stoked the embers of a bitter personal rivalry that had crackled with blistering intensity during the two years they spent in opposing camps in Spain.\nMourinho\u2019s first season at Real Madrid in 2010-11 culminated in an infamously spiky series of matches against Guardiola\u2019s Barcelona, who would have the last laugh by claiming a La Liga and Champions League double.\nMourinho nourished the hostility, villainously jabbing his finger in the eye of Guardiola\u2019s assistant, the late Tito Vilanova, during a Spanish Super Cup match in 2011.\nMadrid finished the 2011-12 season as champions and Guardiola, worn out by the constant sniping, stepped down at Camp Nou and would not resurface at Bayern Munich for another year.\nThe men\u2019s September 2016 reunion promised much, Guardiola\u2019s slick City wiping the floor with United in the first half before a Claudio Bravo blunder enabled Zlatan Ibrahimovic to make a game of it in the second.\nBut by the time of their most recent meeting, at the Etihad Stadium in April, thoughts of an all-Manchester title shootout had vanished.\n\u2013 \u2018Ray of hope\u2019 \u2013 \nA grim 0-0 draw left both teams locked in a battle for fourth place as Antonio Conte\u2019s Chelsea streaked towards glory.\nCity eventually finished third as United trailed home in sixth place, but Mourinho could reflect on the season with greater satisfaction after leading his team to a League Cup and Europa League double.\nSeven months on City look almost transcendent, their sublime and devastatingly effective possession football reminiscent of Guardiola\u2019s great Barcelona team.\nHaving won their last 13 league games, they can set a new mark for successive wins within an English top-flight campaign if they prevail on Sunday.\nRecent results, however, give United reason for optimism.\nWhile City have had to grind out wins, needing late goals to see off Feyenoord, Huddersfield Town, Southampton and West Ham United, Mourinho\u2019s counter-attacking United team have hit form.\nThey followed up impressive wins at Watford and Arsenal with a 2-1 defeat of CSKA Moscow that sent them into the Champions League last 16 and have not lost at home since last year\u2019s loss to City \u2014 a run of 40 matches.\n\u201cThey (United) might, for the first time this season, have just seen a little ray of hope,\u201d said former United captain Gary Neville in his Sky Sports podcast.\n\u201cThere will be better teams (who play City) than Huddersfield, Southampton and West Ham, yet all came close.\n\u201cUnited will be confident going into the game because of what has happened this weekend for City, even though it has been a good week for City too, as they\u2019ve scored three late winners and have taken maximum points.\u201d\nThere was a glint of the old malice in

You Can Now Save Your Instagram Stories \nGame-changer. Busang Senne \nTech lovers! Instagram gurus! Wish your drunken Insta story could play for more than 24 hours? Your favourite app has heard your cries. Instagram is now giving you the option to archive your stories. \nvia GIPHY \nThe new feature does two things. It allows you to keep your escapades either in Stories Archive \u2013 it automatically and privately saves all your stories \u2013 or in Stories Highlights \u2013 the option of storing the ones you want the world to see. Talk about a game-changer! A post shared by Instagram (@instagram) on Dec 5, 2017 at 7:04am PST \nNow, instead of scrambling to save Insta Stories before they reach their 24-hour expiration date, they\u2019re stored in neat categories for you to keep on returning to them \u2026 forever. \nThe app is rolling the new feature out and you should expect the notification when you log in. \nThis does mean that you can expect Instagram to look a little bit different from now on. If you enable Archives, your stories will be visible along with the rest of the content you save. Stories posted on your profile will give your profile a design update but it\u2019s totally worth it. \nvia GIPHY \nThis is pretty much a miracle for anyone including brands and tastemakers who want to make their stories available and accessible for more than a day, or if you lived your best life on an exotic holiday and want to keep the memories forever.

But it\u2019s not just the fact that exercising in the heat feels worse, it\u2019s also pretty dangerous. Heat-related illnesses include heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke, some of which have pretty serious consequences on your body. If during your summertime workout you experience symptoms like nausea, headaches, excessive sweating, dizziness, confusion, trouble with your sight or feeling particularly irritable you need to stop and lower your body\u2019s temperature ASAP. \nHere are a few ways you can help your body to keep cool and calm while still getting ripped in the summertime: Don\u2019t exercise alone \nWorking out with someone else is more motivating, more fun and it\u2019s safer too. Be communicative with each other about what you\u2019re feeling. If you verbalise that you\u2019re feeling dizzy or nauseous your friend will encourage you to take a break, whereas if you were alone you might be more inclined to just push through. It\u2019s safer to have another person around in case you faint or suddenly feel really ill and need assistance from someone you trust, not some stranger in the park. \nvia GIPHY Take a super hot bath \n\u2026or shower if you\u2019re in water-deprived Cape Town. One study suggests that having a 30 minute soak in a really hot bath straight after your workout can make your next exercise session in the heat way easier. The theory is that this gets your body to adapt to heat better in the long run, meaning the next time you exercise you\u2019ll start sweating earlier which helps your body to cool down faster. \nRead: How You Can Exercise without Sweating out Your Edges Keep hydrated \nYou already know you should be drinking more water, and if you plan on exercising in the heat it\u2019s extra important to keep hydrated. Drink half a litre 2 hours before you exercise, 250ml during your warm up, a few sips every ten minutes of your workout, and another 250ml when you\u2019re done. It sounds like a lot, but remember you\u2019ll be losing a lot of water through sweating. Also try to drink cold water as it is absorbed faster. \nvia GIPHY Wear the right clothes \nEven though the cutest stuff from Cotton On Body is mostly black and grey you should avoid wearing dark colours if you\u2019re exercising outside. Stick to light tones which will absorb less radiant energy than darker shades. Also, make sure your gym gear is clean because the oil and salt from sweat and general dirt can block up the holes in your woven clothes, which decreases air circulation. If you suffer from sports bra rash try putting your bra on over a light-weight sports vest. It might look weird but it will prevent chafing. \nRead: 7 Thoughts All First Time Exercisers Have Keep cool \nIf you don\u2019t have the luxury of a personal trainer who will plunge you into an ice bath after your workout to cool you down there are other, less extreme, things you can try. Keep a mini portable fan in your gym bag to blast on your face when things get too heated. An ice pack on your neck also helps, and keeping a spray bottle of cool water at hand is a good idea too. \nvia GIPHY Get acclimatised \nDon\u2019t push yourself too hard too fast. Allow your body to get used to exercising in the heat slowly; after two weeks or so it will start to feel more comfortable. Take two weeks to gradually build up the length and intensity of your workouts to avoid sending your body into shock. \nRead: Want To Get Running Fit? Here\u2019s How Exercise at the right time \nThe sun is at its hottest at midday so avoid lunch time exercising. First thing in the morning and late afternoon/evening are the most ideal times to get sweaty. Plus you\u2019ll get to see the sunrise or sunset and exercising with a view is always better for the soul. Switch up your routine \nUse the summer time as a reason to get into different types of exercise. Swimming is one of the best ways you can get moving in the hotter months because, duh, you\u2019re surrounded by cool water the whole time. \nRead more about health and fitness .
