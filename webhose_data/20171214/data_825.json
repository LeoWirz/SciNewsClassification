The developments in the Emil and Lalli storyline have been\u2026 extremely painful and upsetting for me. I had to shut down completely to deal with them, to the point that even my sister noticed that something was wrong. So, yeah, sorry about that.]\nSo anyway! Emil is learning the hard way that Finnish magic is real.\nIs it now going to be Mikkel\u2019s turn to give in?\n\nBecause the thing is: Sigrun is in huge troubles and he knows it. At this point, even amputating her arm would likely not be enough to stave off the septic infection. She\u2019s way too far gone, and unless she\u2019s only halfway through some round of antibiotics and he\u2019s still waiting for them to kick in, he must necessarily know that she\u2019s going to die and there\u2019s nothing he can do about it anymore.\nMore precisely, there\u2019s nothing he can do about it anymore.\nBut he\u2019s told Emil that there are people whose \u201ctreatments\u201d seem to be as effective as his own. Emil put it down to Mikkel\u2019s medical treatments being as effective as \u201cdoing nothing\u201d, and Mikkel vaguely agreed, but what about now, when he\u2019s absolutely desperate?\nAfter all, we\u2019ve already seen him about to try something completely insane to give Sigrun a fighting chance to survive: when he was about to jump into Floffy\u2019s river to distract it.\nSo how un -likely is it, at this point, that Mikkel might, for example, casually draw something in the snow, and ask Reynir, \u201cEver seen something like that?\u201d\n\u201cUh? \u2026 Oh, yes! It looks a little like that rune people use when a sheep is sick.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 Oh\u2026 OH!\u2026 Erm, okay, let me get my ink\u2013 what are you doing??\u201d\n\u201cSigrun said it would work much better if you used blood. Obviously, you can\u2019t use hers. Just as obviously, I can\u2019t allow you to walk around these parts with an open wound. So mine it will have to be.\u201d\n*Reynir mangles his braid with both hands, looking slightly green* \u201c\u2026 Gross\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDo you want to help or not?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but\u2013\u201c\n*Mikkel slashes his forearm.* \u201cThen get to work.\u201d\nI\u2019m obviously not expecting that exact scenario, but it does seem to me like something along those lines would be the logical conclusion of everything we\u2019ve seen so far:\nNorse magic has a strong focus on defense and healing; Mikkel has been explicitely shown to have worked with Norse healers before; Sigrun\u2019s safety has been shown to be the one thing which can push Mikkel into making completely unreasonable decisions; Teaching both of the unbelievers that magic is real would be a logical theme for this kind of story. Emil is already learning it; it\u2019s Mikkel\u2019s turn to admit it now. So, yeah, I\u2019m interested in seeing how Mikkel will react to Sigrun\u2019s desperate situation this time around\u2026", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lalli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mikkel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sigrun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reynir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "floffy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emil", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:20.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b18b3e04640e164dad7bd59f738a27c0916cc7d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQOKWfhz_3E2LLLR8wYhTEMR9P1xZGv.mXmpy9YYe1RaCI3luQkCDv9mE4fels0zpSrLP31iBtm26iaclhKcywNh9z9Wyx0S2TOwLhpLX8lsdcnQazLOIbY.EMVg.gy.H7hMrjf24aiCA--", "site_full": "www.hoteldealsphuket.com", "site": "hoteldealsphuket.com", "site_section": "http://www.hoteldealsphuket.com/phukettravelnews/feed/", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "travel", "buying_selling_homes", "hotels"], "section_title": "Phuket News", "title": "Young Afghan Girl Has Lived in Prison All Her Life", "title_full": "Young Afghan Girl Has Lived in Prison All Her Life", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.hoteldealsphuket.com/images/phuket-hotel-deals.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b18b3e04640e164dad7bd59f738a27c0916cc7d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQOKWfhz_3E2LLLR8wYhTEMR9P1xZGv.mXmpy9YYe1RaCI3luQkCDv9mE4fels0zpSrLP31iBtm26iaclhKcywNh9z9Wyx0S2TOwLhpLX8lsdcnQazLOIbY.EMVg.gy.H7hMrjf24aiCA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Young Afghan Girl Has Lived in Prison All Her Life", "text": "Vote!

I\u2019m going to try this once more and it\u2019s going to work. It\u2019s going to work, because who\u2019s the boss? I\u2019m the boss. Franjo\u2019s the boss. My eyes narrow with concentration as I raise a balled fist, slowly extending a finger to point at my target.\n\u201cMeatloaf\u201d, I growl, \u201cSit\u201d. Meatloaf does not sit. The thought doesn\u2019t even cross his mind. He just looks up at me with those big green eyes, portraying only complete ignorant innocence. I\u2019ve had these cats for 2 years now. Sheltered them, sustained them, loved them. They\u2019re still complete arse holes though. And they still won\u2019t sit, stay, lie down, roll over, play dead, high 5 or leap through the hoop of fire on command. That last one was perhaps overly ambitious, I\u2019ll grant you. I watch as Meatloaf flops down from the bed onto the floor and pads away towards his food as Burnie watches on from my side. That\u2019s a point, actually\u2026\n\u201cBurnie, sit!\u201d Burnie doesn\u2019t even seem to hear me. He too flops down and pads away to the food bowl. Fucking cats. I reach for my old laptop. It\u2019s really looking its age nowadays, covered in scratches and scuffs from general wear and tear. It really shouldn\u2019t be that battered as I only use it once a year, but I suppose I have to take into account the feline factor. I boot the laptop and start having a look around the world of football.\n\nSo as usual, Arsenal won the\u2026 Oh, hang on\u2026 They didn\u2019t?! Manager of the Year Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s Manchester United won the Premier League?! Oh right, sorry! The King is dead, long live the King, apparently. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has not only stopped Arsene\u2019s run of 3 straight league titles, but he\u2019s done it in ridiculous fashion. Manchester United have been virtually unstoppable this year, dropping points in only 6 matches and accruing 99 points, breaking the records for number of wins in a season and number of points in a season in the EPL. Lead by Captain Ander Herrera and fired to victory by the goalscoring of their jaw dropping attacking line up, featuring Paulo Dybala, Robert Lewandowski, Paul Pogba, Gonzalo Higuain and Juan Mata, United really have had a remarkable season and finished 19 points clear of Klopp\u2019s 2nd placed Liverpool. Wenger\u2019s Arsenal and Pochettino\u2019s Spurs filled out the top 4, while Manchester City finished 5th, prompting the sacking of Pep Guardiola at the end of the season. He\u2019s been replaced by the legendary Zinedine Zidane. Chris Hughton\u2019s overachieving Stoke City were the last team to sneak into the European places at the expense of 7th placed Chelsea, who also sacked their Manager Antonio Conte and replaced him with PSG\u2019s Unai Emery.\nAt the other end of the table there was a frantic finish. I mean, not for Newcastle, they finished dead last and had sacked Mark Warburton by the end of 2019. They brought in former Scunthorpe and Norwich manager Darren Way to replace him but he couldn\u2019t prevent them from ending the campaign at the foot of the table. But the other relegation spots were up for grabs: Going into the final match, Hull City, who have since replaced long serving manager Marco Silva with Michael Laudrup, were on 35 points and Swansea, who sacked manager Ryan Giggs after Christmas and replaced him with Carlo Cudicini, Steve Clarke\u2019s Burnley and Everton, who kindly freed up Laudrup for Hull in March and replaced him with Serie A stalwart Stefano Pioli, were all on 38, all 4 clubs having very similar goal differences. Swansea got thrashed by 2nd placed Liverpool, Hull overcame the odds to beat Southampton and Everton and Burnley played out a brilliant 3-3 draw to make sure they both ended up safe on 39 points, flooding 606 phone lines with accusations of match fixing from people exclusively using very angry East Yorkshire accents.\nPaulo Dybala was the Champions\u2019 top goalscorer but in the league he was eclipsed by Chelsea\u2019s Mauro Icardi. \u00d6zil had another spectacular season, playing consistantly brilliantly for the Gunners and laying on the most goals for his team mates once again, while Paul Pogba and Juan Mata both had brilliant seasons too. Pogba in particular had such a brilliant season in fact that he was named both Players\u2019 Player of the Year and Footballer of the Year. Spurs\u2019 Dele Alli, still only 24 years old, won the Players\u2019 Young Player of the Year award once again, making it 4 times in 5 years for him, and United\u2019s David De Gea won his 3rd Golden Glove in 4 years.\n\nThe Players\u2019 Team of the Season is pretty much as you\u2019d expect, with David De Gea in net, Spurs\u2019 Toby Alderweireld, Chelsea\u2019s Aymeric Laporte, Arsenal\u2019s Laurent Koscielny and surprise inclusion Aaron Creswell of West Ham in defence. United duo Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Paul Pogba are joined by the Gunners\u2019 Mesut \u00d6zil and City\u2019s Kevin De Bruyne in midfield, with top scoring duo Mauro Icardi of Chelsea and Paulo Dybala of Manchester United up front.\n\nOnly 1 of last year\u2019s relegated Premier League teams is heading back up to the top tier: Sunderland, managed by former Port Vale manager Rob Page, of whom I was extremely sceptical after he was appointed last year. He\u2019s proved me wrong though, taking the Black Cats up as Champions at the first time of asking. They\u2019ll be joined by Roberto Di Matteo\u2019s Norwich City and Steve McClaren\u2019s Ipswich Town, who had to navigate tricky play-off ties against Robbie Nielson\u2019s Fulham and Paul Heckingbottom\u2019s Barnsley.\n\nThis season\u2019s La Liga table has a suspiciously similar look to it as last year\u2019s. For the second year in a row, Manager of the Year Luis Enrique\u2019s Barcelona won the league, falling only 1 point short of Manchester United\u2019s tally in the Premier League with 98. It was close between Barca and Diego Simeone\u2019s Athletico Madrid though, who finished on 97 points, 8 clear of Marcelino\u2019s 3rd placed Real Madrid. Damir Canadi\u2019s Bilbao had a great season too, scraping past Javi Garcia\u2019s Villareal into 4th place and nicking a Champions League spot.\nMadrid based duo Cristiano Ronaldo and Sandro Ramirez were the league\u2019s top scorers with 23 and 20 respectively, while Leo Messi set up by far the most goals and had an incredible season, as did his team mate Neymar. Messi also won the Player of the Year award, just pipping Neymar and Real\u2019s Gareth Bale to that particular accolade, while Barcelona\u2019s Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen won the Goalkeeper of the Year award.\n\nBafflingly in a league where Barcelona and Atleti accrued 195 points between them, the Team of the Year is made up mainly of Real Madrid players. Barca stopped ter Stegen is in net, with Atleti\u2019s Alessandro Florenzi and Barca\u2019s Samuel Umtiti joined in defence by Real\u2019s Rapha\u00ebl Varane and Sergio Ramos. The midfield is comprised almost exclusively with Real players, namely Gareth Bale, Eden hazard and Cristiano Ronaldo, with Sevilla\u2019s Franco V\u00e1zquez thrown in for good measure. Messi and Sandro lead the line.\n\nAs I google \u201cBundesliga table\u201d, my heart skips a beat. What if this is the year? What if this is the year that somebody apart from Bayern have won? What if this is the year that we get a bit of variety in the Bundesliga? And then I slap myself across the face for being so fucking silly, because of course Bayern Munich won the Bundesliga. They won it comfortably ahead of Thomas Tuchel\u2019s Borussia Dortmund, as per usual. I\u2019ve nothing against Manager of the Year Carlo Ancelotti or his Bayern side, but I\u2019m just a little bored of looking at the Bundesliga. Well done to them all the same, though. And well done to Slaven Bilic\u2019s Schalke for breezing into the 3rd Champions League spot and to Roger Schmidt\u2019s Bayer Leverkusen and Andr\u00e9 Breitenreiter\u2019s Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach for making the Europa League.\nAs usual, Jerome Boateng and Mats Hummels had terrific seasons at the heart of the Champions\u2019 defence, while Dortmund\u2019s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was the league\u2019s top scorer by some distance. The player that came closest to matching the Gabonese\u2019s 25 goals was Mainz\u2019s Greek striker Dimitris Diamantakos with 16. You might think the fact that no Bayern player got close is a little odd, but to be fair they rotated their strikers quite a lot, with Thomas M\u00fcller bagging 8, \u00a335million Summer 2019 signing Romelu Lukaku getting 7 and \u00a347million Summer 2019 signing Kelechi Iheanacho getting 5. No doubt they\u2019ll be splashing out a bit of cash this Summer to rectify the situation. Red Bull Leipzig\u2019s Emil Forsberg and Dortmund\u2019s Mario G\u00f6tze set up the most goals in the league.\nI\u2019m stopped in my tracks when I see that the awards for Footballer of the Year, Players\u2019 Newcomer of the Year and Players\u2019 Player of the Year were all won by the same young Bayer Leverkusen midfielder who\u2019s name I\u2019ve not heard before: Kai Havertz. He certainly looks like a future World-beater. I think. My scouts don\u2019t know too much about him to be honest.\n\n\nAnd finally the Team of the Year doesn\u2019t contain many shocks at all. Bayern 6some Manuel Neuer, Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels, Joshua Kimmich, David Alaba and Arturo Vidal are all in there, along with Leverkusen\u2019s Kai Havertz, RBL\u2019s Emil Forsberg and Dortmund trio Serge Gnabry, Mario G\u00f6tze and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.\n\nSerie A used to be a lot like the Bundesliga in terms of one club ruling the roost, but since Juventus lost the 2017/18 title to Roma the other teams have started to smell blood. This year, for the first time in 9 years, AC Milan have won Serie A, and quite comfortably too, with Manager of the Year Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz\u2019s men finishing 4 points above Juventus, who sacked Leonardo Jardim in March and brought in who else but Antonio Conte, and Luciano Spalletti\u2019s Roma. I\u2019m annoyed in a way because if there\u2019s anyone who knows how to make Serie A a boring non-contest with Juventus winning the league every single year again, it\u2019s Conte. Napoli were the team to slip back into the Champions League in 4th, and Palermo and Udinese both bagged Europa League spots again.\nNapoli\u2019s Gerard Moreno and AC Milan\u2019s Carlos Bacca each scored 21 goals this season, making them joint top goalscorers, with Moreno\u2019s 5 additional assists in 3 fewer matches granting him the top spot. He was one of the league\u2019s top performers in general, winning the Fans\u2019 Player of the Year award, while Juve defender Leonardo Bonucci won the Player of the Year award. Palermo\u2019s Federico Mancuello set up the most goals with 16, followed from a distance by Sampdoria\u2019s Dennis Praet with 11. Juventus\u2019 Ger\u00f3nimo Rulli won the Best Goalkeeper award for the 2nd year running.\nA glance further down the Serie A table makes me widen my eyes with excitement though, because who\u2019s that that\u2019s slipped into the relegation zone with Verona and Spal? S.S. Lazio. How have Lazio been relegated?! They\u2019ve gone from 3rd place in the league to a first relegation since the mid 80\u2019s in 5 years! And they\u2019re a huge club too; One of the most decorated clubs in the country. Do they need a Manager? Could I have a chance? Oddly, after sacking Cesare Prandelli in December, they poached Sampdoria boss Giuseppe Iachini, who promptly sold their best player in Stefan de Vrij and lost 12 out of 15 matches, ensuring their relegation, and they want him to stay on! I honestly don\u2019t get it, but good luck to him. I\u2019ll be keeping my eye on the sleeping giants from afar. Watching. Waiting. Casually emailing over my CV after every loss.\n\nDespite not winning the league, Juventus still dominate the Serie A Team of the Year, with Ger\u00f3nimo Rulli in net, and Mario, Leonardo Bonucci and Alex Sandro joined by Inter Milan\u2019s Stefan Savic in defence, who I\u2019ll be getting very familiar with when my Liechtenstein side play Montenegro in both the EIL and World Cup Qualifiers. Juve\u2019s William Carvalho and Sami Khedira are selected in midfield along with Inter\u2019s Marcelo Brozovic, while Napoli\u2019s Gerard Moreno is joined by team mate Jos\u00e9 Callej\u00f3n and Roma\u2019s Mohamed Salah up front.\n\nIf a couple of the other leagues looked similar to last year, then Ligue 1 is practically identical. The only real difference being that Christophe Galtier\u2019s 6th placed AS Saint-Etienne didn\u2019t get a Europa League place this time. Once again, Manager of the Year Unai Emery\u2019s Paris Saint-Germain won the league before the manager resigned to join struggling Chelsea, but it was a close run thing this year. Jos\u00e9 Barros\u2019 Monaco went level on points with PSG with 3 games remaining and were trailing purely on goal difference, but both teams took 9 points from their last possible 9 and finished on 102 points, with the Parisians still on top. Jocelyn Gourvennec\u2019s Olympique Lyonnais finished a distant, distant, distant 3rd on 74 points and took the last Champions League place, while Dieter Hecking\u2019s Olympique de Marseille and S\u00e9bastien Bannier\u2019s Girondins de Bourdeaux took the Europa League places. Incidentally, PSG are still looking for a new Manager, but they must have already gone on holiday as they aren\u2019t returning any of my calls.\nPSG\u2019s Edinson Cavani\u2019s showing no signs of slowing down at 33 years old and was the league\u2019s top goalscorer with 22, slightly eclipsing Lyon\u2019s Alexandre Lacazette with 20. Monaco\u2019s Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 was the top performing player in the league, followed closely by team mate Daniele Rugani, and Marseille\u2019s attacking midfielder \u00d3liver assisted the most goals with 16, just 1 ahead of PSG\u2019s Mateo Kovacic, who was also voted Best Player. The Champions\u2019 Gianluigi Donnarumma won his second Goalkeeper of the Season award in as many years.\n\nThe Ligue 1 XI of the Season is made up entirely of players from the top 2 teams, which ordinarily I\u2019d scoff at but when both teams have racked up 102 points it\u2019s probably fair enough. PSG\u2019s Gianluigi Donnarumma is in goal, with team mates Rapha\u00ebl Guerreiro and Marquinhos joined in defence by Monaco\u2019s Daniele Rugani and Fabinho. The Champions\u2019 Marco Verratti and Mateo Kovacic are in midfield with Monaco\u2019s Thomas Lemar, Bernardo Silva and Kylin Mbapp\u00e9, with PSG\u2019s Edinson Cavani up front.\n\nThe Europa League was won by Premier League runners up Liverpool, who\u2019ve had an excellent season under J\u00fcrgen Klopp. They started the knockout stages as they meant to go on with an entertaining 4-4 away goal win over Leverkusen in the first round, before pummelling Valencia 7-1 in the Quarter Finals. They scraped past Leicester City in the Semis, who had themselves breezed past Schalke and Palermo in the knockout stages, and the final was set up against Roma at Porto\u2019s Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o. Roma had had a good run of results themselves, embarrassing Manchester City 5-2 in the first round, before seeing off Vitesse on penalties and AC Milan in the Semi-Final. The red side of Merseyside enjoyed complete domination in the final over their Italian opponents, who lost Samu Castillejo and captain Kevin Strootman to injury, the latter of which took them down to 10 men in extra time as they\u2019d used up their substitutions, and within 6 minutes Liverpool broke the deadlock through substitute Adam Lallana. Kostas Manolas was then sent off reducing Roma to 9 men, and there was no way back.\n\n\nThe Champions League was won surprisingly by Real Madrid, who beat their fierce rivals and La Liga Champions Barcelona 2-0 in a final held at Ajax\u2019s Amsterdam ArenA. Both teams had to knock out European giants on the way, with Madrid knocking out Tottenham, Bayern Munich and AS Monaco while Barcelona beat Borussia Dortmund, Chelsea and Arsenal. The final was rather different to the Europa League final in that it was the losing side that dominated and the winning side that were down to 10 men when Eden Hazard earned a 2nd yellow card after 69 minutes. Ronaldo had already put Madrid in front though and with 8 minutes to go, Toni Kroos doubled their advantage to secure their first Champions League win in 4 years.\n\nI know realistically that I\u2019ve got no chance in hell of landing the PSG job at the minute. And I\u2019ve probably got no chance of getting the Lazio job either, if they ever decide to actually sack the manager that\u2019s taken them down. I can feel these jobs getting closer though. Maybe not by much, but they are getting closer.\nFull of self-confidence, I cast the laptop aside and leap to my feet, staring straight at my 2 cats, who both look up at me curiously. \u201cMEATLOAF, BURNIE\u2026 SIT!\u201d I cry. They don\u2019t. Meatloaf goes back to eating and Burnie walks away towards the litter trays to take a shit.

for the post-Wenger era Ivan Gazidis is clearly building his staff for the post-Wenger era \nHope you are keeping warm and healthy? \nWhat do you make of what Ivan Gazidis has done since the summer? \nIt looked for all the world that he clashed with Wenger last season, and Wenger won by getting a new contract. \nBut since the summer there have been several administrative changes at Arsenal. \nToday they announced that Raul Sanllehi has joined as \u2018Head of Football Relations.\u201d \nLast week Sven Mislintat arrived to take over as \u201cHead of Player Recruitment\u201d i.e. Chief Scout, with veteran Steve Rowley leaving. \nHuss Fahmy arrived from Sky to take over player contracts, negotiator and contract man Dick Law has just left. \nDarren Burgess came in the summer as \u201cDirector of Player Performance\u201d, looking after a team of fitness, nutrition and health coaches. \nThat is a lot of new faces, a lot of fancy titles and a few potential clashes of interest, not least amongst the new arrivals and with existing back-room staff. \nFor all that Wenger declared in May that he did not know what \u201cDirector of Football\u201d means, it seems as if Ivan has covered that role in all but name. \nIs he continuing to play his long game? \nMyles says: \nI haven\u2019t given up on Ivan, who has been playing a long game for a long time. \nMost corporate lawyers hire staff who will be loyal to them and gradually build their internal empires. Ivan and Raul have been very close friends for several years. \nWe saw how recently how huffy our esteemed Professor was at suggestion that Ivan had a permanent desk at Colney. \nThere is an office he can use, said the long-serving Vice-Chancellor of Colney Sports University, and a desk he can use when he comes. \nColney has been packed full of incompetent time-servers for a decade or more. While the poor groundsmen, mostly married men with kids, work long hours. They were paid peanuts 10 years ago, so I hope their terms and conditions have improved. \nRecently I was told French scout Gilles Grimandi reported that Kante was no better than the midfielders Wenger already had. Seriously! \nKante won the title for Leicester and then went to Stamford Bridge and won it for Chelsea, as I said he would. \nFrance is a producer nation, like Spain and Brazil, one of the countries that creates superb footballers who emigrate to play for the top clubs in Europe. \nBut Varane and Griezmann play in Madrid, Pogba and Martial play in Manchester, while the brilliant young Mbappe plays for PSG now. \nTo be fair, Wenger wanted to sign three players in the World Cup summer of 2014: Sanchez, Debuchy and Griezmann.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ivan gazidis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darren burgess", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sven mislintat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huss fahmy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kante", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wenger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raul sanllehi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve rowley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dick law", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mbappe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gilles grimandi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "griezmann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ivan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelsea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "myles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "debuchy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "varane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanchez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "colney sports university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "psg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arsenal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "colney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stamford bridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leicester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pogba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:21.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5502ecb33296aa6285e82b8b33f8ec46cd708a3f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQBt.zJBM7pyqAnpFZ8mbo7DspoLXjBnUYi74amayjViNxi_x03DnKm5oFpmfrYoFnqP3uHBV2A7oQletpGdr6BQkNQENlrJ9PmcOyihQAVu70xW2QZyzDs", "site_full": "forums.macrumors.com", "site": "macrumors.com", "site_section": "http://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-high-sierra-10-13.203/", "site_categories": ["mac_support", "tech"], "section_title": "macOS High Sierra (10.13) | MacRumors Forums", "title": "10.13.2 turned my dock white (reduce transparency)", "title_full": "10.13.2 turned my dock white (reduce transparency) | MacRumors Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T07:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.014, "main_image": "https://forums.macrumors.com/styles/macrumors/xenforo/avatars/avatar_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1213, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2c194778b5a6a4c9506e79db4864842f5b778447", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQBt.zJBM7pyqAnpFZ8mbo7DspoLXjBnUYi74amayjViNxi_x03DnKm5oFpmfrYoFnqP3uHBV2A7oQletpGdr6BQkNQENlrJ9PmcOyihQAVuyVglh0LXWeZINLl8XjukduIEQ9GQCp0hg--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "B\u00f6hme417", "published": "2017-12-07T07:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "d5aqo\u00ebp said: \u2191 Screenshots!

(AP) - \nAn audit has found that more than 1,100 public employees claimed leave to vote in Kentucky elections, but didn't cast a ballot. \nState Auditor Mike Harmon said in a statement that his office reviewed the use of election leave during the 2015 general election and the 2016 primary election. The audit found that 1,329 employees claimed four hours of paid election leave but were not entitled to it because they weren't registered to vote, did not cast a ballot or were on another form of leave. Harmon said of those, 1,176 took leave but did not cast a ballot in one or both elections. \nHarmon called the findings \"troubling\" and said the report will be sent to the Executive Branch Ethics Commission and the Personnel Cabinet for further investigation and possible disciplinary action. \n(Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Dr. Jonathan Finder started Oldphones.com 16 years ago when he was a young physician, and the second income helped him pay off student loans.\nNow his job as a pediatric lung specialist keeps him from putting in the time to acquire new customers. And a downturn in landline sales has hurt business.\nBut he keeps at it, in no small part because he\u2019s an unabashed fan of the craftsmanship and history of his merchandise. \u201cHow many electromechanical objects that are 50 to 70 years old do exactly what they did when they were first made?\u201d Finder says. \u201cThe phones of the \u201930s and \u201940s outclass anything on the market today.\u201d\nA new calling For other entrepreneurs, like Woodbury, retro devices are their sole focus. The market for these phones would seem pretty small to build a business on. Two groups\u2014the Antique Telephone Collectors Association and Telephone Collectors International\u2014have only 1,125 members total.\nDon\u2019t miss: This is the vintage technology some companies are using to store your data \nYet buyers have been eager enough not only to keep Woodbury\u2019s operation afloat but allow it to thrive, even enough to support a four-person staff. Revenue, he says, can hit 50,000 Canadian dollars (roughly US$39,000) in a good month, and though he doesn\u2019t track long-term growth, he says that sales have shown a consistent year-to-year increase since the beginning.\nWhen original equipment is unavailable, the company uses reproduction parts\u2014such as cloth-covered cords\u2014manufactured in its own workshop. Additionally, Oldphoneworks.com has the capability to repair and refurbish models that aren\u2019t in its inventory, a service that accounts for about 10% of the company\u2019s revenue.\nWoodbury\u2019s customers are both \u201crepeat buyers; people who are going through their collection and want to upgrade, so they\u2019ll come to us to order the one part they need,\u201d he says, and \u201ca lot of one-offs, where someone Googles us because they need parts.\u201d\nTypically, Woodbury gets his inventory from individuals or estates looking to liquidate their collections. His average telephone sale is $250, a healthy return on his average investment of $50, not counting the cost of labor for refurbishing. Prices usually range from $100 to as much as $8,000 for a rare model, such as the 1905 Strowger Candlestick, the first commercially available dial telephone.\n(A Kansas City undertaker, Almon Strowger, believed that the only local operator was steering business calls to his competitor, who also happened to be her husband. So he invented dial service, bypassing operator intervention.)\nOldPhoneWorks.com Hello! This Strowger Candlestick dial phone goes for $7,999. \u201cA phone like that may sit there for five years, but eventually someone will buy it,\u201d Woodbury says. \u201cIf people really want something, they\u2019re willing to pay for it. You just have to be patient.\u201d\nTo build consumer trust, he offers a one-year, repair-or-replace warranty\u2014which gives him an edge over garage sales and flea markets, where the mantra is \u201cLet the buyer beware.\u201d He also says he can offer items in bulk, which is difficult for other dealers.\nA trunk line The company doesn\u2019t do much marketing. Mostly it involves making sure customers can find 20th-century technology using 21st-century methods. General manager Matt Jennings, 31, makes updating social media a top priority, trying to land the company at the top of Google rankings in their category.\nWhen he answered a help-wanted ad two years ago, he didn\u2019t know a spit-cup receiver from an F1 handset. \u201cI thought I\u2019d be repairing cellphones. I certainly didn\u2019t think this would be much of a market,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter my first day, I realized I was wrong.\u201d\nBeth Howe, like many buyers, found her way to Oldphoneworks by googling.

And how off-the-rails is the Republican Party? \nThe good people of Alabama will help answer these questions in next Tuesday's special election for the U. S. Senate. The whole world will be watching them decide whether party and ideology trump decency and moderation; whether there is simply no end to the extremism Republican voters are willing to tolerate in their ranks; and whether a majority in their state believe that being a credibly accused sexual predator is better than being a Democrat. \nThey will also be telling us what they think the word \"Christian\" means. \nThe outcome is likely to be determined by the consciences of conservatives, and of a specific kind: Those who see Mitt Romney and Republicans like him as far more reflective of their moral sense than is Judge Roy Moore , the GOP's ethically defective nominee whose indifference to the law led him to be removed from Alabama's Supreme Court twice . \nSteve Bannon, the former Trump Svengali who proudly peddles the ideological wares of the extreme right, inadvertently clarified the stakes at a Moore rally in south Alabama Tuesday night with a malicious and spiteful attack on Romney. The former Massachusetts governor tweeted this week that having Moore in the Senate \"would be a stain on the GOP and on the nation.\" \nBannon's response? \"Judge Roy Moore has more honor and integrity in that pinky finger than your entire family has in its whole DNA.\" \nYes, he really said that. \nFor good measure, Bannon not only accused Romney of avoiding service in Vietnam. He also trafficked in the anti-Mormon sentiments common among some evangelicals. \n\"You hid behind your religion,\" Bannon said of Romney. \"You went to France to be a missionary while guys were dying in rice paddies in Vietnam. Do not talk to me about honor and integrity.\" (And never mind that \"while guys were dying in rice paddies in Vietnam,\" the president whom Bannon served also avoided the war, courtesy of five draft deferments.) \nBannon is many things, but a fool he is not. It's no accident he linked his Vietnam attack to Romney's missionary work, which underscored the 2012 Republican nominee's deep commitment to Mormonism. \nThanks to Bannon, we now know that this is no longer just a race between Moore and Democrat Doug Jones, a former U.S. attorney who, depending on the poll, is either slightly behind or slightly ahead. It is, in very large part, a decision by Republicans about who they are. \nIt is also an important choice for devoted Christians. Do they really want their faith defined by those who tried to justify Moore's alleged relationships with young teenagers by invoking the Holy Family and saying that Joseph was older than Mary (which, besides being absurd, is Biblically unfounded)? Or by arguing that an interest in young girls might be explained by a desire for \"a large family,\" as a professor at Ouachita Baptist University wrote? \nDo those saying such things not realize that they are helping to discredit the very tradition they claim to be defending? No atheist could inflict this much damage to the faith. \nThis is how haywire politics has gone in the Age of Trump. \nParty loyalty can, it's true, be honorable if it is about the defense of principles, and Moore's backers say they are sticking with him to oppose abortion and multiply conservative judges. \nBut these rationales ring hollow given Moore's utterly unconservative claims as a judge that his theological predilections overrode the law and his lies about not profiting from his private charity, which suggest he is a charlatan exploiting the beliefs of his supporters for his own purposes. \nBoth Moore and Trump play on the feelings of marginalization experienced by many cultural conservatives. It would be salutary for such voters to declare that there are limits to how much they will allow themselves to be used by politicians whose words and deeds are so often at odds. If Moore is not the limiting case, there are no limits. \nMoore's promoters, including Bannon, want to persuade Alabama Republicans that since a Jones triumph will be taken as a rebuke to Trump, they have an obligation to fall into line. But the long-term harm to the GOP from a Moore victory will be far greater than from one lost Senate seat. Bannon is right to cast the election as being about \"honor and integrity.\" When it comes to these virtues, it is not a close call. \n(c) 2017, Washington Post Writers Group", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mitt romney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump svengali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "romney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doug jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u. s. senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington post writers group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ouachita baptist university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vietnam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:22.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7e9c55d684cbaf79e05cc41a67d3e8ceac8af0c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSSihs.Ow_LbiQBpmGM2LXkGxe0xuflB7GaO4pRAWXFCIOew1ZmfDSlRagPu1cMNF.xsBWHlEYdcQy_ACrzf9B9UR8IcQe5TnXax2z7vb.S.pLa9_xmrsWOWEkpC04_5GdVlWmp_73UW2kf4fF06xcLP4PyxE4dk7ThQ8PnkGdgzA--", "site_full": "www.realclearpolitics.com", "site": "realclearpolitics.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/Realclearpolitics-Articles", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics", "media"], "section_title": "RealClearPolitics - Articles", "title": "It Was A Woman Who First Addressed the Nation About Pearl Harbor", "title_full": "It Was A Woman Who First Addressed the Nation About Pearl Harbor", "published": "2017-12-08T00:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://assets.realclear.com/images/42/426370_5_.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 871, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 36, "comments": 0, "shares": 36}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7e9c55d684cbaf79e05cc41a67d3e8ceac8af0c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSSihs.Ow_LbiQBpmGM2LXkGxe0xuflB7GaO4pRAWXFCIOew1ZmfDSlRagPu1cMNF.xsBWHlEYdcQy_ACrzf9B9UR8IcQe5TnXax2z7vb.S.pLa9_xmrsWOWEkpC04_5GdVlWmp_73UW2kf4fF06xcLP4PyxE4dk7ThQ8PnkGdgzA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Rasmussen", "published": "2017-12-08T00:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "It Was A Woman Who First Addressed the Nation About Pearl Harbor", "text": "  \nThere are events in history that no one alive will ever forget. But time moves on and those who will never forget eventually leave this earth. The rest of us know it only from the history books. \nOne of those events was the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Only a handful of Americans alive today actually remember the day President Franklin Roosevelt said would forever live in infamy. Even fewer remember that the first Administration spokesperson to address the nation that day was not the president, but First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. \nIn those days, radio was the hot communications technology, and just about all Americans listened to it. President Roosevelt famously bonded with the American people through a series of \"Fireside Chat\" broadcasts. But the First Lady also hosted a weekly show that aired every Sunday night. \nUpon learning of the Sunday morning attack on Pearl Harbor, the decision was made for Mrs. Roosevelt to go ahead with her regular weekly broadcast. She did, however, change the introduction to say she was speaking \"at a very serious moment in our history.\" Her commentary informed the nation that \"The Cabinet is convening and the leaders in Congress are meeting with the President.\" \nThe First Lady went on to disclose the treacherous fact that \"the Japanese ambassador was talking to the president at the very time that Japan's airships were bombing our citizens in Hawaii and the Philippines.\" \nMrs. Roosevelt made it clear that all Americans were involved in this struggle. Although it's impossible to imagine today, the political elites in the 1940s were not exempt from the obligations imposed on other Americans. Speaking as a mother, the First Lady shared her concerns. \"I have a boy at sea on a destroyer, for all I know he may be on his way to the Pacific. Two of my children are in coast cities on the Pacific.\" \nBut she maintained her poise. \"We know what we have to face and we know that we are ready to face it.\" She expressed confidence that \"Whatever is asked of us I am sure we can accomplish it. We are the free and unconquerable people of the United States of America.\" \nAnd then she did something no political figure would do in the 21st century. Rather than encouraging everyone to obsess over the latest new and political responses, the First Lady said it was time to \"go about our daily business.\" But to do so \"more determined than ever to do the ordinary things as well as we can.\" She added that \"when we find a way to do anything more in our communities to help others, to build morale, to give a feeling of security, we must do it.\" And then Eleanor Roosevelt practiced what she preached by going \"back to the program we had arranged.\" \nThat last bit of advice makes as much sense today as it did 76 years ago. It's important to be aware of the news and political responses, but it's the daily business of life that is even more important. The way to move our nation forward is to \"do the ordinary things as well as we can\" and \"do... more in our communities to help others.\" \nThank you, Eleanor Roosevelt.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eleanor roosevelt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "franklin roosevelt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roosevelt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the cabinet", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states of america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pearl harbor", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:22.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d2fbb3c769a38de7978d22911fdf6ac16eadd051", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQApyRnPnOVUpRy1bzm_9FzsvLcXRbamSkmK9skXbl24Q--", "site_full": "vk.com", "site": "vk.com", "site_section": "https://vk.com/irinkakiss_2005", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Angelina Mamedova", "title": "Angelina Mamedova", "title_full": "Angelina Mamedova", "published": "2017-12-07T01:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "RU", "spam_score": 0.995, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 21, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d2fbb3c769a38de7978d22911fdf6ac16eadd051", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQApyRnPnOVUpRy1bzm_9FzsvLcXRbamSkmK9skXbl24Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Angelina Mamedova", "published": "2017-12-07T01:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "Angelina Mamedova", "text": "Angelina Mamedova", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:22.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "999892b2fbc12e0e9b6e48e0c3d93bf3b9c3cd55", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOr5oOlB7JsKoo4eiC7dwCClOiGlqWgLYFCFhLBbegPv46uB91iQds6zTo9QtlwIm.LeJMt_Hbm80nCUAf8thuwvnHrET4FBTAU-", "site_full": "sharepointonlines.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://sharepointonlines.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Sharepoint Online", "title": "Google Alert - share", "title_full": "Google Alert - share", "published": "2017-12-07T11:17:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "999892b2fbc12e0e9b6e48e0c3d93bf3b9c3cd55", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOr5oOlB7JsKoo4eiC7dwCClOiGlqWgLYFCFhLBbegPv46uB91iQds6zTo9QtlwIm.LeJMt_Hbm80nCUAf8thuwvnHrET4FBTAU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whadeand (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:17:00.000+02:00", "title": "Google Alert - share", "text": "share As-it-happens update \u22c5 December 7, 2017 NEWS Magna Announces Completion of First Share Repurchase Program PR Newswire (press release) AURORA, ON, Dec. 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - Magna International Inc.

He was 34 at the time and, according to news accounts, had slipped his hands under the shirt of a 17-year-old and fondled her breasts. \nThat's how a moral America deals with men who molest underage girls. Roy Moore apparently did the same at age 32, except that one of the girls was 14 and his hands roved down to panty level. \nEvery society has its Moores -- sick predators who hide their perversions in a thick cloud of religiosity. Not every society would elect them to any office, much less a high one like the U.S. Senate. \nIt will be interesting to see whether the voters of Alabama find justification for letting such an individual represent them to the world. Alabama's business community is alarmed that they may. \nAlabama has had great success luring foreign manufacturers. Mercedes-Benz, Airbus, Honda and Toyota are among the corporate giants based in other countries now employing over 87,000 Alabamans. The state last year attracted $1.5 billion in foreign investment. \nWould multinationals feel secure locating to or expanding in a state that chooses a leader who traffics in the most primitive racism, homophobia and xenophobia -- never mind his stalking of underage girls at a local mall? The bigger question here is not Moore himself but the civic culture that finds him OK. \nThese companies employ specialized workers from all over the world. Few have forgotten the horrific shooting of two engineers at a suburban Kansas City bar because they were dark-skinned foreigners. The engineers, one of whom died, were Indian nationals working for the tech firm Garmin. \nThe gunman had demanded to know whether they were in the country illegally. The engineers were working legally, plus they were educated in the U.S. The gunman shouted, \"Get out of my country!\" Then he fired. People back in India were so furious that the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi had to issue a statement condemning the \"tragic and senseless act.\" \nIt's no secret that hostility toward foreigners has risen since the election of Donald Trump. State and local leaders who don't fight the poison -- or who, in Moore's case, pour more on -- will be shunned by large businesses with multiethnic workforces, which most of them have. \nMoore's lawyer made reference to MSNBC anchor Ali Velshi's Indian heritage in some bizarre defense of the candidate's sexual misconduct. Velshi is from Canada, actually. \nBirmingham has been aggressively vying to win Amazon's second headquarters and the 50,000 jobs that would come with it. If Moore gets elected, Alabama can kiss that idea goodbye. But even if he loses, Amazon must confront the reality that the state's dominant party chose Moore over a normal conservative by 9 percentage points. \nMoore is an intestinal disease for Alabama's business leaders. The Business Council of Alabama has not endorsed him, nor has the state's senior senator, Richard Shelby. Alabama may offer enormous taxpayer subsidies to attract manufacturers, but so can other places. \nTo overcome the state's fraught racial history, economic development officials place prominent pictures of blacks and whites working together on their promotional literature. But it would require quite a package to overcome the drawbacks of a state where the political leadership insults the workers they want to hire, not to mention activates local nut jobs who would do them harm. \nThis election, in the end, isn't a referendum on Moore.

John Conyers , D-Mich., hospitalized for an undefined stress-related illness, announced his retirement after serving more than 50 years in the House. Two other Conyers -- a son and a great-nephew -- immediately announced plans to vie for the elder Conyers' seat. The great-nephew said, \"His doctor advised him that the rigor of another campaign would be too much for him just in terms of his health.\" \nDespite his sudden retirement, Conyers \"vehemently\" denies all accusations that he ever committed sexual harassment. \"My legacy can't be compromised or diminished in any way by what we are going through now,\" Conyers said in a radio interview from the hospital. \"This too shall pass. My legacy will continue through my children.\" \nOne former aide describes how the congressman, who was driving while she was in the passenger seat, attempted to fondle her: \"He was trying to feel me up with his right hand. I kept pushing his hand away. Then he put his hand on my neck and started trying to tickle me. We were on I-75, and he was driving erratically. I was saved by the bell because we got pulled over by the police for the way he was driving.\" Another former staffer claimed that Conyers would sit \"close to (her) while stroking and rubbing (her) thighs,\" and that once, while she was at Conyers' home, he \"came out of the bathroom completely naked.\" \nAfter initially defending Conyers as an \"icon,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called for Conyers to resign. Her call for his resignation, however, came 50 years too late. \nFor what has Conyers, a co-founder of the Congressional Black Caucus, achieved in his over half-century of service? Every two years since 1989, Conyers has introduced a bill for reparations for slavery. It has never gotten out of committee. \nThis blacks-are-owed-something-because-of-slavery mindset is dangerous and counterproductive. It is this mindset that is the basis for \"affirmative action,\" or race-based preferences. \nWhile \"affirmative action\" to achieve \"diversity\" is now a staple on college campuses, some warned about its unintended negative consequences. Archie Epps was one. He served as one of Harvard's first black deans. He criticized Harvard for admitting unqualified black students, and warned the school as early as the late '60s about the perils of admitting scholastically unqualified students to achieve \"diversity.\" Epps predicted that lowered standards for incoming black students would lead to a higher dropout rate, precisely what has happened. \nSimilarly, Judge Macklin Fleming, a former Yale graduate, wrote a letter in 1969 warning the dean of Yale Law School about its new \"quota\" policy, which guaranteed that 10 percent of each entering class would be composed of black students. Fleming predicted that \"minority groups\" that outperform relative to blacks, such as Asian-Americans, would be penalized in favor of lesser-qualified minorities. He predicted that those admitted with lower standards would struggle academically. The students, Fleming predicted, would make demands for watered-down courses or would accuse \"racist\" professors of giving them poor grades. All of this, he argued, would create a supposition that minorities are not as competent as non-minorities. Their degrees would be viewed with suspicion. \nConyers supports race-based preferences. Yet in 2000, The Detroit News evaluated the affirmative action programs of seven colleges and universities in Michigan. They reported: \"Among black students who were freshmen in 1994, just 40 percent got their diplomas after six years, compared to 61 percent of white students and 74 percent of Asians. ... Universities knowingly admit students who have a high chance of failing. ... The 10 years' worth of data analyzed by The News shows that the more selective a university is in choosing its students, the more likely its students are to graduate.\" \nOne history professor even said: \"We're throwing them out after taking their money and they're getting nothing out of it. We're mugging (the majority) of them, taking their money, taking their dignity. I feel like I am participating in a vast criminal conspiracy.\" \nConyers opposes school vouchers, which would allow the money for education to follow the student rather than the other way around. In Detroit, the average urban high school student reads several grades below grade level. Urban parents want vouchers so they can send their child to a private or parochial school, and not to the underperforming public school chosen by government. \nConyers opposes the privatization of Social Security. The libertarian think tank CATO Institute calculates that because blacks die at a younger age, there is a net transfer of about $10,000 from black workers to non-black workers. \nConyers does not understand the connection between the welfare state and the demise of the nuclear black family. In 1965, 25 percent of black babies were born to unmarried mothers. Fifty years later, and over $22 trillion spent on the \"War on Poverty,\" and now 72 percent of black kids are born out of wedlock. \nConyers' indifference about open borders allows unskilled illegal workers to compete for urban jobs and puts downward pressure on wages. \nIt is long past time for Conyers to pack up his race cards and call it a career. \nCOPYRIGHT 2017 LAURENCE A.

Photo: HT Ahmedabad: Surat\u2014Gujarat\u2019s diamond city and the epicenter of the Patidar quota movement \u2014 is set for a tough assembly poll battle as the Congress has added the face of the Patidar agitation Hardik Patel to its arsenal this time. \nAmid issues like implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) and demonetisation, apart from the \u2018Patidar\u2019 factor, it is to be seen for whom the large trading community of this diamond and textile hub will vote, when the city goes to polls in the first phase on Saturday. \nThough Ahmedabad is the largest city of Gujarat, Surat is a favoured destination of political heavyweights in this poll season. Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi visited the city twice last month to understand the plight of those who were \u201chit by GST and note ban\u201d. \nAlso read: Gujarat Elections 2017 LIVE \nDuring his visit, Gandhi also addressed a huge rally in the city\u2019s Patidar strongholds\u2014Varachha and Katargam. On 3 December, quota agitation leader Hardik Patel led a mega road show in Varachha. Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani led the Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s (BJP) road show in Majura area the same day. \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi last month addressed a rally at Kadodara, located on the city\u2019s outskirts. The Congress is hoping to snatch some seats from the BJP this time by capitalising on the \u2018anger\u2019 factor of Patidars and the traders. \nOn the other side, the BJP is confident of retaining its bastion, as its leaders claim the \u2018ground reality\u2019 is different from what the Congress is projecting. Out of the total 12 constituencies in Surat city, nearly half of the seats \u2014 Varachha Road, Kamrej, Katargam, Karanj, Olpad and Udhna \u2014 have a concentrated population of Patidars, who mostly migrated here from Saurashtra. \nThe remaining six seats are\u2014Surat-East, Surat-North, Surat-West, Choryasi, Limbayat and Majura. To some extent, Surat-North and Majura seats also have a significant population of Patidars, who are into various businesses, including diamond cutting, polishing, trading and in different trades associated with textiles. \nAlso read: Gujarat elections: CM Vijay Rupani may face stiff battle on BJP\u2019s \u2018safe\u2019 seat \nThe city has been a bastion of the BJP since long. But, the political scenario in this bustling business hub seems to have changed after Hardik Patel started the agitation to get reservation for his community two years back. At that time, Surat witnessed large scale violence and arson, mostly in Varachha and adjoining areas. \nOut of the two sedition cases lodged against Hardik, one was registered in Surat. Since then, the Hardik-led agitating body\u2014Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS)\u2014is up in arms against the ruling BJP and has vowed to defeat it. \nNotably, BJP president Amit Shah had to cut short his speech at a function in Varachha area in September when some PAAS agitators created chaos by shouting slogans and throwing chairs. Now, in an apparent bid to thwart the anti-incumbency factor following the Patidar \u2018anger\u2019, the BJP has dropped six of its sitting MLAs from Kamrej, Surat-East, Surat-North, Karanj, Udhna and Katargam seats. \nThese leaders include sitting MLA of Katargam, Nanu Vanani, who is a minister in the Rupani government. Out of the nearly 1.98 lakh voters of Varachha Road seat, the Patidars are in the driving seat with their number being over 1.5 lakh. In Kamrej, where the total electorate is about 4.28 lakh, the Patidars alone account for over two lakh. \nIn Katargam, having around 2.77 voters, the Patidars are in a dominating position with over 1.18 lakh electorate. Besides the \u2018angry\u2019 Patidars and traders, there are various other factors which could breach the hull of BJP\u2019s ship in this coastal city. Since a large population, mostly Patels, of this city belongs to Saurashtra region, the agrarian crisis back home could also add fuel into their \u2018anger\u2019 here, Surat city Congress president Hasmukh Desai said. \n\u201cMany decades back, Patels and other communities from Saurashtra region started settling here. Since they still own agricultural land back home, they are holding the BJP government responsible for their dwindling farm income. It is possible that their anger could reflect in the voting here,\u201d Desai said. \nApart from Patidars, the Congress is also banking on small traders and entrepreneurs whose businesses were claimed to have been hit by demonetisation and the implementation of GST by the BJP-led government at the Centre. In July, the textile traders of Surat city called a massive strike against the GST. \nThe Congress was quick to take up the issue and party vice president Rahul Gandhi held two back-to-back visits last month. \u201cOn one side we are getting full support from the Patidars, while on the other the trading community and the shopkeepers, who are spread across the city, are seeing a ray of hope in Congress after Gandhi\u2019s visit. All the factors are in our favour,\u201d Desai claimed. \nHowever, the BJP discarded the argument, claiming that the ground reality is totally different. \u201cThough traders were unhappy initially, they now understand the benefits of GST. This so-called anger will never convert into votes. If the people were still against us, then why so many had turned up for the chief minister\u2019s rally?\u201d BJP\u2019s sitting MLA from Majura, Harsh Sanghvi, asked. \nMeanwhile, the PAAS members have already hit the streets in the Patidar-dominated areas to convince people not to vote for the BJP. According to PAAS convener for Surat, Dharmik Malavia, they have set a target of defeating the BJP on at least five seats \u2014 Varachha Road, Karanj, Kamrej, Olpad and Surat\u2014North. \n\u201cWhen we tell people do not vote for the BJP, it implies that vote for Congress if you want to uproot the party which committed atrocities on us,\u201d Malavia said. \u201cThe people are in our support and the BJP candidates are finding it difficult to even enter into the Patidar societies for canvassing,\u201d he claimed. The 182-member Gujarat Assembly will go to the polls in two phases\u2014on 9 and 14 December\u2014and the counting of votes will be taken up on 18 December.
