What would you do with yourself if I took away your phone for a whole day? \nSomething I frequently ask is, \u201cWill you please put your phone down for just one second?\u201d This is constantly said to all those who are obsessed with checking social media, staying in the \u201cloop\u201d of society and constantly posting to share with the world your life experiences. In reality, why do people care about what other people think? Why is it so important to share every moment or thought with our peers? Do we really care? \nThroughout life, we experience subjectivity within society, whether we know it or not. We are often unaware of how tethered we are to our phones because it is the \u201cnormal\u201d for people because, well, it\u2019s just what everyone else does. Due to addiction\u2019s natural \u201cinvisibleness\u201d and apparent obviousness, challenging our norms are like weaning off a drug. \nI\u2019m writing this to challenge you. I\u2019m urging you to unplug from smartphones and live in the moment. Yes, the moment. Not the moment for \u201csnapping\u201d the concert you\u2019re at or the boomerang you want to take to look trendy. I order you to look up from your phone, shut down the display, take in your surroundings and make the most of the day. \nWe live in a world where we continue to find ways to make it easier for us to connect with each other, but really, always results in us spending more time alone. We have no idea what possibilities and opportunities are around us when we are looking down at our smart phone. When we get so caught up and worried about capturing the moment on a photo memory or post, when really is the person\u2019s own memory that counts. A picture is worth a thousand words, but a memory is worth a lifetime story. The amount of times that it takes for you to document the moments of your life, takes away from the time that you\u2019re actually living it. Why waste your time focusing on how many \u201clikes\u201d or \u201cfavorites\u201d your post will or could get, rather than missing out, living in the moment, and enjoying it yourself? You are including while excluding yourself. \nWe are obsessed with the illusion we want to portray to our followers or \u201cfriends.\u201d The illusion you want to portray as your life is more consuming than actually living. People are dependent on certain aspects, such as social media and technology, to feel as if they \u201cfit in\u201d and to keep up with constant updates and societal expectations. We are so worried about coming across as the person we want others to perceive us as that we forgets how to just be ourselves in the process. \nWhile someone is posting to satisfy themselves with \u201cfavorites\u201d or \u201clikes\u201d on a post and constantly checking their phone, they don\u2019t realize they are missing out on moments that matter most. We lack communication by depending on emojis to express our emotion. People are always looking to be up to date on technology, the newest software, the best IPhone, the \u201cemojis\u201d to express oneself. In that time somehow people fall short of themselves, but really becoming inferior in many ways and missing out on what life truly offers. We are becoming unsocial in an expanding social society. \nEverything you do, you have the need to show or tell the world where you went, what you did, and who or what you saw. That need becomes so overwhelming that you forget to live in the moment and simply appreciate the very actual moment that happened. \nTechnology creates a compulsion to post, but that isn\u2019t enough to simply experience a moment, make it your own, and to store it in the memory that matters most, your own memory. Not the phone memory. We fail to take the time to experience anything because we rush for out posting in the hopes that we get our \u201cfriends\u201d to \u201clike it.\u201d Is it not enough to just enjoy the moment ourselves? It is up to us, the students, the face of the future to defy the norm. Put your cellphones away and enjoy the moment!

The performance was called \u201cA Classical Christmas.\u201d \nThe first half of the show was dedicated to Benjamin Britten\u2019s play \u201cSaint Nicolas.\u201d This work was performed in nine acts and focused on the birth of Saint Nicolas, his many journeys and his death. \nThe first act introduced Saint Nicolas and implored him to speak to people across time. Afterwards, the audience was told of Saint Nicolas\u2019 birth, \u201cFrom his mother\u2019s womb he sprang and cried, \u2018God be glorified!\u2019\u201d Then, stories of Saint Nicolas\u2019 childhood were interspersed with the words \u2018God be glorified,\u2019 until an adult Saint Nicolas was heard. \nAfterward, stories about Saint Nicolas devoting himself to God, his journey to Palestine and how he was chosen as the Bishop of Myra were relayed. \nOne area that caught the audience by surprise was the act titled \u201cNicolas and the Pickled Boys.\u201d In this act, Saint Nicholas found himself at an inn with a group of fellow travelers. When the travelers invited Nicolas to eat with them, he declined and stopped the travelers from eating when he realized the meat they were consuming came from three murdered boys. \nWith this information, Nicolas said, \u201cTimothy, Mark and John, put your fleshly garments on,\u201d and the boys came back to life and sang, \u201cAlleluia.\u201d \nRounding out the first half of the show was, \u201cThe Death of Saint Nicolas.\u201d Here, the audience heard about Saint Nicolas and his impending death. For Saint Nicolas, he was filled with joy and eagerness to finally meet Jesus.

It is to repaint. In the process of painting, the school community can design the library according to their wishes. And of course the school is happy and wants to paint their library into a colorful library. They all try to make the library as colorful as possible.

Setting up Alexa with your online calendars can let the device speak out the appointments you have for the day, or add events and reminders to your calendars. \nThis relationship with Alexa works both ways to help you plan your day. You just have to ask a polite \u201cAlexa, what\u2019s on my calendar today?\u201d But more on the commands later. Let\u2019s first connect Alexa to the online calendars it supports! How to Connect Alexa to an Online Calendar \nAlexa supports iCloud Calendar, Google Calendar, Microsoft Office 365 Calendars, and Microsoft Outlook.com Calendar. You can link Alexa to only one calendar at a time. Any other member of your Amazon Household can also link their calendar accounts to Alexa. Launch the Alexa app on your smartphone. Go to the Hamburger icon on the top left and select Settings . Select Calendar . Tap and choose your calendar account from the list of supported providers. Select the Link option, and follow the on-screen instructions to allow Alexa to access your calendar. \nYou have to enable two-factor authentication for the iCloud Calendar. Do pay attention to the message that says anyone with access to your Alexa devices can ask about events on your linked calendars. You may have multiple calendars for each account like \u201cPersonal\u201d or \u201cWork\u201d. The last step allows you to select the one calendar for scheduling your day. \nIt\u2019s done. Now, you have allowed Alexa into the sanctum of your calendar. Ask Alexa to tell or remind you when your next appointment or holiday is. Don\u2019t forget that Alexa is smart \u2014 you can add an event via Alexa by speaking out aloud. For instance: \u201cCreate a meeting named [event name] with [person\u2019s name].\u201d \nThere are more voice commands and you can read them all on this Amazon Help page. \nHave you set up a calendar with Alexa and Amazon Echo yet?

Scott, co-chief film critic for The Times, and Wesley Morris, critic at large, discuss the 10 great movie performances of 2017. By CHRISTOPHER WHITWORTH on Publish Date December 7, 2017. Image courtesy of Internet Video Archive. Watch in Times Video \u00bb Photo Credit Universal Pictures The shot from Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cGet Out\u201d that probably pops into your head first \u2014 it was in the trailers and will no doubt feature in the Oscar reel \u2014 is of Daniel Kaluuya in close-up, his eyes open wide and overflowing with tears. It\u2019s a pivotal moment, for sure, both in the plot and in Kaluuya\u2019s performance: the big reveal and the first big emotional payoff. But it\u2019s also a confirmation of the importance of those eyes to the structure and meaning of the film. They are perhaps its only reliable barometers of emotion, instruments of empathy and windows on the truth. Chris Washington, Kaluuya\u2019s character, is a photographer. According to a movie convention going back at least to \u201cRear Window,\u201d this makes him a bit of a voyeur and also suggests a certain detachment from experience. He\u2019s a watcher more than a doer, at risk of seeing too much. And \u201cGet Out,\u201d in every way, is about seeing and being seen, about Chris\u2019s dual status as an observer of the ways of white people and an object of their increasingly sinister gazes. Visibility and invisibility are central to the psychic history of American racism. Black men like Chris can be destroyed if they are seen in the wrong place (or if they look at the wrong person in the wrong way). They are also in constant danger of disappearing, of being erased, stolen, whited out. Chris knows all of this, but he would like to believe that he can wear this history, as it were, lightly. In the early scenes it seems as if he and his girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams) haven\u2019t so much \u201ctranscended\u201d or \u201cseen beyond\u201d race as figured out a way to be different without being each other\u2019s Others. Chris\u2019s rude awakening from this pleasant, lethal fantasy is the entire plot of \u201cGet Out,\u201d and Kaluuya\u2019s quiet, reactive, cat-footed performance is the key to it. He is victim and avenger, a surrogate for the filmmaker and the audience, as passive and helpless as Mia Farrow in \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d and then, when it counts, as charismatic and decisive. He can\u2019t believe his eyes, and you can\u2019t take yours off him. A.O. Scott \nAdvertisement Films: The Beguiled, The Killing of a Sacred Deer Photo Credit Ben Rothstein/Focus Features (\"The Beguiled\") The truth of the matter is that Nicole Kidman could make the list of great performers in just about any year, for just about any role. She is always interesting, never not surprising and consistently unnerving, even when the movies fall short. In 2017 her most-heralded work was on television, in the Northern California HBO potboiler \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d where she played a supercapable professional turned stay-at-home mom and steadfast friend who was also the victim of violent domestic abuse. The zone where normalcy collides with extremity \u2014 where high comedy and psychological terror keep company \u2014 is her sweet spot. Continue reading the main story What makes her big-screen work this year \u2014 in \u201cThe Beguiled\u201d and \u201cThe Killing of a Sacred Deer\u201d \u2014 even more astonishing is that she brought that sweet spot with her, infusing those movies with an element of vitality they would otherwise have lacked. Both of them are hothouse blossoms, exercises in sensibility for directors (Sofia Coppola and Yorgos Lanthimos, respectively) with very particular agendas. \u201cThe Beguiled\u201d remakes a pulpy early-\u201970s study in sexual hysteria into an arch melodrama of beleaguered femininity. As the headmistress of a school full of Southern belles who welcome a wounded Yankee into their midst, Kidman is an avatar of Victorian womanhood. Her character is also the only one to understand how absurd the situation is and to grasp the raw currents of power and lust that surge under the decorous surface. Kidman herself disrupts the film\u2019s decorum, much as she complicates the mechanical allegory of Lanthimos\u2019s film. Everyone else in \u201cSacred Deer\u201d is slotted into a carefully measured box, working in the service of what is essentially a literary conceit. A young man places a curse on a modern, upper-middle-class family, who must contemplate a horrible crime if they wish to break it. While the other actors obey the director\u2019s fairy-tale strictures, Kidman behaves like a real person. All of the film\u2019s moments of genuine emotion, which means real humor as well as authentic terror, belong to her. A.O.S. \u2014 Photo Credit Michele K. Short/Universal Pictures Please bear with me. I\u2019m about to use too many italics. But that\u2019s because Tiffany Haddish is an italics type of actor. She bends every word she speaks toward her. They\u2019re not leaning, though. They\u2019re bowing down. Haddish is that charismatic, that alive . Dina, the party monster she\u2019s playing in \u201cGirls Trip,\u201d wields that charisma to demand that you be alive, too. In the movie\u2019s most notorious scene, she makes a case for the erotics of grapefruit that should have sent citrus stock through the roof. In New Orleans\u2019s French Quarter, Haddish air-humps one of those live tourist-trap statues, and the statue breaks character and chases after her. He can\u2019t help himself. Nobody can. This is an ensemble movie with a very good ensemble, so it feels rude to single out Haddish. But she makes the singling out inarguable. As Michael Jackson once asked, \u201cWhere did you come from, lady?\u201d Before \u201cGirls Trip,\u201d I\u2019d only seen Haddish in \u201cKeanu,\u201d as a gun-toting drug-world thug who is mildly into Jordan Peele. We now know what false advertising this was. There\u2019s nothing mild about her. Some of Dina\u2019s choice lines: \u201cIt\u2019s chlamydia, y\u2019all! That [expletive] can be cured!\u201d \u201cI got drugs. In my booty.\u201d \u201cWho is this ratchet-ass bitch?\u201d Black women have done top-volume vulgarity in the movies before. What we\u2019ve never seen is vulgarity delivered with this much kaleidoscopic effervescence. In a sequence set on an airplane, Dina takes a serving tray from the flight attendant and starts handing out cups to her fellow first-class passengers as Chaka Khan\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Every Woman\u201d starts playing. Even though Haddish is singing along, it still seems like another soundtrack jam. But then everybody else in the cabin sings, too. Who put this song on? We don\u2019t hear anybody request it, and no airplane speakers sound this good. As Haddish marches and shakes her way down the aisle, it\u2019s pretty clear what happened. She willed this. To paraphrase Chaka, it really is all in her. And by the time this movie is over, whatever \u201cit\u201d is, Haddish has poured all over us. Wesley Morris \u2014 Photo Credit Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions What to do with an actor in a type of role you dislike that\u2019s the centerpiece of a movie you don\u2019t care for, in part because it\u2019s set somewhere you wish the movies would, pretty please, stop fetishizing? Well, if the acting works, you just ignore everything else. And Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s acting here really works. He plays Jeff Bauman, a real-life Costco employee who lost his legs in the Boston Marathon bombing. Bauman is desperate to go back to being a knucklehead with his buddies. But he has to struggle with his family\u2019s brew of emotions, his girlfriend\u2019s guilty feelings and rehab. It\u2019s the sort of bound-for-tragedy part that barely needs an actor. It practically performs itself. And yet, many actors have given it and had many a statuette thrown at them for doing so. But as the story becomes about the city\u2019s need to worship at Bauman\u2019s wheelchair, Gyllenhaal\u2019s sidesteps dignity and saintliness and inhabits the horror of unsought heroism. He makes the physical challenges secondary to the psychological ones. Gyllenhaal has found a way to play a part that can only be described as charismatically unremarkable; except he doesn\u2019t just play it, he disappears within it. The bombing in the film happens sooner than you want it to. The minute you hear the first boom, you start wondering about what\u2019s going to happen to Bauman, obviously. I worried about what would happen to Gyllenhaal\u2019s acting. He works here with remarkable restraint. The character struggles with leglessness and unceasing adoration. The actor doesn\u2019t appear to struggle with anything. He\u2019s playing the shock of attention, the suffocating embarrassment of pity, and rage at how the bombing forces Bauman to take greater responsibility for his choices. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story This fictional Bauman seems fine with the wheelchair. It\u2019s adulthood and celebrity that leave him feeling confined. There\u2019s a scene in which the character is wheeled onto the ice before a Bruins game, where the crowd smothers him with hero worship. Rather than exude gratitude, Gyllenhaal goes for something far more original and distressing in its direness: claustrophobia. W.M. \u2014 Photo Credit Michelle Bossy/Sony Pictures Classics \u201cA Fantastic Woman\u201d is set in Chile, but its star, Daniela Vega, practices a kind of naturalistic, European mode of performance. It\u2019s acting that\u2019s more like being: She makes her way through the film as she might go about her actual day. If you\u2019re a transgender woman, as Vega is, the day might entail enduring the hateful harassment of your dead boyfriend\u2019s ex-wife, his son and his son\u2019s friends. It might include a medical examiner\u2019s gratuitous request that you disrobe, not only because you\u2019re the suspected cause of the boyfriend\u2019s death but, you know, just because . Vega plays Marina, a waitress and a nightclub singer, for whom a version of widowhood immediately sinks in, meaning she spends most of Sebasti\u00e1n Lelio\u2019s film in a state of shock. Everyone who comes into contact with her insinuates something. How did Orlando really die? And where are you taking those suitcases? With each new confrontation, Marina has to reexplain herself and therefore relive the trauma of her man\u2019s death. She\u2019s insulted, nagged, disbelieved, denied, wrapped in packing tape, at some point, and dumped out of a truck. The tension here is between the necessary wariness of Vega\u2019s acting and Marina\u2019s being so hideously acted upon. Dignity is overrated as a performance strategy. Usually, it works against an actor because it bumps her up to saint before she\u2019s finished being human. But the longer this movie goes on, the clearer it becomes that Marina is all dignity. Under the circumstances, it\u2019s all she has. The \u201cfantastic\u201d of the title might be a kind of built-in accolade for its star. But it also implies the state of the character\u2019s imagination. Anytime we\u2019re allowed into Marina\u2019s head, it\u2019s for something like a nightclub dance sequence in which she becomes a human pompom. Vega has Marion Cotillard\u2019s enormous eyes, some of her sense of sadness and a whiff of her glamour. She\u2019s Cotillard before putting on layers of emotional makeup. Her work here builds slowly. But it builds up high. Vega\u2019s triumph is moving for its absorptive anti-drama. Her body tells you where she stands. But that face tells you what she has withstood. W.M. \u2014 Photo Credit A24 Has any movie actor conjured as much surprise as this little girl? Maybe \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d-era Diane Keaton or 1980s Goldie Hawn. But Brooklynn Prince is playing a 6-year-old impoverished urchin named Moonee, not a bourgeois, hopeless romantic. Moonee zooms around a shabby motel near Disney World, looking for excitement that most adults would classify as trouble. There\u2019s a scene in which she tries banging the back of her head against a concrete mural and registers real alarm at how it kind of hurts. It\u2019s cute yet sums up her acting challenge here: Where does cute go after it hits a wall? Typically, the answer would be \u201con your last nerve.\u201d But Moonee\u2019s misbehavior abuts tragedy. Even though she\u2019s a child who instigates arson and licks ice cream as a comic means of torture, Sean Baker\u2019s movie has pulled back far enough for her mischief to make psychological sense. Her young mother is messy and wild \u2014 and, emotionally, also 6. Moonee learned brattiness and cluelessness at home. Baker carefully turns this kid\u2019s depressive, uncouth world into a wonderland. Her tasks might seem like nothing special (she does lots of yelling and galloping around). But that\u2019s an actor\u2019s job \u2014 to turn nothing special into something. For one thing, she has a firm grasp of sarcasm. (\u201cYeah, Mom, you\u2019re a disgrace,\u201d she says when someone chastises her mother about Moonee\u2019s latest misadventure.) For another, she holds her own with Willem Dafoe, who plays the motel\u2019s manager and is the only veteran actor in the movie for miles. She doesn\u2019t seem to know or care that she\u2019s acting with Dafoe. He becomes another game to play, his patience another button to push. Prince is at her comical best when the movie needs her face to do what a screenplay can\u2019t. That fire Moonee helps start lures eager spectators, including her mother, who proceeds to take her daughter\u2019s picture in front of the burning building. Prince\u2019s expression \u2014 a rictus of embarrassment, confusion and guilt \u2014 belongs in a gallery. It\u2019s a masterpiece of remorse. W.M. \nAdvertisement Film: Call Me by Your Name Photo Credit Sayombhu Mukdeeprom/Sony Pictures Classics Elio, the teenage protagonist of \u201cCall Me by Your Name,\u201d may not be a prodigy, but he\u2019s a serious musician, spending part of each summer day in intense concentration as he transcribes what he hears on his Walkman onto staff paper. It\u2019s 1983, a blissfully analog time to be 17. Sometimes Elio\u2019s parents persuade him to perform for guests at the rambling villa in Northern Italy where they live during school vacations. One guest in particular \u2014 an American graduate student named Oliver, who is with them for six weeks \u2014 sparks Elio\u2019s interest. As their initially tentative friendship evolves into something more intense, Elio engages in some musical showboating for Oliver\u2019s benefit. He plays a bit of Bach on the guitar and then moves to the piano, banging out the same passage in the style of Liszt and then in the manner of \u201cBusoni playing the way Liszt would have done it.\u201d Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, the 21-year-old actor who plays Elio, demonstrates similar virtuosity, but with nothing like Elio\u2019s level of needy display. Luca Guadagnino\u2019s film, one of three movies in which Chalamet appeared this year (the others are \u201cHostiles\u201d and \u201cLady Bird\u201d), is lush, sensual and elusive, driven less by plot than by mood. The moods that keep it in motion \u2014 languorous, horny, impatient, ecstatic \u2014 belong principally to Elio. Or, rather, he belongs to them. The conventional way to deal with a young man\u2019s first sexual experience involving another man is as a coming-out story in which an unacknowledged but pre-existing identity is brought to the surface of consciousness and experience. What happens to Elio is a more ambiguous and open-ended process of self-invention. Every aspect of his life \u2014 erotic, domestic, intellectual, social \u2014 is like that Bach medley. He tries out various styles with flair, irony and a kind of amazed delight in himself and his awakening appetites. Chalamet seems to match Elio\u2019s exuberance, to share his devotion to experimentation and limit-pushing and, before our eyes, to evolve from precociousness to mastery. A.O.S. \u2014 Film: War for the Planet of the Apes Photo Credit 20th Century Fox Here\u2019s the short, incomplete explanation of how performance-capture works: An actor puts on a contraption that helps record the contortions of his face and body. That recording is then used to animate a creature whose movements have a peculiar lifelikeness. To play Caesar, the president of the apes in \u201cWar for the Planet of the Apes,\u201d Andy Serkis had to wear such a get-up. He\u2019ll never be sufficiently lauded for the grace and solemnity of his performance as Caesar. His mastery of this wing of acting might always be perplexing. How do you know what we\u2019re seeing? But if Caesar moves you, the experience beats seeing Serkis. You\u2019re feeling him. He so harmonizes with the technology that he manages to transcend it. It\u2019s tempting to say he is the Daniel Day-Lewis of performance-capture acting. But what if Daniel Day-Lewis is really the Andy Serkis of regular acting? By this third installment of the latest \u201cApes\u201d series, Caesar is a being of fury, grief and purpose. He speaks in low, oddly elegant grunts. For stretches, he does a lot of crouching, standing and watching. There\u2019s barely any of his motion to capture. And yet he remains the movie\u2019s emotional center of gravity. This beast couldn\u2019t be more dissimilar from Serkis\u2019s Gollum, from the \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d movies \u2014 a tinier, hairless, lizardly villain. His hissed speech was a kind of demonic possession. The inner conflict Serkis evoked as Gollum becomes grand yet wary rectitude with Caesar. As with Gollum, one key to the \u201cApes\u201d performance is in the eyes. They\u2019re not roiled here. They\u2019re pebbles. You\u2019d never think anything so tiny could be so mesmerizing, but they\u2019re essential to the moral seduction of these new \u201cApes\u201d movies and maybe even to the performance-capture enterprise as practiced by Serkis: They make man root against mankind. The perverse empathy we feel for the apes comes from how thoroughly awful humans are made to seem. The rest comes from what a convincing leader Serkis makes Caesar. You really would follow him to paradise, to war and even to your death.

on December 1, 2017. -Photo Editor/Nicole Mingo \nThe spirit of Christmas came to town bringing residents, students and their families out of their homes and onto the streets to enjoy the Boro in Lights festival. \nGlassboro\u2019s annual annual tree-lighting and Christmas festival was held along Rowan Boulevard this past Friday, Dec. 1. \nHundreds of adults, children and students from Rowan University braved the near-freezing temperatures with hot chocolate and coffee in-hand, for their worthwhile glimpse and feel of holiday cheer, as the multicolored lights sparkled brightly around the three-story-high Christmas tree. Although a holiday parade was not included, many events were sure to deliver just as much of a Christmas gift. Leo McCabe, Mayor of Glassboro, holds a check presented by South Jersey Federal Credit Union at \u201cBoro in Lights\u201d on December 1, 2017. -Photo Editor/Nicole Mingo \n\u201cThe tree-lighting is definitely my favorite part,\u201d said Rowan University student, sophomore public relations major Steven Becker. \u201cThis is my first time attending this event here in Glassboro, but this definitely stands out a lot from the ones I\u2019ve been to at home.\u201d \nThe tree-lighting was not the only thing that brought the crowd to applaud and cheer. Songs and carols performed by children\u2019s choruses from local elementary and middle schools and ice sculpture carving added emphasis to the event. Selfies and other photogenic poses were being taken by many in front of the Christmas tree, carriage rides pulled by snow-white horses carried riders along the perimeter of the event and drones flew high above the crowd snapping every festive picture it could get. Even a special performance by the Rowan Ballroom Dance Club was given in the streets to a medley of Christmas songs. \n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely an overwhelming feeling being here,\u201d said junior accounting major Jonathan Dolan, a student at Rowan University. \u201cThere\u2019s an overwhelming amount of children here\u2026and people. That\u2019s definitely a good thing to feel and great thing to see.\u201d The crowd gathers around the ice shaving display at \u201cBoro in Lights\u201d on Dec. 1, 2017.-Photo Editor/Nicole Mingo \n\u201cThis event is totally worth coming out in freezing temperatures for,\u201d said Glassboro High School senior, Osazee Nosa. \u201cI didn\u2019t come to the event last year although I really wanted to, but now that I am here, I can see that this is an amazing thing to ever come to this town. It brings people together and delivers a sense of community, happiness and peace; something we all need, especially in today\u2019s society.\u201d \nA very extravagant event like Boro in Lights, takes sheer and potent dedication to plan and prepare. Megan McHugh, assistant director for the Chamberlain Student Center and Campus Activities, elaborated on what went into the holiday event. \n\u201cWe start the planning for this event the summer prior. We need to work with the Borough of Glassboro to reserve the space, have roads closed, gather sponsorship from local businesses, and notify businesses on the Boulevard about the event,\u201d McHugh said. \n\u201cWe also book vendors, solicit performers, and create contracts months leading up to the event. The Rowan After Hours (RAH) professional team makes up the committee that really plans this event and then the RAH student staff members execute it night of. Also, can\u2019t forget the marketing! We promote this event at least 2 weeks prior via social media, flyers and lawn signs are campus and the local Glassboro area, and much more.\u201d \nFor comments/questions about this story, email features@thewhitonline.com or tweet @TheWhitOnline .

All opinions of this beautiful product are 100% mine! \nHello amazing Friends! On Tuesday I shared a peek at what I was using on the feature wall in my office, and today I am SO excited to share how it turned out! \nRemember how it looked not long after we moved in back in August: \n\nIt has come a long way since then! \nWe removed the carpet and discovered we had to raise the floors for the new hardwoods, so we added a layer of luan. Then I painted all the trim and the walls that were not receiving the stone treatment: \nI shared a little peek of the feature wall on Tuesday: \nI chose to use AirStone , a lightweight stone product, to highlight this wall in my office. \nReady to see it finished?? \nHere it is! \nIsn\u2019t it cool?? \nThis is the reason I painted my desk white. I needed it to be neutral enough to let the beautiful AirStone wall stand out. \nHere it is going in\u2026you\u2019ll see I had my number one helper on hand for this project. \ud83d\ude42 \n\nI love the character that the AirStone has added to this space. \nYou just apply the AirStone adhesive to the back with a putty knife and stick it to the wall. Easy! \nSee more details on how I installed it in my teaser post HERE . \nAirStone can be found at most Lowes stores. This color is one of three colors available: \nI chose Birch Bluff. My room has a ton of light so it really plays up the grays, but as you can see above, it can take on a more beige tone depending on the space. \nYou may remember my little sofa I slipcovered back in June. (See that post HERE .) It used to be in our master bedroom, but I love it here in my office! \nThis faux stone works perfectly with my wall color and flooring: \nI still need to hang that clock, but it will go in here somewhere. I also still have to add the quarter round to the base molding. \nAs you can see I installed the AirStone in between the original moldings that were already in here\u2026 \n\n\n\nI am still deciding what will go on the wall to the left, but this angle is all set! \nThe black and white rug that used to be in my dining room at the old house will probably end up in here. For now, I love coming down the stairs and being greeted by this pretty room! I also still have my frenchy fabric-covered desk chair\u2026I\u2019m still deciding if it will get a new look as well. \nI used Airstone just on one wall that did not require any corner pieces, but it can easily be used around corners as well. Here is a short video that shares how: \nThis product is super easy to install, even for the novice do-it-yourselfer!

In the first round of the night, students competed in a \u201cscratch\u201d event, where all of the robots used are built from scratch. \u201cKit\u201d events, when everyone uses the same standard robot, occurred later in the evening. \n\u201cIn scratch competition, they can change the code, as well as the physical attributes of the bot,\u201d said DJ Stahlburger, 19-year-old electrical and computer engineering major. \u201cThey have a lot more freedom in this event and it\u2019s always a more interesting competition.\u201d \nThe bracket tournament was set up with 16 teams, all working with one robot. Two rings were set up so two matches could take place at the same time. All of the robots had five second delay start times, this way the team member is given adequate time to step out of the ring. Failure to do so would result in a disqualification. \nEach match was a best two out of three rounds. The winners of the event, \u201cThe Dream Team,\u201d swept virtually every match they were in. \nThe team consisted of three electrical and computer engineering majors, sophomore Tanner Smith, junior Tomas Uribe and junior Jake Frazier. \nTheir robot was significantly larger than most of the bots used in the tournament, which gave them the advantage to push their opponents out of the ring with ease. \n\u201cOur bot weighed in at 442 grams, which was just under the limit of 500 grams,\u201d Smith said, who along with his teammates has competed in Profbots for the last three years. \nThe tournament not only showcased the creativity of engineers from Rowan, but competitors from Stockton University and Glassboro High School showed what they could do as well. \n\u201cThe last three years, a kit bot has won every single time. So, we used the kit bot and the example code, modified the speed and gave it more weight,\u201d Smith said. \nExpanding this event beyond Rowan is a goal Nikola Kosaric, 19, an electrical and computer engineering major, wants to achieve. \n\u201cI want to see this grow into more schools participating,\u201d Kosaric said. \u201cI want to see it be hosted in a bigger area with even more people attending.\u201d Electric Computer Engineering majors in sophomore Tanner Smith, junior Tomas Uribe and junior Jake Frazier take first place at Profbots 2017. \u2013 Staff Photo/Chris Devine \nAs for Smith and the rest of the Dream Team, they walked away with the grand prize of a $500 gift card in dominating fashion. They say they will be back for a fourth year to defend their title. Whether or not they\u2019ll need to make any modifications to their tank of a robot remains to be seen. \n\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t do well, we have some ideas in mind,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s not broke, don\u2019t fix it.\u201d \nFor comments/questions about this story, email features@thewhitonline.com or tweet @TheWhitOnline .

In any case at this point as an ex mercy main I can tell you all....enjoy your game.\n\"streamers and pro players\" are GM and top 500, who dedicate their lives to the playing and understanding the finer mechanics of the game and making it better, the \"community\" is a swath of gold and lower players who don't really understand how the game works and have no interest in learning. Why shouldn't their opinions carry more weight? do you think you know better than them?\nHonestly?\nI do not know better than others. But i can tell you this, the game changes as the top ranks raise. Bastion, torb, symmetra can be hard to counter for hitscans in some levels, in others they dont. There are great differences between the playerbase and the top500 players. The game have extreme differences in some levels and others.\nIf you want to play a game to dedicate your life to it, for me is ok. But if you want to be popular and sell and retain players then you cant bend to only those skilled guys. Ill give you an example. Junkrat pickratio. A pro player recently posted that he wont play junkrat. Not cause is a good dps or a good character but cause they have to \"show off\" skills, and as junkrat is taken as a low skill one, he prefers to show his training and hours in the game playing other characters that are \"considered\" of higher skill.\nThere are more differences, same as everytimne someone said that they have an issue with this, or other character they are told \"git gud\" \"you should not have issues with it at your rank\" and other stuff.\nI know, i know, i only can expose my opinion ina reasonable way. You do the same respect it and you are not a pro player. This is not a fight about who knows better. But let me tell you this. The pro players will have a salary cause people watch the game and the OWL. The same playerbase that they play it as casual and enjoy it. If the game is not enjoyable for them anymore and the game gets stale, then there will be no pro players.\nThis is the first time a game is FORCED in the e-sport, instead of letting it grow organically from the playerbase.\nBy the way and to end this, you are complaining about changes, saying Mercy is OP and rezz is op. Ok, and in several posts later you say that we do not know better about a game than the pros that created this issue.\nSO....you are telling me Im no one to talk, cause im a poor player in a low sr (gold) and at the same time you complain about the precise changes that pros and the \"devs advisors\" have decided for the rework and once checked, they considered a success?.\nsighs", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:48.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "be37a4899ea2ae7139fd361f2516c3fac0d58539", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLv7Ej4RLGCzK6Iy_H6aNT3RNIZN79GfXIgCAAWVrbeY.DjnQoerTU_F", "site_full": "us.battle.net", "site": "battle.net", "site_section": "https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/22813879/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "General Discussion - Overwatch Forums", "title": "Just Remove Resurrect", "title_full": "Just Remove Resurrect - Overwatch Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T13:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "/forums/static/images/social-thumbs/overwatch.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 462, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2ceadec02b3d494f76fd5d958c03fb33602a7a22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLv7Ej4RLGCzK6Iy_H6aNT3RNIZN79GfXIgCAAWVrbeY.FtNEUiLPCJIfSCGKhjfhho-", "ord_in_thread": 16, "author": "Tyrathius", "published": "2017-12-07T17:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "12/06/2017 08:02 PM Posted by Drizzle all of you people using the \"she was trash when when rez was ult, how is that unbalanced\" do you not realize that being significantly weaker than other choices is also unbalanced? rez is impossible to balance because it is either too strong or too weak, and the game would benefit greatly from it being removed because it's impossible to find an acceptable middle ground.\nIn an ideal world all the healers would have identical pickrates, but we all know there's basically zero chance of that ever happening.\nIn the patch prior to the rework Mercy was the most accessible healer and enjoyed a high but not unreasonable pickrate across all tiers, but was fairly niche in pro play (third highest picked healer, used mostly for Pharmercy or on Defense).

In total, all 19 Hong Kong-based QROPS have been delisted by HMRC and are no longer included in the authority\u2019s list of approved schemes. For expats living in China and planning to transfer their funds to a QROPS, the delisting means they no longer qualify for an exemption and must either pay a 25 per cent transfer tax or switch the fund to a UK-based SIPP self invested personal pension. As is usual, HMRC has given no reason for the deletion of the 19 Hong Kong QROPS, and the firms affected by the decision have made no comment as yet regarding their products\u2019 loss of status. Hong Kong based QROPS have been established in the offshore pensions marketplace since the start of the QROPS scheme in 2006, averaging between 10 and 26 products over the past 11 years. In April this year, 22 schemes were registered, with one deleted during the month and two more taken down in October, again with no explanation from HRMC. The Hong Kong financial market, including its QROPS, has frequently borne the brunt of speculation as regards tax avoidance and general breaking of rules, but no individual scheme has been singled out by HMRC for supposedly breaching its pension laws. Following the closure of the Hong Kong QROPS, there are now 29 offshore financial jurisdictions offering the pensions, with 16 located within the European Economic Area (EEA), and the rest set outside the European mainland. Although no reports have come in as yet regarding the status of those whose Hong Kong QROPS have been deleted, online examples include the plight of 100 investors in the 2012-delisted Singapore-based Panthera ROSIIP scheme. After being delisted, HMRC considered their original transfers \u2018unauthorised\u2019 and billed them for up to 55 per cent of the transfer\u2019s value as the scheme had lost its qualifying status. Some charges amounted to more than the current total value of pension pots. The investors fought back using a group litigation order, with the final judgement in 2013 proving humiliating for HMRC as it was forced to recall the tax bills and pay investors\u2019 legal costs.

I've managed Tyrone Booze, former cruiserweight champ,\njunior middleweight champ Buster Drayton, featherweight champ Freddie Norwood and\nfor the briefest of periods a guy named Jose Rivera who was the welterweight champ.\nYou fix fights\nto make betting money.\nYou fix fights to get a fighter a championship. You fix fights\nto maneuver a fighter up the ranks toward a championship fight.\nYou fix fights to win\nin order\nagain to position someone strategically.\nYou fix fights to lose in\norder to get paid and in order to make - you know - betting coups.\nThe way you fix fights\nvaries greatly.\nYou fix fights by buying judges.\nThat's... you know... that's one easy way to do it. You fix fights by having the referee working for you, so that\nif there's any way that the ref can stop a fight in your guy's favor, he does.\nYou fix fights by colluding with the fighters, generally the loser. It's al... it's almost always the loser.\nWinners almost never know that the fight is fixed.\nOne of the things that you're cognizant of when you are fixing fights is\nthat you're doing something illegal.\nSomething that theoretically can wind you up - you know -\nwind you in jail and get people angry at you. So you never really say anything?\nYou know, nothing that's culpable.\nSo there's a code and\nif you're in boxing for a while, you know the code everybody knows the code.\nYou will go into a gym\nwhere there's either a trainer or manager and you're looking for somebody\nyour guy can beat. This is how these guys make their money, and it's interesting that people who lose in boxing\n- generally speaking - if they're professional losers can make more money than winners.\nWinning costs money,\nlosing makes money.\nThat's not true obviously at an elite level, but it almost every other level, it's the case.\nSo what you do is you say I've got a guy and\nhe is looking for work.\n\"Looking for work\" is the first?\nOkay, so it means that\nHe needs to win - you know - and you want to keep him busy.\nThe response to that is \"I've got somebody\" and generally the second phrase is \"but he hasn't been in the gym too much.\"\nOkay, so the subtext there is: He's not in good shape and\nso you're honing in on where this thing is gonna go and you say that's okay, you know\nI'd like a guy to get in a few rounds\nThat means it's gonna be a knockout\nAt which point he goes: \"well, you know okay...\"\nI can do that, but really my guy isn't in shape to go more than three or four?\nThat's okay, so you've just fixed the fight.\nNobody's done anything illegal. Nobody's done anything where they've come out and stated anything explicitly.\nBut that's a done deal, and you get... you get what you pay for.\nCan you say how many fights you've fixed?\nHundreds. How many I'm not sure, but hundreds.\nI see it all the time now, I mean, I don't make our living in boxing anymore.\nBut I see fixes all the time, sure. It will always exist, it always has.\nAlright fans, here we go with our main event of the evening\nwith over 90 countries in six continents tuning in. It's Showtime!\nVegas I think tends toward the sensational.\nIrish hurricane Peter McNeeley!\nKeep laughing, keep laughing.\nReal funny huh?\nIf you go... if anyone of you\ndoesn't respect me or what I'm doing or what I've been doing for the last three months\nsince I been asked... and going against a guy like this,\nyou'd have a big dump in your pants.\nI'm hurricane Peter McNeeley from Medfield, Mass, (Massachusetts). On Saturday night, watch me kick Tyson's ass.\nBut if you haven't made your pay for view arrangements yet, make them soon because remember what happens when I wrap you in my cocoon.\"\nMcNeeley's manager was a guy named Vin Vecchione.\nVecchione had no money,\nso I... for a while was bankrolling what they were doing. I was bringing McNeeley sometimes and Vecchione to New York.\nFor various... you know and I was making fights for Peter,\nso I mean I knew them very well, and I was very involved in what was going on.\nSo I bring Vecchione to Al Bravermans office, who was Don Kings Director of Boxing. And we worked out a deal.\nfor McNeeley to be Tyson's first opponent which is a completely win-win situation for everybody.\"\nI'm just happy to be here, everybody's made their statements.\nMr McNeeley had a cute statement,\nI'm just ready to fight. Thank you everyone for your support. Thank you.\nAnd I get a phone call\nfrom a guy whose voice I recognised but not somebody I really know.\nAnd he said, look, somebody\nthought I should give you a call, to let you know that a bet got made,\nThat the fight wouldn't\nYeah, I'm trying to remember how he described...\nI think he told me, the fight won't go... it's... it's not gonna go 90 seconds.\nIt was you know it was a million dollar bet and the fights not gonna go 90 seconds. Somebody thought,\nyou might be interested in that.\n89 seconds at which point Vin Vecchione steps\nbetween the ropes to prop the ending to the fight\nVecchione who really had this thing figured out, understood that\nit was crucial that\nthere be no finding of impropriety\nbecause Tyson was the machine\non which boxing ran.\nBy far the biggest earner in the world and...\nYou know when he fights in Vegas\nthey generate a billion dollars in added revenue. I mean not from boxing per se but you know from all of the ancillary revenue.\nSo it has to be okay?\nAnd Vecchione knows that.\nSo he gets his payday, whatever it is, and I don't know what it is. I never did know what it was,\nand I get a phone call from from him\nand I'm still in Puerto Rico because... you got to come to the house\nI got to see you, and I said I can't do it.

You can't just\nwalk into the ring, so you've got to watch this thing and you have to figure out\nWhen can I do this?\nAnybody who's got the kind of nerve\nfrom that background dealing with what is on the other side,\nyou know, the establishment side,\nto wait until one second\nto step in.\nIf you don't admire that I don't know that yeah you see things that I don't because to me\nthat is the greatest single underdog score that...\nthat I've ever seen in all of my years in boxing. You know the single\nmost savvy maneuver that I've ever seen.\nIf you're in the boxing business, if you're doing it worldwide\nyou're going to run into gangsters, it's always been a sport that's had a lot of criminal activity, the Russian mob and the Mafia.\nBoth fractions figured out that I really didn't know my way around the game a lot\nunderstood a lot about boxing and so I wound up making some fights for\nmob guys of both both stripes...\nand fixing some fights for some people but\nthere were problems, that... that showed up some things didn't go our way. Some bad things happened.\nWell obviously, they didn't send somebody I mean, they didn't send somebody to kill me because, here I am.\nI got a phone call from somebody I knew,\nwho said that I'd better take care of things I'd better iron out this problem\nIf I don't hear from you in two weeks, we'll have to\nresolve this in a different way.\nI really hope that we can resolve this the right way.\nI mean if I have to take it just for the ... we can discuss the... it is entirely up to you.\nSo I brokered a deal that allowed me to get out.\nFor more infomation >> Ex-Boxing Manager Reveals How Boxing Matches Are Fixed - Duration: 12:56. \nROM\u00c3 \ud83d\udc8b FRUTA AFRODIS\u00cdACA! | N\u00f4 Figueiredo - Duration: 3:42.

I'm Chris Muir from the Oracle Mobile Platform Team. In this video, we're\ngoing to cover an overview of the Intelligent Bots channel feature. As an\nintelligent chatbot developer having developed a bot, the fact that you can\nhave an actual conversation in the Test screen with your chatbot--it's fairly\neasy to think that Oracle's bot solution is the be-all and end-all; the solution\nthat you need. If you build a bot, you can converse with the bot--what else is there\nto do? However, you need to remember: intelligent chat bots is designed to be\nthe backend intelligence for your bot and you can plug this backend\nintelligence into one or more messenger platforms capable of\nconversations, such as Facebook's messenger, for example. In order to\nfacilitate connecting into other messenger platforms, Intelligent Bots has\nthe concept of channels. A channel is a named abstraction of the settings\nrequired to connect into another messenger platform like Facebook\nMessenger, for example. Now at the time this video was recorded--and in the initial\nrelease of intelligent chat bots--it has support for two different channel types:\nthat is, specifically, Facebook Messenger and a more generic webhook mechanism\nthat should suit any messenger platform that supports webhooks. In fact, Facebook\nMessenger uses webhooks under the covers, so let's talk about what\nwebhooks are first. Webhooks aren't tied, or only relevant, to messenger platforms.\nThey are a more generic mechanism for server-to-server\nbackground communications that commonly utilize REST APIs. So let's\nexplain this in a little bit more detail so you understand.\nImagine we have two servers who want to talk to each other and can only use REST\nAPIs to do so. So on our left, our server wants to retrieve some data from our\nserver on the right. Now with plain old REST APIs, the right server would\npublish a resource and the left server would use an HTTP GET request to\nretrieve the results from the other server. As such, a request would travel\nthrough left server to the right server, and a synchronous response would return\nwith a payload from right to left as part of the same HTTP request-response\ncall. Now this is all good and well, but what if the right server has some sort\nof event the left server is interested in? How would it, in real time using this\nmechanism, get a notification of the event as soon as it had occurred? Currently,\nthe left server has to call the right server, so there is always going to be a\ngap in time to find out about the event if we set up a periodic polling call\nbetween the servers. So, how do we solve this? What the solution to\nthis is: webhooks. Rather than the server on the right publishing a REST API which\nthe left server has to call periodically, we set up instead the REST APIs in an\nopposite fashion. The left server sets up a REST API that the right server, on raising an\nevent, is then configured to push the event data to the left server automatically\nonce the event occurs. As such, you can conceptually think of webhooks as a\npublication-subscription type mechanism rather than a request-response mechanism.\nWhat's neat about this mechanism is we can set up webhooks in both directions.\nEssentially, each server is configured to call the REST API on the other server\nwhen an event is raised and to pass the information of the event to the other\nserver in near-real time. But what's especially neat about this mechanism is how useful it is\nfor conversational bots--which we are using--when you have a conversation\noccurring between both servers, where the event is one bot saying something to the\nother bot's server and vice- versa.\nAs such, with webhooks in both directions between our servers, we can support each\nbot conversing with each other, again in a near-real time fashion. This is why\nwebhooks, as a mechanism, is one of the first channel mechanisms intelligent chatbots\nsupports. And it is common to many messaging platforms, and gives bots\ndevelopers a generic mechanism for setting up a channel with a third-party\nmessenger platform. Beyond webhooks for the first iteration of Intelligent Bots\nas I mentioned, Intelligent Bots will also support Facebook Messenger. Now\nthere are plans to support more messenger platforms in the future, but\nFacebook Messenger was one of our first choices. Facebook's messenger platform,\nunder the covers, uses webhooks. However, Intelligent Bots has additional\nsupport for Facebook Messenger to make the integration tasks easier. We are going\nto explore the Facebook Messenger support in Intelligent Bots in the next\nvideo. Hope you've enjoyed this video. I hope to catch you in the next video very\nsoon.\n[MUSIC]\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "leon spinks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyrone booze", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vecchione", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "freddie norwood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter mcneeley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcneeley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jose rivera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris muir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buster drayton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vin vecchione", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pooja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ko ko bop", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mafia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "showtime", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oracle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oracle mobile platform team", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook messenger", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medfield", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:49.061+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1e6b7dad750fee95ace7092ac8e4b3ce0b532a78", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9QKowbIlzeOXqFYL.FoHw9UuKYqn18.ymjec22zJlmZYNG4XsjwNE_Hu7LHHyOvtATzPwTzjxkHVjYUR7zUGM9AHALFsqKrLBt2Rri738auwlY1ad2JnlP1tNpETkYa4A-", "site_full": "www.expatsblog.com", "site": "expatsblog.com", "site_section": "http://www.expatsblog.com/news/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "British state pensioners have largest income drop of major world countries", "title_full": "British state pensioners have largest income drop of major world countries", "published": "2017-12-06T20:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1e6b7dad750fee95ace7092ac8e4b3ce0b532a78", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9QKowbIlzeOXqFYL.FoHw9UuKYqn18.ymjec22zJlmZYNG4XsjwNE_Hu7LHHyOvtATzPwTzjxkHVjYUR7zUGM9AHALFsqKrLBt2Rri738auwlY1ad2JnlP1tNpETkYa4A-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Charles Smith", "published": "2017-12-06T20:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "British state pensioners have largest income drop of major world countries", "text": "Home \u00bb Expat News \u00bb British state pensioners have largest income drop of major world countries British state pensioners have largest income drop of major world countries Published: 6   Moving , Spain , UK , Italy , Study Abroad , Pension Transfer , England , The Netherlands It\u2019s no wonder British pensioners have been queuing up to leave the UK for warmer, cheaper climes, as their state stipends are far below those of any other major world country. It\u2019s official, Britain\u2019s state pensioners are now at the bottom of the retirement league, with those unable to save for a private pension now undergoing serious hardship. Government reports invariably state the fact the elderly may have to rely on just the state pension, even if their wages over their working lives have only provided enough to support their weekly expenses due to regular hikes in the cost of living. It\u2019s no surprise that \u2018pound shops\u2019, unheard of in the UK up until a few years ago, are now favourite shopping destinations for British pensioners. Recent research shows pensioners in Denmark, Holland and even in Italy are far better off than their British equivalents, with the retirement income drop more severe than in other countries including Mexico,Japan and Poland. The measly UK state pension is just 29 per cent of average in-work earnings, with the average from a compilation of other countries standing at 63 per cent. Even when private pensions are included in the calculations, Britain still falls well behind the OECD average. The OECD study is definitive, stating \u2018those without additional sources of revenue are left with few resources, adding the UK government has persistently underfunded benefit workplace pension schemes. The result is that many over-65s will be forced to continue working till they drop rather than risk running out of funds. Previously, a good number of UK state pensioners voted with their feet, selling their homes and ending up in Spain or other relatively inexpensive expat destinations, thus removing the need to beg the British authorities for financial help in their old age. Current poverty levels in the 75-plus group stand at 18.5 per cent, and are just over 10 per cent in the 66-75 age group \u2013 a sad reflection of British lawmakers\u2019 lack of concern for the elderly. The introduction of the new pension isn\u2019t expected to help much and doesn\u2019t affect current retirees. Should a hard Brexit be the result of the ailing negotiations, Britain can expect a reluctant influx of UK state pensioner returnees, many of whom may well be homeless and the majority of whom will only have their state pensions to rely on.
