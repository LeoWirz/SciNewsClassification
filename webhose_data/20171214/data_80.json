The Conservative leader and byelection candidate weren't shopping just to soothe a sugar craving. They were making a political point about small business taxes, an issue they're pushing to be front and centre in South Surrey-White Rock. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck By: Laura Kane The Canadian Press Published on SURREY, B.C. \u2014 Inside a colourful candy shop in a bustling Vancouver suburb, Andrew Scheer and Kerry-Lynne Findlay marvelled at delicate British chocolate bars, chewy Red Vines and an edible Monopoly board. The Conservative leader and byelection candidate weren't shopping just to soothe a sugar craving. They were making a political point about small business taxes, an issue they're pushing to be front and centre in South Surrey-White Rock. \"People are saying, 'I'm paying a lot higher taxes than I was before. I'm being called a tax cheat because I'm an entrepreneur with a small business,' \" said Findlay, 62, a former national revenue minister. The riding is one of four across Canada where a byelection will be held Monday, but it's anticipated to be the closest race. Conservative Dianne Watts won by just 1,400 votes over the Liberal candidate in 2015, while the NDP placed a distant third. The vote arrives midway through Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's term and it's expected to test his popularity, as well as the potential of rookie leader Scheer, ahead of the 2019 election. Both men have visited the riding twice and both have suggested the outcome will indicate whether the Liberal surge of 2015 is continuing or waning. \"Two years ago, in the election, Canadians didn't randomly or suddenly change who we are,\" Trudeau said at a recent rally to support Liberal candidate Gordie Hogg, 71. \"We have always been progressive, forward-thinking, open, compassionate, ambitious people,\" he said. \"It was just about getting a government that recognizes that.\" South Surrey-White Rock has older, wealthier and whiter demographics than other ridings in Surrey, which is the fastest-growing city in Metro Vancouver. It's home to a picturesque waterfront and an array of restaurants, shops and other small businesses. In July, Trudeau's government announced plans to close loopholes that it said have allowed high-earning business owners to avoid higher taxes. The measures included changes to \"income sprinkling,\" which allows owners to split income among family members. After a backlash, the government said it would cut the small business tax rate from 10.5 per cent to nine per cent by 2019. Hogg said he and Trudeau are committed to cutting taxes for small businesses, while the Conservatives voted against a tax cut in 2015 for \"middle-class\" Canadians earning between about $45,000 and $90,000 a year. \"To me, their record is more important than their rhetoric,\" said Hogg. \"This byelection is about electing the strongest positive voice for our community, and only Justin Trudeau and I have a positive plan to strengthen our middle class and offer real help for families.\" The seat became vacant after Watts resigned to run for leader of the B.C. Liberal Party, an informal coalition of federal Conservatives and Liberals. Byelections will also be held in Battlefords-Lloydminster in Saskatchewan, previously held by the Conservatives; Bonavista-Burin-Trinity in Newfoundland, a Liberal seat; and Scarborough-Agincourt in Ontario, also won by the Liberals in the last election. In South Surrey-White Rock, Hogg has name recognition and deep roots. He was White Rock mayor for 10 years before being elected to the B.C. legislature for two decades. Findlay, meantime, represented Delta-Richmond East in Parliament from 2011 to 2015. Asked about her connection to the riding, Findlay said her parents lived in the community and she has also lived there at various points, including after she was widowed at 34 and was raising her children alone. She said she moved to White Rock this summer. The NDP candidate is Jonathan Silveira, 40, a real estate agent and founder of advocacy group Surrey Kids Matter. He said the byelection was an opportunity to train new volunteers and strengthen relationships, but added he was serious about winning. \"There are two big sharks fighting here. I am not afraid of the fight as well,\" he said. New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh has not joined Silveira in the riding. Trudeau's recent rally with Hogg in Surrey drew hundreds. Some were not local voters, however, including a Syrian refugee who said she wanted to thank Trudeau, and a visitor from Singapore who wanted to see the famous Canadian politician in person. The prime minister is pictured alongside Hogg on campaign signs, indicating confidence among Liberals in Trudeau's popularity. Scheer and Findlay, however, said they've heard from people who have \"buyer's remorse\" after voting Liberal in 2015. It's hard to predict a general election based on byelections, Scheer added, because the latter generally have lower turnouts, and local issues become amplified over national ones. \"But I think we would love to send a signal, mid-term, that what the Liberals have been doing for Canadians isn't working.\" \u2014 Follow @ellekane on Twitter.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trudeau", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "scheer", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hogg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laura kane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kerry-lynne findlay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew scheer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dianne watts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gordie hogg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jagmeet singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin trudeau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bonavista-burin-trinity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "findlay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan silveira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silveira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "watts", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook share", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "b.c. liberal party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surrey kids matter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ndp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "surrey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metro vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south surrey-white rock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white rock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newfoundland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saskatchewan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scarborough-agincourt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "battlefords-lloydminster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ontario", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surrey", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:29.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "82ccfdcbeb7a2cc2c322e1082591b0f3b53b252f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS5toXaRhqXGAWb3yrKz.7Z_xwnFClimg59K7Fufd8rbB2zyZQ7L1IyxinDCYxkXUuPKDaRsRsgAY-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Steven Universe discussion and fanart", "title": "M'Lapis", "title_full": "M'Lapis : stevenuniverse", "published": "2017-12-07T00:31:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 142, "participants_count": 93, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2d2b0dd0887eecddd5804be4754a6f0a9c201902", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS5toXaRhqXGAWb3yrKz.7Z_xwnFClimg59K7Fufd8rbB2zyZQ7L1IyxinDCYxkXUuUVQq0w8XlCRHm29YfSIvSWXoFFr1bcNi", "ord_in_thread": 136, "author": "Need_a_Ladder", "published": "2017-12-07T10:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "That's a weird way to spell Peridot.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:29.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2fc76769a73aed300cbeedcd26057296067d115e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jepyMjYRjrpj3xypWcMQjSJLiTASruHf3P.uJkSZfuneV3bYEdIRusaDmbX6lhd2w4-", "site_full": "coyotescorner.net", "site": "coyotescorner.net", "site_section": "http://coyotescorner.net/viewforum.php?f=6", "site_categories": ["pro_ice_hockey", "sports", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "CoyotesCorner.net \u2022 View forum -

During the pregnancy we decided to be OAD due to fianances and the overall freedom of having 1. So during my pregnancy and the newborn stage I was always thinking \"this is probably the last time\". It made me sad but I also had HG which made me throw up my whole pregnancy. Our daughter still doesn't sleep through the night and is very active all day, but honestly I would love to have another. I stay at home while I go to school part time because my nanny job didn't work out bringing my baby along. I am living off my student loans and my husbands salary as an apprentice plumber. Right now times are tough money wise, but overall as a plumber he will be making a lot more once he is a Forman or working on his own. Last week at thanksgiving dinner his grandma asked when we will have another, and he said we aren't. They are an in your business type of family. It lead to a long discussion, and I really didn't mind it because I liked hearing their opinions. Even his dad said he just has to have another, and that money shouldn't hold us back (they have a lot of money, he owns 10 restaurants, I don't think they understand that part). I found myself agreeing with them, but only if they are close in age because I want to stay home when they are young and I will graduate in a few years. DH (dear husband) says he wants another, and we agreed to space them about 2.8 years apart, so that I would be pregnant this time next year. Although we already agreed and I am excited, I am still conflicted. I think about all the positives this group has shown me about OAD.

Despite the hot Karoo sun, staff at Aquila Private Game Reserve welcomed the new arrivals with big smiles. The animals seemed to enjoy their new surroundings, with the eland seen leaping out of the truck to explore its new territory. Enroute to Aquila Private Game Reserve. About to see their new home. The two giraffes getting familiar with their new surroundings. \nThe two Cape giraffe were taken off specialised trucks, after a long journey from Eastern Cape to the reserve. They kept close to each other as they looked around their new home. These giraffes will strengthen the gene pool. Owned by Searl Derman, Aquila firmly believes in protecting wild plant and animal species and their habitats. This is why they are doing everything in their power to create a beautiful home for some of these endangered species. Lynley Mitchelle of Aquila Private Game Reserve said it was exciting to welcome the first seasonal delivery of animals to their new home this week. The eland leap out of the truck to see their new surroundings. Pictures: Supplied. \n\u201cTheir arrival is the first delivery of a substantial investment in a variety of game to boost numbers and to strengthen gene pools. More giraffe, around 20 buffalo, kudu and eland have been purchased with the first 5 arriving at the reserve in early January,\u201d said Mitchelle. She said while the reserve was open for tourists, Derman was also passionate to strengthen the gene pool and strengthen the numbers.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO-Toronto Police Service MANDATORY CREDIT By: Staff The Canadian Press Published on TORONTO \u2014 The judge at the trial of two men accused of killing a young Toronto woman five years ago and then burning her body is to begin his legal instructions to the jury today. Dellen Millard and Mark Smich have pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder in the presumed death of 23-year-old Laura Babcock. Babcock's body has not been found. In its closing address on Wednesday the Crown said a \"mountain\" of circumstantial evidence points to Millard and Smich killing Babcock at Millard's home some time after 8 p.m. on July 3, 2012 and then disposing of her body at Millard's farm near Waterloo, Ont. The prosecution alleges Babcock was killed after becoming the odd woman out in a love triangle with Millard and his girlfriend. Smich's lawyer told the jury on Wednesday that his client had no motive to kill Babcock because he was never part of a love triangle and all the Crown has is a rap song in which Smich says he killed a girl and burned her body. Millard, who represented himself, told the jury in his closing address Tuesday that several witnesses testified to having seen or heard from Babcock after July 4, 2012.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laura babcock", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "smich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dellen millard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "babcock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark smich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "millard", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "toronto police service", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "babcock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waterloo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:30.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "efe231dc20a8c8ab227c5dbe4fa2526f1ad27ca4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl6CegicN6kN4WEamnpZD6tmshnyPCwBs8R1W18Fdj4uNn6XQr69vPAUEj_R4iB2G9c9Uvkw1OYshd1iwXzFylTL1EzFuuteJ7Q--", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "[FFRK] Ability Buffs!

He said the motivation to not rely solely on external research had seen Sugar Research Australia convert to an IOC. Mr McKeon said the IOC model had some strengths, especially in terms of operations. \u201cThere are really strong points in having an IOC model, there is the operational flexibility there that is really desirable.\u201d   Equally, Mr McKeon said the RDC model could work well with some minor tweaks to the PIERD Act. \u201cSome minor legislative change, such as creating the ability to undertake internal R&D would iron out many of the issues people have at present with the RDC model,\u201d Mr McKeon said. However, in terms of the GRDC, which is the highest profile levy-funded organisation still operated as an RDC, there is a groundswell of grower support for a transition to an IOC. Ray Marshall, Grain Producers Australia board member and Pingelly, WA, farmer, said he was in favour of an IOC. \u201cThe only way forward for the grains industry is an IOC,\u201d Mr Marshall said. \u201cIt will give growers more autonomy and more interest in their organisation and how their levies are spent.\u201d In its analysis dating back to 2011, the Productivity Commission (PC) said the Australian agricultural RDC model was unique globally.

I did not think he would be talking about a comeback. At 34 years of age I may be closer to helping a major league team than a known cheater who famously pointed his finger at congress and told them \u201cI have never used steriods\u2026 today.\u201d Perhaps the \u201ctoday\u201d part was key and he simply meant he did not inject on that day. \nAnyway it does not matter. We do not need to analyze this any more than we need to analyze a 53 year old former major leaguer eyeing a comeback as a player. Palmeiro\u2019s chances of returning to the game revolve around a Jose Canseco independent league circus tour and accepting a role as a minor league instructor. \nFor those wanting to see him point his finger here is the clip again: \nHow much did steroids help? I don\u2019t know. Palmeiro was a tremendous talent on the field during his playing days. He is just one of five players to amass 500 home runs and 3,000 hits. \nJulio Franco played 15 games for the Braves as a 48 year old in 2007 but that came after consecutive seasons with the team and a brief stint with the Mets in which he still looked like a guy capable of filling out a major league roster and not a guy who has been sitting at home for almost 600 weeks. Franco found out at the age of 48 that his body finally deteriorated and he was still five years younger than Palmeiro is now. \nIchiro Suzuki, 44, is still looking for employment for 2018 after performing just below that of a replacement level player. The last five years have been difficult for Suzuki who has hit .263/.312/.333 during that span. His 57 stolen bases during that span is a far cry from a guy who used to steal 30 or more a season with ease but his defense has remained steady and you would be hard pressed to find many words negative of him. \nBartolo Colon eyes pitching again in 2018. He flamed out of the Braves rotation this year but found some success upon signing with the Twins. Still at 44 he finished the season with a 7-14 record and a 6.48 ERA. Sure there is more than wins and losses and ERA is only one measure but a hittable pitcher who suddenly finds trouble with walks does not make for a good solution to anyone\u2019s rotation for 2018.

(AP Photo/Markus Schreiber) By: Geir Moulson The Associated Press Published on BERLIN \u2014 Germany's centre -left Social Democrats agreed Thursday to open talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives on whether to renew their governing coalition or at least to support a minority government. Party leader Martin Schulz, Merkel's defeated challenger in Germany's Sept. 24 election, secured a party congress's agreement to a motion calling for talks on \"whether and in what form\" the party could support a new government. Delegates voted down a call from party's youth wing to explicitly rule out a repeat of the \"grand coalition\" of Germany's biggest parties in which the Social Democrats have been junior partners since 2013. But the road to a new government is likely to be lengthy and bumpy \u2014 a several-hour debate revealed little enthusiasm for a coalition. Schulz had insisted after the Social Democrats' disastrous election result in September that the party would go into opposition. He said he still wouldn't contemplate joining a new coalition after Merkel's talks with two smaller parties collapsed last month. But President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made clear he doesn't want a new election, and Schulz reversed course. Schulz told Thursday's previously scheduled congress that the leadership's plan for talks, which he hopes to start next week, \"takes no option off the table\" and wouldn't automatically lead to a coalition. \"We don't have to govern at any price, but we also shouldn't want not to govern at any price,\" he said. \"What is important is what we can implement.\" Schulz has promised a ballot of the party's entire membership on any coalition deal with Merkel's Union bloc. On Thursday, leaders agreed also to hold a party congress to consider whether to move on from exploratory talks \u2014 if they are successful \u2014 to full coalition negotiations. If no coalition is agreed upon, that would leave only a minority government or a new election as options. Merkel has said she is \"very skeptical\" about leading a minority government, which hasn't yet been tried in post-World War II Germany. Schulz, however, made clear that some form of support for a minority conservative government is very much an option for his party. \"I give you this promise: we will explore every path,\" he told delegates. In his speech, Schulz listed centre -left priorities such as equal treatment for men and women in the labour market and a relatively liberal approach to immigration, rejecting the idea of a cap on the number of refugees allowed into the country. The former European Parliament president called for a eurozone budget to boost investment and growth in Europe, and a European finance minister who would curb \"tax dumping.\" He also advocated aiming for a federal \"United States of Europe\" by 2025, and argued that countries that don't sign up to a treaty establishing a federal setup should then automatically leave the European Union. Merkel gave a skeptical response when asked at a separate event in Berlin about Schulz' push for a federalized Europe. She said she would concentrate on securing greater co-operation defence and other issues by 2025. The Social Democrats have been part of Germany's government for 15 of the past 19 years \u2014 twice joining a \"grand coalition\" under Merkel, from 2005 to 2009 and again from 2013 until now. But the party suffered historically poor election results after both Merkel coalitions, with support slumping to a post-war low of 20.5 per cent in September. \"The renewal of the Social Democratic Party will happen outside a 'grand coalition,' or it won't happen,\" said the leader of its youth wing, Kevin Kuehnert.

And, now that the U.S. has had a taste of faster payments, the country\u2019s Federal Reserve wants to push the industry even further into the future. The December edition of the PYMNTS Faster Payments Tracker\u2122 , powered by NACHA, examines the latest efforts to bring faster payments technology and capabilities to the United States. News from around the world of Faster Payments After spending years behind the faster payments times, the U.S. has completed a successful initial run with its first new payments system in four decades. The Real-Time Payments (RTP) system, set up by The Clearing House (TCH), was used for the first time to transfer a small sum between two financial institutions (FIs) \u2014 U.S. Bank and BNY Mellon. True to its name, the transfer took just three seconds. And, with the first successful transfer completed, other banks announced support for the RTP system. That included real-time electronic payment and banking solutions provider ACI Worldwide. In news released the day after the trial run, ACI said it had added support for the new instant payments system, including an extension of its existing UP Immediate Payments offering. The Fed on finding a clear road to getting faster The U.S. economy, like many others around the world, is rapidly changing as technology providers race to debut and develop new capabilities that make exchanging funds faster, easier and safer. To ensure that transformation goes as smoothly as possible, the Federal Reserve is again bringing stakeholders together with a focus on an industry-designed governance framework that can support faster payments technology development. This time, the effort is taking the form of the Governance Framework Formation Team. The group, comprised of payments industry executives and stakeholders, was assembled by the Federal Reserve after the Faster Payments Task Force completed its work this summer and issued its final report. The group\u2019s goals include faster payments ubiquity by 2020. And, according to recent interviews with two members of the Formation Team \u2014 including Connie Theien, senior vice president of industry relations at the Federal Reserve, and Janet Estep, CEO of NACHA \u2013 The Electronic Payments Association \u2014 those plans are ambitious but achievable. \u201cBy setting that goal, they\u2019ve created a real sense of urgency to drive momentum and get this done,\u201d Theien told PYMNTS. \u201cSo far, its really led to a very positive outcome in terms of Task Force recommendations and the roadmap for the future. Now we\u2019re really getting to the point where the rubber hits the road and the industry can collaborate and make some concrete decisions.\u201d Find the story in the latest edition of the Faster Payments Tracker. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

In the World, Not of It (1:5\u20133:12); III. In Him Who First Loved Us (3:13\u20135:21)  \n2 John\n \nGreeting (1\u20133); II. Walking in Truth and Love (4\u201311); III. Final Greetings (12\u201313)  \n3 John\n \nGreeting (1\u20134); II. Support and Opposition (5\u201312); III. Final Greetings (13\u201315)  \nNew Testament Reading: 1 John 1:1\u20132:14 \n\nThe Word of Life \n \nThat which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we looked upon and have touched with our hands, concerning the word of life\u2014the life was made manifest, and we have seen it, and testify to it and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was made manifest to us\u2014that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. And we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete.\n \nJohn begins this Book much like his Gospel account, with the Eternal Word, who was always with the Father and was working with the Father at creation. But here John\u2019s point is that this same Word who is \u201ceternal life\u201d is the crucified and risen Lord Jesus Christ, whom all the apostles had physically seen, heard, and touched. We owe the Eternal Word our perfect obedience. Despite our disobedience\u2014our lack of recognition and faithfulness of our Creator\u2014the Eternal Word did not come to condemn us but to save us. \n\nHeavenly Father, by the writings of the apostles, grant that we may ever share in Christ and His kingdom, that our joy may be complete. Amen. \n \nWalking in the Light \n \nThis is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.\n \nJohn writes about faithfulness in our walk with God. Our sinful pride rejects God\u2019s Word and seeks to deceive us so that we might not know ourselves as we are or know God as He has revealed Himself. God sees our true nature, and in Christ He reveals His nature, which is both just and gracious to us. For those who confess their sins, God is always faithful to His promise to forgive. This is just and right because of His Son, who has paid the price for our sins. \n\nHeavenly Father, give us hearts to believe and to know ourselves as we are. Then we may truthfully confess our sins, trusting in Your forgiveness and mercy. Amen. \n \nChrist Our Advocate \n \nMy little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. Whoever says \u201cI know him\u201d but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him, but whoever keeps his word, in him truly the love of God is perfected. By this we may know that we are in him: whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked.\n \nOnly true children who know Jesus as their Savior can truly walk as Jesus walked and love one another as Jesus has loved them. If anyone claims to know Jesus and does not love as Jesus loves, he is a liar. When we are guilty of not loving as Jesus loved us, we have One who defends us before God\u2019s throne and petitions our pardon for the sake of His own blood\u2014Jesus the Righteous One. Through His endless love and forgiveness, we have salvation and have come to know Him. In Him, we love our fellow Christians. \n\nFather, strengthen me in my own salvation, that I might be empowered to keep Your commands and love everyone as Christ has loved me. Amen. \n \nThe New Commandment \n \nBeloved, I am writing you no new commandment, but an old commandment that you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you have heard. At the same time, it is a new commandment that I am writing to you, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining. Whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness. Whoever loves his brother abides in the light, and in him there is no cause for stumbling. But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.\n \nI am writing to you, little children,\nbecause your sins are forgiven for his name\u2019s sake.\nI am writing to you, fathers,\nbecause you know him who is from the beginning.\nI am writing to you, young men,\nbecause you have overcome the evil one.\nI write to you, children,\nbecause you know the Father.\nI write to you, fathers,\nbecause you know him who is from the beginning.\nI write to you, young men,\nbecause you are strong,\nand the word of God abides in you,\nand you have overcome the evil one.\n \nJesus has shown us the love of God on the cross. This is the love the Law commanded but we could never fulfill. But more than that, it is the love that the Gospel imparts to those who love their brother and abide in the light so that there is in them nothing that would cause them to fall away from faith in Christ. The old commandment, \u201clove your neighbor as yourself\u201d (Lv 19:18), condemns us all, since we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves. The new commandment, \u201clove one another as I have loved you\u201d (Jn 15:12), is rooted in Jesus\u2019 work, which frees us from guilt. His atonement for our sins empowers us to love as He loves. \n\nGrant, Lord, that we trust in You and Your love, that we may always love our neighbor. Amen. \n \n\u2013 TLSB\n \nArticle: John\u2019s Reasoning, page 2171 \n \nResponsory \n \nBehold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch.\n \nThis is the name by which He will be called: The Lord Is Our Righteousness.\n \nAs a child of the catechism, one may recite the Ten Commandments and the Creed. \n \nSuggested Reading from the Book of Concord \n \nLarge Catechism I 49-58\n \nIn the morning, the Te Deum or Benedictus may be sung or prayed.

A concerted effort to improve commercial income and fundraising activities saw a combined increase of \u20ac150,000. A task force chaired by Miche\u00e1l Mahon (HWH Bunclody) and including Adrian Fenlon (Rapparees-Starlights, Se\u00e1n Doyle (Buffers Alley) and Anthony Neville (St John\u2019s Volunteers) will make a presentation to convention on how there is potential for further growth in this area. \nIncome from local gate receipts shows a small increase, while the success of the senior hurling team in 2017 saw an increased national league dividend of \u20ac75,000. Over five and half thousand children attended summer camps in the county in 2017 highlighting the continuing growth of underage activity in the county. This saw income increase from \u20ac275,499 to \u20ac314,822 \nThe financial picture is especially positive given the increase in expenditure in a number of areas. \nThe spend on inter-county teams was \u20ac945,224. In previous years this was \u20ac695,891 in 2016 and \u20ac806,866 in 2015. The improved mileage rate for players in 2017 contributed to part of this increase. There were also additional high profile games in 2017 with our senior hurlers reaching the NHL semi-final and Leinster final and senior footballers reaching the NFL final. \nWexford GAA continue their investment in Coaching and Games Development with an increase in expenditure to \u20ac495,456 from \u20ac457,000. As recently announced Wexford GAA with the support of Croke Park, Leinster GAA and Wexford County Council have established a targeted initiative to boost participation in urban areas. While the recruitment of Willie Cleary (Hurling) and Anthony Masterson (Gaelic Football) have contributed to the development of specific plans to raise standards in both codes.

However, the stray elbow actually makes an incredibly powerful statement about reporting sexual assault\u2026 \nEarlier this year, President Donald Trump claimed that he had turned down the honour of being named Time Magazine \u2018s Person of the Year for 2017. \nAddressing the honour in his typically humble manner, he tweeted: \u201d Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named \u201cMan (Person) of the Year,\u201d like last year, but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. \n\u201cI said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway!\u201d \nTime Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named \u201cMan (Person) of the Year,\u201d like last year, but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway! \n\u2013 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 24, 2017 \nSo, when it was announced that the cover had actually been awarded to \u201cThe Silence Breakers\u201d (otherwise known as those who spoke out in the face of sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace, triggering a massive #MeToo movement across every industry), the reaction online was phenomenal. \nAs one social media user put it: \u201cIt\u2019s less that it\u2019s not Trump that\u2019s Person of the Year this year, and more that it\u2019s so unequivocally Anti-Trump (and everything he stands for) that\u2019s giving me my life today. \n\u201cBalance ton porc indeed.\u201d \nPictured on the cover are five women dressed in black \u2013 two of which are celebrities: actress Ashley Judd, who was one of the first to speak out against Harvey Weinstein, and singer Taylor Swift, who won a civil case against an ex-DJ who she said had grabbed her bottom. \nStanding alongside them are former Uber engineer Susan Fowler (whose allegation brought down Uber\u2019s CEO), lobbyist Adama Iwu, and Isabel Pascual (an immigrant whose name has been changed to protect her identity). \nIf you look closely, though, you\u2019ll notice an elbow with no face or name attached \u2013 a move which has sparked some criticism online. \n\u201cReally loving the new Time Magazine cover, but my sympathies to whoever thought they were going to be on the cover of Time but ended up being cropped down to an elbow,\u201d one commenter shared on Twitter. \nHowever, while the crop may seem like an error, the elbow\u2019s inclusion was actually intentional. \n\u201cThe stray elbow on Time \u2018s Person of the Year cover is meant to include victims of sexual harassment who have to stay anonymous: It\u2019s still really difficult for a lot of women to come forward,\u201d Charlotte Alter, Time \u2018s national correspondent, told BuzzFeed News . \nThis arm in particular, though, belongs to a young hospital worker from Texas who \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel\u2026 that she can come forward without threatening her livelihood.\u201d \n\u201cShe too is a victim of sexual harassment but was there anonymously, she said, as an act of solidarity to represent all those who could not speak out,\u201d Time said. \nThe fact that a woman honored on @TIME\u2019s POY cover didn\u2019t feel safe revealing her identity perfectly encapsulates why \u201cthe silence breakers\u201d are so influential \u2013 and how far the #MeToo movement still has to go pic.twitter.com/YTgeUaHJWI \n\u2013 Lauren Holter (@laurenholter) December 6, 2017 \nOf course, the publication has identified many more people as part of the #MeToo movement behind the cover shot: the accompanying article spans some 8,000 words, and is five chapters long. It features the likes of Tarana Burke, who created the #MeToo hashtag over a decade ago, is featured in the accompanying story \u2013 as well as Alyssa Milano, who helped it to gain traction on social media in October. \nThen there\u2019s Blaise Godbe Lipman, the former actor-turned-filmmaker who accused his former agent Tyler Grasham of sexually assaulting him when he was 18, and Rose McGowan, who publicly accused Harvey Weinstein of rape earlier this year. There\u2019s Oregon state senator Sara Gelser, who detailed in a formal complaint filed in November a years-long pattern of unwanted touching and sexual harassment by fellow senator Jeff Kruse and indicated that at least 15 women have similar experiences. There\u2019s Sandra Pezqueda, a former dish-washer, who filed a lawsuit against her supervisor at a luxury resort in South California for sexual harassment lasting months. There\u2019s Megyn Kelly, the former Fox News journalist whom Donald Trump accused of having \u201cblood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever\u201d after she moderated a debate during the presidential campaign. There\u2019s a group of hotel workers who have filed a lawsuit against their employer. And actor Terry Crews, who revealed he was sexually molested by a Hollywood executive in 2016, has also been included. \nA long list of names? Absolutely, but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg: there are many, many others (both women and men) who have shared their stories in the thought-provoking piece, too. \nWhy so many? Because this \u201cmoment\u201d, the magazine says, \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a leader, or a single, unifying tenet. The hashtag #MeToo (swiftly adapted into #BalanceTonPorc, #YoTambien, #Ana_kaman and many others), which to date has provided an umbrella of solidarity for millions of people to come forward with their stories, is part of the picture, but not all of it\u2026 \n\u201cThe women and men who have broken their silence span all races, all income classes, all occupations and virtually all corners of the globe.\u201d \nIn its Person of the Year 2017 cover story, Time adds: \u201cThis reckoning appears to have sprung up overnight. But it has actually been simmering for years, decades, centuries. Women have had it with bosses and co-workers who not only cross boundaries but don\u2019t even seem to know that boundaries exist. They\u2019ve had it with the fear of retaliation, of being blackballed, of being fired from a job they can\u2019t afford to lose. They\u2019ve had it with the code of going along to get along. They\u2019ve had it with men who use their power to take what they want from women. \nGet a daily Stylist treat Read our \nSubscribe to our newsletter \nprivacy policy \n\u201cThese silence breakers have started a revolution of refusal, gathering strength by the day, and in the past two months alone, their collective anger has spurred immediate and shocking results: nearly every day, CEOs have been fired, moguls toppled, icons disgraced. In some cases, criminal charges have been brought.\u201d \nIt\u2019s thought that only 344 out of every 1,000 cases of sexual assault gets reported to authorities, meaning roughly two thirds of incidents will never be investigated. \nThere are a number of reasons why people decide not to report \u2013 from fear of testifying or concerns their attacker might retaliate \u2013 all valid concerns considering that out of every 1,000 rapes only six perpetrators will go to jail. \nSo, by including that stray elbow on the cover, Time has not only paid tribute to the \u201cindividual acts of courage\u201d that brought about the \u201cfastest-moving social change we\u2019ve seen in decades\u201d and changed the narrative on sexual assault, but it has also given a voice to all those who are currently unable to speak up. \nIf you have been subject to sexual assault, call 999 to report it to police. \nInformation and support can be found at nhs.uk, gov.uk and rapecrisis.org.uk. \nIf you need to report assault or harassment on public transport, British Transport Police urges victims of sexual assault to report the crime as soon as possible, by approaching a police officer or station staff, calling 0800 40 50 40 or texting 61016.

Shannon Power Marriage equality is finally legal in Australia. 7 December 2017 Shannon Power \nAustralia\u2019s parliament broke out in euphoric celebrations as Australia finally legalized same-sex marriage. \nAfter a 13 year battle and a hurtful postal survey on the issue, marriage equality is now completely legal in Australia. \nThe House of Representative in the Australian Parliament has just voted in favour of passing a law that would allow same-sex couples to marry. \nThe Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 was passed late on Thursday afternoon. Only four MPs voted against the Bill to legalise same-sex marriage. \nToday\u2019s vote in parliament came after an unprecedented, non-binding postal survey which asked eligible Australian voters if they agreed the law should be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry . It was revealed on 15 November that Australians voted 61.6% in favor of changing the law. \nThe Bill was first introduced in Australian Senate where it was passed after a long debate and passed to the Lower House. \nSince Monday, 118 Members of Parliament gave speeches in the House, debating their point of view on the Bill. The Bill was debated for almost 30 hours in the Lower House. \nBut on Wednesday morning, long-time marriage equality supporter Warren Entsch introduced the second reading of the Bill. \nThe Lower House went on to debate proposed amendments to the marriage equality Bill. \nAll of the proposed amendments to the Bill, from each end of the political spectrum were voted down. \nSome of the voted down amendments included; increased religious freedoms, allowing parents to remove their children from classes at school if it was teaching them about same-sex marriage and allowing wedding celebrants to refuse to officiate on same-sex marriages. What comes next? \nThe Bill will be put forward to the Governor-General Peter Cosgrove for Royal Assent, which could happen at anytime up to 10 days from now.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "warren entsch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter cosgrove", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "members of parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shannon power marriage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australian parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lower house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representative", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shannon power  australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:33.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8de70683638a1390d2c25f4edb6b2170b303febc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9zKytBPrqRTdGW8VMKnULjv.3UrUflphjUyUA3wmskLz_9HobJ9VAe5KrCGDut.aiOEZRAXCnBaQ--", "site_full": "www.cafepharma.com", "site": "cafepharma.com", "site_section": "http://www.cafepharma.com/boards/forums/avion-pharmaceuticals.897/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Avion Pharmaceuticals | Cafepharma Message Boards | Pharma Sales, Device Sales, Lab Sales", "title": "Acella | Page 9", "title_full": "Acella | Page 9 | Cafepharma Message Boards | Pharma Sales, Device Sales, Lab Sales", "published": "2017-11-16T17:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.cafepharma.com/boards/styles/rogue/xenforo/avatars/avatar_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5bf2ef63a4053880681a10fb10954e42ceb9b8ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9zKytBPrqRTdGW8VMKnULjv.3UrUflphjUyUA3wmskLz_9HobJ9VAe5KrCGDut.aiHx27rUS21FJMyc1eOCcHd_O33TkrkTR4-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "anonymous", "published": "2017-11-17T16:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Above poster sounds a wee bit jealous", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:34.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d1388f84e3378d0e80fa694acfc3fe43355ada5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrrRORleMxMhchsa62jNi555j1rK2EEQGI40o2AvQAgGs6p6KPF9ngR", "site_full": "southafrica.shafaqna.com", "site": "shafaqna.com", "site_section": "http://southafrica.shafaqna.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "South Africa News (News Reader) |", "title": "South Africa:Ex-Mineworkers Benefit From Health Service Centre", "title_full": "South Africa:Ex-Mineworkers Benefit From Health Service Centre", "published": "2017-12-07T10:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5727, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d1388f84e3378d0e80fa694acfc3fe43355ada5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrrRORleMxMhchsa62jNi555j1rK2EEQGI40o2AvQAgGs6p6KPF9ngR", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "South Africa:Ex-Mineworkers Benefit From Health Service Centre", "text": "20 hours ago South Africa:Ex-Mineworkers Benefit From Health Service Centre [SAnews.gov.za] Former miners will benefit from a centre which will provide integrated services for Tuberculosis (TB) and occupational lung disease assessments, as well as administrative services for compensation.

Photo by Chris Lee, Chris Lee Save \nST. LOUIS \u2014 In a rare matchup with a team more depleted than them, SIU's nine players failed to close a road win against Saint Louis' seven-man roster Wednesday. \nCenter Kavion Pippen endured foul trouble for the first time this season, and the Billikens came up with all the big shots in a 74-69 upset at Chaifetz Arena. \nJordan Goodwin, a former star at Belleville Althoff High School, scored a game-high 20 points and guard Javon Bess hit two big 3s in the final five minutes to help Saint Louis end its four-game losing streak. \n\"We showed a lot of character to just move on, and to just control what you can control, and we've been tested on that a lot,\" said Saint Louis coach Travis Ford, who lost starting guard Davell Roby for the last 30 minutes because of what he described as an illness. \"Just worry about the things you can control. We can't always control if the ball goes in the hole or not, but we can control what we do next, and I thought our team showed a lot of character when he went out.\" \nNeither team led by more than six in the second half, and SIU (4-3) crashed and burned after Pippen fouled out with 3:25 to play. Nursing a 63-62 lead, the Salukis were outscored 12-6 the rest of the way in what could be a costly loss it seemed to have in control in front of an announced crowd of 5,633 fans. \nJonathan Wiley scored 19 points, Armon Fletcher added 12, and point guard Marcus Bartley, in his first game in over a year, scored 12 points in 23 minutes. The 6-foot-5 guard had a spine-tingling assist to a cutting Sean Lloyd along the baseline, bouncing it behind one defender right into the junior guard's hands before he laid it up. Bartley added two big 3-pointers, one to give SIU a 31-30 lead in the first half and the second to pull the team within three with 11 seconds left. \n\"I thought he played exceptionally well,\" SIU coach Barry Hinson said. \"He hadn't played in a year and eight months, and you look at his stat line. He tried to split a ball-screen and he took, probably, one ill-advised 3, but I think you gotta look at it and go 'Wow.' It's no surprise that he got in foul trouble, because he's gonna be a little lax on defense, and I think you gotta give Travis and them guys some credit. They tried to drive him, and, kudos to them.\" \nBartley, Lloyd and Wiley finished the game with four fouls. \nForward Hasahn French and backup center Rashed Anthony finished the game with four fouls for Saint Louis (4-4). \nPippen scored 10 points in 26 minutes, sinking 4 of 7 from the field. He also grabbed a team-high five rebounds. \n618-351-5087 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "saint louis",

Against a backdrop of fruit trees and waves lapping the shore I listened to horrific stories from six gay, bisexual, and transgender people whom a Sri Lankan gay activist had convened to meet with Human Rights Watch. \n\u201cAbeeth\u201d (all names are changed for privacy and security), a young gay man, told us that when he was 17, Ambalangoda police ordered him into a jeep and took him to the beach, where one of them raped him. \u201cI was so scared,\u201d Abeeth said. \u201cI let him do anything.\u201d \nJeewani, a 20-year-old transgender woman, said a police officer in Colombo had raped her when she was 17. The rape was \u2018so, so painful, I screamed,\u2019 she said. Neither Jeewani nor Abeeth reported the crimes, afraid the police would abuse them further. \nIn Colombo, my colleague interviewed Nithura, a 31-year-old lesbian, who said her girlfriend\u2019s father had threatened her with death, but she did not go to the police. \u201cIf not for the laws, I would\u2019ve said something,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a criminal in this country. What\u2019s the point wasting time saying something when the laws are unequal and unjust? I just don\u2019t want to be illegal.\u201d \nSections 365 and 365A of the Sri Lankan Penal Code prohibit \u201ccarnal intercourse against the order of nature\u201d and acts of \u201cgross indecency,\u201d commonly understood in Sri Lanka to criminalize same-sex relations between consenting adults, both female and male, including in private spaces. The police use these and vague, outdated \u201cvagrancy\u201d laws to justify arbitrary arrests of people simply because they appear gay or transgender. Their legal vulnerability makes them easy targets for horrendous police abuse. \nOther Sri Lankans told us during our research in Sri Lanka in 2015 and 2016, that they had faced discrimination accessing health care, employment, and housing because of their real or perceived gender identity or sexual orientation. Voluntary pledge to protect LGBTI people \nAt Sri Lanka\u2019s recent Universal Periodic Review (UPR) in November \u2013 a review every four years of the human rights records of United Nations member states at the UN Human Rights Council \u2013 the government accepted recommendations to end discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people. In fact, it made a \u201c voluntary pledge\u201d to \u201cEnsure and strengthen respect for fundamental rights of all persons, including those from the LGBTIQ community, and address concerns raised in that regard,\u201d no doubt a result of years of advocacy by Sri Lankan activists. \nThe pledge is encouraging, but officials have been sending mixed messages. An interim report from the fundamental rights committee of the Constitutional Assembly in early 2017 included draft language prohibiting discrimination on gender, sex, sexual orientation and gender identity among other grounds. The committee also proposed doing away with article 16 of the existing constitution, a bizarre \u201csavings clause\u201d that prohibits constitutional challenges to laws that predate the constitution, some dating to British colonial days. That would allow human rights activists to go to court, challenging sections 365 and 365A as unconstitutional. \nBut there\u2019s no guarantee that these proposed reforms will survive the constitutional reform process. The Constitutional Assembly has since wavered on including sexual orientation and gender identity in the proposed non-discrimination clause, and it\u2019s uncertain whether removing article 16 will get past an anti-reform lobby. \nIn its National Human Rights Action Plan, released in early November, the government removed draft language calling for protection on the grounds of sexual orientation, although it did include gender identity. \nAs the Sri Lankan organization Equal Ground has said, \u2018Contradiction of this sort only proves that the Government of Sri Lanka is yet to acknowledge persons with minority sexual orientations as people of the country.\u2019 A group of activists delivered a petition to the government protesting the exclusion. \nThe government has long resisted removing discriminatory penal code provisions that prohibit same-sex relations, and it rejected recommendations at November\u2019s UPR session to repeal articles 365 and 365A, claiming it doesn\u2019t allow discriminatory application of laws. But in practice, the Penal Code and other criminal law provisions are regularly used to discriminate against transgender people and have a pernicious impact on others due to their actual or perceived sexual orientation. \nSo when, and how, will officials\u2019 lofty promises to protect LGBT Sri Lankans from discrimination bear fruit? The government has made no promises as to when a new constitution will be delivered. The need for change is not abstract, nor is the urgency around decriminalization of same-sex conduct: the lives of people like Abeeth, Jeevani and Manisha, are literally on the line. As long as the Sri Lankan government tolerates discrimination and violence against LGBT people, we can predict further arbitrary arrests, rapes, assaults, death threats, and obstacles to redress. \nDeputy Solicitor General Nerin Pulle told the Human Rights Council that the government \u2018remains committed to law reform and guaranteeing non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity\u2019. \nSuch commitments need to be transformed into reality. The government should ensure that the new constitution protects LGBT people from discrimination, and allows legal challenges to preexisting discriminatory laws. In the meantime, it should seek other pathways to protecting LGBT people, including by exercising leadership in mobilizing parliament to pass a bill to repeal sections 365 and 365A.

Doing the sums \nOn average, \u00a35,418 was budgeted to be spent per pupil in 2010-11. \nIn 2016-17, the figure was \u00a35,570 \u2013 an increase in cash terms. But we used Treasury data to adjust for inflation and work out what the 2010-11 amount would be worth in 2016-17 prices. The answer is \u00a35,959. \nWe also then slightly inflated the 2016-17 figure, to reflect the fact that some money for the Flying Start scheme was taken out of schools budgets in 2015-16. That gave us a revised 2016-17 figure of \u00a35,587, \u00a3372 lower in real terms than the 2010-11 amount \u2013 a cut of 6.2%. You might also like... Nick Gibb insists school funding changes are all about 'fairness' \nSteve Rees is the headteacher of Evenlode Primary in Penarth, near Cardiff, and a representative for the National Association of Headteachers. \nHe told the programme cuts meant his school was starting to look run-down, and it was also affecting pupils. \n\u201cIt\u2019s had a dramatic effect,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a quarter of the staff that\u2019s disappeared in the last four years and that\u2019s basically down to the fact we can\u2019t afford to employ them. \n\u201cObviously if you\u2019ve got targeted children that benefit from additional support those children simply aren\u2019t getting it any more. \n\u201cIt means more able children that could do with being pushed a bit further we\u2019re unable to support them in the way we have been able to.\u201d \nHis school has a low proportion of children eligible for free school meals, so doesn\u2019t qualify for much of the Welsh Government\u2019s Pupil Development Grant. \nHe felt big variations between schools were unfair. \u201cIt makes me feel very frustrated,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIt makes me feel very angry. I\u2019ve got great kids but they\u2019re simply not getting a fair deal.\u201d \n\u201cWelsh government needs to sit back and look at priorities because at the moment from my perspective there are too many initiatives that I simply cannot cover with the amount of money I\u2019m given.\u201d \nA Welsh government spokesman said: \u201cRaising standards for all and tackling the attainment gap is at the heart of our new national mission for education. \n\u201cThat\u2019s why we are supporting teachers and learners by investing \u00a3100m to raise school standards over this Assembly term, maintaining our support for delivery of the Foundation Phase, and providing more than \u00a3187m over the next two years through our Pupil Development Grant \u2013 helping to break the link between poverty and attainment.\u201d \nHe added there had been improved GCSE outcomes and a narrowing of the gap between poorer students and the better-off. \nDon\u2019t forget to follow us on Twitter , like us on Facebook , or connect with us on LinkedIn !

The Smith Family is an independent children\u2019s charity that works with disadvantaged children. \nARQ\u2019s duty manager Jack Rae is the man behind the nightclub\u2019s altruistic initiative. He set up Arq\u2019s first donation drive in 2016.\u2018Last year I was inspired by my friend Gael Donaldson (who has organised drop off points for the appeal for several years now) to get involved and encourage people to donate to the cause,\u2019 he told Gay Star News. \n\u2018The Smith Family is a wonderful charity and the appeal gets thousands of toys and books to disadvantaged kids who would otherwise be likely wake up to no presents on Christmas morning.\u2019 \nIn its first year, the staff at Arq were overwhelmed with the amount of support they got with people dropping off toys, books and cash donations. \n\u2018Last year we had lots of people drop off toys and books. We also had lots of people who wanted to donate a toy but didn\u2019t have the time to go shopping so they made cash donations instead,\u2019 Rae said. \n\u2018Some of our wonderful queens including Coco Jumbo, Krystal Kleer and Fantasia Starr also did the rounds through the crowds with collection buckets. \n\u2018The wonderful Felicity Frockaccino donated her time to help us film a little promo video for the appeal that featured her shopping at Kmart in drag, buying toys with all the money that people had donated over the weekend.\u2019 Get in the Christmas spirit \nPeople in Sydney who would like to help out can donate a toy or book you can by drop it off to A RQ\u2019s Cloak Room during trading hours on or before the 10 December. \nAlternatively people can leave a cash donation and the ARQ staff will buy toys and books to donate. \nSome of ARQ\u2019s drag queens will also be doing the rounds through the crowd at ARQ with collection buckets this coming weekend. People are encouraged to keep an eye out for them to dig deep and give generously. Got a news tip? Want to share your story?
