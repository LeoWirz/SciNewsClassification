With one of the most reliable news teams in the industry, Bitcoinist provides up-to-date news and insightful analysis. For more follow the link below. \nInvestor Mark Yusko has held steadfast to the notion that Bitcoin\u2019s price will shoot to $400,000 in the future. The founder and CEO of the North Carolina-based Morgan Creek Capital Management firm states that the cryptocurrency has the potential of gaining value, thanks to its technical infrastructure and other factors that are already inclined in its favor. \nMark Yusko maintains that Bitcoin\u2019s self-sufficient design has given it a disruptive revolutional technological edge. In an interview on Bloomberg, he cites the possibility for people to transact exchanges on blockchains without seeking out banks to confirm the transaction\u2019s validity. Can\u2019t Trust the Banks \nThis stand reflects his optimistic position from last month that blockchains are taking over the turf and will soon override banks. He said: \nOne of my greatest nightmares is that I may wake up one morning and the bank says I have no money. How would I prove that I do? So I think Bitcoin and Blockchain and Ethereum are exciting new technologies The Math is Quite Simple \nBut how is Yusko so sure that Bitcoin will crank it all the way up to $400,000? He credits it all in the simple fact behind Bitcoin\u2019s gold equivalence. \nTake twenty million Bitcoin totals, if today\u2019s gold is eight trillion, it will give you $400,000. And this goes without including any used cases like an exchange of currency. \nBetter yet, because the world\u2019s total amount of gold can fill two Olympic swimming pools (even though Forbes says it\u2019s 3.27 pools) shows just how great the numbers can be when it comes to gold. The expanding influence of Bitcoin continues to rise, especially when compared to gold. Currently, Bitcoin is 11 times more valuable than gold when comparing a single coin to an ounce of gold. Making the case for bitcoin $400,000 https://t.co/VIP5jMmdFn pic.twitter.com/LSlFh2fdjk \n\u2014 Bloomberg (@business) December 5, 2017 Banks Should Be Scared to Death \nYusko also states that Bitcoin\u2019s disruptive tech and its efficiency is something banks should be very wary of, since this is a real potential for eventually displacing the banks altogether. Apparently, things are going well for Bitcoin so far, which could be a sign that it is already gaining grounds in that particular market. \nThe digital currency has had a wild ride this year. Bitcoin was worth $600 in December last year, but the last few months have been insane as the cryptocurrency kept going higher and higher. As coinmarketcap shows today, Bitcoin has soared to a market cap of $251,264,422,255 as the price per bitcoin reached over $15,000. \nDo you think banks should be scared of Bitcoin? If so, will they fight back? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below. \nImage courtesy of Coinmarketcap, Twitter/Bloomberg, and Bitcoinist archives.

Cathey Taipei Business Traveller , Taipei \nWhether new to traveling or is out for a business trip, tourists are quite excited to visit a new country and fly business class. Then you can have a Mercedes Benz waiting for you to pick you up. You stay in a 5-star hotel, and dine the full course of a chosen restaurant, and so on. \nHowever today, you can travel various Asian cities on a slightly tight budget. You just need to travel with restriction and lengthy guidelines to follow. To begin your tour, choose Taipei as your first stop for the business travel destination. Searching for a Hotel \nIt\u2019s a wise idea to do your homework before you board a plane for Taipei . It\u2019s good to be prepared when you travel down to this city. However, there is no room for worries when communicating with its people as they are highly proficient in English. Just converse with them, and they can help find around this city. \nHotels to stay in this city can vary from the most expensive to those on a budget. You just need to check a customer website that directs you to magnificent hotels in the city. Perhaps the hotel you are staying can be near the MRT station. This will be a lot easier to provide you with transport to get to places near and within the city. You want things done smoothly and conveniently. \nWorking in a big prestigious company can have you booked in 5-star hotels like the Taipei Sheraton Hotel, Sherwood Hotel, the Grand Hyatt, Shangri-La Taipei, Taipei Formosa Hotel and more. This can have your dollars spent per night. Certainly, there are also those for small corporates. Their prices are average and will just fit your small budget. Access and Transportation \nIt can\u2019t be a good idea to have your hotel pick you up from the airport. This can cost you exuberant dollars than having the option to ride a taxi. If you aren\u2019t in a hurry, why not try the shuttle bus which is 10% less than taxis. This can also take you to familiar places in and around Taipei . If this is your first time to travel and you aren\u2019t familiar with the city, you can always ask the driver to drop you off to your desired destination. \nAlso, having booked a hotel near the MRT station can save you a lot of money for transportation fees. If you want to go places, you just need to step out of your hotel and head on to the MRT station. Just get a ticket from the subway counter and ensure you have specified your destination. Personal or Business Dining \nSurely dining or eating out is your next concern when traveling on a business trip. Here, you will be dining with your clients or business partners at a local restaurant to discuss and do business. Taipei offers many wonderful restaurants around the city. For instance, you may want to try the Shilin night market food.

In May, Eliud Kipchoge, the Kenyan marathon runner, periodically grinned through the final miles of his fastest-ever marathon, which he completed in 2 hours 25 seconds; afterward, he said that he had hoped that the smiling would ease him to the finish line. But there has been little solid scientific evidence to support this idea. Several past studies have examined whether deliberately smiling can alter how people feel psychologically during races, but few have looked at the physiological impact on sports performance.\nFor a new study published in September in Psychology of Sport and Exercise , researchers from Ulster University in Northern Ireland and Swansea University in Wales decided to gather a group of experienced recreational runners and have them alternately grin and grimace as they ran. The 24 volunteers, men and women, were not aware of the study\u2019s purpose: They were told that the experiment would look at a variety of factors related to \u201crunning economy,\u201d a measure of how much oxygen you use to stride at a given speed.\nFirst, the researchers tested the volunteers\u2019 usual running economy by having them don a facial mask to measure their respiration and then run on a treadmill until they were exhausted. As they ran, the scientists asked them to rate how they felt and describe what strategies they were using to keep going, such as ignoring their bodies\u2019 discomfort or tuning in to it.\nThen, on a separate lab visit, each volunteer completed a series of four six-minute runs, during which they were assigned four approaches: to smile continuously but sincerely, to frown, to relax their upper body by imagining they gently held a potato chip between loose fingers or, as a control, to use their normal get-me-through-this-run mental techniques.\nThere were variations in the results. A few runners were most economical when they frowned; the researchers speculate that their grimaces, like ferocious \u201cgame faces,\u201d increased their determination to outdo their normal performance. But the runners turned out to be most economical when they smiled. As a group, their economy then was as much as 2.78 percent more efficient than during the other runs, a meaningful difference in competitions. Smiling probably aided economy by prompting a \u201creduction in muscular tension,\u201d says Noel Brick, a lecturer in sport and exercise psychology at Ulster University, who led the study.\nMany of the runners found it difficult to smile throughout the six-minute session, though: Their grins became increasingly fixed and unnatural. Such false smiles activate fewer facial muscles than the sincere version, Brick said, and most likely result in less relaxation and performance enhancements. So the key to using a happy smile to make you a better runner, he says, may be to grin sincerely and often near a race\u2019s end, but in 30-second bursts, rather than continuously. \u201cThis is what Eliud Kipchoge seems to do,\u201d Brick said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2015/02/10/mag-pullquote-redesign/assets/style.css", "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1469029217303461", "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2015/02/10/mag-pullquote-redesign/assets/", "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2015/02/10/mag-pullquote-redesign/b585ac490ed3103c57423bc4f581ffac30ebc5df/", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/10/magazine/10mag-well/10mag-10well-t_CA0-superJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/10/magazine/10mag-well/10mag-10well-t_CA0-master768.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2015/02/10/mag-pullquote-redesign/assets/build.js"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ping zhu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eliud kipchoge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noel brick", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "swansea university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ulster university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:34.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db5ee107f5a2a50dab70952bad090698d5d70804", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KmpmsyknoVauEgLVdh3BC.emfxB3ymfezvz1Q2Lvgwp4uS7ar9X6WDJ53vCFZbzfKiFppDAlGAcTRG8Kq5RhyithAmmOW5T88os613SyyZDZ1ZUyPzVAa_MZY7mlsbPnT1YT6ctYJiYUIGqN1JtTN", "site_full": "www.cbsnews.com", "site": "cbsnews.com", "site_section": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbsnewscom-blogs-page/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CBSNews.com Blogs Page - CBS News", "title": "Donald Trump Jr. would not tell investigators about conversations with father, lawmaker says", "title_full": "Donald Trump Jr. would not tell investigators about conversations with father, lawmaker says - CBS News", "published": "2017-12-07T07:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 99, "participants_count": 34, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2017/05/19/5e4a6964-7adc-4938-878c-72da11cad1c8/ap-17137348512985.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 584, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4f35bc3cc7b7807a3a0a7f2d2347d8b346d3c44f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KmpmsyknoVauEgLVdh3BC.emfxB3ymfezvz1Q2Lvgwp4uS7ar9X6WDJ53vCFZbzfKiFppDAlGAcTRG8Kq5RhyithAmmOW5T88os613SyyZDZ1ZUyPzVAa_MZY7mlsbPnT1YT6ctYJiYvq69kWqbaRZ_TPTz4Q5ic-", "ord_in_thread": 44, "author": "Don Ikesenhouer", "published": "2017-12-07T09:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "So in other words, you delusional tRump cultists believe that Fuhrer tRump is above the law, like an authoritative and fascist dictator.

Carbon fiber is crucial to both the development of many current products, from golf clubs to jackets, and has the potential to be a crucial material in mankind\u2019s quest to become interplanetary. With a history that starts with its use as a filament in Thomas Edison\u2019s light bulbs, carbon fiber has been \u201ccutting edge\u201d since the 1870s. But it\u2019s not just hype; the way carbon fiber has been used has changed throughout the decades, giving it a fresh appeal. Various developments in production from companies like Houston\u2019s Union Carbide and Japan\u2019s Toray Industries have changed the way carbon fiber was built and used in day-to-day products. This rundown from Real Engineering gives a great overview of the past, and future, of this fantastic material: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKpDyfJnxQQ Throughout the years, good press has helped keep carbon fiber in the spotlight. In 1972, American golfer Gay Brewer won the first annual Taiheiyo Club Masters in Japan, and his win was widely credited to his use of golf clubs made out of carbon fiber shafts, sparking a rush on similar products. Carbon fiber was viewed suspiciously by some in Formula 1 racing as being too weak to withstand a crash, but a 1981 accident where a driver walked in a carbon-fiber car walked away showed the world that the material could take a hit. Last year, SpaceX announced that it had developed a 40-foot carbon tank crucial to its efforts in getting to Mars. But the material is also tricky, as evidenced by how a carbon fiber liner played into SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 explosion. The material\u2019s wide variety of uses through the centuries has come from the basic idea of information sharing. Hopefully, as more is learned about SpaceX has done right and wrong with carbon fiber, the next generation will be even stronger. . \n.

Am I right? This easy Shrimp & Sausage Skillet fits the bill perfectly. It\u2019s an all-in-one skillet meal that comes together in minutes and pleases the whole family. In partnership with al fresco\u00ae. \nRemember when you were a kid and the holidays were filled simply with excitement and wonder? It never occurred to you to feel anything else, because they were just such fun and happy times. School was out, snow was on the ground, friends and family were dropping by, and the twinkling lights were everywhere, filling you with joy. But your parents didn\u2019t quite seem to feel the same way. They were stressed, they were tired, they were constantly running errands and writing cards and wrapping gifts and sending packages. They just didn\u2019t seem to enjoy the lead up to the holidays at all and you wondered how it could possibly be that stressful. \nAnd then you became a parent yourself, with a full time job and myriad other responsibilities, and it all just clicked. Oh! That lead up time isn\u2019t all about excitement and wonder. You still love the holidays and everything they represent, but you have SO much to do. And it isn\u2019t even about the gifts or the shopping, because you know that\u2019s not really the point. But it\u2019s about all the little things you have to do on top of the big things you already do on a daily basis. Because what you want most for your kids is for them to have all the wonder and excitement, untarnished and beautiful, just as you had it when you were little. So you come to realize that yes it\u2019s stressful, but it\u2019s so worth it. \nBut any tips that make is less stressful are surely welcome. Like easy low carb dinner recipes. You have enough cooking and baking ahead of you as the holidays approach, so why make it more stressful by cooking complicated dinners each evening? What you need is a recipe that you can just chop everything up, throw it in a pan and a few minutes later, dinner is done. And that\u2019s exactly the sort of recipe this Easy Keto Shrimp & Sausage Skillet is. Prep work is simple and thanks to al fresco\u00ae fully cooked chicken sausage , cook time is minimal. And the best part is that it\u2019s a recipe that appeals to every palate\u2026at least in my house. \nI created this recipe a few weeks ago when I was exactly in that stressful moment between work and dinner time, when I had a lot on my plate. I didn\u2019t have much on hand but I had some fresh shrimp, some green beans, a red pepper, and a package of al fresco\u00ae Roasted Red Pepper and Asiago sausage. Sounded pretty good to me so I simply sauteed the whole thing and dinner was done. I called it \u201cAll In One Skillet Dinner\u201d. \nDid you know that I am actually writing a book on Easy Keto Dinners? Or perhaps I should say I \u201cwrote\u201d a book, because I just turned in the full manuscript a few days ago (and it\u2019s already available on Amazon for pre-order!). I\u2019ve become pretty good at this easy dinner recipe thang\u2026and one of my tricks, which I actually mention in the book, is using full cooked sausage like al fresco\u00ae.

November after continuous growth since the beginning of this year, due to the increase in the interbank rate ROBOR and the exchange rate volatility, according to data released by local real estate portal Imobiliare.ro.\nHowever, apartment prices continued to increase at national level. They rose by 0.7% to EUR 1,171 per sqm at the end of November compared to an average price of EUR 1,163 per sqm at the end of October. The price was pulled up by the evolution in smaller cities.\nIn Bucharest, the average apartment price dropped by 0.2% from EUR 1,274 in October to EUR 1,271 in November.\nBrasov became the sixth city in Romania, where the average apartment price exceeded EUR 1,000 per sqm. The other cities where the price has surpassed this threshold are Bucharest, Cluj, Timisoara, Constanta and Craiova.\n[email protected]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.googletagservices.com/tag/js/gpt.js"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "romania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bucharest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iasi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cluj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "timisoara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craiova", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "constanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brasov", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:35.070+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db5ee107f5a2a50dab70952bad090698d5d70804", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KmpmsyknoVauEgLVdh3BC.emfxB3ymfezvz1Q2Lvgwp4uS7ar9X6WDJ53vCFZbzfKiFppDAlGAcTRG8Kq5RhyithAmmOW5T88os613SyyZDZ1ZUyPzVAa_MZY7mlsbPnT1YT6ctYJiYUIGqN1JtTN", "site_full": "www.cbsnews.com", "site": "cbsnews.com", "site_section": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbsnewscom-blogs-page/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CBSNews.com Blogs Page - CBS News", "title": "Donald Trump Jr. would not tell investigators about conversations with father, lawmaker says", "title_full": "Donald Trump Jr. would not tell investigators about conversations with father, lawmaker says - CBS News", "published": "2017-12-07T07:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 99, "participants_count": 34, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2017/05/19/5e4a6964-7adc-4938-878c-72da11cad1c8/ap-17137348512985.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 584, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "da11d0c9f4bff1311f7c22ee51e8f1101bf8ffab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KmpmsyknoVauEgLVdh3BC.emfxB3ymfezvz1Q2Lvgwp4uS7ar9X6WDJ53vCFZbzfKiFppDAlGAcTRG8Kq5RhyithAmmOW5T88os613SyyZDZ1ZUyPzVAa_MZY7mlsbPnT1YT6ctYJiYvq69kWqbaR4rGQmZ2AKYQ-", "ord_in_thread": 47, "author": "sane_commenter", "published": "2017-12-07T10:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "If they were before he was pres. then there's also this thing called the fifth amendment, look it up.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:35.082+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0fbfc714c3e0866f5bfca0ceab2bfe6bae5842e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXXxozQtug3wQaQTUpcrJnXWgsBkBnk3Tr_Ery.p9Y5ZDwvu4jb08YkJhaEehiywUf1DuWY.W3fJw--", "site_full": "naruto.wikia.com", "site": "wikia.com", "site_section": "http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Special:RecentChanges?feed=atom", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Narutopedia  - Recent changes [en]", "title": "File:Kakashi Subdues Boruto.png", "title_full": "File:Kakashi Subdues Boruto.png", "published": "2017-12-07T11:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/2/21/Kakashi_Subdues_Boruto.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/2000?cb=20171207092632", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 114, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0fbfc714c3e0866f5bfca0ceab2bfe6bae5842e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXXxozQtug3wQaQTUpcrJnXWgsBkBnk3Tr_Ery.p9Y5ZDwvu4jb08YkJhaEehiywUf1DuWY.W3fJw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sarutobii2", "published": "2017-12-07T11:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "File:Kakashi Subdues Boruto.png", "text": "Boruto: Naruto Next Generations written by Uky\u014d Kodachi and illustrated by Mikio Ikemoto Licensing \nThis is a screenshot of a television program, and is protected by copyright and/or trademark.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with celebrating that! It\u2019s called progress! Even slow progress is progress. \nI can only hope that someday race won\u2019t have to be a \u201cthing\u201d in American politics or this great America. We\u2019re not there yet. Let\u2019s keep trying! \nSham Ostapko, Huntersville Jennifer Roberts still shifting blame \nIn response to \u201cQ&A with ex-mayor Jennifer Roberts\u201d (Dec. 5): \nNo matter how Mayor Jennifer Roberts spins her tenure, the voters in her own party voted her out of office. In two recent interviews she casts about a lot of blame for her shortcomings. Just another reason to affirm her one-term status is good for Charlotte. I do wish her the best. \nDale Williams, Boone Wedding cake isn\u2019t about discrimination \nWhen I was growing up, we had signs in restaurants like, \u201cNo shoes, no shirt, no service,\u201d and, \u201cWe reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.\u201d \nBusiness owners should be able to determine who they want to serve, for whatever reason. Let them decide if they want to lose business. \nIn the wedding cake case, the business is not refusing a certain population (LGBT). They are refusing to contribute to something they don\u2019t believe in, religiously or otherwise. \nJames F. Hall, Charlotte America should still care about the world \nIt is precisely in times such as these, when people feel divided and angered, that we cannot forget the moral obligation we have to people across the world who see us as representing humanitarian ideals. We cannot be content to boast about recaptured greatness when at the same time letting go of our responsibility. \n\u201cYour huddled masses, yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door.\u201d Unless this door is gilded, I urge Senators Richard Burr and Thom Tillis, as well as Rep. Robert Pittenger to protect funding for the International Affairs Budget, a fund that can save millions of lives both domestically and abroad. \nSam Bramlett, Charlotte Herb Riley CATS, find funding from businesses \nIn response to \u201cCities must find own ways to fund programs like public transit, expert says\u201d(Dec. 6): \nI could not agree more with the rationale put forth by Mr. Bruce Katz of the Brookings Institute. If the Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS) wants to move forward with the much needed expansion of light rail in one initiative to cover three new major routes, partner with the Charlotte business community for the initiative. Expecting subsidized funds from either the U.S. DOT or the State at anytime in the foreseeable future is not realistic. \nCharlotte businesses need to partner and support the light rail transit initiatives of CATS. This is good for the entire greater Charlotte metropolitan area. \nHerb Riley, Matthews GOP can do better than Roy Moore \nI find President Trump\u2019s endorsement and the financial support of the RNC for U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama to be disturbing. I uphold this nation\u2019s principal of innocent until proven guilty, but endorsing an individual accused of coming onto multiple teenage girls, now women, is a disgrace to the Republican Party. \nIf Roy Moore is the best Republican candidate available, look again! What about candidates that have led their entire life supporting the needs of Alabama\u2019s citizens and are Republicans? Surely they would be better candidates. We need principled persons with integrity in Washington, D.C., to represent us. \nZachary Schaut, Charlotte The GOP has earned a new slogan \nThe GOP (the party of family values) supports the rights of the unborn, but when that child becomes a teenager and is sexually assaulted by someone like Roy Moore, that\u2019s OK because after all \u2013 it is party over morality. \nI have a slogan the GOP might want to use for future elections: \u201cIt\u2019s OK to prey as long as you pray.\u201d \nDot Meixler, Huntersville", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "huntersville jennifer roberts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thom tillis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meixler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill peterson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zachary schaut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bruce katz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer roberts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james f. hall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert pittenger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam bramlett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herb riley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dale williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard burr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sham ostapko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte herb riley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "matthews gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international affairs budget", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rnc for u.s. senate", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huntersville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:36.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db5ee107f5a2a50dab70952bad090698d5d70804", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KmpmsyknoVauEgLVdh3BC.emfxB3ymfezvz1Q2Lvgwp4uS7ar9X6WDJ53vCFZbzfKiFppDAlGAcTRG8Kq5RhyithAmmOW5T88os613SyyZDZ1ZUyPzVAa_MZY7mlsbPnT1YT6ctYJiYUIGqN1JtTN", "site_full": "www.cbsnews.com", "site": "cbsnews.com", "site_section": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbsnewscom-blogs-page/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CBSNews.com Blogs Page -

(Chitin is also the same organic material that makes up the exoskeleton of crustaceans and insects)\r\n-Unlike plants and animals, all fungi are non-vascular, meaning that any form of circulatory system (blood for animals, xylem/phloem for plants) is absent in all fungi.\r\n-Recent research states that fungi are more closely related to animals than any other kingdom\r\nFOUR GROUPS OF FUNGI:\r\nChytrids-most primitive fungi appeared 500million years ago\r\nZygomycetes-decomposes\r\nascomycetes- cup shapes featureing edible fungi, common exmaple is yeast.\r\nBasidiomycetes-also called \u201cclub Fungi\u201d, most fammiliar group of fungi and account for \u2153 of the world\u2019s fungi\r\n \r\nApplications (3-5): Kaiwen and Claire\r\n \r\n- production of enzymes, vitamins, pigments, lipids, glycolipids, polysaccharides and polyhydric alcohols: mycoproteins (plant growth promoters and disease suppressor)\r\n- genetic engineering: shuttle vectors (an organism, typically a biting insect or tick, that transmits a disease or parasite from one animal or plant to another) are used to create the desired gene\r\n- food: by itself (high protein and low calorific value), yeast (decomposes food to make it tasty), soy sauce and produces invertases, amylases and cellulases, which degrade the soy paste), cheese (assist ripening from the outside of the cheese, and they can impart flavours from inside the cheese), food colouring (Monoascus purpureus has been traditionally used for the production of red wine)\r\n- biodegradation of pesticides: White Rot fungi can potentially biodegrade toxic pesticides (like DDT, PCB and Lindane), toxic chemicals (like dioxin, benzopyrene, cyanides, azides, CCl4 and Pentachlorophenol (PCP)).\r\n-decomposers: fungi recycle nutrients (like nitrogen and carbon) by breaking down organic material. Plants rely on this - otherwise, the nutrients would remain 'locked away' forever.\r\n \r\nProblems Affecting It (as many as possible): Hammad and Jasmine\r\nMembers (3): Hammad and Jasmine\r\n- mushrooms are fungus. some mushrooms are toxic when injested.\r\n- fungi can live inside or outside plants and animals\r\n- this can cause diseases like Dutch Elm Disease or Athletes Foot\r\n- parasitic fungi feed on plants or animals\r\n- some harm environment by attacking trees\r\n- Bracket Fungi grows inside trees and then develops large shelf-like structures on the outside of the tree\r\n- Fungi can cause human disease in 3 ways: infection, allergic reaction and toxins\r\n-Infections don\u2019t occur in most healthy humans\r\n-people can be sensitive to molds\r\n- causing allergies, asthma and respiratory problems\r\n- more extreme reactions included fever and shortness of breath\r\n \r\n- wood decay destroys structures and creates safety hazards\r\n- fungi causes food spoilage\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Facts Applications Problems with these organisms 3 specific members\r\n\u2022 Very diverse;

For layer one, spread a small dollop onto a large cake stand, then place one donut in the center. Place five doughnuts around it, creating your first layer. Spoon about 3/4 cup whipped cream over the doughnuts, then repeat the process for your second layer- one doughnut in the center, five doughnuts around it, and 3/4 cup whipped cream on top. For layers three and four, place four doughnuts onto the cake, creating a pyramid of sorts. Again, add 3/4 cup whipped cream in between the layers. For layer 5, place 3 doughnuts in a triangle, then add 1/4 cup whipped cream, just in the center. For layer 6, place a single doughnut on top! To make the fudge sauce, heat the heavy cream in a small saucepan until scalding. Remove from heat and add in chocolate chips. Stir until combined.

The media\u2019s job is not to give \u201cequal\u201d coverage to the president or to any politician. Their job is to investigate, to learn the facts, to tell the truth. And until the president can be relied on to give consistently accurate information, not false information, it is the job of the press to call him out. And this should be the job of our faith leaders, as well. \nOur democracy depends on it. Our faith demands it! \nLouise Woods, Charlotte Pittenger, don\u2019t blur church and state \nIn response to \u201cPittenger puts Christ back ... into campaign ads\u201d (Nov. 28): \nIt is so cynical and sinister that Rep. Robert Pittenger, who is always railing against government intrusion into private matters, sees it as his responsibility as a U.S. Congressman to put Christ back into Christmas. The meaning of the life of the Jesus of Nazareth is only realized when his followers live out his ethical teachings in every part of their daily lives. \nTo maintain religious freedom it is critical that public office is never used to support an individual faith tradition. Mr. Pittenger\u2019s actions amount to a political stunt to curry favor of one religious voting block. \nSam Todd, Mint Hill Think before closing busy street \nIn response to \u201cBusy uptown intersection is closing for December\u201d (Dec.3): \nDear City of Charlotte, et al., \nPlease reverse the decision to close Stonewall from Brevard to Tryon. I understand the requirement to accommodate building contractors\u2019 needs to work on utility relocation, but how about doing this in January when traffic patterns lessen with the passing of the holidays. \nWith many holiday activities scheduled in December for companies and the community, this closure will negatively affect people visiting uptown during a short-sighted closure of a major uptown thoroughfare. Needless to say, it will cause a high level of frustration. \nFor once, let\u2019s put the interests of the tax-paying Charlotte citizens above that of major construction projects and contractors. Rescind the closure of Stonewall until January! \nGary Parks, Charlotte Why does it have to be a race thing? \nIn response to \u201cQ&A with ex-mayor Jennifer Roberts\u201d (Dec. 5): \nSteve Harrison\u2019s interview with Ex-Mayor Jennifer Roberts listed Vi Lyles as the city\u2019s first American-American female mayor. \nOf course he meant African-American. But why is there this distinction? Do we see distinctions of German-Americans? Irish-Americans? Italian-Americans? Russian-Americans? French-Americans? We are just Americans. Enough already! \nBill Peterson, Charlotte ABC was too lenient on Ross \nIn response to \u201cAfter staggering error, ABC gets it right\u201d (Dec. 5 Opinion): \nIn response to \u201cABC gets it right\u201d \u2013 I beg to differ. What Brian Ross did was to falsely present the \u201csmoking gun\u201d evidence that would invalidate the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. What punishment did Ross receive? A month off during Christmas and New Years holiday. We should all be so lucky. I\u2019ll wager a guess that each member of the editorial board of the Observer will be subject to at least one week off this month. What a grim fate. \nGreg Pamer, Harrisburg What I\u2019m \u2018thanking\u2019 Congress for \nWe should thank Sens. Tillis and Burr, and Rep. Pittenger, for offering Americans the chance to be free of tax deductions so that the mighty job creators may enjoy tax cuts. \nWho needs student loan forgiveness or affordable health insurance when they\u2019ve granted expectant parents tax-exempt college funds for their unborn fetuses? \nAnd what are environmental protection and civil rights, when Congress has locked in the security of corporate tax cuts while sun-setting individuals\u2019 paltry tax benefits? \nTruly, congressional Republicans have given America a gift.

I have to phrase it as such because 1994 did not have an ending and the Montreal Expos were running away with it. \nYear in and year out, the Braves could lose key players and not lose a beat. \nTerry Pendleton, Fred McGriff, Sid Bream, Ron Gant, Jeff Blauser, Otis Nixon, Ryan Klesko, Gary Sheffield\u2026 they all left town and new people filled in and the division was theirs. \nSteve Avery was an ace for a while. He left. Nobody blinked. Charlie Liebrandt was the steady veteran for the 1991 and 1992 pennant winners. So long. Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine were the Hall of Fame faces of the organization. Bye bye! We\u2019ve got Divisions to win! \nThen in 2006, the magic wore off. The team failed to make the playoffs. \nOn the surface, they looked like they had a good team. Young Brian McCann had a terrific season at catcher. Chipper Jones, Jeff Francoeur, Adam LaRoche and Andruw Jones all put up solid power numbers. Edgar Renteria had a bounce back season after a let down in Boston. Plus Matt Diaz and Wilson Betemit gave them a good bench. \nThe rotation, while not as great as they were in the mid 1990\u2019s, still had John Smoltz and Tim Hudson giving them over 200 solid innings each and a nice season from young Chuck James. In limited work, closer Bob Wickman posted a 1.04 ERA. \nSo what happened? \nHow did they finish with a losing record? A rough April gave way to a solid May. Going into June, they were fluctuating between 3 1/2 and 4 1/2 games of the Mets and the inevitable post season trip. \nThen they lost 21 of 27 games in June, finishing the month 12 games under .500. They were 13 1/2 games behind the Mets. They were 11 games out of the Wild Card and only lowly Washington kept them out of the basement of the NL East. \nFor July, August and September, the Braves played 45-36 ball, a .556 winning percentage. A full season at that pace would equal 90 wins. But their slow start put them at 79-83. \nWhat killed the Braves was a 19-33 record in one run games. Even a .500 record in those games would have added 7 wins to their final. An 86-76 record would have put them just 2 games behind the Dodgers for the final Wild Card spot. \nWho knows? \nWhat I DO know is this is a strange team picture. What the hell is that little wall in front of the team. Is it carpet? Is it sheet metal? Are they nude behind it? Was it added in? \nIt is bizarre. I do not recall a team picture, from Little League to the majors that does that. I could be wrong. \nFortunately, it is NOT a beloved Braves team so I doubt this picture is hanging in the garage of many Georgians.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sid bream", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ron gant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob wickman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt diaz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg maddux", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff blauser", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson betemit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim hudson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terry pendleton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan klesko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam laroche", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian mccann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuck james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff francoeur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred mcgriff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gary sheffield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bobby cox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "otis nixon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom glavine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john smoltz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andruw jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edgar renteria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve avery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie liebrandt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chipper jones", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "atlanta braves", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "topps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hall of fame", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montreal expos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "braves", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dodgers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "little league", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:36.094+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db5ee107f5a2a50dab70952bad090698d5d70804", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KmpmsyknoVauEgLVdh3BC.emfxB3ymfezvz1Q2Lvgwp4uS7ar9X6WDJ53vCFZbzfKiFppDAlGAcTRG8Kq5RhyithAmmOW5T88os613SyyZDZ1ZUyPzVAa_MZY7mlsbPnT1YT6ctYJiYUIGqN1JtTN", "site_full": "www.cbsnews.com", "site": "cbsnews.com", "site_section": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbsnewscom-blogs-page/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CBSNews.com Blogs Page -

There are a bunch of things that you need to consider before you make your final decision. Of course, you can change your domain at a later point if you need to but that can be a big hassle to do and can naturally be bad for your brand, business and search engine rankings. \nSo, what are some of the things you should keep in mind when making this choice? Go for an original extension \nA .com extension (or .co.uk if you\u2019re UK based) is the most memorable extension and the one most people will type in automatically. There are many fun ones that might suit your business category but if your clients or readers don\u2019t remember it, then it\u2019s not a good choice! Keep it short & simple \nShorter domain names are easier to remember so keep it shortand also make an effort to keep it simple. Your domain name prone needs to be easy to pronounce and spell. Avoid anything that has different spellings and words that are to typos. Avoid hyphens too as these can easily be forgotten when typing an address. Keywords matter \nIf you can, use a keyword in your domain. A short and simple domain name that really lets you know what the website is about, like Casino.com , is very useful when it comes to search engine rankings. Reason being that anyone searching for anything casino will easily get to the site. The same is the case with freelancer.com and many other sites. Think about the future \nChoose a name that works well with the industry that you\u2019re in but also think about how this name will work in the future. If you want to blog as a new mum, you might be tempted to have the word baby in your domain but your blog will probably not be baby related forever as babies grow up and then your blog content will most likely change too. You should go for a domain name that leaves the niche open such as amumreviews.co.uk and techxmaster.com . Do your research \nResearch your possible domain ideas to ensure the names are not already in use or too similar to ones that are already established. You don\u2019t want to accidentally copy anybody else or worse, use a trademarked name. \nSponsored Post.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "sponsored post", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:37.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b7eb27921b848d8e2d5b580af10c0c6dfd955df5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_O.Knfw.YDvY99G1Iu6YzX.QQAFpWcr25xCcWhEwOEWPQV5LOhcxjvMLi9Olh3tt9Bznk.gu0KFB_vXebWsWzjVhQBbBn1RWw-", "site_full": "www.cbc.ca", "site": "cbc.ca", "site_section": "http://rss.cbc.ca/lineup/canada-manitoba.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Families with teen drivers may pay more as MPI ordered to study primary-driver registration", "title_full": "Families with teen drivers may pay more as MPI ordered to study primary-driver registration", "published": "2017-12-07T02:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4032353.1490015664!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/crash-at-mcphillips-street-and-mountain-avenue.JPG", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1123, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 12, "comments": 0, "shares": 12}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 55}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b7eb27921b848d8e2d5b580af10c0c6dfd955df5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_O.Knfw.YDvY99G1Iu6YzX.QQAFpWcr25xCcWhEwOEWPQV5LOhcxjvMLi9Olh3tt9Bznk.gu0KFB_vXebWsWzjVhQBbBn1RWw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cbc", "published": "2017-12-07T02:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Families with teen drivers may pay more as MPI ordered to study primary-driver registration", "text": "Manitoba's Public Utilities Board wants to see a change to vehicle registration it says will make insurance rates fairer and bring the province in line with others, but which will cost higher-risk drivers more.\nIn an order to Manitoba Public Insurance presented on Monday, the board told MPI to complete study options for a new system requiring that vehicles be registered under their primary driver.\nREAD THE ORDER: Manitoba Public Insurance general rate application Current rules allow Manitoba families to register vehicles under the name of the member with the most merits on their driver's licence \u2014 even if that's not the vehicle's main driver \u2014 which can save families on insurance rates.\nDarren Christle, executive director of the Public Utilities Board, said \"performance-based rates\" are already the norm in every province except Manitoba.\n\"What you're doing is incentivizing safe driving behaviour, so those that are deemed to be higher-risk would actually pay more than those who are driving safely and prudently,\" he said.\nThose \"higher-risk\" drivers could include those with demerits because of accidents, or teen drivers who haven't yet amassed merits on their licence.\n2.6% rate hike approved The board gave MPI a year to complete the technical conference and report back, and said the new system should be implemented by 2021. In the same order, the board approved an overall general rate hike of 2.6 per cent, effective March 1 .\nPublic Utilities Board approves MPI hikes, and wants more jurisdiction A spokesperson for MPI told CBC News the Crown corporation will comply with the directive and couldn't provide further detail at this time.\nChristle couldn't say how much extra revenue the change would generate for MPI or how it would impact families with teenage drivers using vehicles registered in their parents' names. He said initial evidence suggests a \"significant number\" of Manitoba families register vehicles to the driver with the best record, but couldn't say what proportion.\n\"It is different than what Manitobans are used to today,\" Chrstle said.\nHe said the technical conference will give MPI the chance to get better information on those questions, as well as how the change could be implemented.\n\"[The study is] so that we can get good evidence in front of the panel to make a rates decision outside of the hearing process, and that should make us more efficient and give better information to establishing a just and reasonable rate.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.pubmanitoba.ca/v1/proceedings-decisions/orders/pubs/2017%20orders/130-17.pdf"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chrstle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darren christle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christle", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mpi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "public utilities board", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "manitoba public insurance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbc news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "manitoba", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:37.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cffeebbcfffa8cf6fb581c8836aa25bca426c9ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPtjoebeD9uDXB98IhWwPjIZmrk0Q6D0sE0vZTf8vtLuWgLTMYmGC1UPccgPcigkQ7.aAZn_tOokaMpe7lv9GcRkuNzsZGMtz.zg8v9mbKZM4kQwzZowR9qqIX8.eFCd4oZEDvdu5dKo3f5RWoDO.9lzMSrLbCtwa8LJ48lTIwGA--", "site_full": "www.northamericanmotoring.com", "site": "northamericanmotoring.com", "site_section": "https://www.northamericanmotoring.com/forums/2nd-generation-minis-184/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "2nd Generation MINIs - North American Motoring", "title": "Rebuilt head.

I personally think it's a bad O2 sensor but the codes don't make sense. Its a 2007 R56 N14 with 115,000 miles. Its going about 2,000 miles since the rebuild.

A meta-analysis", "text": "Abstract Introduction Linburg\u2013Comstock variation often connecting the flexor pollicis longus and flexor digitorum profundus of the index finger at a different level with significant discrepancy between clinical and cadaveric frequencies reported in the literature. Although this variation is quite prevalent, it is yet frequently unrecognized. The aim of this meta-analysis is to generate more accurate weighted frequency values of the Linburg\u2013Comstock variation and to look for possible association with ethnicity, laterality, gender and side.\nMethods A systematic literature search identified 14 studies, including 4132 forearms/hands, which met the inclusion criteria.\nResults While no significant difference was found for laterality, we found significantly higher Linburg\u2013Comstock variation rate in females compared to males. Turkish population demonstrated a significantly higher crude frequency when compared to Europeans (22.2 vs. 15.2%). Hispanic population showed the highest crude frequency (34.5%), whereas the African ancestry showed the least one (8.8%).\nConclusions Linburg\u2013Comstock variation could cause career-threatening disabilities and could complicate some hand injuries as well. This review invites future researchers to use a single nomenclature; the term \"Linburg\u2013Comstock variation\" is to be used when no symptoms are present, and the term \"Linburg\u2013Comstock syndrome\" in cases where the variation is symptomatic.\n\n\nfrom #ORL-AlexandrosSfakianakis via ola Kala on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2B9h7dO", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "ola kala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linburg", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:37.056+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db5ee107f5a2a50dab70952bad090698d5d70804", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KmpmsyknoVauEgLVdh3BC.emfxB3ymfezvz1Q2Lvgwp4uS7ar9X6WDJ53vCFZbzfKiFppDAlGAcTRG8Kq5RhyithAmmOW5T88os613SyyZDZ1ZUyPzVAa_MZY7mlsbPnT1YT6ctYJiYUIGqN1JtTN", "site_full": "www.cbsnews.com", "site": "cbsnews.com", "site_section": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbsnewscom-blogs-page/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CBSNews.com Blogs Page - CBS News", "title": "Donald Trump Jr. would not tell investigators about conversations with father, lawmaker says", "title_full": "Donald Trump Jr. would not tell investigators about conversations with father, lawmaker says - CBS News", "published": "2017-12-07T07:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 99, "participants_count": 34, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2017/05/19/5e4a6964-7adc-4938-878c-72da11cad1c8/ap-17137348512985.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 584, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c1b11b5bc106cf02b834f4f155ea19c280be6c4b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KmpmsyknoVauEgLVdh3BC.emfxB3ymfezvz1Q2Lvgwp4uS7ar9X6WDJ53vCFZbzfKiFppDAlGAcTRG8Kq5RhyithAmmOW5T88os613SyyZDZ1ZUyPzVAa_MZY7mlsbPnT1YT6ctYJiYvq69kWqbaRaLKal7SJIas-", "ord_in_thread": 59, "author": "Don Ikesenhouer", "published": "2017-12-07T10:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "You're an idiot behind an anonymous internet keyboard making false and ridiculous statements!

Futuresource Consulting says Google\u2019s Chrome OS is currently the leading choice for powering what it calls mobile PCs, which include laptops, netbooks, tablets, and Chromebooks, in schools in the United States. No less than 59.8% of these devices were powered by Chrome OS in the third quarter of 2017, up from 57.8% in Q2, while Microsoft\u2019s Windows was the runner-up with 22.3%, again an increase from 18.4%. In the rest of the world, however, there\u2019s also a huge gap between the first two places, but this time in favor of Microsoft. Windows is leading the pack with 66.5%, up from 57.1%, while Android is the second choice with 14.4%, down from 24.4%. In this case, Chrome is far behind with just 7.7%. Apple far behind but improving Long-time Microsoft rival Apple is losing ground in both the US and in the rest of the world. In the US, for instance, Apple\u2019s iOS fell from 18.4% to 12.3%, while macOS pretty much stagnated \u2013 4.8% in Q2 versus 4.7% in Q3. Only 6.1% of the devices used in schools in the rest of the world were powered by iOS, Futuresource says, while macOS has less than 1% share. Microsoft appears to be the company that keeps improving in all markets, mostly as a result of the investments the company has made into products specifically tailored for the education sector. In addition to devices like the Surface Laptop, Microsoft also launched Windows 10 S, a special version of its desktop operating system that\u2019s limited to apps in the Windows Store. Microsoft says this restriction makes it a better choice for educators, though options to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro are also available. \u201cMicrosoft has made huge strides in developing its education ecosystem offering in the past year, with major announcements on both the devices and platform side. Q3 2017 was the first time we saw and heard about a slight shifting of the competitive scenario in the US, with many OEMs and major channel players reporting faster growth (and expected growth) on Windows than Chrome based devices,\u201d Mike Fisher, Associate Director at Futuresource Consulting, says. \u201cThe challenge now for Microsoft will be how to accelerate this trend in 2018. The majority of market demand is expected to be replacement demand; convincing existing Chrome users to completely change the existing ecosystem will likely not be easy due to the time and cost involved.\u201d All three companies are expected to continue investments in education, and Futuresource says that 2017 itself will generate a growth of 9%, down from 19% the year before.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chromebooks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "futuresource", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike fisher", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "surface laptop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "futuresource consulting", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:38.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db5ee107f5a2a50dab70952bad090698d5d70804", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KmpmsyknoVauEgLVdh3BC.emfxB3ymfezvz1Q2Lvgwp4uS7ar9X6WDJ53vCFZbzfKiFppDAlGAcTRG8Kq5RhyithAmmOW5T88os613SyyZDZ1ZUyPzVAa_MZY7mlsbPnT1YT6ctYJiYUIGqN1JtTN", "site_full": "www.cbsnews.com", "site": "cbsnews.com", "site_section": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbsnewscom-blogs-page/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CBSNews.com Blogs Page -
