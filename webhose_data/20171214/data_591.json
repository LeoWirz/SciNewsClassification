Reds are the first club to limit access since deal with streaming giants was announced. By Duncan Wright 7th December 2017, 8:56 am MANCHESTER UNITED have barred rivals Manchester City from filming their fly-on-the-wall Amazon documentary inside Old Trafford. \nCity made a formal request to allow their camera crew into the away dressing room and the tunnel at this weekend\u2019s eagerly anticipated derby clash. Reuters 4 Jose Mourinho is looking to beat Manchester City to re-open the Premier League title race \nBut United fired an early shot across the bows of their neighbours by refusing the crew access to the inner sanctum of their stadium. \nPremier League leaders City have agreed a \u00a310million deal with internet streaming giants Amazon for the behind the scenes programme. \nCamera crews are following Pep Guardiola\u2019s squad all season to produce a series to be screened next summer showing never-before-seen areas of a top flight club. \nBut United want no part to play in the programme, and have become the first top flight club to refuse City\u2019s request for access-all-areas passes for the crew. REUTERS A camera crew is filming behind the scenes as Pep Guardiola attempts to lead City to the title Sunday Premier League preview including Liverpool v Everton and Manchester United v Manchester City \nInstead they have told their rivals the Amazon team can only have one camera pitchside to film the leaders warming up for the match. \nOfficially, United have claimed their is simply not enough space to accomodate the extra team for the documentary. TATTOO GOOD Meet the tattoo artist for the top PL stars including Hazard and Mourinho \nThe away dressing room at Old Trafford is not the biggest, and is situated down a fairly narrow corridor that is busy on matchdays. \nBut the tunnel at the ground is one of the biggest in the division, yet United have ruled they do not want City\u2019s production team in such a resutricted area.

PA:Empics Sport 4 Broadcasters Sky Sports and BT Sport are uncomfortable with the City deal with Amazon \nBoth channels forked out a fortune to secure exclusive rights to screen Premier League football, and are uncomfortable with the access City have given a rival. \nThe series can only be screened in the close season because any other time would contravene the deals in place with the television giants. \nAnd United, always sensitive to protecting and maximising their own commericla interests, have given City as little as possible help.

If you sent this transaction and know you did not double spend, then its probably just a false positive from the software, and you have nothing to worry about. \nIf you are the receiver of this transaction, do not release whatever goods/services you are trading the btc for until after this transaction has enough confirmations.

14th November 1896 the \u2018Locomotive on Highways Act\u2019 was passed by the British Government. By relaxing the speed limit on the highways and byways, this allowed the new fangled automobiles to no longer be required to have a man with a red flag walk in front of them. On that day to celebrate, automobilists were invited to drive their machines from London to Brighton, it would become known as the Emancipation Run (still run today on the first Sunday in November for owners of pre 1905 vehicles). One year on and still celebrating their new found freedoms it was decided to gather some 45 automobiles, including several motor tricycles, and travel from London to Sheen House in Richmond. Tricycle and cycle racing was very popular at the time and Sheen House had it\u2019s own concrete oval track, ideal for the motor tricycles to race round and become the first official race of the internal combustion powered vehicles in Great Britain. Dressed and ready \nSeveral years later in 1907, Hugh Fortesque Locke-King constructed, at his own expense, a 2.75 mile banked concrete circuit in Weybridge, Surrey. Brooklands as it is known, was the world\u2019s first purpose built motor racing track. Many Land Speed records were set and sadly lives lost at incredible speeds up to the outbreak of war in 1939. The circuit was considered more useful to aviation and was quickly consumed by the aircraft industry. Much of the outer banking fell into disrepair and became engulfed by suburbia, racing never returned. However the central buildings escaped development and stands today as a museum and reminder of those great days. Within the last year, at vast expense, the original \u2018Back Straight\u2019 with a Start/Finish line and scoreboard has been re-instated; it is here (with Sheen House long demolished) 120 years on, that the De Dion Bouton Club GB will recreate those first races. \nHaving announced an \u2018Afternoon of Racing\u2019 for the 29th November 2017, the club mustered 20 motor tricycles all manufactured between 1898 and 1901 and produced by such manufacturers as De Dion, Rochet, Marot Gardon, M.M.C., Clement, Phebus, Corre, Dechamps and Automoto. With three races on the card, the riders all in period costume mounted their veteran machinery and either pushed or pedaled them into life. The sight and sound of those little engines powering around the oval was something to behold. Cornering a motor tricycle at speed requires a certain amount of skill and nerve. A level of fitness helps as well, pedaling assists acceleration out of corners and with the last race covering 5 miles (30 laps), and with some of the riders let us say, in their later years, medics were on hand. \nThe race begins \nAt the end of the day exhausted riders shook hands and there were mutterings of this becoming an annual event. The staff and volunteers at Brooklands beamed having seen the first massed start race there in 78 years.
