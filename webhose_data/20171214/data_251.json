The IOC, however, plans to invite individual Russians to compete under the Olympic flag.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \n\"Without any doubt we will not declare any kind of blockade,\" Putin said in televised remarks after launching his re-election campaign at an automobile factory. \"We will not block our Olympians from taking part, if any of them wish to take part as individuals. \n\"They have been preparing for these competitions for their whole careers, and for them it's very important.\" \nA Russian boycott would have been the biggest at any Olympics since the Soviet Union and its allies missed the 1984 Los Angeles Games. That itself was in response to the U.S.-led boycott of the Moscow Olympics four years earlier. \nPutin also said Russia still did not accept accusations that it ran a state-backed doping system around the Sochi Olympics. He called the IOC ruling \"politically motivated\" and unfair \"collective punishment.\" \nPRO FOOTBALL \nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Roger Goodell has signed a five-year contract extension to remain commissioner of the NFL through 2024. \nA memo from the NFL's compensation committee to team owners and obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press confirms that Goodell and committee chairman Arthur Blank, owner of the Atlanta Falcons, have signed the extension. \nThat extension has been a source of controversy because Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones objected to the process. \nAll 32 owners approved in May the compensation committee's power to negotiate and sign a deal with Goodell, who replaced Paul Tagliabue in 2006. \nSince then, the league's total revenues have more than doubled to $14 billion. \nA person familiar with the contract told The Associated Press it is worth almost $200 million, with a base of $40 million. But the deal is incentive-laden, the person added, speaking on condition of anonymity because the contract numbers are not made public. \nHall of Fame quarterback Warren Moon has been accused of sexual harassment by an assistant for his sports marketing firm, according to a lawsuit filed in California. \nThe civil lawsuit was filed Monday in Orange County Superior Court. According to court documents, Wendy Haskell alleges Moon made \"unwanted and unsolicited\" sexual advances as part of her role as his assistant working for Sports 1 Marketing. Moon is the co-founder and president of the company. \nThe Washington Post first reported on the lawsuit Wednesday. The 61-year-old Moon has been working as a radio commentator for the Seattle Seahawks. The team announced later Wednesday that \"We have accepted Warren Moon's request for a leave of absence as the club's radio analyst.\" \nMoon played parts of 17 seasons in the NFL with Houston, Minnesota, Seattle and Kansas City. He threw for 49,325 yards and 291 touchdowns in the regular season and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2006. The former University of Washington star led Edmonton to five Canadian Football League titles before playing in the NFL. \nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier has been transferred from a Cincinnati hospital to Pittsburgh to continue treatment for a spinal injury suffered during Monday night's game against the Bengals. \nThe Steelers say Shazier will continue to undergo tests before offering an update on his status. \nShazier left Paul Brown Stadium on a stretcher less than four minutes into his team's 23-20 victory over Cincinnati following a tackle that left the 25-year-old writhing on the turf, his legs motionless. He underwent extensive testing at University of Cincinnati Medical Center under the care of neurosurgeons David Okonwko and Joseph Cheng. \nRICHMOND, Va. (AP) \u2014 A former University of Virginia and pro football player has been sentenced to 40 years for running a $10 million fraud scheme that victimized more than 50 investors. \nFederal prosecutors say in a news release that 37-year-old Merrill Robertson Jr. of Chesterfield was sentenced Wednesday. He was convicted in August on 15 offenses, including mail and wire fraud and money laundering. \nProsecutors say Robertson and a co-conspirator operated Cavalier Union Investments in Richmond. Authorities say Robertson targeted former coaches, donors, alumni and employees of schools he had attended. \nAccording to the documents, Robertson sold promissory notes that he claimed would pay an annual return of up to 20 percent. \nInstead, prosecutors charged, Robertson used the invested money for cars, vacations and a luxury suite at a football stadium. \nPRO BASKETBALL \nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Hornets coach Steve Clifford will be away from the team for an undetermined period of time to deal with a \"health issue.\" \nThe team made the announcement Wednesday in a release. \nThe 56-year-old Clifford missed Monday night's game against Orlando because he was not feeling well. Associate head coach Stephen Silas filled in for Clifford against the Magic. \nClifford has battled heart problems in the past, but a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press the issue was not a heart-related. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the team has not released details of Clifford's health issue. \nThe team said there is no timetable for Clifford's return and that officials would have no further comment. \nBASEBALL \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Giants general manager Bobby Evans confirmed on San Francisco's flagship radio station KNBR that the club has reached the parameters of a potential trade for Miami slugger Giancarlo Stanton. \nEvans said Giants executives gathered with the NL MVP and his representatives in \"a good meeting\" last week. \n\"The specifics of the deal are not something that we feel comfortable discussing, but ultimately our hope is that if he does choose to come here, we'll be able to fold him in with a winning club,\" Evans said Wednesday. \"In terms of our deal it just has a number of contingencies, one of course that's paramount is relative to his full no trade and that's a decision that really comes from him. But our terms with the Marlins are clear.\" \nMarlins CEO Derek Jeter said Tuesday that Miami has not decided whether to trade Stanton, still owed $295 million over the final decade of his record $325 million, 13-year contract. When asked specifically about absorbing the majority of that contract, Evans didn't address it. \nStanton is due to make $25 million in 2018 after he led the majors with 59 home runs and 132 RBIs this season.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vladimir", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "paul brown",

Using sunless tanner saves both time and energy. It is the safest method due to the fact that one does not need to be exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays to get a new look. Sun tanning is time consuming, painful and extremely harmful to your health because one has to spend long hours under the sun. There are numerous factors as to why a sunless tan is recommendable for you.\n\nTo begin with the indoors tans ensures your safety because it does not expose you to harmful infrared radiations that cause skin cancer. Cancer is a chronic disease that no one would want to suffer from. The disease is distressing and involves many expensive remedies that are met to prolong life.\n\nThe method is met to give you a stunning natural glow that makes one look more attractive as if it were a real deal. Sun bronzing can give you a new tan but it has leaves tan lines, sunburns and freckles on the skin. Infrared radiation activates melanocytes which cause more melanin to be produced. Melanin has the effect of increasing the chances of sunburns and freckles which glow dark and within a short while they become visible.\n\nThis means of getting a tan saves time and is cost effective compared to sun bronzing. With sun bronzing one has to stay under the sun for hours. This increases the chances of skin cancer. The disease necessitates many remedies that are often expensive. Sunless tans only take few hours and one obtains a new look as opposed to outdoor method where one has to stay for long hours under the sun. This makes it cost effective, time and energy saving.\n\nUnlike outdoor tanning that causes premature ageing of your skin this method aims at ensuring your skin looks younger. Quit often harmful sun rays quicken the rate at which your skin gets old. Destructive ultraviolet rays makes the DNA in the skin mutate. If the situation repeats itself the mutated DNA accumulate in the skin.\n\nSunless tans are convenient. This is because indoor tanner products are readily available in most stores, firms that provide the service and salons. They are convenient for use because a single application is able to give one a new tan. The new glow can be sustained for a long time depending on the how well the application is done.\n\nUsing indoor tanners can help a person get rid of some blemishes such as spider veins, scars and jagged skin tone. Sun bronzing can hardly remove this kind of blemishes. Therefore this method does not only help one have a new natural glow but also clears spots on the skin.\n\nGetting tans from sunlight exposure is extremely dangerous for your health and one should avoid it. This is because it can lead to skin diseases and often make one get a bad effect on the skin such as tan lines, sunburns and freckles.

Andrews \nThe Washington Post Starbucks once made waves with the indulgent sizes of some of its drinks, such as the Trenta, which contains a staggering 31 ounces of joe. Now, as part of the company\u2019s aggressive expansion in China, the Seattle-based coffee retailer opened its largest store in the world: a nearly 30,000-square-foot compound that does much more than simply serve coffee. The new Starbucks Reserve Roastery, which opened Tuesday in Shanghai, is the first non-U.S. location of a new series of shops designed to offer a more \u201cimmersive\u201d experience for coffee lovers, according to Starbucks. The first such roastery, which opened in Seattle in 2014, is about half its size, CNN reported. The Shanghai location is the world\u2019s largest Starbucks. It includes three coffee bars, one of which clocks in at 88 feet long \u2014 the chain\u2019s longest to date. The coffee bars will serve cups made from beans grown in China\u2019s Pu\u2019er in Yunnan Province, USA Today reported. A two-story, 40-ton copper cask towers over the store, refilling the coffee bars\u2019 various silos. As a nod to the local beverage of choice, it also includes a tea bar made from 3D printed materials, and an in-house bakery employing more than 30 Chinese bakers and chefs, the company stated. The experience seems curated to keep people mulling about the store. It is the first Starbucks location to integrate augmented reality, which refers to technology that combines real-world surroundings with tech, in this case the customers\u2019 smartphones. They can point their phones at various spots around the cavernous room to learn about the coffee brewing process. China might seem like an odd place to open the world\u2019s biggest and arguably flashy Starbucks, given the country\u2019s traditional warm beverage has long been tea, not coffee. And, in fact, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said the company struggled when it opened its first store in China in 1999. \u201cWe had to educate and teach many Chinese about what coffee was \u2014 the coffee ritual, what a latte was,\u201d Schultz told CNN. \u201cSo in the early years, we did not make money.\u201d But now, the company is expanding faster than frothed milk. Since 2016, it has been on pace to open an average of one new store every day for five years, CNN reported. In 2021, the company plans to have almost 5,000 stores across the country. For comparison, there were more than 11,100 Starbucks in America in 2012. \u201cWhen people ask me how much can you really grow in China, I don\u2019t really know what the answer is, but I do believe it\u2019s going to be larger than the U.S.,\u201d Schultz told the New York Times. The company\u2019s practices in China haven\u2019t been free of criticism. In 2014, reports came out that a latte cost nearly a dollar more in China than in the United States, even though the U.S. boasted a per capita income that was 51\u20442 times China\u2019s, the Atlantic reported. The company defended its pricing structure, and has not adjusted it. \u201cWhen you look at our pricing structure, we look at it market by market. It\u2019s based on our true cost of running our business in China and or any market that we operate,\u201d John Culver, group president at Starbucks Coffee China and Asia Pacific, told CNBC Asia\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d The higher prices don\u2019t seem to have driven away many customers. Over the past year, sales in China grew by 7 percent compared to a 3 percent in the rest of the world, ABC News reported. Some believe that\u2019s why the company chose to open the new splashy location in Shanghai. \u201cThis is a show store,\u201d John Gordon, a restaurant analyst at Pacific Management Consulting, told CNN. \u201cThe point is to be in a highly, highly visible, touristy [area] where there\u2019s foot traffic, offices and urban housing in order to promote the brand. The store\u2019s boasting rights as the world\u2019s largest won\u2019t last long, though. The company plans to open a 43,000-square-foot location on Chicago\u2019s Michigan Avenue in 2019, the Chicago Tribune reported. 18946298 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "travis m. andrews", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "schultz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john gordon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "howard schultz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john culver", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "starbucks", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "washington post starbucks", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "starbucks coffee china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "starbucks reserve roastery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abc news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago tribune", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trenta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific management consulting", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa today", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "shanghai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan avenue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yunnan province", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:22.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4d945047227902e12d3dd8734c01143865ff9945", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.6O4yW1CM2s.9kApu0e9fYIhzsOzdR2fxMlSBML8HeWTElCVPH9PhzNBGJ4kTq5ajmh.YCGiJl1b54zKJJhdN5OnCnb5fvxQ8wIdnJa9hjVuTmmrsdPinPrQQpVOpqgXqNUqPVpLpBl8MA2t8i0ot0Cc7CVOtHxSPjM7mYH7u85dMI15.URgbs", "site_full": "www.delawareonline.com", "site": "delawareonline.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.delawareonline.com/wilmington/decolleges", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "media", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "GANNETT Syndication Service", "title": "Blue Hens can&apos;t complete comeback, lose 75-72 to Buffalo; Notre Dame next", "title_full": "Blue Hens can&apos;t complete comeback, lose 75-72 to Buffalo; Notre Dame next", "published": "2017-12-07T07:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/509c20d8e1fd827de5fdc8e35323da239a32bcfc/c=0-63-2560-1509&r=x803&c=1600x800/local/-/media/2017/12/06/Wilmington/Wilmington/636481882820827286-120617-ud-v-buffalo-wb139870.jpg-.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34784, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4d945047227902e12d3dd8734c01143865ff9945", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.6O4yW1CM2s.9kApu0e9fYIhzsOzdR2fxMlSBML8HeWTElCVPH9PhzNBGJ4kTq5ajmh.YCGiJl1b54zKJJhdN5OnCnb5fvxQ8wIdnJa9hjVuTmmrsdPinPrQQpVOpqgXqNUqPVpLpBl8MA2t8i0ot0Cc7CVOtHxSPjM7mYH7u85dMI15.URgbs", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The News Journal", "published": "2017-12-07T07:56:00.000+02:00", "title": "Blue Hens can&apos;t complete comeback, lose 75-72 to Buffalo; Notre Dame next", "text": "Posted!

Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio, left, and Keith Gregg, the county's Chief Information Technology Officer, right, speak at a press conference Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, at the Government Center about t... \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

Not many cars, which is odd for a racing game, no \"campaign\", and the online mode is complete shit. JUST MATCHMAKE ME IN A LOBBY OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO RACE, DONT TELL ME TO COME BACK AT 8:00 PM TO START THE RACE. Seriously that has to be the dumbest thing in video games history.\nI love the gameplay, but they better get their shit together cause its so boring atm.\nThe last racing game I played was the first Forza. And it had more content than GT Sport.\nHere is the link https://www.gtplanet.net/gt-sport-patch-v1-06-bring-new-cars-offline-modes/\nBut honestly you just gotta be patient. They built GT Sport from ground up and unlike Forza didn't carry over old content into the new one. I think what many people didn't like about GT5/6 was the fact that they literally imported the cars over without any change, even the exhaust notes were complete shit.\nThey have already said by the end of GT Sport life cycle, there will be 550 cars in the game.\nBut just looking at the core of the game, it is SO polished. the physics are amazing, the graphics are sensational, the exhaust notes are finally beautiful and realistic and don't sound like a vacuum, everything is just so polished. I think it's the content that is displeasing people and I totally get that!\nI'm excited for the future of the game because I think they are on the right path!\nedit: and a race happens every 15 minutes! So in the mean time run a few practice laps.

If you suffer from dyslexia then it becomes necessary to find a dyslexia therapist Michigan . Depending on the severity of the problem, the symptoms may vary as well. Its important to get an early diagnosis and treat this illness effectively otherwise it will lead to many other problems in the future.\n\nThere are situations where individuals do not receive the necessary treatment because their illness is not diagnosed in an accurate manner. To ensure that the child gets proper treatment, he needs to undergo certain assessments in order to identify the real cause of this problem and its severity level as well.\n\nDyslexia has a number of varied symptoms and a couple of them include unable to rhyme letters and recognize them correctly. After reaching a certain age, children tend to do these things without any effort but when they struggle as compared to other children of their age, then you should think seriously about it. Further assessments should be made as soon as possible to find the root cause of this problem.\n\nAnother problem that dyslexics face is that they find it pretty hard to copy anything from a book or a board. They find this task extremely difficult and stressful at the same time. Their writing pattern is very disorganized and its hard to make up what they have actually written. Besides writing, their other functional abilities are also very disorientated.\n\nTheir level of intelligence is sometimes superior as compared to other children of their age but when they speak out or write, they struggle to find the correct words. This makes them less confident about themselves and they tend to hide somewhere in the background because they do not want to be in the lime light anymore. They think their condition will never improve and they won't be able to lead a normal life as others do.\n\nIts very likely that the child no longer feels confident about his abilities and starts to loose his will power. Your child won't feel like going to school anymore and doesn't want to focus on his studies because he feels like he is not good enough. Its important that you do a proper diagnosis to find out what sort of disability your child is suffering from and what is its severity level.\n\nIf the diagnosis is done at the right age and at the right time then its more likely that the child won't suffer from his disabilities. He will learn how to cope with it and live his life with such disability. Full recovery might not be possible but the condition can be improved to a great extent if proper therapy and treatment plan is followed as prescribed by the specialists. Its important to provide the child with the necessary support that he requires.\n\nIt is actually a life long condition and the individual who suffers from it needs to learn how to cope with it in a positive manner. The child's weaknesses can be minimized provided he undergoes proper treatment plan and it is ensured that he will receive proper care even afterwards.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are searching for information about a dyslexia therapist Michigan residents can come to our web pages today.

I am trying to fit a model to this ordinal DV, and find best features. The problem is that one of the classes, ie (1- bad), only has 50 out of 5000 observations, the other two classes have around around equal number of observations. This is leading to a number of problems, I believe, and I am trying to find the best solution to address it. \nHere is what I've tried: \nmodel <- polr(Y ~., train, Hess=TRUE) output: Warning message: In polr(Y ~ ., train, Hess = TRUE): design appears to be rank-deficient, so dropping some coefs \nAlso qda.fit=qda(Y~.,data=train) Error in qda.default(x, grouping, ...): rank deficiency in group 1 \nSo I read the following which explains there could be a number of reasons for insufficient data here: What is rank deficiency, and how to deal with it? . The main quote here below is intro. The answer suggests some causes without going into best way- at least not that I can glean - to address my specific case. \n\"Rank deficiency in this context says there is insufficient information contained in your data to estimate the model you desire. It stems from many origins. I'll talk here about modeling in a fairly general context, rather than explicitly logistic regression, but everything still applies to the specific context.\" \nMy thinking about options: Remove level 1 class and do a binomial logistic regression Merge the level 1 with another class somehow - not sure best way to do that Something else? \nOption 1 is easiest but is that the best option. My concern is this: While there is very little data, there is a pattern, and it also makes sense that very few reviews would be the lowest, relative to others.

If you are coming down the steep line from Stanley Crook to Crook its on your left at the first gate, if you are going up the hill on the line from Crook its on your right past the second gate. If you are coming from Durham / Nevilles Cross head for Brancepth Village A690, down and up the first dip and turn right onto Stockley Lane at the top turn right onto B2699 and head for Stanley Crook, into the village and turn left down the hill A6298 to Billy Row then turn left onto Temperance Terrace. If you are coming in from the North A68 go through Tow Law and turn left on the sharp bend onto Sunniside. South on the A68 come off right ta the roundabout and head towards Crook. By car there is only one vehicle entry point which is off the B6298, signposted Temperance Terrace. We'll have cycling event signs out as well. If you use google maps and search for Billy Hall Farm you'll see two entrances, use the one to the left. The other entrance from the B6299 end is a private road and we will be turning vehicles away from this entrance to the course. Dress for the cold, its an exposed venue at a fair old height. The weather forecast is looking nippy with a max temperature of 1 degrees and that with without he wind chill factor.

Advertisement opens in new window \nRefuting social media messages, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) said that as on date there is no stay from the Supreme Court on Aadhaar and its linking to various services. \n\"That Aadhaar Act being in force, all notifications for requiring Aadhaar for various welfare programmes, verifying bank account, PAN card and SIM card with Aadhaar stand valid and lawful,\" it said in a statement. \n\"Today's legal position is that there is no stay as on December 7, 2017 from the Supreme Court on Aadhaar and its linking to various services,\" it added. \nThe government has made it mandatory for verifying bank account and PAN to weed out black money and bring unaccounted wealth to book. The same for SIM has been mandated to establish identify of mobile phone users. \n\"The mandatory requirements of Aadhaar for PAN, bank accounts, welfare programs, and SIM cards have been challenged in the Supreme Court and no stay has been granted. Therefore, it is clear that the video is outdated because it does not reflect the latest legal position as on today (December 7, 2017),\" the statement said. Advertisement opens in new window \nUIDAI said the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 was passed by the Parliament on March 16, 2016 and notified in the Gazette of India on March 26, 2016. \n\"Therefore, subsequent notifications issued under section/s of Aadhaar Act for requiring Aadhaar as primary identifier by various ministries and departments of Government of India and States/UTs Governments for various services, benefits and subsidies hold the field today,\" it said. \nUIDAI asked people not to get misled by an outdated video doing rounds in the social media and Whatsapp and said \"people should instead verify their banks accounts, investment accounts, SIM cards, etc as per the current laws and deadlines as early as possible to avoid any inconvenience.\" \n\"UIDAI has clarified on a video circulated purportedly out of context of a lady lawyer on WhatsApp, Twitter and Social Media and said that the video refers to an order passed by the Supreme Court on August 11, 2015 when the court had restricted use of Aadhaar to only few programs,\" the statement said. \nThe video, it said, does not reflect \"true legal position\" as it stands today, because after the said Supreme Court order of 2015, Aadhaar Act was passed by Parliament in 2016. Advertisement opens in new window \nSubsequent to the Act, notifications have been issued making Aadhaar mandatory for availing various welfare benefits such as public distribution services (PDS), cooking gas LPG, MNREGS, scholarships and pensions. \nThe Income Tax Act was amended in March 2017 to make Aadhaar mandatory for PAN cards. On June 1, 2017, PML Rules have been amended to make Aadhaar mandatory for linking all bank accounts, insurance, pension, mutual funds and DMAT accounts. \n\"Supreme Court too in Lokniti Foundation case through an order passed in February 2017 has approved verification of all SIM cards with Aadhaar,\" UIDAI said. \nThe Apex Court has upheld the linkage of Aadhaar with PAN in the case of Binoy Viswam vs Union of India which mandates Aadhaar for income tax returns and PAN. \nPTI ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "aadhaar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uidai", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national news analysis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "uidai", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "supreme court on aadhaar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lokniti foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aadhaar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apex court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unique identification authority of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter and social media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "binoy viswam vs union of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pds", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "aadhaar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:24.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ff823afee76613c74445c7fb24915399666446e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOryHLIQTO9aw1KolrJXWT_jWtYKnsQRQTGKE1WA_fvPeW2Cp5BsMAYeitGp2GXKGqFcrSNB8bM1EQA9wpJ_0kzVj..ML2Cot1S88fYUqAhwHA--", "site_full": "sandraspicy.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://sandraspicy.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Sandra Spicy", "title": "Woman Gets Engaged To a Chandelier(Photos)", "title_full": "Woman Gets Engaged To a Chandelier(Photos)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ff823afee76613c74445c7fb24915399666446e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOryHLIQTO9aw1KolrJXWT_jWtYKnsQRQTGKE1WA_fvPeW2Cp5BsMAYeitGp2GXKGqFcrSNB8bM1EQA9wpJ_0kzVj..ML2Cot1S88fYUqAhwHA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sandra ijeme dickson (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Woman Gets Engaged To a Chandelier(Photos)", "text": "One woman who identifies herself as \u2018objectum sexual\u2019 is now engaged to a chandelier.\n\n\n\nAmanda Liberty has discovered the light of her life in the shape of a chandelier she bought on eBay last year. And she claims it was love at first light.\n\nThe 33-year-old from Leeds identifies herself as \u2018objectum sexual\u2019, which means she is attracted to objects.\n\nShe bought the chandelier from an eBay seller in Germany for \u00a3400 last year, and has named it Lumi\u00e8re after the candelabra character from Disney movie Beauty and the Beast.\n\nShe regularly gives the chandelier hugs and kisses, and proposed on Valentine\u2019s Day \u2013 even giving Lumi\u00e8re an engagement ring.\n\u201cLast Valentine\u2019s Day ,I proposed to her, to signify our long-lasting love,\u201d said Ms Liberty.\n\n\u201cI hope at some point we will have a commitment ceremony. I haven\u2019t been engaged before, so it\u2019s very new and exciting!\u201d\n\nHowever, Lumi\u00e8re isn\u2019t the only chandelier in Ms Liberty\u2019s life. She goes to bed with another chandelier called Jewel, which is smaller and thinner. In fact, she says she is in a relationship with 25 different chandeliers.\n\n\u2018None of my chandeliers are jealous of each other,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u201cThey understand that I love them all for their different personalities. For example, I love kissing and cuddling Lumi\u00e8re, but I sleep with Jewel every night as she is portable and very nice to cuddle.\u201d\n\nMs Liberty says she fell in love with the Statue of Liberty on a trip to New York when she was 17, and changed her surname \u2018Liberty\u2019 by deed poll in 2010 as a result.\nShe first realised she was attracted to objects when she fell in love with a drum kit at the age of 14. But her current crush is chandeliers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always loved the look of chandeliers and when I saw my first chandelier, Luna, it was love at first sight,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t control who you fall in love with and things just went from there. I want others to see how happy the chandeliers make me, and how much they\u2019ve enriched my life.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hurting anyone by entering into a relationship with them.

PHOTO: FILE \nI do not know if the readers will be hurt more after reading Urdu literary great Intizar Husain\u2019s life story, who unthinkingly made Pakistan home after the partition of India, or author Mahmood Farooqui\u2019s, a renowned dastan-go (storyteller), who was serving a seven-year prison term for rape until the Delhi High Court set aside the order in September. \nHusain lived a long life \u2013 93 years, and wrote for 70. If that in itself is not commendable, he wrote across genres \u2013 covering themes as diverse as partition (the closest to his heart), about Hindu and Islamic mythology and their fantastic amalgamation \u2013 drawing from the Katha Saritasagar , the Mahabharata , the Jataka Tales and Alif Laila . \nUrdu mourns as Intizar Hussain dies \nIn his writings, he always pined for that perfect past, often shaming the ugliness of modernity, exposing the hypocrisy of the religious brigade that unleashed terror in the country that he made a home. \nHusain also wrote with passion about the rape of the environment, of the missing koel , of the \u2018assassination\u2019 of trees, of the zameen (land), even as the heavyweight progressives trashed him as anti-progress, anti-national and hyper-nostalgic. \nHusain\u2019s move to Pakistan was an unthinking act. He moved because his teacher-mentor Muhammad Hasan Askari asked him to in a message on Radio Pakistan . \u201cI am going to stay here. Please come and join me. And further, ask Intizar to come with you.\u201d \nHusain decided to join Askari, becoming a guest in a very small, cramped house where Askari himself was a guest. This impulsive move haunted him for several decades, accentuated by his being a Shia. A move, he wrote about often, for instance, in Basti and in Hindustan Se Ek Khat amongst others. In 2012, Basti was included as the only South Asian novel in New York Book Review\u2019s Hundred Classic Novels of the 20th Century. \nFive decades after the partition, Husain avoided questions over his decision to move to Pakistan. It happened a long time ago and is now the realm of historians, he would say, or \u201cI feel very disappointed that I have no saga of being attacked, of being looted or burned or assaulted\u201d. \nHis writings, however, were full of angst. \u201cOur house was steeped in [an] Islamic atmosphere, but the atmosphere around was steeped in Hindu colour\u2026Now the Wahhabis have taken the fun out of it.\u201d \nHusain insisted his writings were not political. But, as Farooqui points out in his book titled, A Requiem for Pakistan: The World of Intizar Husain (2016) , there are ways of being political which go beyond commenting on the current political dispensation: \u201cSuddenly one morning I realised that the place where we live is a good vantage point to witness those public hangings\u201d. OR \u201cEvery affliction that falls from the sky and every turbulence that arises from the earth comes asking for the address of Pakistan and having arrived here takes us into its arms.\u201d \n\u2018Intizar Husain a memory of the past, vision for the future\u2019 \nPakistan\u2019s nuclear tests troubled him deeply. \u201cWhen I pick up my pen all I can think of is the Chaghi mountain. First, it trembles a bit, and then its colour begins to change\u2026I am not under the spell of the nuclear bomb, I am breathing under the shadow of the pain of that mountain. If I can ride over this torture I may be able to write a story. Between me and my story lies that bruised mountain.\u201d \nAfter decades of writing, Husain rues the ineffectiveness of the written word. Yet he never stopped writing \u2013 like the protagonist Shahrzad in Shahrzad Ke Naam who lived and managed to change the heart of the king through her storytelling. \nFarooqui shares Husain\u2019s and, thereby Shahrzad\u2019s, compulsion to tell a story \u2013 \u201cin the fear of death\u201d. \u201cI too have written this (book) with a sword hanging over my head. I may soon be sent to jail for seven years for a crime I didn\u2019t commit.\u201d \nYet, Farooqui manages to light up the book with little anecdotes: \u201cNobody had then thought that partition would mean irrevocable borders. The Muslim League leader Khaliquzzaman was quite convinced that he would be able to live in his mansion in Calcutta [now Kolkata], even while he became a minister in the Pakistani government.\u201d \nFor Farooqui, the book is as much about Partition, as about a writer\u2019s life post-partition. The scenes at the Pak Tea House, the adda (base) of writers \u2013 \u201cwhen the Amritsari crowd gathers \u2013 all that they talk about is Amritsar, Amritsar, Amritsar. As if there is only one city on the world map\u2026\u201d \nWriters such as Munir Niyazi and Husain missing their lost paradise \u2013 the Basti , the peacocks, the mango groves; and people like Mim Hasan Lateefi, who lost everything during the move to Pakistan, asking Husain to buy him tea and two pieces of toast. The toast for the birds and dogs. \nIntizar Hussain \u2013 the seller of dreams \nFarooqui met Husain a couple of times. On one such occasion, Husain talked about the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Pakistan: \u201cThe thing is that they do not regard us as Muslims and my response to that is that either I am not a Muslim or they are not Muslims. One of us is certainly a Kafir (infidel). That is all I can say.\u201d \nHusain died on February 3, 2016 \u2013 the most mourned death of a literary figure after Faiz Ahmed Faiz, despite the fact he was Shia. \nFarooqui wrote this book under exceptional circumstances and he is aware of the flaws \u2013 tighter editing, better structuring, for sure. \n\u201cI got there first so I have done what I could. Now you can do better if you like,\u201d he announces up front in the preface to the book. \nTo borrow a pun from Niranjan Ramkrishnan, who has written the foreword of the book, it was Husain\u2019s \u201cShia good fortune\u201d to have lived to be 93 and died peacefully in a post-Zia Pakistan. This good fortune seems to have rubbed on Farooqui too \u2013 with him winning an impossible battle at the courts. \nLamat R Hasan is a Delhi-based independent journalist who lived in Pakistan during 2007-2013.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "intizar husain", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "muslims", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intizar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alif laila", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "husain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muhammad hasan askari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "basti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "farooqui", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khaliquzzaman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lamat r hasan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faiz ahmed faiz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "askari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intizar hussain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mim hasan lateefi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niranjan ramkrishnan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shahrzad ke naam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shahrzad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katha saritasagar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahmood farooqui", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "munir niyazi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "delhi high court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hindustan se ek khat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pak tea house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calcutta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "urdu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amritsar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kolkata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:25.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c5fd4b3faabac5ecf1cd7b9cc2583e78a860970e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS8i1SiyS5eu6ptADoBkOrUZ2RX0vKqewTqAqx_7w7xn.wBLW4OroJ6dII0KML_yANyWv8jiT1GWO4CXvTtm58F_KULLPqZ.EzT_Or8SCYrEdLpgQjeNOwC", "site_full": "www.corvetteforum.com", "site": "corvetteforum.com", "site_section": "https://www.corvetteforum.com/forums/c7-parts-for-sale-wanted-162/", "site_categories": ["auto_racing", "sports"], "section_title": "C7 Parts for Sale/Wanted -

You may have signed up to some years ago, but forgotten all about them. If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s time to take another look. \nRecently, Facebook has paying more attention to groups , and adding some significant improvements and new features. For example, all Pages can now create linked groups , group membership questions have been rolled out and you can now post to a group as a Page , not just as an individual. \nAs a result of these updates, you may have heard a lot more about Facebook groups lately. You may also be noticing more group posts appearing on your timeline. But have you considered creating a Facebook group for your business? \nGroups are an excellent way to personally connect with your customers, as well as potential clients. There's also great value in building a community around your brand and in having somewhere that your customers can find out more, or talk with others within your brand community. If you\u2019re still unsure, did you know that groups have more than a billion monthly active users ? \nTo help you build an effective Facebook group for your company, here are six simple steps: 1. Create the right group \nFirst off, it\u2019s important to decide on the purpose of your Facebook group. Do you want to use it as a place where customers can come to ask questions? Do you want customers to be able to speak with other like-minded customers? Or perhaps you want to use it as a place to get valuable feedback? \nNext, decide what you want your group to be called and who you want to attract. You can limit members by setting the right privacy settings . You can set your group to \u2018public\u2019, so everyone can see it, or \u2018closed\u2019, where it\u2019s more exclusive and only specific customers can join. You can also make your group \u2018secret\u2019 so that it doesn\u2019t show up in search results and people can only be added by invitation. 2. Encourage members to join \nNow you have your group set up, you need to add members. \nThere are several ways you can do this - if you already have a Facebook Page, advertise your group there. Additionally, consider sending out an email to your mailing list, encouraging them to join your group. \nThis shouldn\u2019t just be a one-off activity. Promote your group regularly (whilst being careful not to over-promote). \nOnce you have members of your group, ask them to invite their friends too. This is a great way to get your group to grow - however, you should also work to ensure that you're attracting people to your group which match your target audience. 3. Create clear group rules \nOnce you have members, you'll start to generate some interactions - however, before that happens, take some time to establish your group rules. \nConsider whether you'll allow people to promote their own businesses in the group (some groups allow this, but only on a certain day of the week/month for example). Will you moderate posts before they're shown in the group, or can anyone post, whenever they want? \nNo one wants to join a group that's full of spam, irrelevant or self-promotional content, so establishing clear rules from the very start can help to avoid a lot of problems in the longer term. \nIf you\u2019re not sure which rules you want to have, think about what you like or dislike about the groups you're already a member of. 4. Create content specifically for the group \nIt\u2019s not enough to just set up the Facebook group and then leave it to run itself. To create a successful group, you need to provide value to your members. Creating a posting plan for your group content is a good place to start. \nA big mistake businesses often make is setting up an account and spamming users with self-promotional posts, full of links back to their website. Instead, share valuable content, which, ideally, isn\u2019t available anywhere else on your social channels. You should also ask questions and encourage discussion wherever possible. \nTo save time, you can schedule your posts using the group platform itself, or with tools such as Hootsuite. 5. Spend time in your group daily \nBuilding an effective Facebook group doesn\u2019t come instantly. It requires a lot of time and effort. \nWhilst being able to schedule posts is a huge help, you will still need to set some time aside each day to monitor your group. \nIt\u2019s important that when people comment on your posts, or post their own pictures, questions or other content, you reply and have a positive presence there. Don\u2019t forget to get liking other people\u2019s posts too, as well as commenting on them and offering useful information and insights wherever possible. \nIf you\u2019re unable to spend time in your group each day, you may want to consider recruiting a Social Media Manager to help out. 6. Check your insights \nNow that you have your group up and running, it\u2019s important to regularly monitor its progress. \nUse Facebook Group Insights to see how your group is growing - first, take a look at which posts receive the most engagement. This can help you to make your posting plan even more effective. \nYou should also spend some time getting to know the demographic make-up of your group. This can help you to tailor content to them or give top contributors the recognition they deserve. \nAs noted, Facebook's been putting increased focus on groups in 2018, and the new options provide a range of opportunities, making groups an even bigger consideration for marketers. If you haven't considered the possibilities of groups before, they may be worth adding to your 2018 strategy. \nFollow Elizabeth Harmon on Twitter ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/help/220336891328465?helpref=faq_content", "https://www.opencolleges.edu.au/careers/blog/career-snapshot-life-social-media-manager", "https://www.facebook.com/help/167970719931213?helpref=uf_permalink"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "facebook group insights", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook page", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:26.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f2c4ac473e955389098883f2859395a97558818b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFprwaXCO45YPB9ndTtbCH4A1yyz2oFRKBFCoWKhUVjat.PCHgvxg_6_Vxrpz.K.hL2bR298shR7yUS86wIkDBTr", "site_full": "gtaforums.com", "site": "gtaforums.com", "site_section": "http://gtaforums.com/forum/227-annual-awards-2017/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Annual Awards 2017 -

While the IMA wrote to the BCCI and Vinod Rai, the head of the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators, stating that it was troubled over the third Test between India and Sri Lanka being played in such conditions, Gurusinha urged the ICC to deploy air-quality meters in the future. \nGurusinha further said both the India and Sri Lanka dressing rooms had to use oxygen cylinders. \"The players are not able to breathe so we're using oxygen cylinders in the changing room. This has been medically advised to us,\" he told Mumbai Mirror . \"Even the Indian team is using oxygen cylinders in the dressing room.\" \nAccording to PTI , IMA president KK Agarwal said the conduct of the match sent out the message that it was safe for children to play cricket even when the PM (particulate matter) 2.5 levels were more than 300. \"Rain and poor light are taken into consideration when determining suitable playing conditions, we suggest that atmospheric pollution should now also be included in the assessing criteria for a match,\" Agarwal stated in his letter to the BCCI. \nContending that air pollution could be an important factor in affecting the performance of athletes, Agarwal quoted from medical literature and said the poor air quality in Delhi may increase the risk of lung and heart disease and trigger a potentially life-threatening event. \nThe safe levels of atmospheric particulate matter, according to World Health Organisation air-quality guidelines, are 20g/cu mm (annual mean) for PM10 and 10g/cu mm (annual mean) for PM2.5. If the air quality index (AQI) is between 151 and 200, it is recommended that outdoor exercises be reduced. \nThe first signs of players' discomfort in the polluted Delhi atmosphere came on the second day of the Test when five Sri Lanka fielders came out wearing masks in the post-lunch session. There were two stoppages of play spanning a total of 22 minutes after fast bowlers Lahiru Gamage and Suranga Lakmal appeared to struggle. Later in the Test, Lakmal and India's Mohammed Shami were seen throwing up on the field. While the India camp initially appeared to be skeptical of Sri Lanka's difficulty as bowling coach B Arun questioned their bowlers' fitness , opener Shikhar Dhawan later conceded the visitors' discomfort could have been genuine . \nPollution in Delhi has been a major health concern in recent winters. A public health emergency was declared by the government in November this year, with schools closing down for a week even as the Delhi half marathon almost turned out a non-starter. During the Test match, air quality in some parts of Delhi was reported to be hazardous, and very unhealthy in the area adjoining the Feroz Shah Kotla. \nDuring the interruptions, match referee David Boon was seen talking to a doctor, who had a stethoscope around his neck, presumably for advice on how big a health hazard the current pollution was. Gurusinha felt the ICC needed to lay down guidelines in relation to pollution-related issues. \"The match referee David Boon is handling our request. He is collecting all the data.

The shelter received more dogs than they expected, and, some of the animals were pregnant. \n\u201cI just did too much, and I kind of got myself in a little jam, which is what I did,\u201d Brown said. \nOne thing they have a lot here at the shelter is puppies. And they\u2019re little and cute and adorable, and they do require a lot of food and maintenance to keep them happy and healthy. And that\u2019s why they really need your donations. \n\u201cPuppy milk replacer is expensive and we mix puppy milk replacer with rice cereal and kibble or can food. Can food is, again, expensive,\u201d said Brown. \nThe shelter spays and neuters all their dogs and cats and is looking for people to adopt them. Susie Brown, who has run the shelter for more than 20 years, says it is a no-kill shelter and will only put down an animal in extreme conditions. She realizes some people think she should just euthanize more animals. \n\u201cAnd I tell people, \u2018if you think that I should be euthanizing animals, then you come down here, you work with them for a month and then you choose.\u2019\u201d \nInstead, she will work to find these pets good homes. \nCash and pet supply donations are welcome at the Beaverhead County Animal Shelter this holiday season.

The driver will have a sense of direction since the arrows will guide him or her from the entrance to the exit. Parking Lot Striping AR is very advantageous and it ought to be taken seriously.\n\nDemarcating an area to be used by the disabled is a legal requirement. In addition, this area should be in close proximity to the entrance of the store or building. Moreover, the space should be bigger compared to normal parking spaces. These individuals should have enough room to operate their wheelchairs, walking aids, clutches and other gadgets that they might use. Plus, it is prudent to have spaces reserved for the employees as well.\n\nA marked car park looks organized and appealing. The strips guide the drivers and they are able to park their cars in a systematic manner. If the bay is not marked, the drivers tend to park in a disorderly manner. This in turn can result to accidents and the people caught in this mayhem maybe inconvenienced. Minor scratches or dents on the vehicle can be as a result of poor parking and the car owner may be forced to carry out unplanned repairs which can be costly.\n\nDrivers tend to waste a lot of space especially in an unmarked space. This is not the case when it comes to marked car parking. Planning of the slots will have to be done beforehand and the area is marked accordingly therefore improving the number of spaces available to park the car. Plus, finding a space to park the car becomes easy and therefore individuals may prefer to use this parking zone.\n\nIn an unmarked area, the pedestrians can be knocked down by a speeding car or a car can hit another car. By stripping a lot, pedestrians will be allocated a specific area to walk and cross the road. These areas should be clearly marked for the motorist and pedestrians to see. Driving a car at high speeds in a parking area can result to accidents therefore, the speed should be clearly spelled out. This way; accidents will be avoided, motorist and pedestrians will feel safe.\n\nOne may tend to think that stripping the bay is an easy process. Hiring a professional is important because, they have the capacity to use the right tools and equipment to mark the bay. In addition, they are able to take measurement and come up with a good plan that will be used to utilize the space accordingly.\n\nThese professional will measure the size of the parking zone and come up with a systematic way in which the cars will be parked. This will see to it that they come up with the highest possible number of spaces. In addition, they ought to seal the potholes as well to produce an excellent finished work.

Unicorn Snot Glitter Gel Glitter \ud83d\udc9a I am not going to lie when I saw the 'unicorn snot' glitter at Bath and Body Works I was so excited.

Just a touch on your eyes, cheeks, or lips will do! Plus, this Unicorn Snot glitter gel is pretty hard to find--it's sold out at a bunch of stores!

I have become such a fan of their fresh and fragrant which are both chemical and cruelty free. I need serious restraint when I visit their stores in the Grand Floridian and Disney Springs at Walt Disney World! Their shops are so beautiful and everything smells so yummy!\n\nIf you've never been to a Basin store before then make a note of it if you're ever in Orlando (or indeed Las Vegas, they have stores there too!). Their products are super if you have sensitive skin like me. I like to limit the chemicals in what I use as much as I can and Basin products are just perfect. They are so much fun, too! I am such a fan of their Disney soaps and the bath bombs with hidden mickey confetti inside. Kiddo is also a fan of the mini bath bombs and the create-your-own tubes of brightly coloured bath salts.\n\nLet's be honest though, I already have such a stash of bath products at home so I really didn't have the need to buy *anything* but I couldn't resist purchasing a few products to enjoy at home! I bought a bunch of stuff to give as gifts so obviously I'm not going to share those but here are the products I picked up for myself!  \n\nFirstly, bath bombs! In Basin stores, you can grab an empty barrel and fill it with as many of the large bath bombs as possible for a set price. I'm going to say it was around $20, I can't remember exactly.... not expensive though! We managed to fit five in there and oh my goodness, I can't tell you how good they all smell! The bath bomb marbles are also super, just one will scent your bath beautifully. \nI've used a few so far and the turquoise one smells like actual heaven, not even kidding. So fresh and luxurious! I also loved the hidden Mickey one that plopped into the bath to reveal copious amounts of red, white and blue Mickey Mouse shapes. Absolutely adorable!   \n\nNext we have lip balms. Now, please believe me here when I say that these are the best lip balms e v e r ! I picked up five of the flavours including English Toffee and Coconut to keep me going through the winter months. I believe they also have flavours such as Sangria and Iced Pear but I've not seen them in person before.... I'll keep my eyes peeled for those next time!  \nThese lip balms are super nourishing, are made with SPF 15, they are lightweight and not at all greasy. They also smell amazing!   \n\nFinally, I bought two of the soaps for myself and quite a few as gifts, too! I love the many, many designs they have but predictably I opted for a couple of the winter Mickey soaps. I bought the gingerbread one last year too and it was good enough to eat so I just had to repurchase it this year! These soaps lather up so well and they smell ridiculously good too!  \n\nAre you a fan of Basin too? What are your favourite products? Let me know in a comment below!

However, its importance is substantially diminished because of how the different methods build their inference. \nThe repetition element is important in sampling-based statistics because you are working in the sample space and the concept of optimality is that the estimators minimize some loss and are optimal on average. Bayesian estimators are optimal, given the actually observed sample. If you repeat the experiment, then the Bayesian estimates are updated. Each Frequentist experiment is reported out as separate events, except in meta-analysis. \nUsing your graphic, the Frequentist conducts each experiment and produces twenty sets of inference. The Bayesian would use all prior experiments to update the current one, so in a sense, those twenty experiments are one Bayesian sample. \nIn a Frequentist solution, the concern is with the distribution of $\\bar{x}-\\mu$ and since $\\bar{x}$ is a random variable made up of the sum of many random variables, the sampling distribution of $\\bar{x}$ is normal and so the central limit theorem holds and is important. \nFor a user of Bayesian methods, however, the sample isn't random. An observation isn't a random variable. The central limit theorem still holds, but it isn't directly used for inference. The posterior depends only on the exact sample that was observed and not samples that could have happened but did not happen. \nI cannot say what the authors mean as I haven't read the book. Nonetheless, I do not think that you can infer as much as you are from that statement. Since Bayesian inference is based on the sample that was observed, there is no direct concept of \"power.\" \nBayesian methods depend on sample size just as null hypothesis methods do to get information, but there is no idea of exploring a sample space in order to perform inference. \nI think they are saying something smaller than what you are saying. Let me give you an example. Let us imagine that you are about to patent a new species of bean. A very similar bean has 31 calories per 100 grams, with a variance of 25 calories$^2$ per 100 grams. You have your first ten beans. They weight 55 grams. You have a sample size of ten. That isn't much. \nIn doing this, you have basically constrained the search area for $\\mu$ to (16,46). This increases the precision of the test because the method of maximum likelihood is going to treat the entire set of real numbers as the possible number of calories per hundred grams until it sees the sample. Then the confidence interval will be based only one what the sample provides. This will make for a wider estimate since it lacks the additional information. \nI don't think they are saying anything more. \nIf you did do infinite repetition, then if $\\mu$ is a population mean from a density, and the prior is not degenerate, then the marginal posterior density of $\\mu$ will converge to the normal distribution. The central limit theorem has returned, albeit in another form and it isn't the \"central limit theorem\" anymore, but it is the same idea. Now $\\mu$ is the random variable. The distinction here, however, is that nobody can collect the data from infinite repetition, but you can collect ten beans.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:28.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "462164a2c46ea99db782a5f709a0ca5b57e9bef7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJ5iB6lAljbTm89Z.iPVnTg2atwIvffo1mpJr07W90P7sRDWsUaQgh8gSZzx98.dBiJTC7ByUQ8ko3NZclY726", "site_full": "hiltonhead.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://hiltonhead.craigslist.org/search/ppp?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist hilton head | personals search", "title": "Hot head -
