Trump Jr., the eldest son of President Donald Trump, met for more than 10 hours Wednesday with the committee, which is one of three government panels investigating whether Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential race. Trump Jr. left without speaking to reporters about what was discussed. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can shield conversations by only having an attorney present.\u201d \n\u2013 Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. \nTrump Jr. has claimed he didn\u2019t tell the president about the meeting between Trump campaign officials and Russians when it happened and he declined to elaborate on what he ultimately told him after the meeting became public. \nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said that Trump Jr. said he couldn\u2019t speak about the conversations with his father because of attorney-client privilege, telling the committee a lawyer was present when he spoke to his father about the meeting and the emails that led up to it. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can shield conversations by only having an attorney present,\u201d the California lawmaker said. \nThe Trump Tower meeting is a matter of keen interest to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is also investigating the meddling and whether there was any obstruction of justice. Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, attended the meeting with several Russian operatives under the impression that they might receive damaging information about the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton. \nMueller is also interested in the White House response to the meeting once it became public. The White House has said the president was involved in drafting an early statement saying the meeting primarily concerned a Russian adoption program, but emails later released by Trump Jr. showed that he enthusiastically agreed to the sit-down with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and others after he was promised dirt on his father\u2019s rival. Trump Jr. later said the promised material never materialized. \nTrump Jr. said during Wednesday\u2019s interview that he spoke with President Trump\u2019s communications aide Hope Hicks as early reports of the meeting emerged, according to one person familiar with the interview. The New York Times was first to report the existence of the meeting, and Trump Jr. eventually released the emails detailing the planning for it. \nHicks was with the president on Air Force One while they were writing the statement that said the meeting primarily concerned the adoption program. \nTrump Jr. also told the intelligence panel that he didn\u2019t tell his father about the 2016 meeting at the time that it happened, according to the person familiar with his interview. The person was not authorized to speak about the testimony and asked not to be identified. \nJulian Assange of WikiLeaks. \nTrump Jr. also voluntarily testified in September before a closed session of the Senate Judiciary Committee about the meeting, which he cast as simply an opportunity to learn about Clinton\u2019s \u201cfitness, character or qualifications,\u201d insisting to investigators that he did not collude with Russia to hurt Clinton\u2019s campaign. \nThe Senate intelligence committee also hopes to interview Trump Jr. before the end of the year. \nBritish publicist Rob Goldstone, who is believed to have arranged that meeting, will reportedly talk to members of the House and Senate intelligence committees as early as next week. \nKushner has spoken to both intelligence committees. The panels have also interviewed Ike Kaveladze, who was at the meeting as a representative of a Russian developer who once partnered with Trump to bring the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow, and Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American lobbyist. A translator who was in attendance has also spoken to congressional investigators. \nLawmakers were also expected to ask Trump Jr. about his communications with WikiLeaks during and after the campaign. Last month, Trump Jr. released a series of private Twitter exchanges with WikiLeaks dating to the period during and after the 2016 election. \nIn the exchanges \u2014 including some around the time WikiLeaks was releasing stolen emails from Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman \u2014 Trump Jr. is asked to release his father\u2019s tax returns to the site. \nThe private messages also show Trump Jr. responding to the WikiLeaks account three times. \nHe also asked the site about a rumor about an upcoming leak. The messages began in September 2016 and ran through the following July. \nTrump Jr. played down the exchanges as he released them. \n\u201cHere is the entire chain of messages with @wikileaks (with my whopping 3 responses) which one of the congressional committees has chosen to selectively leak,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cHow ironic!\u201d \nTrump Jr.\u2019s lawyers had already released the exchanges to the congressional committees investigating Russian intervention. \nIn an Oct. 3, 2016, message, the WikiLeaks Twitter account sent Trump Jr. an article that included critical comments Clinton had made about site editor Julian Assange and said, \u201cIt\u2019d be great if you guys could comment on/push this story.\u201d \nTrump Jr. replied: \u201cAlready did that earlier today. It\u2019s amazing what she can get away with.\u201d \nTwo minutes later, Trump Jr. sent another message: \u201cWhat\u2019s behind this Wednesday leak I keep reading about?\u201d \nLongtime Trump associate Roger Stone had tweeted the day that\u201cHillary Clinton is done,\u201d referencing WikiLeaks. \nThe WikiLeaks Twitter account never responded, but days later WikiLeaks started rolling out emails from Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta\u2019s account. After the release, WikiLeaks sent Trump Jr. a searchable link of the emails. Trump Jr. tweeted that link two days later, on Oct. 14, 2016, according to The Atlantic magazine. \nFox News\u2019 Joseph Weber and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump jr. in j", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kushner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wikileaks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ike kaveladze", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hope hicks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hicks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob goldstone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph weber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julian assange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "willens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared kushner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john podesta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rinat akhmetshin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "natalia veselnitskaya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger stone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam schiff", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wikileaks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house intelligence committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate judiciary committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wikileaks twitter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump tower", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:55.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "df2fc36da9d6ff0b1e52f522996a007e52bbadbc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZShcLv2AiNvM32EPzqcRyNTjTgNtkeP.0TApsX3EUS1PnhL99W_uO.DgrhRjAOewL54DixjeOnjg3uO2.L6970b", "site_full": "forums.studentdoctor.net", "site": "studentdoctor.net", "site_section": "https://forums.studentdoctor.net/forums/pre-medical-do.13/", "site_categories": ["7_12_education", "education"], "section_title": "Pre-Medical - DO | Student Doctor Network", "title": "KCU - Joplin vs UNECOM", "title_full": "KCU - Joplin vs UNECOM | Student Doctor Network", "published": "2017-12-07T20:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forums.studentdoctor.net/styles/xenbase/xenforo/avatars/avatar_male_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3333, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "df2fc36da9d6ff0b1e52f522996a007e52bbadbc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZShcLv2AiNvM32EPzqcRyNTjTgNtkeP.0TApsX3EUS1PnhL99W_uO.DgrhRjAOewL54DixjeOnjg3uO2.L6970b", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "latinclubimperatus", "published": "2017-12-07T20:56:00.000+02:00", "title": "KCU - Joplin vs UNECOM", "text": "hey guys so this is my first post ever so bare with me.

It is, after all, hype - and hyperbole, by definition, consists of 'exaggerated claims not meant to be taken literally'. Becoming literal, these cease to be hype. QED. \nPardon the pedantry: its relevance lies in reviewing the success in the first two Tests of Australia's three-prong pace attack - Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Patrick Cummins. \nBefore the series, they were heavily hyped. Ryan Harris even thought them superior to the trio he formed four years earlier with Mitchell Johnson and Peter Siddle. \nGlenn McGrath anointed Starc 'the best bowler in the world'; his captain called him an 'absolute genius'; a video of him bouncing Usman Khawaja in the nets circulated like the work of a Russian electoral hacker. Cryptocurrencies have changed hands at fairer value. Image: Starc claimed 5-88 as England were bundled out for 233 in their second innings in Adelaide \nIn fact, Starc, Hazlewood and Cummins have not had it all their own way since, being held at bay on the first day of the series, being checked under lights, at times searching a little hard for swing, at other times maybe straining for pace. \nBut now, let it be said, they're starting to click, in wickets and knots. The statistics tell a tale: Starc has 14 wickets at 18.7, Cummins and Hazlewood seven wickets each at 27.7 and 29.7 respectively. \nThe last day at Adelaide Oval dawned brightly for England, whose strength had hitherto been said to lie in their lower-middle echelons. In fact, the visitors lost seven for 64 in 147 deliveries - a testament to both lethality and parsimony. \nFor England, the conditions in Adelaide were meant to represent their greatest opportunity of the summer - pink ball, artificial illumination, benign weather. But what's sauce for the goose, eh? \nWhen Starc bowled the first over of England's reply, he wound the dial up on speed so effortlessly that it was almost like watching the main event after a curtain raiser. Image: Jonny Bairstow was last man out, chopping Starc onto his stumps \nThe first ball of his first over was the fastest of the match, at 146kmh; then so was the last ball of his first over, breaking through 150kmh, and stirring a sonic boom of appreciation from the crowd, some of whom might have cast their mind back to four years earlier, when another Mitch was sustaining similar velocities. \nHow to deploy such resources? Skipper Smith is still learning. In Adelaide it coloured his captaincy. Scorning to enforce the follow-on was all about easing his precious pace bowlers' workloads and sparing them until after darkness's fall, even if his batsmen did not receive the memo, and lasted only 58 overs. \nSmith also remains surprisingly slow to post short catchers to leg, behind and in front of square. The trio did the job on the fifth day anyway, Hazlewood breaking the game open, Starc closing the game out, and Cummins excellent throughout. \nIn fact, for all that he has taken half as many series wickets as Starc and has played a fifth as many Tests as Hazlewood, it has been Cummins who has really impressed this summer, with spells of unremitting economy, allowing fewer than 2.5 an over in his auxiliary role, and unflagging speed, routinely clocking in the high 140s. \nWhen he hit tailender Craig Overton on the last day, it seemed for a moment like the ball would have to be pulled out from between the young Englishman's ribs. Image: Cummins rattled England debutant Craig Overton on the rib cage \nAbove all, Cummins has demonstrated a striking maturity for a player who has played only 10 first-class matches other than his seven Tests. He understands game moments. As Australia zeroed in on victory on Wednesday, for example, he concluded an over to Jonny Bairstow with a bouncer so that Starc could have his chance at Stuart Broad, gratefully accepted. \nHe contributes above and beyond: his partnerships of 66 with Smith in Brisbane and of 99 with Marsh in Adelaide have been integral to Australia's building first-innings scores beyond their rivals. Having been a showcase for Australia's strength and conditioning capacities over the preceding five years, Cummins has this year proven a fine advertisement for its high-performance group, its coaches and selectors. \nWhat is really making the configuration work, however, is Nathan Lyon, whose 109 overs have cost only 2.29 runs each, yielded 11 wickets at 22.7, but just as importantly afforded opportunities for the pace trio to regain their wind and to return refreshed. On a slow wicket in Brisbane, Lyon was a patient foil for his faster team-mates; in Adelaide, he showed hometown nous. \nLyon's English counterpart Moeen Ali, by contrast, has been able to get through 63 overs for two wickets, leaving Joe Root with no choice but to turn back to James Anderson again and again. Image: Nathan Lyon has taken a leading 57 Test wickets in 2017 \nEngland will now surely be worried about Anderson's thirty-five-year-old physique, particularly if he wants to continue bowling round the wicket - which is how he strained his side and missed the last two and a half Ashes Tests of 2015. Were history to repeat itself in Perth, the Melbourne and Sydney Tests would be services in communal English rain prayer. \nAttacks cannot operate at one pace alone.

The CVS combination would unite drugstores, a pharmacy-benefit manager and insurance to build an integrated health care company without a foundation of doctors. That deal stands in contrast to the UnitedHealth mix, which involves a PBM in addition to health coverage and, now increasingly, physicians. \nKidney-care provider DaVita had previously said that it was \"pursuing strategic alternatives\" for its physician operation, which has had bumpy financial results and recently surprised investors by driving down earnings for DaVita, which recorded a net loss in the third quarter. \nUnitedHealth's Optum health-services arm has been building up its roster of physician practices, clinics and surgery centers with years of mostly under-the-radar acquisitions, but DaVita's group represents its highest-profile deal so far in the doctor business. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \nLarry C. Renfro, the chief executive of Optum, said the acquisition \"advances our shared goal of supporting physicians in delivering exceptional patient care in innovative and efficient ways.\" \nDaVita Medical Group includes around 280 clinics offering primary and specialist care, as well as 35 urgent-care centers and six outpatient surgery centers. It operates in states including California, Washington and Florida. The group employs around 2,200 health-care providers, including doctors, nurse practitioners and physician assistants. \nEarlier this year, Optum closed its $2.3 billion acquisition of Surgical Care Affiliates Inc., a major surgical company. Optum also last month took over the health unit of Advisory Board Co., which advises hospital systems. \nUnitedHealth has said Optum aims to provide primary care and ambulatory services in 75 markets, representing about two-thirds of the U.S. population. Last month, the company told investors that it has medical groups in 30 markets, and a health-care provider presence in 60. \nDaVita bought the big medical group HealthCare Partners LLC in 2012 in a $4.42 billion deal that diversified it away from its core kidney-care business. At the time, HealthCare Partners was the largest U.S. operator of physician groups and networks. DaVita later expanded it. \nBut the company has struggled with the physician operation. DaVita attributed the unit's third-quarter result to higher-than-projected medical costs and other factors. At the same time, DaVita has been under pressure in its main business because of scrutiny on the relationship of it and other kidney-care providers to a charity, American Kidney Fund, that has helped patients pay for health coverage. \nDaVita said it would use the proceeds from the deal with Optum for stock buybacks, debt repayment and other purposes. The companies said the deal was expected to close in 2018. \nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the parent company's top shareholder and held about one-fifth of DaVita shares as of Sept. 30. Berkshire portfolio manager Ted Weschler initiated the position after joining Berkshire in 2011. \nWrite to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com \n(END) Dow Jones Newswires ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anna wilde", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ted weschler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anna wilde mathews", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "optum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larry c. renfro", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "unitedhealth", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mathews  company", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "cvs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unitedhealth group inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "optum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthcare partners", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aetna inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davita medical group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "continue reading below  this", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "advisory board co.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davita", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american kidney fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surgical care affiliates inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davita inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pbm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthcare partners llc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cvs health corp.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:57.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d22492415400aef799d4ae16b35536541de7dd45", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jfCzYShD5TkeHbD2s_Ld2eC41M8nEehLENp.xrmmq0qUInaCCEVVeWRgdzLfVgLYNT7_Xsnj_1EogdjJAgWq_kk37S1FgIJFibQFYAbw2qzl3bHVMVgc2oCESKrWTSsRysACTS5DGUoGn4PyhM9H1MD", "site_full": "cardfight.wikia.com", "site": "wikia.com", "site_section": "http://cardfight.wikia.com/wiki/Special:RecentChanges?feed=atom", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Cardfight!!

(AP) \u2014 Time-consuming paper transactions slowed business Thursday in North Carolina's largest metro area as a county government began the days long process of restoring computer systems locked down by a ransomware attack. \nMecklenburg County was using backed-up data to make digital repairs after refusing to pay foreign hackers that froze dozens of county servers earlier this week. In the meantime, services ranging from processing jail inmates to paying tax bills had to be done by hand. \nDarryl Broome, a contractor who does remodeling and demolition work, went in person to a county office to retrieve land information he normally could look up on his home computer. He had to drive 10 miles and spent about a half-hour looking through paper records. \n\"It's a bit frustrating because you learn that you really need certain things online,\" he said. \"You get used to doing certain things online, and when you have to slow down, it costs you time and time costs you money.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government said its separate computer system wasn't affected by the attack. Nor were the computers that handle 911 calls and dispatch for the city and county, said Charlotte Fire Department Deputy Chief Richard Granger. \nMany county-run services have been delayed. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said Wednesday it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, while code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said workers were putting a priority on fixing the systems that power transactions for the health department, court system and the department that oversees building codes and environmental services. \nCyberattacks on local government are becoming increasingly common and sophisticated. Security experts say Mecklenburg County followed the right steps before and after the cyberattack, including declining to pay the ransom. \n\"Unfortunately, it's become all too common,\" said Lawrence Abrams, who runs the cyber security site bleepingcomputer.com. \"It's smart not to pay the ransom if you can avoid it. In paying these ransoms, it's obviously encouraging others.\" \nCounties in Indiana and Alabama are among those that have paid ransoms to regain access to data after a cyberattack since late last year. The Montgomery Advertiser reported that the Montgomery County, Alabama, faced disruptions to some operations even after paying hackers in September. \nOther public organizations have chosen to restore and not pay. In November 2016, a ransomware attack on San Francisco's transit system resulted in officials shutting down ticketing machines, allowing free rides for much of a weekend. But transit officials didn't pay a ransom. The St. Louis library system said it took days to restore electronic services for patrons and weeks more to fix all of its computers after it refused to pay hackers behind a ransomware attack this year. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said Mecklenburg County appears to have done a good job of backing up its data if it's able to restore the system without paying the hackers. \n\"It seems like the county was fairly well-prepared,\" he said. \"Overall, this is not as bad of a story as it could have been.\" \nMecklenburg County computers were hit Monday after an employee opened an email attachment containing malicious software, Diorio said. The attack as publicly revealed the next day. Hackers had sought digital currency worth more than $23,000 to unlock the data. \nA forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. Without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system using backup data. \n___ \nDrew reported from Raleigh, North Carolina. \n___", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "irwin carmichael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dena diorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keith gregg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ross rustici", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anjanette flowers grube", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap news share tweet", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cybereason", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mecklenburg county sheriff's office", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mecklenburg county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukraine", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:57.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "241197bef26b3ee7eea2c17e7a91cf375bbb9f86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXMSd2yHTQiO6QW_JIgtlEIzZ64sQTwbEYwt.NDk6n07_sw.ZT659gmQXIrrLUGuPL8o3et70PPiGXQJLV.IrNF0v0qOVoeh5RKTmWx_3tpo7XVK.i2esjZPYB19YoKouwA6Idm5jw2R6KKoQ1BgDDE7", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com", "site": "tripadvisor.com", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g28922-i173-Alabama.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Alabama Forum, Travel Discussion for Alabama, United States - TripAdvisor", "title": "Restaurants open Christmas Eve and Christmas Day 2017 - Gulf Shores", "title_full": "Restaurants open Christmas Eve and Christmas Day 2017 - Gulf Shores Forum - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-11-21T04:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.106, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 189, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ca58459d7af1bb72dbd69f3f53a84a6de96a8a75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXMSd2yHTQiO6QW_JIgtlEIzZ64sQTwbEYwt.NDk6n07_sw.ZT659gmQXIrrLUGuPL8o3et70PPiGXQJLV.IrNF0v0qOVoeh5RKTmWx_3tpo7XVK.i2esjZPYB19YoKouwA6Idm5jw2R6LMoW2kkOek2.78FfY5HXTY-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "97laura2017", "published": "2017-12-06T04:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "You made me laugh.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:58.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dbff9f211d5be6edf9616fbb72d59ce0270bd4d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jfCzYShD5TkeHbD2s_Ld2eC41M8nEehLEOcLkyPTI6dZPzKDwVZMfbuv4xh87PLo1A-", "site_full": "cardfight.wikia.com", "site": "wikia.com", "site_section": "http://cardfight.wikia.com/wiki/Special:RecentChanges?feed=atom", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Cardfight!!

Arrive 2100 HCM 1st May & leave from HCM 9am 23rd May.\nInitial plans are\nHCM 2 nights\nCan Tho 2 nights - probably just take bus there, then fly to Da Nang 3rd morning\nHoi An 3 nights\nHue 2 nights - go via train\nfrom here I'm a bit stuck. Not sure which order makes sense and how to travel north from Hue, fly or train\nthinking 4 Hanoi , 1 or 2 Bac Ha, 1 or 2 Sapa, 1 or 2 Mihn Bin, 1 or 2 Halong\nI do definitely want to stay Bac Ha Sat 20th for the market next day...possibly Friday also and do the Can Cau market ...if do 2 in Bac Ha will just do 1 in Sapa. Leaning towards day bus Hanoi - Bac Ha & express bus Sapa - Hanoi\nFor Halong still tossing up options, 1 night cruise, stay night in Halong and do day cruise, maybe a night on island\nFlying back to HCM 22/5 which probably means need to stay back in Hanoi 21/5.\nHavent booked any hotels or internal flights yet\nFor internal flights would you suggest booking asap or are flights likely to be discounted a little closer to May. I realise if flights fill they wont be discounted\nGuess I will be flat out researching for next 6 months\nI should add we are late 50's couple.

Speaking in the Dail in Dublin, Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy prime minister, \nWe are in a position where we still need to find a way forward but, let me be very clear, the core issues that Ireland got agreement on at the start of this week are not changing.\nCoveney was referring to provisions in the draft agreement proposing some form of regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and the Republic to prevent the emergence of a hard border. The DUP objected to the wording because they thought it could result in Northern Ireland getting detached in regulatory terms from the rest of the UK. The UK government and the DUP are still working on a solution, but there are no indications that an announcement is imminent.\nMPs, families and legal experts have raised serious concerns about comments made by the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, suggesting that British troops should break the law by carrying out targeted extrajudicial killings of British jihadists. A small number of prisoners \u2013 probably around 100 \u2013 will be given the right to vote after a British compromise offer to marginally extend the franchise was accepted on Thursday by the Council of Europe. NHS bosses have been accused of unacceptable secrecy after deciding no longer to reveal how many hospitals come under such pressure during winter that they have to declare an alert. Opposition is mounting to a planned visit to the UK by a leading American conservative evangelical Christian who has made Islamophobic and anti-gay statements, with critics saying it will promote prejudice and damage interfaith relations. That\u2019s all from me for today.\nThanks for the comments.\nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.53pm GMT 16:53 \nOsborne says Labour could be 20 points ahead in polls under different leader Here are some fuller quotes from the George Osborne speech. I\u2019m using the copy from the Press Association.\nOsborne said there was a \u201cconsensus\u201d in the Conservative party that Theresa May would be replaced before the general election . He said: \nThe essential question is going to be - is there going to be a change of leadership in this parliament? The Conservative party parliamentary party assumes there will be, the prime minister has said nothing about that. And at some point that is going to come to a head.\nI would make the observation that it is the consensus view of the Conservative parliamentary Party that the leadership should change. So at some point something will happen.\nHe said the Conservative party had to be modern to win. He said: \nIf you as a party set yourselves against the future, if we\u2019re hostile to business, if we think they are the problem not the solution, if the Cabinet game becomes who can get the most money out of the chancellor, if we\u2019re anti-tech, if we talk about building homes but pretend they can only be built on brownfields, then we will lose our economic credibility and cause damage to our country\u2019s economic future.\nHe said Labour could be 20 points ahead in the polls with a different leader. He said: \nThe Labour party chose to change its leadership rules, the new membership of the Labour party chose to head to the political fringes, and the Labour movement now lives with the consequences of that big decision.\nAnd in my view, for all this undoubted ability to connect to younger and more disillusioned voters, Jeremy Corbyn remains the biggest obstacle to Labour winning an election. \nIf the party was led by a more moderate social democrat of even middling ability then they would now be 20 points ahead in the polls and on the cusp of power. Instead the Labour movement is consumed by an internal battle for its soul.\nHe said he did not expect to return to politics, but did not rule it out. He said: \nI don\u2019t rule it out [returning to the Commons] just because I think you can be foolish saying never to things, but it is certainly not what I think I\u2019m going to be doing with my life in the future. I am very much enjoying editing the paper and for me aged 46, having had 20 years in politics, I\u2019ve discovered a new career and a new life and I\u2019m quite enjoying it.\nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.33pm GMT 16:33 \nCharles Walker , the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons procedure committee, has announced that he is tabling amendments to the EU withdrawal bill for debate next week that would give a Commons committee new powers to demand votes when ministers want to amend the law using secondary legislation.\nAt the moment most secondary legislation gets passed at the stroke of a pen, without MPs getting a vote. This has become a big issue in relation to the EU withdrawal bill because it will give ministers extensive new powers to incorporate EU law into UK law.\nThe Walker amendments, which have the backing of his committee, would create a \u201csifting committee\u201d which would have the job of going through all the statutory instruments passed under the EU withdrawal bill (up to 1,000, ministers expect) and identifying important ones which would have to be debated by MPs.\nMany Tory MPs, as well as the opposition, have been calling for a mechanism of this kind, and it is very likely that the government will accept the amendments, or table their own alternatives.\nIn a statement Walker said:\n\nIn Wednesday\u2019s debate I shall look forward to a positive response from both despatch boxes to the constructive suggestions we have made.\nThe process of transferring over 40 years\u2019 worth of accumulated EU law into UK law is one of the greatest legislative challenges parliament has ever faced.\nI shall be looking to the government for assurances that the process is going to be managed appropriately and in a way which allows the new sifting committee to do its job properly.\n\nCharles Walker.

After a quarterly council meeting today, CBI NI\u2019s director Angela McGowan said:\n\nBusiness leaders are united \u2013 they want to see Brexit talks move onto the next phase as quickly as possible and are becoming increasingly impatient that negotiators can\u2019t find a way through the deadlock on future trading arrangements, citizens\u2019 rights and the financial settlement.\nPrevarication is getting us nowhere, the people of Northern Ireland need clarity now. We find ourselves in serious danger of not only losing out on much needed foreign investment but of facing the real prospect of fantastic companies making the reluctant choice to move away from Northern Ireland .\nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.10pm GMT 16:10 \nThis is from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. \nLaura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) Hear DUP and Tory Chief Whips in negotiations this afternoon\nDecember 7, 2017 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.59pm GMT 15:59 \nAnd this tweet from Lisa is worth noting too.\nlisa o'carroll (@lisaocarroll) On Brit v Ireland - was at Fine Gael drinks last night.

Burt told MPs other states would have to fill the gap left by the United States after the president\u2019s announcement in order to ensure the \u201cprospects for peace are not diminished\u201d. \nAnd Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said the government\u2019s whole approach to handling Trump was wrong. She said:\n\nThey told us that holding his hand and hugging him close, indulging him with the offer of a state visit, was the best way of wielding influence and shaping his policies. \nBut on Jerusalem, as on so many other issues before, they have been made to look like fools. \nWeak, ignored and entirely without influence. \nWhen will they realise that bending over for a bully only encourages that behaviour, when what our country needs and what the world needs is a British government prepared to stand up to him.\n\nEmily Thornberry.

(See 12pm.) The phase one issues cover Ireland, the financial settlement and citizens\u2019 rights. Ireland is the sticking point, and Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, said he expected the UK government to produce fresh proposals on this issue within the next 24 hours. (See 11.39am.) Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has rejected claims that he has had to back down from telling the EU to \u201cgo whistle\u201d over the the so-called \u201cBrexit bill\u201d . (See 12.15pm.) Johnson has called on President Trump to show \u201cleadership\u201d in restoring momentum to the Middle East peace process. In a Q&A after a speech on fighting terrorism, he said the government thought Trump\u2019s decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was premature. But he went on: \nA lot of people are very excited and interested in possibilities that the American administration, the Trump administration, could bring to the Middle East peace process. There is an opportunity, there is a conjuncture of the stars, there is a moment - people think - when progress could be made. \nI think, this decision having been announced by President Trump, the world would like to see some serious announcements by the US about how they see the Middle East peace process and how to bring the two sides together. \nI think that\u2019s what we all want to see. If we are going to have a move of the US embassy, then let\u2019s also see some moves towards the long overdue resolution of the Middle East peace process.\nA former director of public prosecutions, Lord Macdonald, has described the new defence secretary Gavin Williamson as \u201cjuvenile\u201d for saying all British jihadis should be eliminated instead of ever being allowed to return to the UK. (See 2.11pm.) Others have strongly condemned Williamson\u2019s remarks too, and Number 10 and Boris Johnson have backed away from endorsing exactly what Williamson said. (See 12.35pm.) Theresa May has failed to get the EU to agree that Britain will retain a voice at the European court of justice in return for her concession that the Luxembourg court will retain a role in protecting citizens\u2019 rights in the UK after Brexit. Momentum is to be investigated by the Electoral Commission over its role campaigning for Labour during the 2017 general election, including whether it breached campaign spending rules. The number of people arrested over terrorism-related offences in Britain has risen by 54% to 400 in one of the most intense periods for attacks in recent history. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.11pm GMT 14:11 \nWilliamson's comments about killing all jihadis 'juvenile', says former DPP Lord Macdonald , a Lib Dem peer and former director of public prosecutions, has described Gavin Williamson\u2019s declaration that all Britons fighting with Islamic State should be killed rather than ever being allowed to return to the UK as \u201cjuvenile\u201d. He explained why in an interview on the Word at One.\n\nI think it is very important to understand that there are limits [to what the state can do.] In wartime soliders have immunity from prosecution for killing enemy combatants. But not in all circumstances. In wartime, if enemy soldiers have laid down their weapons and are fleeing or trying to surrender and their opponents kill them, that\u2019s likely to be a war crime. And the situation is going to be no different in Syria and Iraq. So it simply will not be lawful in all circumstances to kill jihadis, as the secretary of state seems to be suggesting.\nIf they\u2019ve laid down their arms, if they are fleeing, if they are trying to surrender, to hunt them down, as he put it, and kill them is likely to raise serious legal issues and perhaps legal liabilities for the people carrying out those killings. So I think his response needs to be a great deal more nuanced than it is. He hasn\u2019t been in the job very long, and maybe that explains why his response is so unnuanced ...\nA policy which says we will simply kill every individual who has travelled to Syria or to Iraq, even if they are surrendering, even if they have laid down their weapons, is really a policy that belongs in a Netflix series more seriously than it belongs in the range of policies that should be being applied by the UK government ...\nWe can\u2019t simply say that everyone who has gone to Iraq will now be hunted down and killed. That\u2019s a juvenile response. It\u2019s not a serious, grown-up policy response for a senior British government minister.\n\nKen MacDonald Photograph: Frank Baron for the Guardian \nThe Labour MP John Woodcock also condemned Williamson\u2019s comments. He said:\n\nInsecure Gavin Williamson is shooting from the hip to mask his inexperience and distract attention from the appalling cuts the government is about to inflict on our armed forces. The defence secretary risks endangering the lives of British troops with this fatuous posturing on returning British jihadis.\nIf he is not slapped down, any future enemy of Britain could say, \u2018Why should we respect the Geneva convention on captured British soldiers when the British don\u2019t respect it for their own citizens?\u2019\nThe Lib Dem defence spokesman Menzies Campbell also made the same point. He said:\n\nIn present circumstances it is not difficult to see that any member of the military that followed his advice could be subjected to court martial and prosecution.\nThe gung-ho opinions that he has expressed undermine the credibility of British armed forces in general and his office in particular. \nAnd Prof Philippe Sands , the internationally-renowned barrister, said the government should confirm that Williamson was not making policy. He told the Guardian:\n\nI was surprised the secretary of state\u2019s statement. It was inappropriate. It sounds as though we have or are on the cusp of having, on his terms, some sort of shoot-to-kill policy.\nIt sounds like he was shooting from the hip, it sounds like the words of an inexperienced minister, like someone speaking who has given no thought or reflection at all to the underlying issues, including the consequences of having such a policy. If you adopt that policy in relation to them, you effectively legitimising their actions in relation to us.\nWe need a confirmation from Number 10 Downing Street that the UK is committed to the totality of its legal obligations in domestic law and international law and it does not operate to shoot-to-kill policy in relation to people who violate criminal law.\nNumber 10 made it fairly clear earlier that Williamson was not speaking for the government in what he said. (See 12.35pm.) Reading the Daily Mail interview, it seems obvious that what Williamson said was more the political equivalent of pub talk than a new statement of security policy. Still, the Daily Mail will probably like the sound of it. Williamson\u2019s colleagues think he wants to be party leader one day and perhaps he\u2019s auditioning for the role of Daily Mail candidate. (The Mail will probably want to back a Brexiter, but it has reservations about Boris Johnson, so there is probably an opening ...)\nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.36pm GMT 13:36 \nSadiq Khan rules himself out as a future PM Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, has ruled out becoming prime minister.

She said:\n\nIt may well be that the case [for a second referendum on Brexit] becomes difficult to resist but I think there is a more immediate necessity and that is to stop this reckless UK government driving the entire UK over this cliff edge.\nI think the majority exists in the House of Commons if Labour gets its act together, and I think the majority exists across the whole of the UK to stop that happening. The sensible compromise option and the least damaging option for our economy is to stay within the single market and the customs union so everyone who is of that view should come together and make that happen.\nShe concluded by reminding the chamber that the current shambles only strengthened the case for independence, though noticeably avoided mentioning the \u2018I\u2019 word directly.\n\nAs long as we continue to allow our future to be in the hands of Tory governments in Westminster rather than having our future in our own hands we will always be at the mercy of reckless decisions taken by Tory government in Westminster.\n\nNicola Sturgeon.

I also don't spray the house for bugs or anything like that.\nOn another note...nothing has changed with her. She sees me walking by her enclosure and she follows. She is constantly on the lookout for food. I just fed her two days ago and she's was giving me that look again last night.

Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box \u2014 although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action. \n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" \nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. \nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" \nTrump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \n\"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron david miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilan goldenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill galston", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for a new american security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east security program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faith and freedom coalition", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:59.056+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "44462aea0c76257c8792921e84fd8928021be6cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_kNOYMWIthylTUGkFjTM60jqqdDuDF8RJFiSYF1P.W0FZpRjFs5U7rFUyHUr9q9Ef71B7piV_2WnNKhwzG4OdZfBhjKcjUpKfIEzBFWMziTd6ELeBTV0FAIh3UkpOibAo5B_12B3X4u3lJ_bawebkSYrfn24hJ5PGw9dOr.JjbSg--", "site_full": "www.independent.co.uk", "site": "independent.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/rss", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "The Independent - News", "title": "Brexit latest: Theresa May slaps down Philip Hammond over payment of \u00a345bn divorce bill in fresh cabinet split", "title_full": "Brexit latest: Theresa May slaps down Philip Hammond over payment of \u00a345bn divorce bill in fresh cabinet split | The Independent", "published": "2017-12-07T02:10:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 36, "participants_count": 24, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/10/15/may-hammond.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 568, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ab2bbeaca4f77a1e68e180e378097977fe4735cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_kNOYMWIthylTUGkFjTM60jqqdDuDF8RJFiSYF1P.W0FZpRjFs5U7rFUyHUr9q9Ef71B7piV_2WnNKhwzG4OdZfBhjKcjUpKfIEzBFWMziTd6ELeBTV0FAIh3UkpOibAo5B_12B3X4u3lJ_bawebkSYrfn24hJ5PGtsdU6Zp3V0CHonhQFJdmM", "ord_in_thread": 34, "author": "goodoledreary", "published": "2017-12-07T13:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "No i dont see that as racist but i do see it as economical suicide with losses that will dwarfe by a factor of 10 what we pay at present for Access to worlds largest trading bloc.

Is problematic from a prosecutorial standpoint.\nIn Abramski, the straw concept, was prior to this case considered to be intended to keep firearms from prohibited persons. ATF went outside the \"intent\" of the law. And relied on the \"written word\" and got enough Justices to go along. With their interpretation.\nWhat ATF did have a burden of proof of in Abramski. Was INTENT, which they showed with a paper trail to/from the uncle.\nIn the husband/wife community property scenario. It would be impossible for any prosecutor to prove intent. Outside of providing a husband's Email, etc, to his wife \"asking\" for her to buy the gun for him.\nAs a spouse, any and all verbal communications are \"privileged\". And as such, he/she cannot be compelled to disclose anything regarding the others spousal communications.\nThat would be a definite \"Non Starter\" for any prosecutor.\nJM2c The marital privilege is anything but absolute, though it would apply in most cases. Even if it were not, I agree that this would be a \"Non Starter\" that most prosecutors would avoid having to prosecute. I don't know that I understand your position on intent unless you mean that the prosecution would have to establish that at the time of purchase the one spouse bought it for the other spouse and not for themselve. Still, my understanding is that this forum is supposed to discuss what is and is not legal, and this point goes not to whether or not the purchase would be legal but the difficulty in successfully prosecuting the same.\nIf one was to consider the difficulty in proving intent, there are always those instances of the vengeful ex or, as they said in the old WW2 era films, \"loose lips sink ships\".\nI don't know that I would agree with you that the majority in Abramski ignored the intent of the law and followed the word. You seem to suggest that by doing so they acted improperly. The way I learned it long past is the Courts are supposed to construe the law according to its plain language unless to do so would render an absurd result and courts are only to consider the intent of the legislative body where the language is so ambiguous that its plain meaning cannot be ascertained.\nGiven the language in the 4473 concerning buying as a gift I think the better argument for the defense would be, should one be made an example of in a test case, that the law as applied to spouses is so ambiguous as to be a denial of due process.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:00.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "44462aea0c76257c8792921e84fd8928021be6cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_kNOYMWIthylTUGkFjTM60jqqdDuDF8RJFiSYF1P.W0FZpRjFs5U7rFUyHUr9q9Ef71B7piV_2WnNKhwzG4OdZfBhjKcjUpKfIEzBFWMziTd6ELeBTV0FAIh3UkpOibAo5B_12B3X4u3lJ_bawebkSYrfn24hJ5PGw9dOr.JjbSg--", "site_full": "www.independent.co.uk", "site": "independent.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/rss", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "The Independent - News", "title": "Brexit latest: Theresa May slaps down Philip Hammond over payment of \u00a345bn divorce bill in fresh cabinet split", "title_full": "Brexit latest: Theresa May slaps down Philip Hammond over payment of \u00a345bn divorce bill in fresh cabinet split | The Independent", "published": "2017-12-07T02:10:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 36, "participants_count": 24, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/10/15/may-hammond.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 568, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aa92f96a72ddf0b661448c9c10cd38659586f8a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_kNOYMWIthylTUGkFjTM60jqqdDuDF8RJFiSYF1P.W0FZpRjFs5U7rFUyHUr9q9Ef71B7piV_2WnNKhwzG4OdZfBhjKcjUpKfIEzBFWMziTd6ELeBTV0FAIh3UkpOibAo5B_12B3X4u3lJ_bawebkSYrfn24hJ5PGtsdU6Zp3V0KW2ODUd6UPI", "ord_in_thread": 35, "author": "Just A Thought", "published": "2017-12-07T13:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "What kind of stupid comment is that.

The hippocampal induction of IFN-\u03b1 was less marked and more variable. Nonetheless, there BTK inhibitor was an interaction between disease and poly I:C for this gene (F = 5.68, df 1, 14, p < 0.05). TLR3 mRNA was induced in the hippocampus both by poly I:C treatment and by ME7. Two-way ANOVA revealed a main effect of both poly I:C (F = 41.38, df 1, 14, p < 0.0001) and of ME7 (F = 24.3, df 1, 14 p = 0.0002) but there was no significant interaction, although \nTLR3 was induced further by poly I:C challenge in ME7 animals (one-way ANOVA, ME7 + poly I:C versus NBH + poly I:C p < 0.01 and versus ME7 + saline p < 0.001). RIG-I showed similar expression to IFN\u03b2, with main effects of disease (F = 59.21, df 1, 14, p < 0.0001) and of poly \nI:C (F = 351.86, df 1, 14, p < 0.0001) and a significant interaction of these two factors (F = 9.97, df 1, 14, p < 0.01). Thus anti-viral responses were amplified in ME7 + poly I:C animals with respect to NBH + poly I:C. These transcripts (IFN\u03b2, IFN\u03b1, TLR3, RIG-I) were also examined in the hypothalamus since this region is highly sensitive to circulating inflammatory mediators. Poly I:C induced robust transcription of all 4 genes in the hypothalamus, but this transcription was equivalent in ME7 and NBH animals. These data are shown in Fig. 1b. Two-way ANOVAs for these genes showed that there were main effects of poly I:C in all cases, but no effect of ME7 and no interaction between the two factors (F = 1.62, df 1, 14, p > 0.22 else in all cases). Thus, \nthe exaggerated anti-viral response of ME7 animals, to poly I:C, is present selleck chemical in the hippocampus, but not in the hypothalamus. The levels of IFN\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were elevated in the plasma of poly I:C-treated animals (6 h post-treatment) but were below detectable levels in both NBH and ME7 animals challenged with sterile saline (Table 1). Poly I:C groups were significantly different to relevant saline controls for IFN\u03b2 (p < 0.001), TNF-\u03b1 (p < 0.01) and IL-6 (p < 0.05) by Bonferroni post hoc tests. Treatment with poly I:C did not produce significantly different cytokine levels in NBH versus ME7 animals (p > 0.05 for all three cytokines). Therefore, systemic cytokine responses to poly I:C are not significantly different in animals with prior neurodegeneration. At the earliest time point examined (14 weeks post-inoculation with ME7, 4 h after poly I:C), poly I:C induced the predicted mild hyperthermic response in normal (NBH) animals but caused hypothermia in prion-diseased (ME7) animals. In addition, the later hypothermic phase was exaggerated in ME7 animals with respect to NBH animals treated with poly I:C (Fig. 2). Repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant effect of time (F = 5.66, df 4, 160, p < 0.0005), a significant effect of treatment (F = 9.29, df 3, 40, p < 0.0001) and an interaction of treatment and time (F = 6.46, df 12, 160, p < 0.0001).

Al Franken, a rising political star only weeks ago, reluctantly announced Thursday he's resigning from Congress, succumbing to a torrent of sexual harassment allegations and evaporating support from fellow Democrats. But he fired a defiant parting shot at President Donald Trump and other Republicans he said have survived much worse accusations. \n\"I of all people am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office, and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the full support of his party,\" Franken said. \nThe 66-year-old Minnesotan, a former \"Saturday Night Live\" comedian who made a successful leap to liberal U.S. senator, announced his decision in a subdued Senate chamber three weeks after the first accusations of sexual misconduct emerged but just a day after most of his Democratic colleagues proclaimed he had to go. His remarks underscored the bitterness many in the party feel toward a GOP that they say has made a political calculation to tolerate Trump and Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore, who've both been accused of sexual assaults that they've denied. \nIn largely unapologetic remarks that lasted 11 minutes, Franken said \"all women deserve to be heard\" but asserted that some accusations against him were untrue. He called himself \"a champion of women\" during his Senate career who fought to improve people's lives. \n\"Even on the worst day of my political life, I feel like it's all been worth it,\" he said. \nFranken's departure, which he said would occur in \"coming weeks,\" made him the latest figure from politics, journalism and the arts to be toppled since October. That's when the first articles appeared revealing sexual abuse allegations against Hollywood titan Harvey Weinstein and energizing the #MeToo movement in which women have named men they say abused or harassed them. \nDemocratic Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton will name a temporary successor, who will serve until a special election next November. \nFranken's comments appended a melancholy coda to the political career of the one-time TV funnyman who became one of his party's most popular and bellicose liberals. \nJust two days earlier, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., a civil rights hero who'd been the House's longest-serving current member, resigned after facing sexual harassment allegations of his own. The two departures underscored the party's determination to show no tolerance for such behavior, a strategy that can bring stunningly fast conclusions to political careers but that party leaders believe could give them high moral ground on a subject that's shown no sign of fading. \nOn a 2005 audio tape released shortly before last year's presidential election, Trump is heard talking about grabbing women, and several women accused him of sexual assaults. Women in Alabama have accused Moore of unwanted sexual contact and pursuing romantic relationships when they were teenagers and he was in his thirties during the 1970s. \nAsked about Franken's comment about him on Thursday, Trump merely replied, \"I didn't hear it, sorry.\" \nAt least eight women had accused Franken of inappropriate sexual behavior. Until this week, he'd said he'd remain in the Senate and cooperate with an investigation into his behavior. \nThe breaking point came Wednesday, when a former Democratic congressional aide said he forcibly tried to kiss her in 2006, an accusation he denied. Hours later, another woman said he'd inappropriately squeezed \"a handful of flesh\" on her waist while posing for a photo with her in 2009. \nThe accusations started last month when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan. She also released a photo of him with his hands at her breasts as she napped aboard a military plane. \nOn Thursday, Franken walked to the Senate chamber shortly before noon, hand-in-hand with his wife of 35 years, Franni. As he spoke, members of his family watched from the visitors' gallery, some sobbing. Franken said that thanks to them, \"I'm going to be just fine.\" \nAlmost two-dozen colleagues listened silently at their desks, some dabbing their eyes. Those watching were nearly all Democrats and many were women, including New Yorker Kirsten Gillibrand, who released the first of what became a flood of public statements Wednesday calling for Franken's resignation. Also present was Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, who one Democrat said had spent much of Wednesday persuading his friend to leave. \nAfter Franken spoke, many of his colleagues lined up to hug him. \nHe said he was leaving because he couldn't handle an ethics panel investigation while representing his state effectively. He said he'd remain an activist: \"I may be resigning my seat, but I am not giving up my voice.\" \nA star on \"Saturday Night Live,\" the Harvard-educated Franken was elected to the Senate in 2008 by 312 votes. In Washington, he distanced himself from his comedic background, largely avoided national reporters and burrowed into consumer issues. He found his voice as a sharp critic of Trump administration officials and has been listed as a potential 2020 presidential contender. \nHis announcement prompted immediate maneuvering for his seat. \nAmong the possibilities for Minnesota Gov. Dayton's temporary appointment is Lt. Gov. Tina Smith, a trusted Dayton ally. The winner of a special election in November 2018 would serve through the end of Franken's term in January 2021. \nMidterm elections are often difficult for the party that holds the White House, and Trump is deeply unpopular. But Hillary Clinton defeated Trump by just 1.5 points in the state, preserving a four-decade run for the Democrats in presidential elections. \n___ \nAP reporters Mary Clare Jalonick, Matthew Daly, Kevin Freking and Andrew Taylor in Washington and Kyle Potter in Minnesota contributed.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "franken", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "minnesot", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kirsten gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leeann tweeden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john conyers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "politico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruben kihuen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy klobuchar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buzzfeed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patty murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey weinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al franken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juliet linderman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay reeves", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate ethics committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota state fair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huffington post", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-nev.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-mich.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "birmingham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:01.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c4ff0beab00e7f553d4be51b87b5ef1021c75731", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_u2tlfIi70ZlEUizW5FtPWr2IB_zVHBGCCIqlT8whTJPhC9JvpPqtC90ks4c5hOYJbAB1mL.qA2g--", "site_full": "www.calguns.net", "site": "calguns.net", "site_section": "http://www.calguns.net/calgunforum/forumdisplay.php?f=349", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "How CA Laws Apply to/Affect Me - Calguns.net", "title": "Don't Make Mrs. Clause a Felon", "title_full": "Don't Make Mrs. Clause a Felon - Calguns.net", "published": "2017-12-05T11:31:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 32, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 16038, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "10579f758f7c4a2fbae902214a10fa1e15592a75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_u2tlfIi70ZlEUizW5FtPWr2IB_zVHBGCCIqlT8whTJPhC9JvpPqtC90ks4c5hOYIIZXQMpusLVIsWdetXC8XCr6cDz4BHEWE-", "ord_in_thread": 26, "author": "fiddletown", "published": "2017-12-07T02:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : A recent discussion concerning straw purchases and who is the actual buyer in California when a wife buys a gun as a gift for her husband go me thinking of how community property fit in with the rule that the gift recipient cannot provide the funds to the donor. The problem being if all the funds owned by the husband and wife are community property. This thread doesn't attempt to deal directly with that conundrum, but looks at the problem exclusive of the source of the purchase money. .... I think you're tripping over yourself here. See Family Code 751: Quote: : 751.The respective interests of each spouse in community property during continuance of the marriage relation are present, existing, and equal interests. Effectively, as a matter of community property law, when a spouse uses community property to buy something, he/she is using his/her money. See also Family Code 1100: Quote: : 1100.(a) Except as provided in subdivisions (b), (c), and (d) and Sections 761 and 1103, either spouse has the management and control of the community personal property, whether acquired prior to or on or after January 1, 1975, with like absolute power of disposition, other than testamentary, as the spouse has of the separate estate of the spouse.... Quote: : take shots ....The case never would have gone anywhere based on suspicion. It was the hard evidence that got him in trouble. The familiar dithering of the ignorant. You apparently don't understand the difference between committing a crime and getting away with it and doing things legally. When one commits a crime he is betting his freedom, future and fortune on not getting caught. But folks who commit crimes get caught in all sorts of ways -- often ways that were unexpected. The prisons are full of people who didn't expect to get caught.\nWhether there will be evidence which could convict the actor of the crime he committed depends on exactly what happened and how it happened. But it's difficult to do something without leaving tracks. Intent is an element of many crimes, and prosecutors prove intent to the satisfaction of juries all the time, often with circumstantial evidence.\nOne of the things we try to do here is help folks understand what sorts of conduct is criminal and what sorts of conduct is legal. If someone understands that what he is doing is a crime and decides nonetheless to bet his freedom, future, and fortune on not getting caught that will be his problem.\nAnd since you obviously don't understand Abramski and what constitutes an illegal straw purchase, see the following outline describing what constitutes an illegal straw purchase consistent with the U. S. Supreme Court ruling in Abramski v. US , 134 S. Ct. 2259 (2014).\nThe actual offense is violation of 18 USC 922(a)(6), making a false statement on the 4473 (specifically about who is the actual buyer).\nSee the ATF publication Federal Firearms Regulation Reference Guide, 2005, at page 165 (emphasis added): Quote: : 15. STRAW PURCHASES\nQuestions have arisen concerning the lawfulness of firearms purchases from licensees by persons who use a \"straw purchaser\" (another person) to acquire the firearms. Specifically, the actual buyer uses the straw purchaser to execute the Form 4473 purporting to show that the straw purchaser is the actual purchaser of the firearm. In some instances, a straw purchaser is used because the actual purchaser is prohibited from acquiring the firearm. That is to say, the actual purchaser is a felon or is within one of the other prohibited categories of persons who may not lawfully acquire firearms or is a resident of a State other than that in which the licensee's business premises is located. Because of his or her disability, the person uses a straw purchaser who is not prohibited from purchasing a firearm from the licensee. In other instances, neither the straw purchaser nor the actual purchaser is prohibited from acquiring the firearm.\nIn both instances, the straw purchaser violates Federal law by making false statements on Form 4473 to the licensee with respect to the identity of the actual purchaser of the firearm, as well as the actual purchaser's residence address and date of birth. The actual purchaser who utilized the straw purchaser to acquire a firearm has unlawfully aided and abetted or caused the making of the false statements. The licensee selling the firearm under these circumstances also violates Federal law if the licensee is aware of the false statements on the form. It is immaterial that the actual purchaser and the straw purchaser are residents of the State in which the licensee's business premises is located, are not prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms, and could have lawfully purchased firearms ... So, if --\nX says to Y, \"Here's the money; buy that gun and then we'll do the transfer to me [when I get back to town, or whenever else].\", or\nX says to Y, \"Buy that gun and hold it for me; I'll buy from you when I get my next paycheck.\"\nor anything similar, if Y then buys the gun, he is not the actual buyer. He is buying the gun as the agent of X, on his behalf; and X is legally the actual buyer. If Y claims on the 4473 that he is the actual buyer, he has lied and violated 18 USC 922(a)(6). His subsequently transferring the gun to X in full compliance with the law, does not erase his prior criminal act of lying on the 4473.\nSome more examples --\nIf X takes his own money, buys the gun and gives the gun to someone else as a gift, free and clear without reimbursement of any kind, X is the actual purchaser; and it is not a straw purchase.\nIf X takes his money and buys the gun honestly intending to keep it for himself and later sells it to another person, X is the actual purchaser; and it is not a straw purchase.\nIf X takes his money and buys the gun intending to take it to the gun show next week to see if he might be able to sell it to someone at a profit, X is the actual purchaser; and it's not a straw purchase. He may, however have other problems if he manages to sell the gun at the gun show, and the transfer there isn't handled properly. He might also have problems if he does this sort of thing too frequently, and the ATF decides he's acting as a dealer without the necessary license.\nIf X takes his money and buys the gun with the understanding that he is going to transfer the gun to Y and that Y is going to reimburse him for it, X is not the actual purchaser. He is advancing X the money and buying the gun for and on behalf of Y, as Y's agent.

It is hard enough make any sense out of CA law, but throw in community property issues and . . .\nRe FC 1100, the fact that one has the power of disposition over CP as if it was that spouse's SP is not to say it is SP.

I would point out where Abramski discusses in dictum that the the law was meant to cover sales on the secondary market nor gifts. That the driver behind Ambraski was the idea that the ultimate gun owner should undego a background check. In many states there is none if the firearm is not resold by a dealer. In California there is still not as complete a screening of the giftee if they be a spouse and both spouses are CA resident, but at lest there is some screening since the transfer has to be reported on an OP LAW to the DOJ.\nI just saw the post accusing you of rudeness. I wouldn't say that you pull any punches and haven't been known to be a bit brusque, but not sure that I would say rude.

I think that any evidence that a spouse is being used to DROS a firearm to mask the identity of the true purchaser could be found to be a straw purchase. Perhaps in the light of day I may begrudgingly agree that the mere use of cp by one spouse to buy a gun as a gift for the other is not enough to establish a straw purchase. I am not so sure of the results if there is evidence that for any reason the one spouse is avoiding a DROS. Okay, I think that's an important, but subtle point. The issue under federal law is whether the person doing the paperwork is the actual buyer or only the agent of the actual buyer. The source of the money can be evidence probative of an agency relationship. There could be other facts that would establish such relationship other than or in addition to the source of funds. So the question breaks down into two parts: (1) What's going on?; and (2) What is the evidence that leads one to the conclusion that's what's going on?\nThe thing is that in California, the source of funds isn't that useful when the person doing the paperwork is a spouse and the money is community property. In other words the use of community funds is not evidence that the spouse is acting as the agent of the other spouse because the spouse doing the paperwork is perfectly free to use community funds as his/her own.\nIn California there's also the problem of the transaction being a sham in violation of 27515 and 27520 to avoid a dealer transfer under 27545. But again the use of community funds can't really be evidence of that because the spouse doing the paperwork is perfectly free to use community funds as his/her own.\nIn either case a use of community funds isn't really evidence of a 18 USC 922(a)(6) or PC 27515/27520 violation.

Gupta was relieved from his post on December 5 and directed to report to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs. Last week, a woman police sub-inspector and a constable were suspended after they allegedly offered bribe to Gupta to the inquiry into complaints against them. The constable was facing a departmental inquiry in a case related to indiscipline. Besides, a departmental inquiry was on against the sub-inspector after she along with another constable allegedly assaulted a man near Panaji in 2014 and took away his car. \"The DIG was relieved by the state government and he will report to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, following allegations of bribery against him,\" Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar told reporters here yesterday. \"The departmental inquiries conducted by Gupta would be reviewed by a senior officer who will take charge of the matter,\" he said.

Socialism, as its name suggests, is based on a belief in the notion of action through the community, in the idea that individuals do not stand alone, and that it is not merely morally right that we should think of ourselves in this way but that it is the most rational way to organise our lives. The world we face today makes a socialist approach all the more relevant: from new technology to the arms race, co-operation surely makes more sense than competition. \u201d\n\u201c Post-war Britain has seen two big changes. First, and partly as a result of reforming Labour governments, there are many more healthy, wealthy and well-educated people than before. In addition, employment has switched from traditional manufacturing industries to a more white-collar, service-based economy. The inevitable result has been that class identity has fragmented. Only about a third of the population now regard themselves as \u2018working-class\u2019. Of course it is possible still to analyse Britain in terms of a strict Marxist definition of class: but it is not very helpful to our understanding of how the country thinks and votes. In fact, of that third, many are likely not to be \u2018working\u2019 at all: these are the unemployed, pensioners, single parents \u2013 in other words, the poor.\nA party that restricts its appeal to the traditional working class will not win an election. That doesn\u2019t entail a rejection of socialism\u2019s traditional values: but it does mean that its appeal, and hence its policies, must address a much wider range of interests. \u201d\n\u201c The trick for Labour is not to follow them and abandon the notion of government and collective provision: but to re-fashion it so that real power is exercised by people and not by institutions or bureaucracies. The fundamental error of Dr Owen (and, oddly, of David Steel since the election, though not before it) has been to surrender to Mrs Thatcher\u2019s philosophy and say that power can only be devolved through the market. The 1990s will not see the continuing triumph of the market, but its failure. \u201d\n\nRoy Hattersley: http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/24/labour2001to2005.news\n\u201c Tony Blair discovered a big idea. His destiny is to create a meritocracy. Unfortunately meritocracy is not the form of society which social democrats want to see. ... A Labour government should not be talking about escape routes from poverty and deprivation. By their nature they are only available to a highly-motivated minority. The Labour Party was created to change society in such a way that there is no poverty and deprivation from which to escape . ... The certain knowledge that the Conservative Party would be a worse government than Labour is not enough to sustain what used to be a party of principles. ...

Your interpretation of what he is doing boggles the imagination . . . running an errand for someone is BS. . . he mentioned waiting the 30 days to put it in his name for the simple reason that the gun is for him and not his wife . . . that he thought that what you call \"dropping off a deposit\" was buyhing the gun evidences his intention to buy it for himself . . . there is no face to face if the wife does the DROS application since she is not the actual buyer.

While you are comfortable just calling people liars. I would simply state the facts that are relevant to the issue.

His admiration for the gun doesn't disqualify her from purchasing it.\nEven Abramski would not have been convicted if he had bought the gun and decided when he got home that he didn't like the grips. That is a perfectly reasonable explanation that has certainly happened legitimately on occasion. That case revolved basically on the fact that he admitted to lying on the form and said he didn't think it mattered and that a check from his uncle was written two days before he even bought the gun and said \"Glock 19\" on it proving that he never intended to keep the gun when he bought it.\nThe case never would have gone anywhere based on suspicion.
