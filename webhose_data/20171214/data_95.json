\u2013 \n\nAtletico will be able to register new players for the first time in 18 months from January 1 after a FIFA imposed transfer ban with nearly 100 million euros already committed to the signings of Costa and Spanish international Vitolo. \n\nThe club also made a huge financial effort to put key players Antoine Griezmann, Koke and Saul Niguez on improved contracts during the transfer ban. \n\nSpanish media reported on Wednesday that at least two and possibly three players will need to be sold in January to help Atletico balance the books. \n\nFringe players such as Kevin Gameiro, Nicolas Gaitan and Sime Vrsaljko are more likely to leave immediately. \n\nHowever, Atletico\u2019s fear remains that Griezmann, the club\u2019s top scorer for the past three seasons, will be lured away come the summer with his 100 million euro buyout clause easily attainable for interested giants like Manchester United, Barcelona or Real Madrid. \n\n\u201cCompletely the opposite,\u201d Simeone responded when asked if he was concerned about an exodus after Tuesday\u2019s 1-1 draw at Chelsea. \u201cWe turn the negatives into the positives.\u201d \n\nAtletico will at least be able to count on their charismatic coach, who extended his own deal to 2020 in September. \n\n\u2013 Europa League consolation \u2013 \n\nThe last time Atletico failed to make it out of the group stages of the Champions League was back in 2009/10, when they went to win the first of two Europa League titles in three seasons. \n\n\u201cThere is no point crying over spilt milk, look forward to the Europa League,\u201d Madrid sports daily AS\u2019s editorial said on Wednesday. \n\n\u201cThe final won in Hamburg (in 2010) built the foundations for a glorious period for Atletico.\u201d \n\nTwo years later in Bucharest, it was Simeone\u2019s first trophy as Atletico boss. A year on they won the Copa del Rey, and two years later La Liga. \n\nTrophies have dried up in recent seasons, though, with the Spanish Super Cup in 2014 the last time Atletico collected silverware. \n\n\u201cIt opens up to us a new challenge,\u201d insisted Simeone. \n\nAnother Europa League title could ultimately kickstart another cycle of success.

Have you written and sent all your cards yet? I\u2019m afraid to say I haven\u2019t even started! This watercoloured background was quick to paint and showcases the large sentiment from the Wishing You Love set by Neat & Tangled beautifully. I\u2019ve linked all supplies at the end of this post. Compensated affiliate links used. \nThere are two ways you can create a background such as this. You can stamp the sentiment   watercolour card and white heat emboss before painting and letting the heat embossing resist the paint. This allows the paint to puddle around the heat embossing and gives nice variation. However, you can get paint dots drying on the heat embossing which need wiping off afterwards. Alternatively, and this is the method I chose for this card, you can watercolour a loose background and then when dry stamp and emboss the sentiment. \nI painted a layer of Daniel Smith Quinacridone Coral , and Rose of Ultramarine on Arches   then dried that layer before painting an Indigo layer over the top. I dried the panel again and then splattered with the paint colours I\u2019d used and in addition a silvery Finetec paint and Winsor & Newton White Gouache . Then I stamped the sentiment from the Wishing You Love   and white heat embossed . I trimmed the watercoloured panel down slightly and mounted on an A2 side folding white card base . I then die cut a Stitched Slope and a house and couple of trees using the Warm Winter Scene die from white card . I foam mounted these over the bottom of the panel and then accented with Sweetheart and Snowfall sequins.

Marvin Gentry-USA TODAY Sports \nIt looks as if new Tennessee Volunteers athletic director Phillip Fulmer is zeroing in on assistants from around the SEC to replace the recently fired Butch Jones as the Volunteers\u2019 head football coach. \nESPN\u2019s Chris Low reported earlier on Wednesday that a trio of SEC coordinators emerged as candidates for the vacant job. That list included defensive coordinators Jeremy Pruitt (Alabama), Mel Tucker (Georgia) and Kevin Steele (Auburn). \nNow according to this report from Yahoo! Sports CFB insider Pete Thamel, Pruitt has emerged as the front runner for the job. \nSource: Alabama DC Jeremy Pruitt has emerged as the leading candidate at Tennessee. \n\u2014 Pete Thamel (@PeteThamel) December 7, 2017 \nIt\u2019s interesting that all three candidates have ties to the Nick Saban coaching tree. But Pruitt is the one most connected to both Saban and the job in Knoxville. \nThe 43-year-old assistant played college ball at Middle Tennessee before transferring to Alabama. \nAfter taking on a variety of coaching roles at both the high school and the college levels, Pruitt earned his first job as a defensive coordinator for Florida State in 2013. He also held the same position at Georgia from 2014-15 before moving on to the Crimson Tide. \nIt\u2019s not yet known whether Pruitt will take the job, and a formal offer has not been made. Coming off a 4-8 season, Tennessee\u2019s head coaching search has been an absolute dumpster fire . It led to the firing of former AD John Currie , only to see Fulmer head back to Knoxville after coaching the football program from 1992-2008. \nConsidering what we saw with the entire Greg Schiano mess and after many other candidates turned down the job , absolutely nothing is etched in stone here. \nBut Tennessee will have to make a decision here soon. It\u2019s late in the process, and the new coach will seemingly already be working from behind to build a new staff and begin the recruiting process.

All the major players featured, and the storyline was progressed substantially, revealing a faux third stage in Elliot's plan to disable Evil Corp - and the Dark Army, from the inside out. Kyle Bradstreet & Courtney Looney wrote \" eps3.8_stage3.torrent \", with showrunner Sam Esmail directing as per usual.\n\nAn extensive 90 second recap reel before the hour's proceedings immediately indicated that this episode would contain many more moving parts than last week's internal examination of Elliot did. Phillip Price, Tyrell, Whiterose and her assistant, Dom, Santiago, and Irving all featured, and had an impact on the new direction the series looks to be taking.\n\nThat direction consists of Elliot being much more firmly in charge than we've previously known. In Season 1 he was depicted as being in charge of his own nucleus of hackers, while in Season 2 that was eroded as Evil Corp was fleshed out and the Dark Army became known. In Season 3, Elliot has been smaller than ever, but that small, socially inept guy looks to have given himself a major advantage over the opposition.\n\nIn a flashback which opens proceedings, we see Gideon Goddard pitching his company, Allsafe's services to three E Corp executives - Phillip Price, Terry Colby, and Tyrell Wellick. Colby was the most vocal, not hesitating to dish out rather rude remarks toward Goddard and other subjects. Assisting Goddard was Angela, and when she brought some paperwork to Goddard, it was then that Allsafe's business hopes were confirmed, with Price immediately developing an infatuation with her. We also saw Tyrell as being nothing more than a pretty face despite his expertise. Price was going to do business with Allsafe, whether he liked it or not.\n\n\n\nIn present day, Tyrell arrived back home for the first time since Irving was in charge of him, and he had been held in custody by the FBI. He was visibly devastated at the loss of his wife and son, and the other events we saw which depicted Tyrell as much less of a player than we had previously understood, making it quite a bit easier to feel sorry for a guy who is basically powerless and well out of his depth.\n\nObedience will be your only task at my company. \nThat being said, the confrontation Tyrell had with Mr. Robot was absolutely spectacular. It was one of several dialog-heavy long take scenes, and had the most unusual anticlimax when Price stopped by, interrupting Tyrell as he was about to beat the daylights out of Mr. Robot - if not worse. \n\nWhat the fuck is Stage 3? \nIn Elliot's world, things were drastically different to last week. Following the receipt of Trenton's email after her death, Elliot and Darlene now had something to chase that could entirely undo the 5/9 hack. In a fascinating series of scenes and dialog, Darlene met with Dom in the same bar we saw them in a few weeks ago. Since Darlene wasn't an informant for the FBI and Dom any longer, they were free to do what they pleased, which included getting drunk, and eventually led to sex between them. I was really pleased to see Dom retain her smarts and not be taken advantage of. She put her gun and ID card in her safe before beginning, and even then she wasn't sure she wanted to proceed with Darlene because she isn't known to be lesbian or bisexual. When she thought Dom was asleep, Darlene broke into the safe to steal the ID card, but Dom caught her in the act, meaning it was down to the FBI headquarters for both of them, to an interview room mere meters away from Darlene's goal: the servers which stored the data kept by Romero.\n\n\n\nThis was another sizzling showdown between Dom, Darlene, and Agent Santiago, Dom's boss. Darlene knew the Dark Army owned the FBI, but Dom is only now beginning to click that Santiago may be under their control, given his apprehension to back Dom's pleas for further investigations in this and in past episodes.\n\nMeanwhile, Elliot had another plan. He requested a meeting with Whiterose to propose \"Stage 3\" - the next stage in his supposed plan to destroy Evil Corp. Noting that E Coin was becoming more commonplace and standardized, eradicating it would be the best way to terminate Evil Corp for good. However the Dark Army wasn't really prepared to go that far, and when Elliot met with Whiterose's right hand man, they swept his computer which gave Elliot access to the Dark Army's worldwide network. Just like he did with the FBI, and others prior, Elliot has internal access to an enemy, and is now in a position to take complete control. An awesome turn of events for sure.\n\nI don't think their target is E Corp any more. I think it is us. \nThe bad news for Elliot, however, is that Whiterose finally decided that Elliot is no longer of any use, much like his father was years earlier. Elliot can now be killed, so he must now work to avoid that while trying to dismantle the Dark Army. This is a genuine race against time which I'm super excited to watch.\n\n\n\nAside from the flashback from Allsafe days, Angela barely featured in present day proceedings. The little we saw of her indicated she is spiraling in the wake of the 5/9 attack. She had hundreds of photos stuck to the walls of her apartment - and she had painted said walls black where she could reach. The last we see of her, she is walking along the street, and bumps into the fake artist pedaling his CDs on the street - the same one whose CD was responsible for her computer getting hacked in the first season. She's wiser this time, but a moment later, men in suits come with a van to collect her. \n\nHeading into next week's season 3 finale, as per usual, anything could happen. With Elliot now wielding more power than he's ever had, along with arguably more motivation than before, he is now in a position to both take down Whiterose and the Dark Army, and reinstate Evil Corp. If both of those things occur (though highly unlikely that they will happen in one episode), I will be staggered by the storytelling that has taken place.\n\nPerhaps something that can be almost guaranteed will be another scene after the finale's credits, which is something that was pioneered in Season 1 and continued in Season 2. These scenes in previous seasons have proved vital in the longer term, so we will have something to go on looking ahead to Season 4, though we all know there will be so much in store for this season finale, and for what is a highly likely fourth season.\n\nFor now, that's where I'll end this review. This episode was a fantastic way to build to the finale. I loved the expanded cast, and the story continued building right through. Next week's season finale will no doubt be spectacular.

And as readers will know, it is not just about the Gulf. \nFlydubai will be feeding passengers to and from Emirates\u2019 long-haul network out of Dubai to Africa, Asia and Australasia. \nIn years to come we can expect Flydubai to be operating these two-class narrowbody aircraft to other European destinations as both it and Emirates seek new opportunities. \nService from Krakow will enable Polish travellers to gain global access without the need to depart Warsaw. It will also enable overseas visitors to more easily access this historic city which is one of the most popular visitor destinations in Poland. \nFlights into Catania will, in particular, grant overseas travellers easier access to Sicily without the need to make time-consuming transfers in Rome. \nExpect to see much more of Boeing\u2019s B737 Max 8 in future.

Those tensions emerged as China moves away from its role as the world\u2019s factory to a more modern, consumer-driven economy, the IMF said. The financial sector is critical in facilitating that transition, but in the process it evolved into a more complicated and debt-laden system. \u201cThe system\u2019s increasing complexity has sown financial stability risks,\u201d the fund said in the 2017 China Financial Sector Stability Assessment report released on Thursday morning Asia hours. The report was a culmination of the fund\u2019s several visits to China between October 2015 and September 2017. \nThe assessment is intended to identify key sources of systemic risk in the financial sector so that policies can be implemented to enhance resilience to shocks and problems that could spread across the globe. The first tension in China\u2019s financial system, according to the IMF, is the rapid build-up in risky credit that was partly due to the strong political pressures banks face to keep non-viable companies open, rather than letting them fail. Such struggling firms have, in recent years, taken on more debt to achieve growth targets set by the authorities. The overall debt-to-GDP ratio in the Asian economic giant grew from around 180% in 2011 to 255.9% by the second quarter of 2017, data by the Bank for International Settlements showed. The rise coincided with a slowdown in productivity growth and pressures on asset quality in the banking system \u2013 increasing the risks faced by the Chinese economy. \nThe second tension identified by the IMF is that risky lending has moved away from banks to the less-regulated parts of the financial system, commonly known as the \u201cshadow banking\u201d sector. That adds to the complexity of the financial sector and makes it more difficult for authorities to supervise activities in the system, the IMF said. And the third issue identified by the international organization is that there\u2019s been a rash of \u201cmoral hazard and excessive risk-taking\u201d because of the mindset that the government will bail out troubled state-owned enterprises and local government financing vehicles. An example is the \u201cimplicit guarantees\u201d that financial institutions offer when selling products to retail investors. That is a situation where the financial product sold are not guaranteed, but banks almost always compensate investors for principal losses by dipping into their own capital. \nThe People\u2019s Bank of China, in response to the IMF assessment, said in a statement on its website that it disagrees with some points in the report but the fund\u2019s recommendations are \u201chighly relevant in the context of deepening financial reforms\u201d in the country. One of the points the Chinese central bank said it disagrees with is the conclusion that many banks lack the ability to withstand shocks. The IMF\u2019s stress tests found that 27 out of 33 banks studied were under-capitalized. But the PBOC said the Chinese financial system is resilient. \nNiceHash is the largest bitcoin-mining exchange. Well, its coins have been found.

Our home brewing expert, Jared Kovacs comes to the rescue with the FBC Home Brewer's Gift Guide that will make both your home brewer and you happy: new toys for them, better beer for you! \n**This post contains affiliate links. In plain English that means that when you click on the link and make a purchase, we receive a small commission. It does not alter the price you pay but it helps us run this site and support the work that Canadian food bloggers do. ** \nT\u2019was a few weeks before Christmas and all through the house, not a home brewer was stirring, not even a little bit? \nOk, listen, I'm no poet, but I do love the holidays. I always have. When I was a kid, I used to wake up at 3 or 4 in the morning, sneak downstairs, open my stocking (even though I wasn't supposed to), restuff it, and then wake up my family, all because SANTA had come. I know, I was every parent's worst nightmare. Y'all will be glad to hear that I now sleep in until at least 6 a.m. ... I'm currently 31. \nHere are seven gifts that would make any homebrewer, including me (wink-wink, nudge-nudge, family and friends) pine with envy. 1. Mastering HomeBrew by Randy Mosher \nI love this book . I've read multiple homebrew books and by far this was the most beneficial. The information is presented in an easy-to-understand format, and there are lots of diagrams and information charts that are easy to reference when in need. And the best part? It's in colour, so it's also visually stunning. 2. Dry Hopper \nIs your beloved homebrewer a hop head? Dry hopping is definitely something they need to try if they haven't already. This dry hopper is made for five-gallon kegs, but could easily be converted for use during fermentation. Don't know what that means? It's ok, they will, and they'll put this to good use. 3. Growler Filler \nI recently purchased this growler filler for my keg system so I can take homebrew wherever I go. It hooks right into my taps perfectly. If your homebrewer has a keg system with taps, this will undoubtedly make a great stocking stuffer. 4. Carboy Mop/Cleaner \nCleaning up is by far the worst part of home brewing. Any home brewer will welcome anything that helps make clean up faster and easier especially when it comes to carboys. Sure, you can spend 10 to 15 minutes scrubbing them clean with a clumsy carboy brush, but why would you when you can spend 1 to 2 minutes with this carboy mop/cleaner attached to a drill? The brewer in your life will scream your praises with this gift. RELATED: Home Brewing Essentials: Understanding Yeast 5. Refractometer \nRefractometers are used to measure alcohol content in each brew. They\u2019re simple to use and use only a few small drops of wort and beer compared to a hydrometer. I love mine and swear by it. 6. Brau Supply's Unibrau All in One Electric System V.3 \nI'd love to get Brau's All in One Unibrau Electric System , and I think your home brewer would like one too. It takes up very little space compared to what you'd need if you went a more traditional route. Check out Home Brew Essentials: Grains and Equipment to see the difference. Brau's Unibrau All in One System is easy to use, and best of all, it can be used in any home setting \u2014 apartments, condos, houses and tiny houses are all fair game with this all in one setup. Finally, they're a Canadian company based in Vancouver. Whenever I get a chance, I try to support my fellow Canadians. 7.

The group has two holiday shows scheduled this weekend at the rec center. PHOTO BY ANDREA VON HOHENLEITEN Two concerts this weekend will feature music about light at the darkest time of the year. \nThe Jamestown Community Chorus will perform at 4 p.m. Saturday and 3 p.m. Sunday at the recreation center, 41 Conanicus Ave. \nThe production, aptly titled \u201cDecember Lights,\u201d is a departure for the chorus, which is typically straightforward choral music. According to conductor B.J. Whitehouse, these shows will feature theatrics to compliment the voices, from a mummer\u2019s play to an English ritual dance. Singers will get into the act by dressing in eclectic folk costumes to enhance the atmosphere. \nThe concert begins in darkness with a recitation \u201cThe Shortest Day,\u201d a poem that captures the joy of winter solstice. As the show progresses, the hall continues to brighten with candles, menorahs and yule logs, mimicking real life as the days continue to get longer. \nAmong the highlights, members will perform the \u201cAbbotts Bromley Horn Dance.\u201d The performance, which features real deer antler, originated in the small English village of Staffordshire during the Middle Ages. \nThe children\u2019s chorus will sing about hunting the wren, a tradition that is celebrated on the day after Christmas. The St. Stephen\u2019s Day ritual features \u201chunting\u201d a fake wren and then setting the bird atop a decorative pole. After an instrumental ensemble accompanies the dancers to a 13th century song titled \u201cAlle Psallite,\u201d the chorus will perform folk silliness with an authentic mummer\u2019s play overseen by Father Christmas, played by Whitehouse. \nThe production also will include an original arrangement of Gounod\u2019s \u201cLes Pifferari\u201d by accompanist Dawn Chung. The North Kingstown pianist will then join the chorus for Ola Gjiello\u2019s \u201cNorthern Lights.\u201d Other pieces include \u201cStrike up Your Instruments of Joy\u201d and \u201cHark! The Herald Angels Sing.\u201d \nThe production includes audience sing-alongs of familiar carols before culminating with a beautiful arrangement of \u201cSilent Night.\u201d \nTickets are available at Jamestown Hardware, The Secret Garden and Baker\u2019s Pharmacy. Admission is $15 in advance, $17 at the door. The student price is $12. Tickets also are available through PayPal at the chorus\u2019 website.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "monda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ola gjiello", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "b.j. whitehouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrea von hohenleiten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dawn chung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gounod", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "whitehouse", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "paypal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbotts bromley horn dance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamestown community chorus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central baptist church", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herald angels", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jamestown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north kingstown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "staffordshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "secret garden", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:15:16.044+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "00c85cb787171bb863ea05600e833ca3d63d13eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UfypjZxRov_9bMYXGzwhFAIefAiQ5n_q62sSqaeeAWN27Rw9AwGVbC1ESnO8zvv8f2.TMnuWatoOQ9xDN4sRQAofIdPAJjm_ujZHDYmrZUJMG2w9fTgwQnj", "site_full": "dealsbestjopchunm.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://dealsbestjopchunm.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "DealsBestJopchunm", "title": "Best Deal!

FILE PHOTO: Football Soccer - Southend United v Sheffield United - Sky Bet Football League One - Roots Hall - 30/3/16 Sheffield United manager Nigel Adkins before the match Mandatory Credit: Action Images / Matthew Childs Livepic Former Southampton manager Adkins replaces Russian Leonid Slutsky, who was sacked on Sunday with the Tigers recording just four wins in 20 games to sit three points above the relegation zone in 20th position. \u201cAdkins will oversee his first training session this morning and will take charge of the side for Saturday\u2019s home game against Brentford.\u201d Hull said on their website. (www.hullcitytigers.com) The Briton, who was sacked as Sheffield United manager in 2016, is the fourth permanent manager appointed at Hull since Steve Bruce\u2019s exit in July that year with the club in danger of being relegated for the third time in four seasons. Adkins could stop the club from a free fall, having previously helped multiple teams rise through the tiers, starting with Scunthorpe United, who climbed to the Championship in 2007 and again in 2009. The 52-year-old took charge at Southampton in 2010 and led them to back-to-back promotions as he guided them up to the Championship in 2011 and the Premier League in 2012 but was fired half-way through the subsequent season. Adkins joined Reading in 2013 but was sacked at the end of 2014 with the club well adrift of the Championship playoff spots.

Consecration is a sour dark ale aged in a Cabernet Sauvignon barrel. It is aged for 4 to 8 months with currants and brettanomyces. You can look for rich flavors of chocolate truffle, spice, tobacco, currants, and a bit of Cabernet. \nWhat sets this kit apart from any other kit out there, is the fact that we include a chunk of an actual consecration barrel in each one! Whether or not the bacteria from the original beer will form their own colony in your beer is hard to prove right or wrong. Either way, we think it is pretty cool!\u201d \nAvailability of Consecration Kits at MoreBeer can be touch and go (guessing this has to do with sourcing actual Consecration Barrels, but that\u2019s only a guess).

Dec 06 2017 \nGustave Courbet The wave 1870 \n\n\nChapter 1 of this five-part series by Dr. D is here: Bitcoin Doesn\u2019t Exist \u2013 1 \nChapter 3 will follow shortly. \n\n\nDr. D: You have to understand what exchanges are and are not. An exchange is a central point where owners post collateral and thereby join and trade on the exchange. The exchange backs the trades with their solvency and reputation, but it\u2019s not a barter system, and it\u2019s not free: the exchange has to make money too. Look at the Comex, which reaches back to the early history of commodities exchange which was founded to match buyers of say, wheat, like General Mills, with producers, the farmers. But why not just have the farmer drive to the local silo and sell there? Two reasons: one, unlike manufacturing, harvests are lumpy. To have everyone buy or sell at one time of the year would cripple the demand for money in that season. This may be why market crashes happen historically at harvest when the demand for money (i.e. Deflation) was highest. Secondly, however, suppose the weather turned bad: all farmers would be ruined simultaneously. \nSuppose the weather then recovered: the previous low prices are erased and any who delayed selling would be rich. This sort of random, uncontrolled, uninsurable event is no way to run an economy, so they added a small group of speculators into the middle. You could sell wheat today for delivery in June, and the buyer would lock in a price. This had the effect of moderating prices, insuring both buyers AND sellers, at the small cost of paying the traders and speculators for their time, basically providing insurance. But the exchange is neither buyer, seller, nor speculator. They only keep the doors open to trade and vet the participants. What\u2019s not immediately apparent is these Contracts of Wheat are only wheat promises, not wheat itself. Although amounts vary, almost all commodities trade contracts in excess of what is actually delivered, and what may exist on earth. I mean the wheat they\u2019re selling, millions of tons, haven\u2019t even been planted yet. So they are synthetic wheat, fantasy wheat that the exchange is selling. \nA Bitcoin exchange is the same thing. You post your Bitcoin to the exchange, and trade it within the exchange with other customers like you. But none of the Bitcoin you trade on the exchange is yours, just like none of the wheat traded is actual wheat moving on trucks between silos. They are Bitcoin vouchers, Bitcoin PROMISES, not actual Bitcoin. So? So although prices are being set on the exchanges \u2013 slightly different prices in each one \u2013 none of the transfers are recorded on the actual Bitcoin Ledger. So how do you think exchanges stay open? Like Brokers and Banks, they take in the Bitcoin at say 100 units, but claim within themselves to have 104. \n\nWhy? Like any other fractional reserve system, they know that at any given moment 104 users will not demand delivery. This is their \u201cfloat\u201d and their profit, which they need to have, and this works well as far as it goes. However, it leads to the problem at Mt. Gox, and indeed Bear Sterns, Lehman and DeutscheBank: a sudden lack of confidence will always lead to a collapse, leaving a number of claims unfulfilled. That\u2019s the bank run you know so well from Mary Poppins\u2019 \u201cFidelity Fiduciary Bank\u201d. It is suspected to be particularly bad in the case of Mt. Gox, which was unregulated. How unregulated? Well, not only were there zero laws concerning Bitcoin, but MTGOX actually stands for \u201cMagic The Gathering Online eXchange\u201d; that is, they were traders of comic books and Pokemon cards, not a brokerage. Prepare accordingly. \nThe important thing here is that an exchange is not Bitcoin. On an exchange, you own a claim on Bitcoin, through the legal entity of the exchange, subject only to jurisdiction and bankruptcy law. You do not own Bitcoin. But maybe Mt.Gox didn\u2019t inflate their holdings but was indeed hacked? Yes, as an exchange, they can be hacked. Now you only need infiltrate one central point to gain access to millions of coins and although their security is far better, it\u2019s now worth a hacker\u2019s time. Arguably, most coins are held on an exchange, which is one reason for the incredibly skewed numbers regarding Bitcoin concentration. Just remember, if you don\u2019t hold it, you don\u2019t own it. In a hack, your coins are gone. \nIf the exchange is lying or gets in trouble, your coins are gone. If someone is embezzling, your coins are gone. If the Government stops the exchange, your coins are gone. If the economy cracks, the exchange will be cash-strapped and your coins are frozen and/or gone. None of these are true if YOU own your coins in a true peer-to-peer manner, but few do. But this is also true of paper dollars, gold bars, safe deposit boxes, and everything else of value. This accounts for some of the variety of opinions on the safety of Bitcoin. So if Polinex or Coinbase gets \u201chacked\u201d it doesn\u2019t mean \u201cBitcoin\u201d was hacked any more than if the Comex or MF Global fails, that corn or Yen were \u201chacked\u201d. The exchange is not Bitcoin: it\u2019s the exchange. There are exchange risks and Bitcoin risks. Being a ledger Bitcoin is wide open and public. How would you hack it? You already have it. And so does everybody else. \nSo we\u2019ve covered the main aspects of Bitcoin and why it is eligible to be money. Classically, money has these things: \n1. Durable- the medium of exchange must not weather, rot, fall apart, or become unusable. \n2. Portable- relative to its size, it must be easily movable and hold a large amount of value. \n3. Divisible- it should be relatively easy to divide with all parts identical. \n4. Intrinsically Valuable- should be valuable in itself and its value should be independent of any other object. Essentially, the item must be rare. \n5. Money is a \u201cUnit of Account\u201d, that is, people measure other things, time and value, using the units of value to THINK about the world, and thus is an part of psychology. Strangely that makes this both the weakest and strongest aspect of: \n6. \u201cThe Network Effect\u201d. Its social and monetary inertia. That is, it\u2019s money to you because you believe other people will accept it in exchange. \nThe Score: \n1. Bitcoin is durable and anti-fragile. As long as there is an Internet \u2013 or even without one \u2013 it can continue to exist without decay, written on a clay tablet with a stylus. \n2. Bitcoin is more portable than anything on earth. A single number \u2014 which can be memorized \u2013 can transport $160B across a border with only your mind, or across the world on the Internet. Its portability is not subject to any inspection or confiscation, unlike silver, gold, or diamonds. \n3. Bitcoin is not infinitely divisible, but neither is gold or silver, which have a discrete number of atoms. At the moment the smallest Bitcoin denomination or \u201cSatoshi\u201d is 0. 1 Bitcoin or about a millionth of a penny. That\u2019s pretty small, but with a software change it can become smaller. In that way, Bitcoin, subject only to math is MORE divisible than silver or gold, and far easier. As numbers all Bitcoin are exactly the same. \n4. Bitcoin has intrinsic value. Actually, the problem is NOTHING has \u201cintrinsic\u201d value. Things have value only because they are useful to yourself personally or because someone else wants them. Water is valuable on a desert island and gold is worthless. In fact, gold has few uses and is fundamentally a rock we dig up from one hole to bury in another, yet we say it has \u201cintrinsic\u201d value \u2013 which is good as Number 4 said it had to be unrelated to any other object, i.e. useless. Bitcoin and Gold are certainly useless. Like gold, Bitcoin may not have \u201cIntrinsic value\u201d but it DOES have intrinsic cost, that is, the cost in time and energy it took to mine it. Like gold, Bitcoin has a cost to mine measurable in BTU\u2019s. As nothing has value outside of human action, you can\u2019t say the electric cost in dollars is a price-floor, but suggests a floor, and that would be equally true of gold, silver, copper, etc. In fact, Bitcoin is more rare than Rhodium: we mine rare metals at 2%/year while the number of Bitcoins stops at 22 Million. Strangely, due to math, computer digits are made harder to get and have than real things. \n5. Bitcoin is a unit of account. As a psychological effect, it\u2019s difficult to quantify. Which comes first, the use of a thing, or its pricing? Neither, they grow together as one replaces another, side-by-side. This happened when gold replaced iron or salt or when bank notes replaced physical gold, or even when the U.S. moved from Pounds and Pence to Dollars and Cents. At first it was adopted by a few, but managed to get a critical mass, accepted, and eventually adopted by the population and entirely forgotten. At the moment Bitcoin enthusiasts do in fact mentally price things in Bitcoins, especially on exchanges where cross-crypto prices are marked vs BTC. Some never use their home currency at all, living entirely according to crypto-prices until home conversion at the moment of sale, or as hundreds or thousands of businesses are now accepting cryptocurrencies, even beyond. For them it is a unit of account the way Fahrenheit is a unit within the United States. \n6. Bitcoin has the network effect. That is, it is widely accepted and publicly considered money. It\u2019s in the news, has a wide following worldwide, and exchanges are signing up 40,000 new users a month. It\u2019s accepted by thousands of vendors and can be used for purchases at Microsoft, Tesla, PayPal, Overstock, or with some work, Amazon. It\u2019s translatable through point-of-sale vendor Square, and from many debit card providers such as Shift. At this point it is already very close to being money, i.e. a commonly accepted good. Note that without special arrangements none of these vendors will accept silver coins, nor price products in them. I expect if Mark Dice offered a candy bar, a silver bar, or a Bitcoin barcode, more people would pick the Bitcoin. In that way Bitcoin is more money than gold and silver are. You could say the same thing about Canadian Dollars or Thai Bhat: they\u2019re respected currencies, but not accepted by everyone, everywhere. For that matter, neither are U.S. dollars. \n\nNote what is not on the list: money is not a unit created or regulated by a central authority, although governments would like us to think so. In fact, no central authority is necessary or even desirable. For centuries the lack of monetary authority was historic fact, back with medieval markets through to private banks, until 1913, 1933, 1971, and the modern evolution into today\u2019s near-total digital fiat. Besides the technical challenge, eliminating their overhead, oversight, control and corruption is the point of Bitcoin. And right now the government\u2019s response to Bitcoin is a strange mixture of antipathy, ignorance, oppression, and opportunity. At $160 Billion it hardly merits the interest of a nation with a $500 Billion trade deficit, and that\u2019s spread worldwide. \nThis leads into one of the spurious claims on Bitcoin: that it\u2019s a refuge for drug smugglers and illegal activities. I assure you mathematically, that is not true. According to the U.N. the world drug trade is $435B, 4 times the total, and strictly theoretical value of Bitcoin, coins locked, lost, and all. Besides if you owned $160B coins, who would you transfer them to? You\u2019re the only user. $435B/year can only be trafficked by major banks like as HSBC, who have paid public fines because money flows that large can\u2019t be hidden. This is so well-known the U.N. suggested the drug-money flows may be one reason global banks were solvent in \u201808. Even $160B misrepresents Bitcoin because it had a 10-fold increase this year alone. So imagine $16B total market cap. That\u2019s half the size of the yearly budget of Los Angeles, one city. Even that overstates it, because through most of its life it\u2019s been around $250, so imagine a $4B market cap, the budget of West Virginia. \nSo you\u2019re a drug dealer in illicit trades and you sell to your customers because all your buyers have Bitcoin accounts? Your pushers have street terminals? This doesn\u2019t make sense. And remember as much as the price of Bitcoin has risen 40-fold, the number of participants has too. Even now, even with Coinbase, even with Dell and Overstock, even with BTC $10,000 almost no one has Bitcoin, even in N.Y.C. or S.F.. So who are these supposed illegal people with illegal activities that couldn\u2019t fit any significant value? \nThat\u2019s not to say illegal activities don\u2019t happen, but it\u2019s the other half of the spurious argument to say people don\u2019t do illegal acts using cash, personal influence, offshore havens, international banks like Wells Fargo, or lately, Amazon Gift Cards and Tide Detergent. As long as there is crime, mediums of value will be used to pay for it. But comparing Bitcoin with a $16B market cap to the existing banking system which the U.N. openly declares is being supported by the transfer of illicit drug funds is insanity. \nLet\u2019s look at it another way: would you rather: a) transfer drugs using cash or secret bank records that can be erased or altered later or b) an public worldwide record of every transaction, where if one DEA bust could get your codes, they could be tracked backwards some distance through the buy chain? I thought so. Bitcoin is the LEAST best choice for illegal activities, and at the personal level where we\u2019re being accused, it\u2019s even worse than cash. \nWe showed that Bitcoin can be money, but we already have a monetary and financial system. What you\u2019re talking about is building another system next to the existing one, and doubling the costs and confusions. That\u2019s great as a mental exercise but why would anyone do that? \nIn a word: 2008. \nIt\u2019s probably not an accident Bitcoin arrived immediately after the Global Financial Crisis. The technology to make it possible existed even on IRC chat boards, but human attention wasn\u2019t focused on solving a new problem using computer software until the GFC captured the public imagination, and hackers started to say, \u201cThis stinks. This system is garbage. How do we fix this?\u201d And with no loyalty to the past, but strictly on a present basis, built the best mousetrap. How do we know it\u2019s a better mousetrap? Easy. If it isn\u2019t noticeably better than the existing system, no one will bother and it will remain an interesting novelty stored in some basements, like Confederate Dollars and Chuck-e-Cheez tokens. To have any chance of succeeding, it has to work better, good enough to overcome the last most critical aspect money has: Inertia. \nSo given that Bitcoin is unfamiliar, less accepted, harder to use, costs real money to keep online, why does it keep gaining traction, and rising in price with increasing speed? No one would build a Bitcoin. Ever. No one would ever use a Bitcoin. Ever. It\u2019s too much work and too much nuisance. Like any product, they would only use Bitcoin because it solves expensive problems confronting us each day. The only chance Bitcoin would have is if our present system failed us, and fails more every day. They, our present system-keepers, are the ones who are giving Bitcoin exponentially more value. They are the ones who could stop Bitcoin and shut it down by fixing the present, easy, familiar system. But they won\u2019t. \n\nWhere has our present system gone wrong? The criticisms of the existing monetary system are short but glaring. First, everyone is disturbed by the constant increase in quantity. And this is more than an offhand accusation. In 2007 the Fed had $750B in assets. In 2017 they have $4.7 Trillion, a 7-fold increase. Where did that money come from? Nowhere. They printed it up, digitally. \n\n\nThe TARP audit ultimately showed $23 trillion created. Nor was the distribution the same. Who received the money the Fed printed? Bondholders, Large Corporations, Hedge Funds and the like. Pa\u2019s Diner? Not so much. So unlike Bitcoin, there not only was a sudden, secret, unapproved, unexpected, unaccountable increase in quantity, but little to no chance for the population to also \u201cmine\u201d some of these new \u201ccoins\u201d. Which leads to this: \n\n\nNear-perfect income disparity, with near-perfect distribution of new \u201ccoins\u201d to those with access to the \u201cdevelopment team\u201d, and zero or even negative returns for those without inside access. Does this seem like a winning model you could sell to the public? Nor is this unique to the U.S.; Japan had long ago put such methods to use, and by 2017 the Bank of Japan owns a mind-bending 75% of Japanese ETFs: \n\n\nSo this unelected, unaccountable bank, which creates its coin from nothing without limit or restraint, now owns 75% of the actual hard labor, assets, indeed, the entire wealth HISTORY of Japan? It took from the Edo Period in 1603 through Japan-takes-the-world 1980s until 2017 to create the wealth of Japan, and Kuroda only 6 years to buy it all? What madness is this? \nNor is Europe better. Mario Draghi has now printed so much money, he has run out of bonds to buy. This is in a Eurozone with a debt measuring Trillions, with $10 Trillion of that yielding negative rates. That\u2019s a direct transfer from all savers to all debtors, and still the economy is sinking fast. Aside from how via these bonds, the ECB came to own all the houses, businesses, and governments of Europe in a few short years, does this sound like a business model you want to participate in? \nSo the volume of issuance is bad, and unfairness of who the coins are issued to is as bad as humanly possible, giving incredible advantages to issuers to transfer all wealth to themselves, either new or existing. \nBut if the currency is functional day-to-day, surely the issuance can be overlooked. Is it?

The Success of India\u2019s Equity Market \nThe potentials of the Asian economy cannot be undermined especially when they are driven by the success and prospects of thriving economies such as that of India. \nThe equity market is one of any nation\u2019s gems. In India, the corporate sector represents roughly 14% of its gross domestic product (GDP). As a developing economy, this is already a compelling figure. In leading economies such as the US, the corporate sector represents 70% of national GDP. Indian Equity Market \nThe Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) are the two main stock exchanges in the country. They represent about 4% of India\u2019s GDP, with more than half of all publicly traded companies in the country listed on the BSE and the NSE. BSE \nThe BSE, founded in 1875, is the oldest stock exchange not just in India but in Asia as well. It is the first entity to get a permanent recognition in India under the Securities Contract Regulation Act of 1956. Presently, it is the 11th biggest stock exchange globally with a total market capitalization of $1.70 trillion as of January 2015. With a speed of six microseconds, the BSE is also one of the fastest stock exchanges globally. \nThe SENSEX 30 is the index monitoring the top 30 stocks on the BSE based on various factors such as liquidity and market capitalization. \nThe BSE first attained a four-digit figure in July 1990. When the Bhartiya Janta Party won the General Elections in October 1999, it first attained the 5,000 mark. The BSE first attained the 10,000 mark in February 2006 and the 20,000 mark in December 2007. When the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 broke out, the BSE had posted its biggest losses, declining more than 2,000 points in just two consecutive trading days in January 2008. Indiabulls Real Estate Limited is a stock traded on the Indian stock exchange. \nNonetheless, the BSE was able to recover from the turmoil. In March 2015, it first attained the 30,000 mark. Shortly after, it had once again posted one of its biggest one-day drop, losing 1,741 points in August 2015. The decline is primarily attributed to the devaluation of yuan. China is the biggest economy in Asia, which is why its economic downturn had a huge dent in the entire equity market of the region. NSE \nWhile the BSE is the first stock exchange in Asia, the NSE, founded in 1992, on the other hand, is the stock exchange that introduced electronic trading system in India. Because of its establishment, India had begun embracing and shifting to fully automated stock exchanges that are more efficient, reliable, and convenient. Indiabulls Real Estate Limited has relatively good liquidity. \nThe NIFTY is the index monitoring the top 50 companies across more than 20 sectors on the NSE based on different factors, particularly market capitalization. \nIndia is one of Asia\u2019s leading economies. With its growth prospects and potentials, the growth opportunities seem limitless as well. Consequently, investing in the Indian stock market is highly advised nowadays, given the thriving success of both the BSE and NSE. Professional analysts might be interested how this will affect Indiabulls Real Estate Limited. \nMore recent Indiabulls Real Estate Limited (NSE:IBREALEST) news were published by: Economictimes.Indiatimes.com which released: \u201cIndiabulls Real Estate tanks 10% after promoters sold 3.3 crore shares\u201d on June 22, 2017.

These stories became beliefs that I carried around for a long time. Beliefs like, \u201cI\u2019m not good enough ,\u201d \u201cRelationships are painful,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have a say,\u201d \u201cI need someone else to show me I\u2019m worthy,\u201d and \u201cI need to be perfect to receive love\u201d (just to name a few).\nAs a conscious adult, I\u2019ve done a lot of healing work and spiritual development around this, and am proud of the growth I\u2019ve experienced between where I was then and where I am now. But even still, I have setbacks. We all do.\nNone of us are immune to the fears and self-doubt that pop up when \u201clife happens.\u201d None of us are safe when the ground we\u2019ve worked so hard to establish gets ripped out from us. \nAfter lots of self-development and work around relationships and love, I recently declared to the Universe that I was no longer afraid of being alone and that I was no longer afraid of being vulnerable and my \u201ctrue self\u201d in a future relationship. So, the Universe delivered. Big time.\nI met someone new. He wasn\u2019t like the other men I\u2019ve dated\u2014men who are safe and stable, and who give me a sense of being in control of the situation. He was uncharted territory for me. Hard to read. Mysterious. Kept me guessing.\nHe would surprise me with nice gestures like showing up with sunflowers, sending me unexpected notes about how beautiful I am, you know\u2026 the works. Not to mention the sex. THE SEX! For the first time, possibly in my whole life, I felt really seen, appreciated, valued and truly beautiful while having sex. There was nothing awkward or uncomfortable or weird or threatening about it. I had met Mr. Perfect\u2026 or so I thought.\nWhat I know now that I didn\u2019t recognize then was that this guy was an assignment. The Universe heard me loud and clear when I announced that I was ready to be alone and/or in a vulnerable relationship (which is actually a very confusing declaration to make in the first place, so\u2026 no wonder stuff got weird!), and so I was sent this guy\u2014let\u2019s refer to him as Mr. Perfect from here on out\u2014as a test.\nMr. Perfect was an opportunity for me to put into practice all of the things I had learned about myself over the past twenty-five years. \nLet\u2019s just say that I failed that test. Miserably.\nAfter an all-out eight-day binge on this guy, we were both like a couple of strung-out addicts, totally manipulative and controlling and hopeless about our futures, but pretending everything was just groovy. We were practically playing house together when we hadn\u2019t even known about the other\u2019s existence just a month earlier.\nSomewhere throughout the week with Mr. Perfect, my energy shifted. I went from this high-vibe, loving, independent, strong version of myself, to this weird, controlling, self-conscious, anxious, creepy version of me. I went from Jennifer Aniston status to that chick in Mean Girls who\u2019s obsessed with Regina George way too quickly, and my old limiting beliefs started to take over.\nSuddenly, I was operating from that old, abusive relationship version of me. \nThe version of me who thought that being vulnerable in a relationship meant getting hurt.\nThe version of me who thought that the guy needs to control everything, and that I am not safe to speak up about what I really want, because you never know how he\u2019s going to react.\nThe version of me who felt uncomfortable in her own skin , so tried really hard to look pretty, say the right thing, and always do something more in an effort to be noticed.\nThe version of me who thought that I needed a man to \u201csave me,\u201d or that he was the one answer to all of my problems in life.\nYou can only race like that for so long until you crash.\nAnd so, eight days of passionate sex, cute notes, sleepless nights, hours of butterflies in my stomach, several dinners, one brunch, way too much tequila, and two bouquets of flowers later, we bottomed out. Both of us.\nMr. Perfect and I took a crash course in \u201cHow to Not Date as Intentional, Conscious Human Beings 101.\u201d Our worlds both went spinning\u2014his, with a huge f*ck up at work, likely the result of us spending too much time together; mine, reversing to harmful coping behaviors that used to show up when I was younger.\nWhen I got the text from Mr. Perfect that started with \u201cWe need to talk,\u201d I went into a downward spiral of emotion and drama. He wanted to end things. I wanted to die. I literally paced outside my apartment building for three hours trying my very best to not have a heart attack.\nI questioned everything. Was any of it real? Did I mean anything to him? How could I screw this up? How could I fix it? I needed to fix it. How could I mess up such a perfect thing? \nBut suddenly, I had a beautiful recognition. I noticed that there was a shift. In my heart space, I could feel the presence of my Higher Self. The part of me that\u2019s connected to something bigger. The part of me that knows these stories of not being good enough are complete BS.\nAnd just like that, I was no longer living in the stories that were sending me into a near panic attack . I was above that. I knew that I was better than that. That I deserve more. That it wasn\u2019t my fault. That I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. That I was still just as worthy as love and acceptance and beauty as anyone else on this planet.\nIn that moment, I forgave myself.\nI forgave myself for the behavior that caused him to end things.\nI forgave myself for the fact that I let it get to the point where we even engaged in an eight-day binge on each other.\nAnd most importantly, I forgave myself for all the negative and self-doubting talk, limiting beliefs, and lame stories I told myself when it happened.\nI saw that the stories were keeping me stuck. I saw that they made me revert back to this old version of me that I no longer was. And I saw that I had the awareness and the power now to intentionally choose to believe a different story instead. \nI chose to believe that this story was no longer serving me, and that I could rise above it.\nThat I actually didn\u2019t need a man to \u201cfix\u201d me or to complete me, but that I had actually been doing that work on my own all along.\nI decided that I was done with this belief of not being good enough.\nI was soooo done.\nI decided then and there to stay committed to this path of personal growth and transcendence, because I see now how all of the pain and struggles that I\u2019ve been through actually happened for me, not to me.\nAll of it was for a reason.\nYou can do the same. Everything that you\u2019ve been through\u2014every negative thought or limiting belief or fear that you\u2019ve had that\u2019s kept you from what you want the most in life\u2014it\u2019s all within your power to change. If you decide that you deserve it.\nHealing is not linear . There will be highs and lows, laughs and tears, moments of total bliss and moments of complete uncertainty and self-doubt. But your Higher Self is there through it all, and S/he wants to see you come out stronger through each and every assignment that the Universe throws your way. \nS/he is cheering you on from the sidelines and always there for support as your #1 fan, no matter what crazy stuff comes across your path. And that person, that part of you, needs you to show up to these assignments.
