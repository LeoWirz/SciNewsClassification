Venus/Mercury together in the 7th will often cause issues in relationships when it runs though. It gives a lot more flexibility to a person in their relationships that is troublesome for \"committed\" relationships.\nI wouldn't say they don't get invested but they aren't as likely to get hung up on any one relationship.\nAlso Moon with Jupiter although they are in the 6th and with Sun which will cause some trouble...but generally speaking nice as well.\nIn division related to romantic relationships Mars is ruler with Mars, Venus and Mercury in first. So that Venus/Mercury nice combo will show up well there although their dignity isn't great so it will cause him loss of romantic relationships ultimately. Strong Mars there though which will likely give more magnetism. Jupiter ends up in 6th in rather meh dignity though could be worse. So being expansive, generous, \"nice\", his philosophical views...general Jupiter things (I'm not reading the specifics here too deeply...) will cause him obstacles and delays in romantic relationships (or even children possibly) but it will be slightly overcome in time. Moon in 8th in this division will cause breaks and losses of relationship due to being too changeable, fickle and fond of new things (nature of the Moon).\nIn division related to general friendships etc rising sign is in Gemini so again we have that Mercury/Venus nature. Jupiter Moon still together in Pisces so the actions they take towards others are going to have that nice influence too.\nSo more or less, yes I would say genuinely nice. He DOES have a Mars/Saturn same-sign conjunction though so that will normally be a bit less than nice when it activates...at least it is not tight...but all the other factors are by far going to out dominate that.\nProbably not great for a steady romantic relationship though.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:14.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d718ead9c77db865a1914743850457ec40ca6b00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_dtEioaMbbw3avT7T6N6_yLdKV6EcbdN0TFFEQukW.4eIE91PuC7iwTAZKxFb9Nk6_XqF0pIUsYvGYuwAtGZhBlgwx3qj60zo-", "site_full": "www.darelasisi.co.uk", "site": "darelasisi.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.darelasisi.co.uk/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Welcome to Dare Lasisi's blog!", "title": "Happy Birthday, Ajegbile Ajedotun Enoch(JR), An Open Letter From Daddy.", "title_full": "Happy Birthday, Ajegbile Ajedotun Enoch(JR), An Open Letter From Daddy.", "published": "2017-12-07T11:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d718ead9c77db865a1914743850457ec40ca6b00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_dtEioaMbbw3avT7T6N6_yLdKV6EcbdN0TFFEQukW.4eIE91PuC7iwTAZKxFb9Nk6_XqF0pIUsYvGYuwAtGZhBlgwx3qj60zo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dare Lasisi (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "Happy Birthday, Ajegbile Ajedotun Enoch(JR), An Open Letter From Daddy.", "text": "\n\nHello son,\n\nFour years ago when you were born I was very happy. I couldn't believe I'm finally a father. As I held you in my arms I wanted a better life for you. A life filled with lots of possibilities.\n\nI called you Ajegbile Ajedotun Enoch (JR) Abolade not because I wanted you to be like me, no! I did because you remind me of who I was and why I took most of the risks I took. Coupled with the fact that you took my face, it was like staring at the baby version of me.\n\n\nYou may not be able to grasp the import of this letter now but I know as you read it over and again as you grow up, you'll understand more.\n\nI love you. I want you to internalise that. I also want the best for you. I know our desires will clash as time goes on and it will look as if I'm overbearing on you, don't worry. Just know that it's coming from the heart of a father that loves his son.\n\nAs at when I'm writing this letter I've observed that you love cartoons and super heroes. It was like that for me too. Just that I want you to be the hero in real life. Bringing solutions to your world and helping the helpless.\n\nI would have loved you to be an entrepreneur like me but I've noticed you love acting like a doctor. However, whatever you choose to be, I just want you to be the super hero to your world and you have my full backing.\n\nFour things I want you to never forget : \n\n1. God should be number one in your life. \n2. Never joke with family. Family is everything no matter your differences \n3. Take risks. Be willing to dare. \n4. I will always love you.

With the pair having dominated the most prestigious individual prize in world football over the course of the last decade, their collective tally is set to be taken to 10 on Thursday. Messi currently leads the way on five victories to Ronaldo\u2019s four, but it appears that the Portuguese forward is set to equal the Argentine\u2019s haul.   Having already claimed the FIFA Best Award for 2017 and topped the Goal 50, Ronaldo has always been the leading contender  on a 30-man shortlist to capture the Ballon d\u2019Or  , and Nike appear to have readied themselves for his coronation. Paying homage to Ronaldo\u2019s previous successes, the new boots have already added 2017 to the 32-year-old\u2019s roll of honour. It remains to be seen whether that scenario will play out, but there is not long to wait now. The Ballon d\u2019Or ceremony is set to take place in Paris on Thursday around 18:00 UK time  , with former France international David Ginola on hand to dish out the top prize \u2013 which is voted for by a group of 173 journalists from around the world. Ronaldo\u2019s claims to the crown have already been talked up by those he works alongside at Real Madrid, with  Blancos boss Zinedine Zidane backing his star forward to emerge victorious  . He said: \"Ronaldo's human, just like us but he is very different at times. He has no limits, really. \"The fact that he's going to win his fifth Ballon d'Or explains that. It's just amazing. He deserves it as well. I'm sure Cristiano is going to win his fifth Ballon d'Or. \"It doesn't surprise me. He wants more and more. He has the ambition to win a sixth or a seventh.\u201d Article continues below Real president Florentio Perez added  : \"Ronaldo is one of our great symbols. \"He is the leading goalscorer in our history. A few days ago, he won his second 'The Best' and this week he is going to win his fifth Ballon d'Or.\" The collection of another trophy would mark a fitting end to another record-breaking week for Ronaldo, with his goal in a Champions League clash with Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday seeing him  become the first man in the history of the competition to net in all six games of the group stage  .

I started working in the insurance industry right after graduation, then after about a year in the field I was in a bad accident that had me off for a year to a year in a half. I'm blessed to have amazing parents who were by my side throughout my entire recovery and got me thru that bad period without any debt, but everything I had saved was gone.\nI've been back to working full time for over a year now and recently moved to a new city and started a new position within the same industry. Relying heavily on commissions I knew that I would have to cut back on things until I built clientele back up, but I can't seem to keep my head above water.\nLuckily I get a base pay (around 30k) but I really struggle to make my paychecks stretch. Even though 30k isn't much, I feel like I should be able to make my dollars go further given how much spending I've cut back on.\nI get paid twice a month and it seems like as soon as I get my check, I pay my bills, then bam... it's gone. I haven't saved a single dollar within the last year and it's killing me. I feel like I'm doing everything I can... I have a roommate so all the rent related bills are split, my car payment is less than 200 bucks, I've only been paying the minimums on my credit cards (which is also killing me) and only using my debt card in order to not rake up more debt. I've always been a shopaholic and I cut out any shopping and spending that isn't absolutely necessary. I pack my lunch everyday and I eat out on my dime at cheap places maybe 1-2 times per month. The real killer has been my health insurance... over $300 per month, which I can't afford to pay anymore and I'm unfortunately going without until my employee benefits kick in.\nSo where can someone in my shoes begin? Is it even possible at this point I'm at right now?\nI know that once I get rolling in my new position I will be better off than I was before. However, even though I have the prior knowledge and experience, the new agent I work for has very detailed marketing systems and processes that I'm currently training on so it could be a few more months before I really get going.\nIt's so important to me that I get a grip on my finances and move in a positive direction... I always thought I would be a lot further than I am today. Getting engaged is right around the corner and will probably happen any day now. We're planning to get married in 2019, and although my boyfriends income could more than compensate what money I don't have, it's so huge to me that I start having something to show for myself and I want to be able to bring a chunk to the table.\n submitted by /u/sass-n-class\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:16.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b15e72256a644cba03465c521f71064461c86701", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSCskm_gl44z6blma4ry8vRtww8JFElt.NADt2TDjBIs_7ny96e2uT7.NsGLTRGz5sWicnOyJHcMe54YCYTn5o8LaOFuOwJY_KLUlojP9y2Xwzjntl2ubIUMiDvWH3ziOwNh5FD3DNJrw--", "site_full": "www.dealnews.com", "site": "dealnews.com", "site_section": "http://s1.dlnws.com/dealnews/rss/todays-edition.xml", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping"], "section_title": "DealNews - Today's Edition", "title": "Neato Botvac WiFi Self-Charging Robot Vacuum for $400 + free shipping", "title_full": "Neato Botvac WiFi Self-Charging Robot Vacuum for $400 + free shipping", "published": "2017-12-07T10:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdlnws.a.ssl.fastly.net/image/upload/f_auto,t_xlarge,q_auto/content/kzaiwhepdmqfxbjm6jvi", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2013, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b15e72256a644cba03465c521f71064461c86701", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSCskm_gl44z6blma4ry8vRtww8JFElt.NADt2TDjBIs_7ny96e2uT7.NsGLTRGz5sWicnOyJHcMe54YCYTn5o8LaOFuOwJY_KLUlojP9y2Xwzjntl2ubIUMiDvWH3ziOwNh5FD3DNJrw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "Neato Botvac WiFi Self-Charging Robot Vacuum for $400 + free shipping", "text": "Neato Botvac WiFi Self-Charging Robot Vacuum Last verified 29 min ago As one of its daily doorbusters, Best Buy offers the Neato Robotics Botvac Connected WiFi Self-Charging Robot Vacuum for $399.99 with free shipping .

The other machine built trails will follow by early 2018 and we\u2019ll reopen the other trails over summer as they are finished. \n\u201cWe may be opening the doors quietly today but this weekend we\u2019re planning a whole lot of festivities.

support for Nigeria, EFCC December 7, 2017 \nBy Prudence Arobani \n\nNew York \u2013 The U.S. Government has pledged to continue its support to the anti-corruption crusade of the Nigerian Government and particularly to strengthen the EFCC in this regard. \nThe U.S. Department of State stated this at the Global Forum on Asset Recovery at Washington, D.C, co-hosted with the UK Government in demonstration of continued commitment to preventing and combatting corruption globally. \nThe event is being attended by Nigerian Government officials led by the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami and representatives of the Nigerian civil society organisations. \nThe department said since 2013, the U.S. government had provided foreign assistance to increase the Nigerian government\u2019s capacity to investigate and prosecute corruption and financial crime cases, including asset forfeiture and anti-money laundering. \nThe state department added that its programmes also sought to bolster Nigerian civil society\u2019s capacity to ensure transparency and accountability in government. \n\u201cOver the past three years, the United States has funded a project with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to mentor officials investigating and prosecuting money laundering crimes. \n\u201cThese include on asset forfeiture and counter financing of terrorism, in addition to providing technical assistance to the Nigerian judiciary. \n\u201cWe will continue to work with the EFCC to further strengthen EFCC institutional development,\u201d the state department said. \nThe U.S. government funds the Open Government Partnership\u2019s (OGP) Support Unit through a joint grant between the Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). \nThey work with civil society and governments to develop commitments aimed at countering corruption and promoting transparency. \nThe U.S. also funded a project which led to the drafting of Nigeria\u2019s OGP National Action Plan. \nThis was carried out through collaboration with EFCC, the ICPC, Nigeria Police Force, and several civil society organisations. \n\u201cThe U.S. foreign assistance also supported outreach efforts through infographics and social media on corruption-related issues. \n\u201cThese supports make public data from Nigerian anti-corruption agencies more accessible, and training Nigerian journalists on best investigative journalism practices,\u201d the state department said. \nAccording to the World Bank, over 20 billion dollars is stolen by corrupt officials annually. \nThe U.S. said: \u201cThis is money that should be used to ensure the sustainable development of these countries for essential services such as schools, hospitals, and roads. \n\u201cRather than lining the pockets of corrupt officials, these funds should help grow economies and improve the well-being of the people of these countries. \n\u201cTo help prevent and combat kleptocracy, U.S. assistance helps strengthen transparency and accountability within government institutions\u201d. \nSince 2016, the Department of State and USAID have dedicated more than 115 million dollars annually to a wide range of foreign assistance efforts to counter corruption. \nThese include capacity building of foreign governments to create stronger laws and more effective institutions; investigate, prosecute, and secure convictions for corruption offences.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

Something that Luke Cage knows all too well. He may be the defender of the common man and always ready and willing to fight for and defend those who have been downtrodden and subjugated by society, but the nature of his powers and how and why they were gifted and granted to him means that deep inside, he\u2019s still plagued by doubt, insecurity and a nagging feeling that maybe he doesn\u2019t deserve to be where he is and who he is. Being the good man that he is though, when Doctor Noah Burstein, the scientist who transformed his life, dies, Cage doesn\u2019t think twice about it, packs his bag and heads to Dr Burnstein\u2019s funeral to pay his respects. \nIt\u2019s a decision that he comes to regret, as his presence doesn\u2019t so much upset the apple cart as smash it to pieces when he finds himself mired in a conspiracy of unethical human experimentation and caught in the middle of an underground business set up to capitalise on the work and theories of his much lamented creator. Talking about Noah, Cage soon comes to doubt everything that he thought he knew about his \u201cfather\u201d when he discovers that he isn\u2019t as unique as he always thought he was and isn\u2019t the biggest dog in the yard anymore. Cast adrift in the company of strangers, all of whom are working to their own agenda\u2019s, Cage can\u2019t trust anyone as struggles to uncover the truth about the death of the man who turned Carl Lucas into Luke Cage. And the more he finds out, the less he wants to know. \nLook, I\u2019m going to be honest with you, David F. Walker is one my go to four colour writers and as far as I\u2019m concerned, he can do no wrong. And Sins of the Father just reinforces my boundless faith in him, as he effortlessly fuses the raw adrenaline fueled excitement of Shaft and the more thoughtful and inquisitive elements of Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein in an intelligent, balanced, character driven story in which plot and action share centre stage and are given equal billing on the marquee. It\u2019s all wrapped up and tied together by Nelson Blake II\u2019s hyper-realistic art that makes Sins feel more like you\u2019re watching a film than reading a book. Yeah, he\u2019s that good. I knew there was a reason that I dig the hell out of Luke Cage. In fact, there\u2019s a whole load of them.

It is a privelage and an honor to be one of your... \" - Chris Nelson View Sign NELSON, Thomas (TJ) Thomas \"TJ\" Nelson passed away at home surrounded by his loving family on December 1, 2017. He was 86, a proud third-generation Sonoma County resident born in Petaluma to parents Clyde and Rose (Nonella) Nelson. TJ was one of six children: the late Mildred Nelson King, the late Clyde Nelson Jr., the late Rolfe Nelson, brother John Nelson (Jean) and sister Joan Nelson Elam (Lee). TJ was married for 66 years to his childhood sweetheart, the love of his life Dorothy \"Scooter\" Hardin Nelson. TJ also leaves five children - Kathy Story (Joe), Rolf Nelson (Becky), Eric Nelson (Martha), Kurt Nelson, Chris Nelson, and their seven grandchildren - Scott and Megan Story, and Todd, Haley Laurel, Jenay, and Taylor Nelson. TJ was immensely proud of his family, always encouraging them to work at something that \"made a contribution.\" TJ and Scooter helped their grandkids through college, and generously provided many memorable summer reunions for the whole family in Sunriver, Oregon. TJ started his work life in the poultry business as a feed salesman, but was best known for his long, distinguished career as a Ranch and Land Real Estate Broker in Sonoma and Mendocino counties. He continued to work diligently until just recently, driven by his passion to do business \"country style;\" he took great satisfaction in finding the just-right deals for his many clients. TJ also loved working with his long-time business associate and great friend Glenda Sales. TJ maintained good health and a positive outlook through his enthusiasm for bicycle riding. For many years he and Scooter enjoyed their weekly Chileno Valley 30-mile bike ride with his brothers Clyde and John, then going afterwards to Mary's Pizza in Petaluma for dinner with more family and friends. TJ relished the biking years, going on organized rides in Europe and all around the western US, and at the age of 76, he and son Eric participated in the AIDS Bike Ride from SF to LA, raising $20,000 for the cause. TJ (a 35-year friend of Bill W) was a very proud founding member of Olympia House, a drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility in West Sonoma County; he worked to establish the center so that others could have the \"same second chance that I got with sobriety.\" TJ will be most remembered for the deep, fierce love and support which he gave generously to his family, friends and others; he will be dearly missed. A celebration of his life will be held at The Friedman Event Center, 4676 Mayette Avenue, Santa Rosa, CA 95405 on December 17, 2017 at 11:00 a.m. The Nelson family wishes to express thanks to Memorial Hospice for the loving care they provided during TJ's final days.

Recorded at Noyzelab, 2014-2017. After a happy chance meeting at an event in the National Portrait Gallery in London, NYZ was invited to make a tape for The Tapeworm. On returning to Australia he went into the studio, digging up some recent-ish pieces from the last few years, and also making a handful of new ones. The music on this tape is a mix of Cellular Automata sequencing hooked up to various synthesis/FX methodologies including: Frequency Modulation, Phase Modulation, Sampling, old school hardware DSP and ROMplers. Musically this tape covers a range of different tunings and intervals, designed to take you on journey through the obscurities of NYZ's approach to experimental sound and music making.  \n\nPPLZ SYNF by NYZ NYZ   - PPLZ SYNF (2017) \nDavid Burraston returns to Ps\u00f8ma Psi Phi with possibly his most expansive release to date - PPLZ SYNF. A gigantic 3.5 hour work consisting of seven pieces created using an ongoing self-build (as Burraston notes) of the Serge/CGS Paperface analog synthesizer, in conjunction with a custom built modular rig. Laid to digital disk space at Burraston's Noyzelab studio in August, PPLZ SYNF is a monolith of drone synthesis that absorbs the listener into some kind of greater collective metaconsciousness. It is both an impressive exercise in longform drone music, and an immersive and hypnotic atmosphere that confounds the mind, transfiguring your surroundings from its unique and singular perspective. A monument, literally and figuratively, in the sound field, etched and erected by a master of the craft. Given the scope and size of such a release, PPLZ SYNF has been committed to a very special, and very limited, triple-cassette set, housed in a dustproof binder. These are extremely finite and assembled by hand in every possible way, making no two copies exactly alike. The digital version available at Bandcamp consists of cuts from the first of the three tapes, while the full release is spread across two 60-minute tapes and one 90-minute tape. \n\n<a href=\"http://glice.bandcamp.com/album/cielo\">CIELO by Glice</a>\nGlice - Cielo (2017) \n\n\nGlice  -  Race To The Bottom  (2017) \n\n\nMore Eaze - yum (2017) \n<a href=\"http://jesseosbornelanthiernoir.bandcamp.com/album/la-prochaine\">\u00c0 La Prochaine by Femminielli Noir</a> Femminielli Noir  -  \u00c0 La Prochaine  (2016) \nMalas Influencias EP by Femminielli Noir Femminielli Noir  -  >Malas Influencias EP  (2015) \n\nL'\u00c9veil by Femminielli Noir Femminielli Noir - \u00c9veil (2013) \n[10INCH] 10inch04 by SOTE Sote -    10inch04(2014/2016) ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "femminielli noir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david burraston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tapewor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burraston", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cielo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "femminielli noir femminielli noir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glice</a> glice - cielo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "femminielli noir</a> femminielli noir  -  \u00e0 la prochaine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "burraston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bandcamp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noyzelab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ps\u00f8ma psi phi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:18.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e4307555fcaaf535cfe5c4574894a60d08262513", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS4mlWRaQOV30AHBjwgH78HaLneCKktrsX0469Os03SlRiq8Rw0lV8PkrPD_yXybYaf0dr5lXR1HHiGy5Q3Wgehw--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : personalfinance", "title": "yearl taxes (CAN)", "title_full": "yearl taxes (CAN) : personalfinance", "published": "2017-12-07T09:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9734c9c77e08c8318c9a402c08ec2a75fd4c7ce6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS4mlWRaQOV30AHBjwgH78HaLneCKktrsX0469Os03SlRiq8Rw0lV8PkrPD_yXybYaf0dr5lXR1HGpkIrTrN5jjLD7QJCYHV7YmCIpqyzjzw0-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "AutoModerator", "published": "2017-12-07T09:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "You may find these links helpful:\nTax Software Megathread Taxes Understanding tax brackets W-4 IRS Withholding Calculator I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Dec 07, 2017 by : Carrie Johnson \nFour months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in \"tatters\" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics. \nIt's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray. \nOn Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch. 1. Russia, Russia, Russia \nWray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, \"a witch hunt.\" \nWray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied to the Trump campaign, including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Support comes from \nDoes that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Stzrok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation , suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case? \nShould there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him? \nLook for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this. \n\"The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,\" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing. \n\"We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,\" Goodlatte added. 2. Independence \nThe job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was \"the Russia thing.\" \nFor his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees , who have faced criticism from the president this year. \nThis week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to \"keep calm and tackle hard\" amid the current adverse climate. And, at his confirmation hearing, Wray pledged his loyalty was to the Constitution, not a political regime. \"I will never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice, period, full stop,\" he said at the time. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee will no doubt want to ask Wray about his contacts with President Trump and others in the White House this year. 3. Oh, yeah \u2014 FBI business \nIn a matter of weeks, an important electronic surveillance tool will expire if Congress does not reauthorize it. The murder rate has spiked in several major American cities. \nCourts have thrown out corruption charges or reduced sentences of public officials accused of bribery and other offenses, following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the tools the Justice Department's public integrity unit can use to attack graft in state houses across the country. \nThe bureau also has open investigations into activity by sympathizers of the Islamic State in every one of its field offices. \nThe FBI, in short, has its hands in many baskets. And after the questions about Russia and Trump, members of the committee may want to discuss some business in regular order.

You mentioned some facebook post of your potential class mates doing some exercise in your other post - can you maybe find out who she is that way? If she is on facebook maybe you can message her & get to know her..you have something in common after all & I am sure you can think of something that doesn't sound creepy...like you saw her at the audition & she seemed like a very nice person - you will start next year & were wondering how things there are working & what you expect then since she is there already or something casual like that, I don't know - that's up to you anyway. In the worst case you won't get an answer, in the best case you can maybe get to know her a bit & find out how the course is going so you know what is waiting for you with the drama course as well. Maybe because you didn't have the chance to really talk to her is why you can't get over it as well - maybe it feels like a missed chance & now she seems like a mystery that you can't solve. I don't know, I make s**t up as I go here tbh. :P but I can imagine it effects you a lot & I guess the sooner you can get your head straight the better for your well-being.

I've never played either, but always wanted to so I'll dig into that this weekend and then move on to the new one.

Know the rights you would acquire from the company. Consider the terms that are set during your purchase. You should be keen with all of these details. You need to know them to protect and promote your own interest.\n\nLeaving such kind of obligation to your dealer could be quite risky. You might like to read the contract once again before you making a risky choice. When signing a contract, though, see to it that all of your rights and interest has been protected. Speaking of materials, make sure to take the role. Aside from handling the payment process, consider the best raw materials that would fit the demands of your project. The quality and the sustainability should be there. Whatever you have invested right now, all of it would reflect on your future. It could affect its market value. Speaking of that, have the Concrete Stencils For Sale .\n\nYou are also protected by various rights offered by your service providers. As for the rights, though, that highly depends on the programs and the extended service offered by the company. Everyone is different. Aside from having a different product, their terms and conditions for your purchase will highly vary too.\n\nTaking the features and effectiveness of the product aside, reconsider how competitive their extended services and customer programs too. Do not let these firms get away from their obligations. Their duties to you do not end after the time you have used their product. No, rather than the end, you could say that it is just the beginning.\n\nIt is a waste of investment. That is the only thing that awaits you. Not all stencils that are sold on the global market are effective. Some of them come with a very poor quality. That could be bad. Buying poor quality stencils would certainly destroy the beauty of your project. It will waste the efforts rendered by your construction workers.\n\nAside from that, since this is an international shipping, you need to understand and take in mind that shipping charges are meant to change from time to time. Therefore, when put under that type of situation, you could always contact their agents. They know things better than you do. They could explain the policies further.\n\nYou should have some reasons for your actions. You are a human, a rational being. It is quite unthinkable for you to move without reconsidering your options. You know from the very start of this endeavor that you have some prospects. Rejoice for that fact. Many people take that for granted.\n\nThey got a reputation too. Plus, you need to remember that they are highly experienced. Certainly, you would never choose them without having these qualifications. Since they have passed your bars and exceed your standards, more or less, these professionals can give you tips on the matter. They can share some helpful advice.\n\nMake everything clear. Weight things rationally. Competitions on the market are what causes these companies to innovate and create wide varieties of marketing strategies. They are not a hindrance on your part, though. Thanks to it, various types of perks were born.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are looking for information about concrete stencils for sale , visit our web pages today.

By: Electronics & Test December 07, 2017 \nMagnesium batteries are one of the energy-storage chemistries in line to replace lithium-ion batteries, which are eco-unfriendly and can even be dangerous. However, to date magnesium batteries have had a number of limitations to being suitable to the task. \n\nNow researchers at the Department of Energy (DoE) have made a significant breakthrough in developing solid-state magnesium-ion batteries that are both energy dense and safe by discovering the fastest magnesium-ion solid-state conductor to date, researchers said. \n\nCommercial batteries use liquid electrolytes\u2014the reason for the flammability in lithium-ion batteries that has resulted in fires and explosions. However, solid-state conductors\u2014which potentially can be electrolytes\u2014tend to be more fire resistant. \n\nUsing something like this instead of an electrolyte is a good fit for magnesium batteries, which is so new, \u201cit doesn\u2019t have any good liquid electrolytes,\u201d said Gerbrand Ceder, a senior faculty scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who worked on the project alongside researchers at Argonne National Laboratory and MIT. \u201cWe thought, why not leapfrog and make a solid-state electrolyte?\u201d \nResearchers identified magnesium scandium selenide spinel as the material for a new class of solid conductors that researchers said can transport magnesium at unprecedented speeds. They used a combination of computational materials, science methodologies, synthesis, and a variety of characterization techniques to identify the material, which has magnesium mobility. \nResearchers published a paper about their work in the journal Nature Communications . \n\nArgonne scientist Baris Key (left) at work in his nuclear magnetic resonance lab. Key worked with researchers at Berkeley Lab on the discovery of the fastest-ever magnesium-ion solid-state conductor. (Source: Argonne National Laboratory) \n\nKey to proving that magnesium ions could move through magnesium scandium selenide spinel as rapidly as theoretical studies had predicted was conducting what are called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiments. This was the job of paper co-author Baris Key, a research chemist at Argonne. \nHe said that the tests\u2014which were among the first experiments to prove the theoretical research\u2014were crucial to confirm that what scientists surmised was indeed true. \n\u201cIt is not often that the theory and the experiment agree closely with each other,\u201d Key said. \u201cThe solid state NMR experiments for this chemistry were very challenging. \u2026 As we\u2019ve shown in this study, an in-depth understanding of short- and long-range structure and ion dynamics will be the key for magnesium ion battery research.\u201d \nNMR is similar to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but instead of showing hydrogen atoms of water in biological substances, it is tuned to detect other elements--including the lithium or magnesium ions that are found in battery materials. \nHowever, though the experiments proved the speed at which ions move through it, other results were inconclusive due to the unknown structure of a material with complex properties, Key said. \nThe team plans to do further work to use the conductor in a battery, although researchers acknowledged that it will be quite awhile before this application is ready for prime time. However, it does prove what scientists did not think was possible\u2014that magnesium could move quickly through a solid material, they said. \nElizabeth Montalbano is a freelance writer who has written about technology and culture for more than 15 years.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "baris key", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gerbrand ceder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elizabeth montalbano", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "department of energy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "argonne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "energy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nature communications", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lawrence berkeley national laboratory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "argonne national laboratory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkeley lab", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "argonne", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:19.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "df26caf1eaae9f531e01f993b6fa4c8b88b78aab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS6Kp1RqFtBQOFhDf.uC7HFf7kDaTkCOAlSA4ixHecDNm1MgiZs4gjmbmUexd1vmiGBh2nd9HgLepCxjnf75SXJ", "site_full": "shoals.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://shoals.craigslist.org/search/ppp?format=rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "craigslist the shoals | personals search", "title": "Lawrenceburg - m4mw (Lawrenceburg)", "title_full": "Lawrenceburg - m4mw (Lawrenceburg)", "published": "2017-12-07T09:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "df26caf1eaae9f531e01f993b6fa4c8b88b78aab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS6Kp1RqFtBQOFhDf.uC7HFf7kDaTkCOAlSA4ixHecDNm1MgiZs4gjmbmUexd1vmiGBh2nd9HgLepCxjnf75SXJ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "Lawrenceburg - m4mw (Lawrenceburg)", "text": "favorite this post Lawrenceburg - m4mw (Lawrenceburg) age: 40   Is there really no real couples in Lawrenceburg?

Dec 07, 2017 by : Scott Neuman \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. Support comes from \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of registered voters and ensured that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\"  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george brandis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "parliament approves same-sex marriage 569035628_1323015507.jpg michael masters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the sydney morning herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott neuman  australia's parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "parliamen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:20.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3318dcabd0455b279d300333add8cae748f24a0f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTcoPVw4cBkk48QKre0KX91gcxVvBuozPmqza16IZT.7.J_FYWIfSDqeAyrG6dAM2ayoduUbMsdc4j7d2_gLtVyfG9d9ftBbBGQyPD4n5avBtNdQOhvn_Rc", "site_full": "www.holyrood.com", "site": "holyrood.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["education", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "Theresa May faces rebellion over Brexit 'no deal' threats | Holyrood Magazine", "title_full": "Theresa May faces rebellion over Brexit 'no deal' threats | Holyrood Magazine", "published": "2017-12-07T10:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.675, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3318dcabd0455b279d300333add8cae748f24a0f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTcoPVw4cBkk48QKre0KX91gcxVvBuozPmqza16IZT.7.J_FYWIfSDqeAyrG6dAM2ayoduUbMsdc4j7d2_gLtVyfG9d9ftBbBGQyPD4n5avBtNdQOhvn_Rc", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nicholas Mairs", "published": "2017-12-07T10:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "Theresa May faces rebellion over Brexit 'no deal' threats | Holyrood Magazine", "text": "Theresa May faces rebellion over Brexit 'no deal' threats Written by Nicholas Mairs on 7 December 2017 in News \nConservative civil war looms as 19 MPs warn Theresa May against \u2018highly irresponsible\u2019 hard Brexit \nTheresa May - PA \nMore than a dozen Conservative MPs have written to Theresa May urging her to ignore those within the party trying to \u201cimpose their own conditions\u201d on Brexit talks. \nIn a fresh sign of Tory infighting, 19 MPs backing \u201csoft Brexit\u201d warned the Prime Minister against dancing to the tune of \"highly irresponsible\" colleagues underplaying the downsides of a no deal outcome. \nThe MPs \u2013 among them former ministers Stephen Crabb, Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan \u2013 hit out at the hardline Brexiteers who believe leaving the EU without a deal would result in \"some status quo which the UK simply opts to adopt\u201d. RELATED CONTENT Ruth Davidson calls on Theresa May to make single market deal UK-wide \n\u201cWe wish to make it clear that we are disappointed yet again that some MPs and others seek to impose their own conditions on these negotiations,\u201d they wrote in a letter. \n\u201cIn particular, it is highly irresponsible to seek to dictate terms which could lead to the UK walking away from these negotiations.\u201d \nThe letter comes amid deadlock between UK and the EU over the issue of the Irish border, after the DUP refused to back differing trade regulations between Great Britain and the island of Ireland as a whole. \nHardline Brexiteers have since ramped up the pressure on the Prime Minister, including Iain Duncan Smith, who on Tuesday said the UK should consider walking away from talks soon if the EU did not allow negotiators to move on to the next phase by next week's EU Council meeting. \nBernard Jenkin told the BBC's Today programme that is the letter's signatories who are thinking of voting against the Government, adding: \"I think that's unhelpful\". \nElsewhere, vocal pro-Brexit backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg warned Mrs May yesterday that her negotiating red lines \"were beginning to look a bit pink\" after her hopes of a breakthrough were dashed. \nAnd Peter Bone, in what looked further like an orchestrated attempt to make the Prime Minister to hold firm with Brussels said the UK \u201cvoted to stop sending billions and billions of pounds to the EU each and every year and they voted to make our laws in our own country judged by our own judges.\u201d \nHowever those behind the letter say the cloud of \u201cuncertainty\u201d for business and EU nationals should mean the Prime Minister takes \u201cwhatever time is necessary\u201d to strike agreement with the bloc. \n\"Those who say that if such an outcome happens the UK will \u2018revert to World Trade Organisation\u2019 rules deliberately make it sound as if some status quo which the UK simply opts to adopt,\" they add. \n\"They miss the many business and other voices who have made it clear that a \u2018no deal post March 2019 scenario would lead to great uncertainty for EU citizens living here and UK citizens living in the EU, higher costs and reduced choice for consumers, disruption at our ports and borders and grave questions about how cross-border contracts are to be fulfilled.\" \nThe warning from Mrs May\u2019s colleagues coincides with fresh pressure from the Lords, who say a no-deal Brexit would \"deeply damage\" the UK, economically, as well as areas such as aviation, counter terrorism and nuclear safety. \nThe report said it would be \"difficult, if not impossible, to envisage a worse outcome for the UK\" than a no-deal scenario. \nAnd in a further blow to the Prime Minister they said striking a deal by the planned March 2019 departure date would be \"impossible\", and warned that enshrining it into domestic law would \"not be in the national interest\".

In contrast with the current empirical approach used to estimate the results of operations based on attritive interactions, the method we present in this paper allows us to predict the output forces and the topography of a simulated grinding wheel for a set of specific operational parameters (speed ratio and radial feed-rate), providing a thorough understanding of the complex mechanisms regulating these processes. In modelling the dressing mechanisms, the abrasive characteristics of both bodies (grain size, geometry, inter-space and protrusion) are first simulated; thus, their interaction is simulated in terms of grain collisions. Exploiting a specifically designed contact/impact evaluation algorithm, the model simulates the collisional effects of the dresser abrasives on the grinding wheel topography (grain fracture/break-out). The method has been tested for the case of a diamond rotary dresser, predicting output forces within less than 10% error and obtaining experimentally validated grinding wheel topographies. The study provides a fundamental understanding of the dressing operation, enabling the improvement of its performance in an industrial scenario, while being of general interest in modelling collision-based processes involving statistically distributed elements.

John Gass Login to follow \nSMALL towns across Australia are missing out on vital services, a new report has shown. \nThe Regional Australia Institute released its Small Towns Report Card on Thursday, which showed small towns of less than 5000 people had a lack of psychologists, preschool teachers and dentists. \nAccess to psychologists in small towns rose between 1-6 per cent over the past 30years, scoring an F grade on the report card. \nOnly 5 per cent of small towns across Australia had access to a dentist in 2011. \nRAI chief executive officer Jack Archer said the Report Card ranked how the nation fared in providing access to 10 essential professionals for residents living in small towns across Australia, taken from data gathered over a 30-year period. \n\"For many of the 1.8million Australians who live in small towns, accessing a GP, dentist, preschool teacher or psychologist is nearly impossible,\u201d Mr Archer said. \n\"This lack of service professionals coincides with higher rates of early childhood development issues in rural and remote areas. We see the same pattern in dentistry and mental health, which are also areas where regional outcomes have been poor for a long time. \n\"The RAI report suggests four ways to address service delivery in small towns. These include supporting community initiatives, role flexibility, delivery of online services and targeted funding.\u201d \nSouth Burnett Mayor Keith Campbell said access to psychology especially was an issue in the small towns across the region. \n\"Those sort of intense medical programs that people require I believe there is an absolute shortage of those throughout the region,\u201d Cr Campbell said. \n\"I don't believe it's possible for those sort of people to come and set up practices in really small towns unless they have a good client base. \n\"South Burnett Regional Council, through its association with the South Burnett community hospital, is trying desperately to build up services available through the local community hospital, as is the public hospital.\u201d \nHe said a number of issuesraised in the report were not issues for South Burnett towns. \n\"In relation to schools, I don't believe any of the small towns in the South Burnett region are disadvantaged, I believe we have excellent schooling,\u201d hesaid. \n\"In terms of social services that are available, we have a wonderful network of care agencies.\u201d \nCr Campbell said a number of those services in the small towns were based out of main hubs in Kingaroy. \n\"The South Burnett is 8400sq km in size and Kingaroy is regarded as the centre of those sorts of activities,\u201d he said. \n\"It is not a huge trip for people living in all locations in the South Burnett to journey into Kingaroy if services are available there. \n\"A lot of people travel out of the area for those services. What I'd like to do is encourage people to utilise services that are available here, which will encourage more professionals to come as well.\u201d \nWhat we need The report card listed these professions as most needed: GPs, nurses, psychologists, dentists, preschool, primary and high school teachers, police officers, paramedics and social welfare workers.
