Aliou Bah, from Guinea, was handed \u00a3110,000 compensation by Judge Nicholas Madge for being held unlawfully for 21 months \u2013 because his own country refused to take him back. However, Judge Madge hit out at his own decision, admitting that he \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d agreed that most people would think that Bah\u2019s victims deserve huge payouts instead. Bah, 28, has been imprisoned twice for serious assaults \u2013 including on a 16-year-old girl \u2013 and has also been placed on the sex offenders register. Immigration officials blocked attempts to deport Bah, who had been granted refugee status, back to his country in West Africa. Judge Madge ruled Bah must receive damages, saying that he had been forced to uphold the principle that no one should be imprisoned unlawfully in a civilised society. Tory MP Peter Bone said Bah had \u201cthoroughly abused the hospitality of this country\u201d (Rex) More Conservative MP Peter Bone said the Government said that the public would conclude that \u201cthe law is an ass\u201d. after hearing about the case. He said: \u201cIt is very difficult to understand why a sex attacker should not be sent home, let alone win a vast amount of public money. \u201cIf he has come to the UK he should live by the rules of the UK. My constituents will quite rightly be outraged at how he has been rewarded despite thoroughly abusing the hospitality of this country.\u201d MORE: Brit fighters who joined Isis \u2018should never be allowed back in the UK\u2019, Defence Secretary declares Bah arrived in the UK in 2007 to join his refugee father but was convicted of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl in February 2011. He was jailed for 18 months before being imprisoned again in 2014 for two years over another sex assault. Theresa May signed a deportation order against Bah in December 2011 when she was Home Secretary \u2013 without realising he was entitled to be treated as a refugee. The Home Office said the case does not change the legality of Bah\u2019s status in the UK (Rex) More He was subsequently held in immigration detention unlawfully, from 2012 to 2013 and again from 2014 to 2015 \u2013 totalling 21 months. Judge Madge said that nobody had been successfully deported to Guinea since 2006 as the authorities there refuse to issue travel papers to anyone who does not want to return. He added that Bah had served punishments for his crimes and blamed the Home Office for his decision to award compensation, saying the department failed to properly apply its own policy. David Green, of think-tank Civitas, said: \u201cThis is a clear case of punishing the Home Office for protecting the public. \u201cThis is perverse and a clear failure of the duty of the courts. It\u2019s not like they have kept him inside for no reason \u2013 he is a danger to the public.\u201d The Home Office said they were now \u201cconsidering the judgement\u201d, adding \u201cThis case does not change the legality of Mr Bah\u2019s status in the UK.\u201d Reblog ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "aliou bah", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nicholas madge", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "peter bone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david green", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reblog", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "civitas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "home office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defence", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "guinea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:40.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c0e55f6d72e11c37b2b884d05d36b3dc722cca4e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_ICEn8IdJwy3FaaS.1KjTiFv7XqUm6Jm6_weG4iHSkNIPvz1wYoD8BjItFRBtL3Z9zSO3BoDcZvqQ.1D49cTNENKFddVtWYiypJrtBryEUcA--", "site_full": "www.forextips.com", "site": "forextips.com", "site_section": "http://www.forextips.com/forums/forum/trading-floor/forex-technical-analysis/", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Forex Forum | ForexTips", "title": "Daily Market Analysis ForexTime ( FXTM )", "title_full": "Daily Market Analysis ForexTime ( FXTM ) | ForexTips", "published": "2017-12-07T15:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ef953279ac7c1ce4c5147c1103192608?s=14&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c0e55f6d72e11c37b2b884d05d36b3dc722cca4e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_ICEn8IdJwy3FaaS.1KjTiFv7XqUm6Jm6_weG4iHSkNIPvz1wYoD8BjItFRBtL3Z9zSO3BoDcZvqQ.1D49cTNENKFddVtWYiypJrtBryEUcA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ForexTime FXTM", "published": "2017-12-07T15:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "Daily Market Analysis ForexTime ( FXTM )", "text": "Daily Fundamental ForexTime ( FXTM )\nBitcoin future trading kicks off; Investors awaiting central banks decisions\nTrading bitcoins entered a new phase today, after Chicago\u2019s CBOE listed the first futures contract on the cryptocurrency. The initial reaction was beyond expectations with the futures contract climbing more than 20% and triggering two trading halts. CBOE\u2019s website experienced unprecedented traffic which may well have sent a new benchmark, the frenetic activity lead to delays and outages. So far, it seems professional investors aren\u2019t willing to bet against the bitcoin, despite the many warnings of a bubble that will burst soon. Many traders aren\u2019t even interested in the price direction, but the listing of the futures contract on CBOE and later next week on the CME, will provide them an arbitrage trading opportunity due to the vast pricing differences. However, the arbitrage trading will lead to improved price efficiency and probably less volatility. After volatility settles down, the focus will return to the price direction.\nCentral Banks Meetings\nCurrency markets were trading in tight ranges early Monday with the dollar slightly weaker against its major peers. Expectations of the Fed hiking rates on Wednesday, stands at 90.2% according to CME\u2019s Fedwatch tool which means the disappointment in wage growth won\u2019t shift the needle for US monetary policy. However, it isn\u2019t the rate hike that will move the dollar on Wednesday, it\u2019s the tone, economic projections and the dot plot. Given that we\u2019re getting closer to a deal on tax reforms, the Fed might become slightly more hawkish. It remains to be seen whether this will shift up the Fed\u2019s dots for future interest rate expectations.\nThe European Central Bank and Bank of England are also meeting this week. Despite no substantive monetary policy changes expected, the language might still move the Euro and the Pound.\nWill the Fed support further rotation in stocks?\nTech shares have been in focus over the past two weeks after the S&P tech index plunged more than 4% between 29-Nov and 05-Dec, before recovering last week. The fall in Teck stocks wasn\u2019t accompanied by a selloff in other sectors, particularly the financials which have been on the rise. This is a classic type of rotation with active managers balancing their portfolios before year end. Tax reforms don\u2019t seem to be of great support to Tech firms, given that their effective tax rate is considered to be the lowest in the U.S. Meanwhile, it\u2019s a big deal for the rest of the U.S, with financials having an effective tax rate of more than 30%. The new Fed Chair, Jerome Powell will likely speed up deregulation for the financial sector which will drive more inflows. And of course, higher interest rates for 2018 will further support the banks\u2019 profit margins. That\u2019s why the trajectory of interest rates in 2018 will likely lead to more portfolio balancing before year end.\nEU Summit\nThe breakthrough in Brexit talks on Friday was a great relief for policymakers, who can now move to phase-2 of the talks. Interestingly though, Sterling instead of rising sharply, dropped on the news. Investors seem reluctant to buy Sterling as they view the next phase more complicated than the first. They want to see details of the transition agreement and trade talks concluded before buying Sterling.

It was a strange situation. He is a tough guy and if he cannot continue the game then you should consider it could be something serious.\" Klopp told reporters. \n\"In the treatment room then, he was a little bit more positive, so maybe we are lucky and it's not too serious. We will see. \n\"We need all the boys for the next few weeks, but especially in this week for the next game on Sunday...\" \nLiverpool's last 7-0 win came in a Champions League game against NK Maribor in October that was followed by a thumping 4-1 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur and Klopp has urged his side to avoid another poor return to league action.

Chris Tilley, File AP Photo Ex-coal magnate Blankenship seeks West Virginia Senate seat The Associated Press  33 AM UPDATED 1 MINUTE AGO CHARLESTON, W.Va. \nFormer Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship, who went to prison after a mine explosion, plans to run for the U.S. Senate seat in West Virginia held by Democratic U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, a spokesman said Wednesday. \nThe formal filing was expected Wednesday, spokesman Greg Thomas told The Associated Press. The Senate clerk's office said it hadn't received it shortly before closing at 6 p.m. \nThe 67-year-old Blankenship was released from a federal prison in California in May after serving a one-year term related to the deadliest U.S. mine explosion in four decades. He is serving one year of supervised release. \nBlankenship was sentenced last year for a misdemeanor conviction of conspiring to violate federal mine safety standards at Massey's Upper Big Branch Mine in southern West Virginia, where 29 workers died in a 2010 explosion.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \nThe U.S. Supreme Court recently rejected Blankenship's bid to appeal. He has insisted he's innocent, and that natural gas and not methane gas and excess coal dust caused the explosion. He has blamed Manchin for helping create the public sentiment against him. On Twitter, when he was released, Blankenship challenged Manchin to debate him. \n\"A U.S. Senator who says I have 'blood on my hands' should be man enough to face me in public,\" Blankenship wrote. \nAt the time, Manchin responded with a statement saying he hopes Blankenship \"chooses to do the right thing and disappear from the public eye.\" \nWest Virginia GOP Chairman Conrad Lucas said he's heard Blankenship is running. Lucas said Blankenship is a Republican. \nThe Republican field for next year's election already includes West Virginia state Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. They have begun attacking each other, with Jenkins faulting Morrisey as an ex-lobbyist for drug companies and Morrisey criticizing Jenkins as an ex-Democrat. \nFederal Election Commission records also show West Virginia native and activist Paula Jean Swearingen as a Democratic candidate for the Senate seat.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "blankenship", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "don blankenship", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "evan jenkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conrad lucas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morrisey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jenkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick morrisey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paula jean swearingen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris tilley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe manchin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "massey energy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "west virginia senate", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mobile & apps file", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "federal election commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert c. byrd u.s. courthouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "charleston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charleston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "w.va", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "upper big branch mine", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:43.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "842a25b5445f6b5a45a2b06c001d763d8d72c879", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWbpjA.VaxgP1.hUL8mJ5KdlaxfDf10B95jRpCBgsl3Pf6cR_pEfvfam_2OmnFUb6JHJG25J5Pii94CKaESYuRPZzajWs5msIXs-", "site_full": "homemade-recipes.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://homemade-recipes.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "LEBANESE RECIPES", "title": "Christmas crackles recipe", "title_full": "Christmas crackles recipe", "published": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "842a25b5445f6b5a45a2b06c001d763d8d72c879", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWbpjA.VaxgP1.hUL8mJ5KdlaxfDf10B95jRpCBgsl3Pf6cR_pEfvfam_2OmnFUb6JHJG25J5Pii94CKaESYuRPZzajWs5msIXs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Khalil Alsalman (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "Christmas crackles recipe", "text": "\n0:10 Prep | 0:05 Cook | Makes 16 | Capable cooks\n\nThe kids will love helping to make these rice bubble treats which have the flavours and colours of Christmas.\n\nINGREDIENTS \n\n70g (2 cups) rice bubbles\n100g (1/2 cup) caster sugar\n45g (1/2 cup) desiccated coconut\n2/3 cup Sunbeam Mixed Fruit\n125g copha\n95g (1/2 cup) choc bits\n\nMETHOD \n\nStep 1 Combine the rice bubbles, sugar, coconut and mixed fruit in a large bowl.\n\nStep 2 Place copha in a saucepan over medium heat until melted.

Burhanuddin Qasmi \nThe supreme court of India has allowed on 5 December 2017, certificates issued by Gram Panchayat (GP) or executive magistrate to be used as supporting or linkage documents for claiming citizenship by a person in Assam during NRC (National Registration of Citizenship) process. \nThe apex court has set aside the order of Gauhati high court dated 28 February 2017, by which it had invalidated these certificates for linking citizenship of an applicant to her or his Indian parent before 1971, the cut-off year in the Assam Accord 1985. \nThis sincere move of the apex court is historic and a massive booster for millions who have been living in fear and uncertainty. This is surely going to bring relief to lakhs of women and men in the state who used this document to establish linkage with their fathers and husbands. This Supreme Court verdict is also a major set back for present BJP-led Assam's state and Delhi's central governments. \nIn the meantime, the apex court has also put an end to the undemocratic and maliciously marked division of Indian citizens into original inhabitants (OI) and non-original inhabitants in the NRC list. This OI and other symbols are created by the state government within the final NRC list were bound to create rifts within Assamese society as some super citizens and other ordinary or second class citizens. \nThanks to the Supreme Court wisdom, it rightly struck in the heart of the issue and demolished the temple of divisive politicking in Assam with poor minority peasants and adivasis. It rightly observed that NRC is to prepare a list of Indian citizens and the constitution of India doesn't make any distinction among its citizens. It was one heavier blow to the present BJP governments both in the state of Assam and in the Centre. \nHowever, the leading petition under case No. 20858 of 2017 was filed by Rupajan Begum of Nogaon district and Monowara Bewa of Dhubri district in Assam. They had been marked as doubtful or \u2018D-voter\u2019 by their respective local election authorities; have yet to get complete relief. Their run to courts are still to over. \nThe foreigner tribunal court in Assam had discarded their documents, they were unable to prove their citizenship. The GP certificates were important document to establish their citizenship and linkage with parental families. \nIn the first stage the foreigner tribunal, and later the Gauhati high court, rejected the GP certificate and termed it as a \u201cprivate document\u201d. Harassed, they knocked the door of the supreme court with backing from All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) president and Dhubri MP Maulana Badruddin Ajmal led Assam State Jamiat Ulema-e Hind. Now the apex court has restored the applicability of the GP documents in establishing the linkage to other documents that prove citizenship. \nRupajan and Monowara have simply won a part of their long and painstaking struggle only. Their counsel and lawyers said that the appeal against their being detected as a \u2018foreigner\u2019 by the foreigner tribunal has not yet been decided. \nThis will, hopefully, be decided positively in the days to come by the 'tribunal' because the parental linkage document of their citizenship is now validated by the supreme sourt. But to avail this they will have to walk to the foreigner tribunal once more. \nMany in Assam and elsewhere in India may find the apex court verdict a means to full on celebrations and greeting congratulations to each other. Here the real victims, the two poor women, have yet to feel complete relief. Their run to the court or tribunal, and their fear will not be over unless they are declared Indian citizens and the insulting tag \"D-Voter\" is struck off from their names in the electoral register and NRC list. \n*Burhanuddin Qasmi - The author is editor of Eastern Crescent, magazine, a Mumbai based freelancer and a native of Assam. \n- Asian Tribune -  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rupajan begum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burhanuddin qasmi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maulana badruddin ajmal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "m. burhanuddin qasmi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monowara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rupajan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hold home \u00bb supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hold supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dhubri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eastern crescent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gram panchayat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "assam state jamiat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "all india united democratic front", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nrc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "assam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gauhati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nogaon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monowara bewa of dhubri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:43.036+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eb66d8664d7452a5f2d2d93f641a0f7dc54772be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgx1Ghi4N2YEGHshZVeQy_su122fboe7Ul5mzQYfkHWo.bN_4VEWL06_K2ThkD2EAukOQzBv0FfUgypuRlLP3uGhWJJOPkbGVDU-", "site_full": "filipinochannel-tf.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://filipinochannel-tf.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Filipino Channel", "title": "Eat Bulaga - 07 December 2017", "title_full": "Eat Bulaga - 07 December 2017", "published": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb66d8664d7452a5f2d2d93f641a0f7dc54772be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgx1Ghi4N2YEGHshZVeQy_su122fboe7Ul5mzQYfkHWo.bN_4VEWL06_K2ThkD2EAukOQzBv0FfUgypuRlLP3uGhWJJOPkbGVDU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tony (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "Eat Bulaga - 07 December 2017", "text": "P1 P2 P3 P4 P5 P6 P7 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:43.052+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d5d1f3b4ab34dbc6c0b193a381b1b843724e74e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFerTyZ.iqKn8JfSbKi02BotLhReE9BTpCrHwwDYwwbsHHkIA_rp2VbvuYEjoc2hvN2gdFmfxFznl30W6hMCNgK1sKU9ZyBl9H9c8KJHm9h_vaEuUp7Fd9wvhQzGCLHcvw7G.W6sH6XzsMXvuXYHVvFag--", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/zero-installments/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "0% Installments - Buy 0% Installments at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "Logitech Z623 Speaker System with Subwoofer", "title_full": "Logitech Z623 Speaker System with Subwoofer | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-01-04T06:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.013, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "418a61827746c59ddd7f651df005b884d6ae7918", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFerTyZ.iqKn8JfSbKi02BotLhReE9BTpCrHwwDYwwbsHHkIA_rp2VbvuYEjoc2hvN2gdFmfxFznl30W6hMCNgK1sKU9ZyBl9H9c8KJHm9h_vaEuUp7Fd9wvhQzGCLHcvw7G.W6sH6XzsMQr4aaUgZuxQ59nPtQt3u3", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "Lazada User", "published": "2017-11-26T16:17:00.000+02:00", "title": "Lazada is good !!", "text": "The item is extremely work fine.

'Imbalance' \nThe average house or flat in the UK is now selling for \u00a3226,821, the Halifax said. \n\"The imbalance between supply and demand continues to support house prices, which doesn't look like changing in the near future,\" said Russell Galley, the managing director of Halifax Community Bank. \nHowever, he added that house price growth was likely to slow in the long term. \n\"Further ahead, increasing affordability issues, as price increases continue to outstrip wage growth, are likely to curb housing demand and cause price growth to ease.\" Buying or renting? The housing market in charts \nThe Halifax said that the changes to Stamp Duty for first-time buyers announced in last month's Budget would help to stimulate demand in London and the South East. \nFor properties costing up to \u00a3500,000, first-time buyers will now pay no stamp duty on the first \u00a3300,000. \nHowever, other data points to a continuing slowdown in the market. \nIn October, the number of home buyers being granted mortgages fell to its lowest for over a year, according to figures from the Bank of England. \n\"Housing market activity is currently muted and faltering,\" said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. \nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the Halifax figures were at odds with other indicators, such as surveys from Nationwide and Rightmove. \n\"Halifax's suggestion that house prices are surging again conflicts with virtually every other indicator we track,\" he said.

The increased healthcare expenditure and the resultant augmentation of healthcare facilities, globally, are the key drivers of the alopecia treatment market.\nAdditionally, the increasing awareness amongst individuals pertaining to the availability of the treatment options can be attributed to the favorable initiatives taken by organizations such as the National Alopecia Areata Foundation (NAAF) and the American Hair Loss Association. The increasing R&D investments pertaining to the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of alopecia is expected to boost the usage rates.\nInternational conferences are held by the NAAF for individuals suffering from alopecia, irrespective of their age, furthermore, NAAF also promotes research by bringing together scientists from all over the world. The 31 st National Conference of NAAF will be held in Washington DC from 14 th July to 16 th July, 2016.\nThe FDA approval of the Janus kinase inhibitors (JAK) drugs that stimulate the growth of hair follicles with minimal side effects is further expected to boost the alopecia treatment market. The Children Alopecia Project by AHLA is dedicated towards making investments in Children Support Groups, which provide funding for children who cannot afford to attend the NAAF Conference and promote research and development activities in alopecia treatment for children.\nBald Truth is a radio program that is involved in spreading awareness about the different types of alopecia affecting people and about the varied products used for the effective treatment of alopecia that are currently available in the market. Rapunzel Project is another initiative by AHLA that is dedicated towards preventing hair loss in chemotherapy patients.\nTo request a sample copy or view summary of this report, click the link below:\nhttp://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/alopecia-market \nFurther key findings from the study suggest: \nIn 2015, topical treatment accounted for over USD 2.8 billion in global alopecia treatment market. The key factors responsible for the large share of topical products include easy application, non-invasive nature, and high awareness amongst the population pertaining to the available therapeutics. The top brands of topical solution are Keranique, Phytoworx, Ultrax, and Nioxin. The patent expiration of majority of the drugs, such as Propecia & Rogaine and the FDA approval gained for the JAK drugs, in 2015, which is an immunosuppresant with minimal side effects are expected to boost the alopecia treatment market during the forecast period. In 2015, the dominant gender segment for the alopecia market were women that generated a revenue of about USD 4.03 billion and is expected to grow at a lucrativerate over the forecast period. The increasing awareness amongst women about alopecia and the emphasis laid upon appearance by them,are the key drivers of this segment. North America was the highest revenue generating region with the market valued at over USD 2.49 billion in 2015. The increasing number of consumer disposable incomes, the introduction of new drugs, and the favorable initiatives taken by the pertinent organizations namely, NAAF and AHLA, are the key factors for the region\u2019s large share. Key players operating in the market are Cipla, Merck & Co., Johnson & Johnson, Lifes2good, Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Sun Pharma, Kirkland Signature, Alpecin, Vitabiotics, and Phyto Ales Group.

The Charlotte Observer via AP Diedra Laird Cyberattack slows North Carolina county as it works on fixes By TOM FOREMAN Jr. and JONATHAN DREW Associated Press December 07, 2017 02:48 PM UPDATED 2 MINUTES AGO CHARLOTTE, N.C. \nTime-consuming paper transactions slowed business Thursday in North Carolina's largest metro area as a county government began the long process of restoring computer systems locked down by a ransomware attack. \nMecklenburg County was using backed-up data to make digital repairs after refusing to pay foreign hackers that froze dozens of county servers earlier this week. County officials were also taking new precautions against fraudulent emails because the hackers have tried again to penetrate their computers. No further damage to the system was reported. \nIn the meantime, services ranging from processing jail inmates to paying tax bills had to be done by hand. \nDarryl Broome, a contractor who does remodeling and demolition work, went in person to a county office to retrieve land information he normally could look up on his home computer. He had to drive 10 miles and spent about a half-hour looking through paper records. Never miss a local story.

Nor were the computers that handle 911 calls and dispatch for the city and county, said Charlotte Fire Department Deputy Chief Richard Granger. \nMecklenburg County manager Dina Diorio told staff in an email Thursday that the county was disabling employees' ability to open attachments generated through Dropbox and Google Docs because of renewed attacks. \nShe said that because the county refused to pay ransom, \"the cyber criminals are redoubling their efforts to penetrate the County's systems, primarily through emails that contain fraudulent attachments with viruses that could further damage our systems.\" \nMany county-run services have been delayed, and officials say it will take days to repair damage from the initial attack. The sheriff has said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, while code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nCyberattacks on local government are becoming increasingly common and sophisticated. Security experts say Mecklenburg County followed the right steps before and after the cyberattack, including declining to pay the ransom. \n\"Unfortunately, it's become all too common,\" said Lawrence Abrams, who runs the cyber security site bleepingcomputer.com. \"It's smart not to pay the ransom if you can avoid it. In paying these ransoms, it's obviously encouraging others.\" \nCounties in Indiana and Alabama are among those that have paid to regain access to data frozen by cyberattacks since late last year. The Montgomery Advertiser reported that Montgomery County, Alabama, faced disruptions to some operations even after paying hackers in September. \nOther public organizations have chosen to rebuild instead of paying hackers. In November 2016, a ransomware attack on San Francisco's transit system resulted in officials shutting down ticketing machines, allowing free rides for much of a weekend. But transit officials didn't pay a ransom. The St. Louis library system said it took days to restore electronic services for patrons and weeks more to fix all of its computers after it refused to pay hackers behind a ransomware attack this year. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said Mecklenburg County appears to have done a good job of backing up its data if it's able to restore the system without paying the hackers. \n\"It seems like the county was fairly well-prepared,\" he said. \"Overall, this is not as bad of a story as it could have been.\" \nMecklenburg County revealed Tuesday that it was facing a computer outage after an employee opened an email attachment containing malicious software.

Although Malaysia has a scheme for granting citizenship under \u201cMalaysia My Home\u201d, Naik has not availed it and has for various reasons ranging from his support base and huge property, chosen to remain an Indian citizen. \nWhat should come as a surprise to Indians is that his host, Malaysia, although an Islamic nation, is multi-ethnic and prides in its multi-racial, multi-religious polity. Under Mahathir Mohamad, who was the prime minister for 22 years, Malaysia has taken pride in practicing what it calls moderate Islam, different from the hard-line Wahabi West Asian one. \nThat, again, should not come as a surprise as the present Prime Minister, Najib Tun Razak, himself a moderate, is politically fighting Mahathir, the non-agenarian statesman who has fought every prime minister who came after him. \nYet another matter that should not cause surprise is that Najib\u2019s United Malays National Organization (UMNO), and the alliance Barisan Nsional (BN), that has ruled Malaysia since independence in 1957, has been leaning towards hard-line, conservative Islam as he faces crucial elections next year. His party and his ruling alliance have lost control of three states. Significantly, these three states witnessed the rise of pan-Islamic party (PAS). \nIslamic conservatives are consolidating in Malaysia. Now Najib is competing with PAS and the opposition for winning the Malay vote. \nIn supporting Naik, both Najib\u2019s party and PAS are one. Naik was the star at a religious conference that PAS had organized in July this year. \nThis pan-party support secures Naik\u2019s position in Malaysia where he is very popular among the Malays, the Muslims who are the backbone of the society and get preferential treatment as they are designated as \u201cBoomiputera\u201d (sons of the soil). \nHowever, Malaysia and other Muslim groups form 61 per cent of the population of 29 million. The Malaysian establishment is striving to boost this majority by including Muslims from neighbouring Thailand and Indonesia and even distant Sri Lanka. Ethnic Indian Muslims are also striving to be included as \u2018Boomiputeras\u2019. \nOver 24 percent of Malaysia\u2019s population is ethnic Chinese and at 2.1 million, ethnic Indians, a bulk of them Tamils form eight percent of the nation\u2019s population. They are also the largest Indian diaspora. \nThe ethnic Indians are politically divided into several political parties, but the largest of them are with Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC), which is a constituent of the ruling Barisan Nasional. \nTo his credit, MIC president, Dr S. Subramaniam, who is also Malaysia\u2019s Health Minister has opposed the hosting of Zakir Naik. \nOn April 20 this year, the minister said: Malaysia doesn't need Dr Zakir Naik as the country's own Islamic scholars are far more adept and competent in advocating the faith to Malaysians. \nThe minister has the traditional title of Datuk Seri. \nThe MIC president said that \u201cMalaysia's Islamic foundation, and its multi-religious national texture are not going to be nourished by Dr Zakir's preaching. \n\"On the contrary, it would only be inciting divisive forces to distort the unifying tenets of Islam as currently practiced in the country,\" he said in a statement. \nDr Subramaniam said that Malaysia is well acknowledged among other Islamic countries as a progressive nation with strong Islamic value systems embedded within its national character. \nHe added that Peace TV, the television channel owned by Dr Zakir has been banned in Bangladesh, Canada and in the United Kingdom. \nHe said that when a large Muslim country like Bangladesh has taken action against Dr Zakir, Malaysia should never allow him to remain in our midst advocating his nefarious and divisive form of Islamic worldview. \n\"Given the space, Zakir Naik would also infiltrate into our national space to disrupt national harmony which could lead to undesirable actions of grave consequence to national peace and stability. \n\"Zakir Naik should not be allowed to use his questionable religious credentials to solicit support from Malaysia to be shielded from possible prosecution in India,\" he said. \nHowever, his senior in the Najib government, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi confirmed that Dr Zakir was given PR status about five years ago. He contended that Naik was not receiving any preferential treatment from the Malaysian Government. \nHe also offered Malaysia\u2019s assistance to the Indian authorities in the investigations by the Indian NIA, and that would cover Naik\u2019s stay. \nMalaysian Government has taken the stand that during his stay in the country, Naik has not broken any local law. \nHamidi told Parliament: \"Over the time spent in this country, he has not broken any laws or regulations. As such, there is no reason from a legal standpoint to detain or arrest him.\" He added that Kuala Lumper has not received any official request from India \"related to terrorism allegations involving Naik\". \nZahid Hamidi and Prime Minister Najib have both posted photos on Facebook of their meetings with Naik last year in Malaysia. \nHowever, there has been alarm in the way Naik\u2019s public speeches are creating a fervour among his listeners, including non-Muslims, some of whom have converted to Islam. \nIt is now clear that support for a more politicised Islam has grown in recent years in Malaysia under PM Najib Razak. \nCritics see Naik's presence in Malaysia as another sign of top-level support for hard-line Islam in a country with substantial minorities of Christians, Hindus and Buddhists, and which has long projected a moderate Islamic image. \nNajib\u2019s UMNO party has been trying to appease an increasingly conservative ethnic Malay-Muslim base and religion has become a battleground ahead of elections the prime minister has to call by mid-2018. \nBangladesh suspended Peace TV channel, which features Naik's preachings, after some media reports claimed bombers of a Dhaka cafe that killed 22 people last year were Naik\u2019s admirers. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. \nThe Malaysian government accommodates Naik because \"he remains a reasonably popular character amongst Malays, who gloss over his more controversial aspects,\" said Rashaad Ali, an analyst with S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) in Singapore. \n\"If the government were to kick him out of the country, it causes them to lose religious credibility in the eyes of the public.\" \nAt his appearance at the Putra mosque last month, a female Reuters reporter asked about the investigation in India. Naik replied: \"Sorry, it is not right for me to speak with ladies in public.\" \nNaik did not respond to subsequent requests for comment from Reuters. \nA group of Malaysian activists has filed a suit in the High Court to deport Naik, saying he is a threat to public peace in the multi-racial society - about 40 percent of Malaysia's population is non-Muslim. \nOfficials at the Putra Mosque said Naik has been attending Friday prayers there for about a month. He has also been spotted in other mosques, hospitals and restaurants in the administrative capital in recent months, according to witnesses that Reuters spoke to. \nMalaysia's opposition Islamic Party (PAS), which has defended Naik in the past, has since urged the government to disregard any potential Indian extradition request, saying the allegations aim \"to block his influence and efforts to spread religious awareness among the international community.\" \nIslam is the official religion in Malaysia. The laws, however, are secular, though the country does have sharia courts for civil cases for Muslims. \nMalaysia's nine sultans, who take turns as the mostly ceremonial monarch, are the official guardians of Islam in Malaysia; last month they called for unity and religious harmony after what they described as \"excessive actions\" in the name of Islam. One of them harshly condemned a Muslim-only launderette. \n\"We are seeing this gravitation towards fundamentalism and a conservative idea of Islam because the current government doesn't want to be seen as secular anymore,\" said Ahmad Farouk Musa, founder of a moderate Islam think-tank, Islamic Renaissance Front (IRF). \nTo ensure Malay support, the government thinks it has \"to have Islamic credentials just like PAS,\" Farouk told Reuters. He remarked: \"Islam sells.\" \nIn September, Turkish writer Mustafa Akyol was detained for giving \"an unauthorised speech\" in the Malaysian capital, in which he argued that governments shouldn't police religion or morality. Zahid, also the home minister, said Akyol's book \"Islam Without Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty\" has been banned as it \"contravened norms of the society in Malaysia\". \n-Asian Tribune-  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zakir naik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malladi rama rao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "najib tun razak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "datuk seri dr ahmad zahid hamidi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahathir mohamad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "najib razak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "najib", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akyol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zakir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "datuk seri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boomiputeras", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "farouk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barisan nsional", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahathir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zahid hamidi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s. subramaniam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "subramaniam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamidi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuala lumper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmad farouk musa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zahid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rashaad ali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mustafa akyol", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putra mosque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barisan nasional", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peace tv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic renaissance front", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united malays national organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s rajaratnam school of international studies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic party", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india home", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sri lanka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thailand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malays", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bangladesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dhaka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:44.045+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6f24907b91b47ffbafc9d2553e81bdf73ecbabc1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmkfrozhHZZfNcQcOQO1gk3XxzexTu4RLV22PoHgeBnZ1Gl_oGomeARXDnUGalRyZL3AoUa_vfR8zIV_UwBLQAvvIjvGMbg.iNlZJiFV.1LYM8Pi4jj0nvLU", "site_full": "rti4empowerment.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://rti4empowerment.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "-", "title": "[rti4empowerment] Arun Jaitley: Do not use innocent depositors\u2019 money to bail in mismanaged banks", "title_full": "[rti4empowerment] Arun Jaitley: Do not use innocent depositors\u2019 money to bail in mismanaged banks", "published": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6f24907b91b47ffbafc9d2553e81bdf73ecbabc1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmkfrozhHZZfNcQcOQO1gk3XxzexTu4RLV22PoHgeBnZ1Gl_oGomeARXDnUGalRyZL3AoUa_vfR8zIV_UwBLQAvvIjvGMbg.iNlZJiFV.1LYM8Pi4jj0nvLU", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "RTI4EMPOWERMENT (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "[rti4empowerment] Arun Jaitley: Do not use innocent depositors\u2019 money to bail in mismanaged banks", "text": "  Hey,\n\nI just signed the petition \"Arun Jaitley: Do not use innocent depositors' money to bail in mismanaged banks #NoBailIn\" and wanted to see if you could help by adding your name.\n\nOur goal is to reach 25,000 signatures and we need more support.

Franken is denying an accusation by a former Democratic congressional aide that he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006. Alex Brandon AP Photo Franken faces fresh accusations, weighing his future By ANDREW TAYLOR Associated Press  00 AM WASHINGTON \nMinnesota Democrat Al Franken, facing fresh allegations of sexual misconduct and vanishing support from fellow Democrats, appears to be on the brink of resigning from the Senate. \nFranken scheduled an announcement for Thursday, though his office tweeted Wednesday evening that he had not made \"a final decision\" on resigning. \nBut a majority of the Senate's Democrats called on the two-term lawmaker to quit after a woman emerged Wednesday morning saying he forcibly tried to kiss her in 2006. Hours later, another woman said Franken inappropriately squeezed \"a handful of flesh\" on her waist while posing for a photo with her in 2009. That brought the number of women alleging misconduct by Franken to at least eight. \nFranken, the former comedian who made his name on \"Saturday Night Live,\" faces a chorus of calls to step aside, and Democratic senators said they expected their liberal colleague to resign.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \n\"Enough is enough,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. \"We need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is OK, none of it is acceptable, and we, as elected leaders, should absolutely be held to a higher standard.\" \nGillibrand was the first to call for Franken's resignation on Wednesday, but a torrent of Democrats quickly followed. \n\"I'm shocked and appalled by Sen. Franken's behavior,\" said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state. \"It's clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time. It's time for him to step aside.\" \nThough the writing appeared to be on the wall, Franken's departure was not certain. A tweet posted Wednesday evening on Franken's Twitter account said: \"Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate.\" \nLate in the day, Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York added his voice. \n\"I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately,\" Schumer said. \nThe resignation demands came in rapid succession even though Franken on Wednesday vehemently denied the new accusation that came from a former Democratic congressional aide, who said he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006. \nThe woman, who was not identified, told Politico that Franken pursued her after her boss had left and she was collecting her belongings. She said that she ducked to avoid his lips and that Franken told her: \"It's my right as an entertainer.\" \nFranken, in a statement, said the idea he would claim such conduct as a right was \"preposterous.\" \nBut it was soon clear that his position had become untenable. \nFellow Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who spoke to Franken, wrote on Twitter, \"I am confident he will make the right decision.\" \nThe pressure only mounted Tuesday, when Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., resigned after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. Rep Ruben Kihuen, D-Nev., faces pressure to resign as well over allegations reported by Buzzfeed that he repeatedly propositioned a former campaign worker. \nWhile Franken apparently is departing, Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore could be arriving, if he prevails in a Dec. 12 special election. Multiple women have accused the 70-year-old Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were teens and he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s. If Moore is elected, it could create a political nightmare for Republicans, who have promised an ethics probe. \nA national conversation about sexual harassment has intensified this fall after the heavily publicized case of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of many acts of sexual misconduct, including rape, by actresses and other women. Just on Wednesday, Time magazine named as its person of the year the \"silence breakers\" \u2014 women who have come forward on sexual harassment. \nPunishment has been swift for leaders in entertainment, media and sports while members of Congress have tried to survive the onslaught of allegations. \nFranken already faced a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into previous claims by several other women that he groped them or sought to forcibly kiss them. \nThe allegations began in mid-November when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan. \nOther allegations followed, including a woman who says Franken put his hand on her buttocks as they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Two women told the Huffington Post that Franken squeezed their buttocks at political events during his first campaign for the Senate in 2008. A fourth woman, an Army veteran, alleged Franken cupped her breast during a photo on a USO tour in 2003. \nFranken has apologized for his behavior but has also disputed some of the allegations.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "al franken", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "franken", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kirsten gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leeann tweeden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john conyers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "politico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew taylor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruben kihuen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy klobuchar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buzzfeed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patty murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey weinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex brandon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schumer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate ethics committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota state fair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huffington post", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "d-minn.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-nev.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-mich.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington  minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:45.024+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "78556eee5b0907b03a4c46ed06aacd78607452d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pCImt8UBblXmBMa3hAX2jzrS37C6BfUUy", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/fa/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/fa/ -

It was the most unlikely lead at the end of a first half in which the hosts dominated. City have not lost a game since April, and face second-place rivals Manchester United next Sunday.

Our pace and pass were quicker and better. That is why we are so happy \u2014 every game is so tough and it is important to keep our momentum. \u201cWe started well but lost our patience and couldn\u2019t find the players in position. They moved too much. \u201cBut you have ups and downs \u2014 what is important is that in the second half it was outstanding the way we played. \u201cIt means we have done 39 points in a row. That is a lot. You see how they run and how they fight, that\u2019s why we are so proud again. \u201cBefore next week\u2019s match against Manchester United, we have to travel to Ukraine and after that think about Old Trafford. We are going to try to be who we are,\u201d he said. West Ham manager David Moyes, on his part, said: \u201cI have to say it was a really good effort. We defended much better today.

An unbroken fellow tries to cover up sin. He or she tries to play smart with sin, particularly when its repercussions are not immediately apparent. In proverbs 28:13, the Holy spirit has this message for such people: \u201cHe that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.\u201d If you fall into sin and the most important thing to you at that moment is that no one should know what you have done, it is because you are not broken. In any case, to what extent can you truly hide sin? For how long can you cover up your evil deeds? Can you hide your sins from God? Hebrews 4:13 answer this: \u201cNeither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.\u201d Thinking that you can hide away your sins from God is living is a fool\u2019s Paradise. This can be compared to the proverbial ostrich which buries his head in the sand to hide from predators, not realizing that is body is still visible to its enemy and vulnerable to attack. Not only are your sin never hidden from God, they are equally not hidden from the saints in Heaven. Hebrews chapter 11 provides a list of saints that ran this race ahead of us and are now in Heaven. Hebrews 12:1 calls them a \u2018cloud of witnesses\u2019. These brethren know and can see all we are doing. Someone who was privileged to visit Heaven and return to earth said that there is a curtain in Heaven that anyone there can pull and the fellow will be able to monitor the activities of anybody here on earth. Another brother who also had that same privilege spoke of how saints in Heaven gather together in a place like a stadium, where they watch earthly saints facing crucial trials of their faith. When a saint being watched compromises, they shout in disappointment, just like when your favourite football team concedes a goal. In contrast, when a person stands for his or her faith in Christ, they shout with excitement. Be aware that you are being watched. If only you can imagine the number of eyes monitoring you, you would be conscious of the fact that nothing you do is hidden! Key Point: The next time you are tempted to sin in secret, just imagine multiple eyes peering at you from every corner of the enclosure you are in.   Hymn 6 1. Deeper, deeper in the love of Jesus Daily let me go; Higher, higher in the school of wisdom, More of grace to know. Chorus: O deeper yet, I pray, And higher every day, In Thy precious, holy Word. 2. Deeper, deeper, blessed Holy Spirit, Take me deeper still, Till my life is wholly lost in Jesus, And His perfect will. 3. Deeper, deeper! though it cost hard trials, Deeper let me go! Rooted in the holy love of Jesus, Let me fruitful grow. 4. Deeper, higher, every day in Jesus, Till all conflict past, Finds me conqu'ror, and in His own image Perfected at last. 5. Deeper, deeper in the faith of Jesus, Holy faith and true; In His pow'r and soul exulting wisdom Let me peace pursue.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "e. a. adeboye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zephaniah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus the son of god", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christ", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kjv", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:47.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0a28ce5218b330ae65fac536fd64cc2996aa049f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ApQiAEWQSsNC4xs9vhPGBK8rlQyLrFaUEwOrutLm3_w3eJrHZY0om4r6Ux7jw8vY-", "site_full": "www.babycenter.ca", "site": "babycenter.ca", "site_section": "http://www.babycenter.ca/g25018573/december-2017", "site_categories": ["pregnancy", "family_and_parenting"], "section_title": "December 2017 - BabyCenter Canada", "title": "Leakage", "title_full": "Leakage - December 2017 - BabyCenter Canada", "published": "2017-12-06T18:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.babycenter.ca/webassets/countries/en_CA/logo_200x200.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82588, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b9c98f6fec7dd7ee6edef82765ea1379cc6c8ef0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ApQiAEWQSsNC4xs9vhPGBK8rlQyLrFaUEwOrutLm3_w3eJrHZY0omP9JQDidyzn0htL8.YlCxbw--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Wifeandmom2", "published": "2017-12-07T00:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Yup.
