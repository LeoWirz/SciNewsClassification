An overview from Huffington Post : \nDemocrats have warned that after passing a tax bill that adds to the national debt, Republicans will say it\u2019s all the more urgent to cut Social Security and Medicare. \nWhile overhauling those popular programs is a long-term Republican goal, in the near-term conservative lawmakers are more eager to cut food stamps. \nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), founder of the House Freedom Caucus, told HuffPost on Tuesday that the influential bloc of conservative Republicans will push for \u201cwelfare reform\u201d legislation next year that would add new restrictions on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits\u2026 \nHe said the basic idea would be new restrictions on able-bodied adults \u2015 even if they have children \u2015 along the lines of a bill he introduced earlier this year. Robert Rector, a welfare expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Jordan\u2019s bill would cut SNAP spending by 20 percent over 10 years, which would amount to more than $100 billion\u2026. \nRoughly 42 million low-income Americans, of whom 44 percent are children, receive monthly SNAP benefits that can be used to buy food in grocery stores \u2015 making it one of the U.S. government\u2019s biggest and most expensive economic safety net programs. \nJordan and Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) talked about the idea with Trump earlier this year, and Jordan said the president is enthusiastic about it\u2026 \nRepublicans have used resentment toward the food stamp program \u2015 established in 1964 as part of President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d \u2015 as a political weapon since at least the 1970s. Ronald Reagan, during his 1976 presidential run, would tell audiences of a \u201cstrapping young buck\u201d outrageously using food stamps to buy steak. \nBefore we turn to this Republican implementation of one of Lambert\u2019s rules of neoliberalism, \u201cGo die,\u201d note that Democrats are all with the bogus premise that Federal deficit spending is a problem, and therefore budget cuts are necessary and desirable. Since neither party will cut military spending or corporate pork, the only thing left to cut is social safety nets. So don\u2019t kid yourself about the Democrats. They\u2019ll make cuts, but slowly and with feigned regret, while as we can see from the quotes in the HuffPo article, the Republicans make them with glee. \nIt only took a few minutes on YouTube to find this priceless clip in which a Fox reporter, with a straight face, tells viewers repeatedly that the rich suffered more in the aftermath of the crisis than the poor. Since when is a decline in paper wealth as big a deal as going from poor to desperate? \nThe Republican canard is the claim that the food stamp program is full of modern welfare queens, slough-offs who need to get off their couches and find work. First, as readers know all too well, there is plenty of un and underemployment in the US. People would not be accepting debilitating warehouse jobs at Amazon if there was adequate demand for workers. Nearly 95% of the jobs created when Obama was in office were part time or contract work. Those willing to work can\u2019t necessarily cobble together the equivalent of a full time paycheck. \nSecond, many jobs pay only the minimum wage, which is below a living wage for a family even with two earners, and below a living wage even for single people in virtually all cities in the US. And what are people in the boonies told to do? Move to cities to get work, even though they seldom have the personal connections to help them land a job there, and often don\u2019t have enough scratch to fund a relocation (as in have enough money to put down a deposit on a rental). \nThird, in keeping with the fact that many jobs don\u2019t pay a living wage, people who are employed are also on food stamps. This article by Peter Van Buren, a former State Department employee who fell into low-wage work after he became a whistleblower and was fired, is important reading. Key section: \n20 mega-companies dominate the minimum-wage world. Walmart alone employs 1.4 million minimum-wage workers; Yum Brands (Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, KFC) is in second place; and McDonald\u2019s takes third. Overall, 60 percent of minimum-wage workers are employed by businesses not officially considered \u201csmall\u201d by government standards, and of course carve-outs for really small businesses are possible, as was done with Obamacare. \nKeep in mind that not raising wages costs you money. \nThose minimum wage workers who can\u2019t make enough and need to go on food assistance? Well, Walmart isn\u2019t paying for those food stamps (now called SNAP), you are. The annual bill that states and the federal government foot for working families making poverty-level wages is $153 billion. A single Walmart Supercenter costs taxpayers between $904,542 and $1.75 million per year in public assistance money. According to Florida Congressman Alan Grayson, in many states Walmart employees are the largest group of Medicaid recipients. They are also the single biggest group of food stamp recipients. In other words, those everyday low prices at the chain are, in part, subsidized by your tax money. Meanwhile, an estimated 18 percent of food stamps (SNAP) are spent at Walmart. \nYves here. Do you think the Walmarts of the world will raise wages to compensate for the loss of the food stamp subsidy? No way. \nAnd let\u2019s look at another population that disproves the \u201cIf you are broke, you must be lazy\u201d myth. From a must-read Guardian tory on farm suicides : \nWe were growing food, but couldn\u2019t afford to buy it. We worked 80 hours a week, but we couldn\u2019t afford to see a dentist, let alone a therapist\u2026. \nSince 2013, net farm income for US farmers has declined 50%. Median farm income for 2017 is projected to be negative $1,325. \nAnother sign of rising stress: homelessness is up for the first time since 2010. From the Wall Street Journal : \nIn an annual report to Congress released Wednesday, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development data shows the homeless population was 553,742 in 2017, a 0.7% increase from 2016\u2026 \nHUD Secretary Ben Carson said rents are rising faster than incomes in major cities, \u201cforcing too many of our neighbors into our shelters and onto our streets.\u201d.. \nOne in four of the nation\u2019s homeless population could be found in New York City or Los Angeles County, according to the report. New York City had the largest homeless population with 76,501 people, a 4.1% increase from the prior year. Los Angeles County counted 55,188 people living in shelters and on streets, a 26% increase over the prior year. \nA key difference between the two major metropolitan areas: in New York, 95% were found to be living in shelters, while in Los Angeles County only 25% were in shelters. \nYves here. I question that 95% claim. The homeless often avoid shelters save when the weather is very cold because shelters are perceived to be unsafe. During the brief life of Occupy Wall Street, many homeless people came and camped out in Zucotti Park because Occupy Wall Street provided free food and staying there at night was perceived to be better than going to a shelter. When the encampment was cleared out, some churched opened up to allow the former Zucotti Park denizens sleep there overnight. Our Outis did night duty regularly at one of those churches because they needed people to act as de facto guards, particularly to keep men from trying to force themselves on women. And this was a real issue; I recall Outis describing various safety-related incidents in which he\u2019d had to intervene. \nBack to the Journal: \nSizable year-over-year increases in the homeless population were registered in several California jurisdictions, including the Sacramento area, 47%, the Oakland area, 36%, and Orange County, 11%. Among major California cities, San Francisco was an outlier, with a 2% decline. \nThe Seattle area, another West Coast region that has struggled with high housing costs, saw an 8.5% increase in its homeless population. \nSo if more of the working and unemployed poor have food stamps cut, one of the results will be more homelessness, of the visible sort that the Feds were able to count, and the under the radar type of people living in cars. \nAnd as I said, don\u2019t expect the Democrats to do much, save for a few bona fide progressives who run on the Democratic party ticket. They also think the well-off deserve their high incomes, and while they express more concern about the poor, they are loath to spend any chips. 22 0 61 1 0", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yves smith", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "obamacare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yves", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronald reagan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter van buren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben carson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan grayson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lambert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lyndon johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark meadows", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert rector", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim jordan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cut food stamps", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "freedom caucus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heritage foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pizza hut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kfc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huffington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walmart supercenter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcdonald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walmart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yum brands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taco bell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of housing and urban development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huffpost", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supplemental nutrition assistance program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house freedom caucus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicaid", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sacramento", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oakland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orange county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "occupy wall street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zucotti park", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:14.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0eb3782f189f8c632b7c05ee7f34c640a56b217c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.JS7Q7yQa_w2JkwoE.D.O3g0xYCCOEV.te264NBp.iFCinhrrkPKyY28yBufWWPC8-", "site_full": "www.mustang6g.com", "site": "mustang6g.com", "site_section": "http://www.mustang6g.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=102", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "Issues, Repairs, Warranty, TSB, Recalls - 2015+ S550 Mustang Forum (GT, GT350, GT500, Mach 1, Ecoboost) - Mustang6G.com", "title": "2018 Mustang GT vs 2017 911 GTS", "title_full": "2018 Mustang GT vs 2017 911 GTS - 2015+ S550 Mustang Forum (GT, GT350, GT500, Mach 1, Ecoboost) - Mustang6G.com", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0ee39bbefb2101e283242f9780383fd3461b04cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.JS7Q7yQa_w2JkwoE.D.O3g0xYCCOEV.te264NBp.iFCinhrrkPKyY1ZrsYtQc5gny8YGhxQFb7g--", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "1blkpny", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : (Post 2084004) You won't understand the Porsche problem until you drive one.

Despite significant improvement in patient care in ICUs, the mortality arising from acute renal failure in ICU remains at over 50%. Over the past 20 years, significant improvement has taken place in the field of hemodialysis and the approach to the treatment of acute renal failure has underwent transformation. Use of novel, user friendly and safer devices has permitted medical practitioner to achieve well-tolerated, efficient and safe renal replacement therapy. \nPatient with acute renal failure often require renal replacement therapy when there is a significant decline in glomerular filtration rate or at the risk of developing solute toxicity. Continuous renal replacement therapy is applied to acute renal failure patients in the ICU. CRRT refers to a collection of blood purification techniques with inherent differences with respect to mechanism of solute transport, presence of lack of dialysate solution, type of membrane and vascular access. \nTOC Of This Reports : http://www.acutemarketreports.com/category/medical-devices-market \nBased on product types, the global continuous renal replacement therapy market is categorized into systems and consumables (filters, tubing sets and disposables). Between these, the consumables segment occupies the larger revenue share and will continue its dominance through the forecast period. Greater consumption volume of filters, fluids and other such disposables mainly contribute to the dominance of this segment. On the other hand, systems segment will witness steady growth during the forecast period due to increasing prevalence of acute renal failure in hospitalized patients and technological development in CRRT systems with respect to greater filtration volume and higher permeability. \nChapter 1.

In this Dec. 5, 2017, photo, Kavita Patel poses for a photo in Creve Coeur, Mo. \nBy RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVARAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - People on Medicaid are more prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But that's not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge. \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" \nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n- Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n- Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n- Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C. \nFor the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point. For Medicaid recipients, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points.

U.S. health of... \nBy LAURAN NEERGAARDAP Medical Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens. \n___ \nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

(The log loss considred here is binary meaning, reference probability is either 1 or 0).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:16.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "893aa4c93397c2f29ce1bf6ec03f9a82e03affc3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9q.auYpKpv6gIo_ZTRTIhneuuv_QqFI1b_SRqtj1SUGBlcGDaSrQmjh9rCyJVr2oss2L_.BRwZ9x7PrdPmEeCBi4W1DBHxnzhXb__pCMWMV5NJbFWxX25BpvdNtHYvYLcRPprpaIY7Zs7QmkcZoCo7yJ_3vCpg6sgdM4m6xgc.Lg--", "site_full": "www.fanforum.com", "site": "fanforum.com", "site_section": "http://www.fanforum.com/f410/", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Nathan Fillion - Fan Forum", "title": "Nathan & Castle Cast Appreciation Thread #3: Because we love that they are all still good friends!

There have been many ads encouraging people to \u201cjoin the movement\u201d and \u201cbe part of the future\u201d. But how much do we know about this form of digital currency and its consumption of energy resources around the world? \nWhat is Bitcoin? \nBitcoin is a type of digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank and underpinned by a system called blockchain, which records transactions. \nTo make sure that transactions are not falsified or records of ownership changed, participants of the Bitcoin network have to sign off on transactions in \u201cblocks\u2019, hence blockchain. It was created in 2009 and basically anyone with enough electricity, internet and space to house computers that can \u201cmine\u201d Bitcoin. \nPeople who verify these \u201cblocks\u201d are rewarded with fresh Bitcoin as an incentive for doing this type of work, which involves computers completing complex cryptographic problems. This is what they call \u201cBitcoin mining\u201d. \nWhat is cryptocurrency? \nCryptocurrency is a medium of exchange using cryptography (a process of process of converting legible information into an almost uncrackable code) to secure the transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets. It was born out of the need for secure communication in the Second World War and Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency. \nBitcoin is now worth more than $10 000 (+- R135 556) as of November 2017 and soaring to record breaking levels but it\u2019s not all positive. \nBitcoin uses more energy than 159 countries use in a year \nRecent research by energy tariff comparison service PowerCompare.co.uk shows that the amount of energy used by computers mining bitcoin globally has already exceeded the amount used on average by 159 countries. \nUsing stats from Bitcoin and cryptocurrency data provider Digiconomist, PowerCompare.co.uk compared the amount of electricity used to mine Bitcoin to the amount used by different countries annually. They found that 29.05 TWh of electricity was used to mine bitcoin compared to an estimated 25 TWh of electricity per year used by Ireland. Here is a map that shows the countries that Bitcoin eclipsed in energy usage. \nIf Bitcoin miners were a country they\u2019d rank 61st in the world in terms of electricity consumption. If it keeps increasing at this rate, Bitcoin mining would consume all the world\u2019s electricity by February 2020.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "digiconomist", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:16.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "55ae4402c16399d3f243616ea665ae6eff4de70f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0.XfYIkVTcehcVGpyb6r8Hb967yu4LzrP9xcgD9cCFXQKD_G9uRJ2oeZ1gjGYSV6d9HLOCOrvDbjoerHdJp8I", "site_full": "www.booking.com", "site": "booking.com", "site_section": "https://www.booking.com/hotel/it/a-casa-di-iosa.en-gb.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Apartment A casa di Iosa, Legnano, Italy -

Let Singapore be a better place where we are one family, without walls differentiating parents who are all trying to build a home for their children.\" \nA report by the committee and a response by MND, made public on Wednesday (Nov 29), rejected the petition by seven single parents, which was submitted by Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng on their behalf in September. \nMND said it has no intention to amend the law and introduce exemptions for unmarried and divorced parents, adding that the Government is committed to housing the nation, and ensuring the well-being of children. \nThe ministry said HDB is able to make changes at policy level, which does not require changing the law. \nThe single parents had hoped that instead of granting case-by-case exceptions, housing rules could be made more inclusive at a time when divorce rates are climbing. \nThe Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware) said the Government has missed out on meeting the needs of some vulnerable families here. \nAware had submitted a statement supporting the petition, and made several suggestions including letting divorced parents rent public housing or buy subsidised housing immediately after the matrimonial flat is sold. \nMs Jolene Tan, head of advocacy and research at Aware, said: \"Single parents have made it clear that, despite MND's promises, housing policies aren't meeting their needs.\" \n\"The Committee has missed an opportunity to respond to the needs and concerns of Singapore's vulnerable families.\" \nIn its reply on Wednesday, MND had said it is mindful \"not to undermine the prevailing social norm of parenthood within marriage\" when helping unmarried parents. \nIt added: \"A range of government agencies work together to ensure that no child is without adequate housing, regardless of whether his or her parents are single or married.\" \nMr Ng told The Straits Times earlier he plans to file a parliamentary question on the criteria single parents need to fulfil before their applications or appeals for public housing are approved. \nWritten by Cheow Sue-Ann for The Straits Times", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cheow sue-ann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jolene tan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louis ng", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "public petitions committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mnd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "straits times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hdb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "housing board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of national development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nee soon grc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "association of women for action and research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:17.039+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6d74fac4ba538b4f8139539dee894433344f7323", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.CtWGBCQ5SYfyGpKoy2hG2X2sAAS0pd8iprnR_u.U0CmAWJOw601hjkXKRdZgU1s_zP.b8ZkJkcDbuECF5BNfenDQZDCMdKxq4x0msalCDCQodcop_jNFb", "site_full": "www.mumsnet.com", "site": "mumsnet.com", "site_section": "http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/sleep", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Sleep | Mumsnet Discussion ", "title": "6 1/2 month old just wants to be cuddled all night", "title_full": "6 1/2 month old just wants to be cuddled all night | Mumsnet Discussion", "published": "2017-12-07T07:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "/images/logo/mn-logo-square.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6762, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eacbb928cd29d8d2975f86dfaebf8fc973e0cbd6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.CtWGBCQ5SYfyGpKoy2hG2X2sAAS0pd8iprnR_u.U0CmAWJOw601hjkXKRdZgU1s_zP.b8ZkJkcDbuECF5BNfenDQZDCMdKxq4x0msalCDCbodxqmRLl0cTNbS6QrbUAo-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "NameChange30", "published": "2017-12-07T16:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Summer\nNot criticising you at all but just wanted to point out to others reading that the reason midwives recommend putting babies on their back to sleep is to decrease the risk of SIDS.

It was the late Rico Yan who first called him Kuya E (his real name is Ernie) when they did \"Got to Believe\" for Star Cinema, and it stuck. He's now known as a motivational speaker inspiring audiences in various parts of the world in Europe, US and Asia.\n\nThis started when he was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer 11 years ago. He was introduced to a food supplement called C24/7 to which he attributes his healing. He then put up his own multi-level marketing company to market this, produced by Nature's Way in Utah and it clicked, making him a millionaire. He was the invited to talk about his healing experience in Pampanga and this began his career as an inspirational speaker.\n\n\n While in Kuwait, a Kuwaiti producer heard him sing and encouraged him to try a singing career. He has just recorded his first single, 'Ako'y Nangarap', an inspirational song about pursuing your dreams, now available on iTunes worldwide. A whole album will soon be released, produced by music icon Vehnee Saturno. He's also staging his first big concert, \"Miracle, Music and Love\", at the Music Museum on December 14, 7 PM, produced by Big Eyes Events and Productions, with new talents Ani Pearl, Rapido, Himig Handog's Aikee and E4 Band as his special guests. For tickets, call 0921-325-3118, 0956-683-4843.\n\n\"The concert will not just entertain you,\" he says. \"It will also inspire you dahil marami kaming ihahatid na mensaheng maaaring makatulong makapagpapabago ng iyong buhay,\" says Kuya E. \"Abangan nyo rin ang aking bagong talk show sa Net25 starting this January 2018 entitled 'RYTS'or Rule Yourself to Success.

The results were appalling. Backstory \nIt\u2019s now known that Russian-based groups purchased Facebook ads promoting fake news stories with the intent of influencing the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. \nIt isn\u2019t every day that my profession (Facebook and internet advertising) makes international headlines, so today I\u2019ll provide a comprehensive overview of the Russian\u2019s Facebook advertising playbook for fake news. \nSpecifically, I\u2019ll cover: How to set up fake news and broadcast propaganda via Facebook ads, step-by-step. Quantify the cost and impact distributing fake news via Facebook ad campaigns. Explore if this influence peddling strategy is still viable today, and how effective (or ineffective) Facebook is at combatting ads that promote fake news. \nLet\u2019s get to work. Step 1: Create a Fake News Website \nThis is super easy: \nThis is a completely fake article. Sign up for a free blog hosting service and customize a template - In my example, I went with \u201cCitizen News Network\u201d and used a backwards CNNlogo. Create a fake news story - The most effective fake news stories exploit the most divisive issues within society. In this case, I just re-used a popular fake news story about a protester that purported to be paid to protest Donald Trump rallies. \nThe reason for using a well-known fake news story and a ridiculous-looking website was to make it super-easy for Facebook to recognize the fake news. Step 2: Create a Fake News Page on Facebook \nThis is also ridiculously easy to do. Go to Facebook. Create a fake company page . Upload your fake logo and fake news stories, like this: Step 3: Create a Facebook Ad, Promoting the Fake News on Your Fake Page \nFacebook makes it super easy to promote posts. Just click on the \u201cBoost Post\u201d button, as shown here: \nBoosting my Fake News Post with Facebook Ads \nNext, we need to target the Facebook ad to people who we think will likely be interested in seeing it. \nDonald Trump and Hillary Clinton spent a combined $6.8 billion in their respective bids to become president in 2016. But the U.S. election is remarkably easy (and cheap) to hack. That\u2019s because the outcome of presidential elections often hinges on just a few thousand votes (just 11,602 in Michigan, for example) in key battleground states, as we saw in 2016. \nTo hack an election, you\u2019d probably want to target the swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, all of which had reasonably close outcomes. Had all three gone the other way, we\u2019d have a different President in office today. \nNext, you have to target the Facebook ad to people who you think will be interested in seeing it. \nTargeting my Fake News using Facebook Ads \nFor optimal effectiveness, you have to utilize \u201cDetailed Targeting\u201d corresponding to the interests and demographics of the people we think will eat this stuff up. \nThat could be: People who donate to conservative political causes. People who are likely to engage with conservative political content. \nBased on this criteria, Facebook has identified 4.4 million people. Their suggested ad targeting criteria is fantastically granular: \nDetailed Fake News Ad Targeting Using Facebook Ads \nOnce you\u2019ve done that, specify a budget (e.g., $50 for this experiment) then click \u201cPlace Order\u201d. Step 4: Analyzing the Fake News Facebook Ad Campaign\u2019s Results \nWithin minutes of placing the order, the ad was approved and my Notifications pane lit up with alerts of people engaging with my fake Facebook ad. \nHigh Post Engagement for My Fake News Post Boosted via Facebook Ads \nAll in, the post reached 4,645 people and generated: 44 \u201cLikes\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://medium.com/marketing-and-entrepreneurship/facebook-ads-fake-news-and-the-shockingly-low-cost-of-influencing-an-election-data-ca7a086fa01c", "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pM7kSy6aj1S1wrzKX4CqRA.png", "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KKBCOn25X3-gvv7QxK0Gtw.jpeg", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-advertising/facebook-says-10-million-u-s-users-saw-russia-linked-ads-idUSKCN1C71YM", "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YrxMQkV_b46AF6NdfqYvFw.jpeg", "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tA3XuIGWKxSHsG1IO13nHw.png", "https://www.facebook.com/business/news/relevance-score", "http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/09/30/ad-fatigue", "https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/09/information-operations-update/", "https://www.facebook.com/iq/articles/measuring-campaign-effectiveness-making-search-work-harder", "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-cctE2ysclv-PPQGbf9n0Q.png", "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6oJh92RFQAzn3pNknloBKQ.jpeg", "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gYEDTQsGKVLu_ltoJ8Fxgw.png", "https://www.citizennewsnexsus.com/single-post/2017/10/05/Donald-Trump-Protester-Speaks-Out-I-Was-Paid-3500-To-Protest-Trump%E2%80%99s-Rally", "https://www.facebook.com/business/products/pages", "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*46QgON-tpb0cKu7EUZFirg.jpeg", "http://www.snopes.com/donald-trump-protester-speaks-out/", "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_qX0E8mn9kVH6JwAOH4Mfg.png", "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KvasmXx0PiwbLrC6Txn3Wg.jpeg", "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tewAk8prQ2t5EMFcv1TAKw.png"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fac", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "my fake news post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fake news on your fake page facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook ads", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook fake news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fake news facebook ad campaign", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook ads all", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "post comments every facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:18.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4a88590e0c4f43bcf009b792f28439b55a3d2da7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zqhE0QuFqf0bXoDAUk12BjCS.skZKEBng-", "site_full": "groups.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://groups.google.com/a/googleproductforums.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=categories/maps/issues-and-troubleshooting", "site_categories": ["business"], "section_title": "Google Maps &amp; Earth Help Forum - Google Product Forums", "title": "Consolidate reviews from 2 accounts into 1?

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite). Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., meets with reporters after House Republicans held a closed-door strategy session as the deadline looms to pass a spending bill to fund the government by week's end, on Capitol Hill. \nBy ALAN FRAMAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Congress seems set to prevent a weekend government shutdown, but lawmakers and President Donald Trump still have longer-range disputes to settle over spending, immigration and other issues before they can declare budget peace. \nWith many on both sides deciding a headline-grabbing federal closure would be a political blunder - at least for now - the House planned to approve legislation Thursday financing federal agencies through Dec. 22. The Senate seemed ready to follow. Without legislation, many agencies would run out of money after midnight Friday and grind to a close. \nThe two-week spending measure is aimed at giving both parties' bargainers more time to reach longer-term budget decisions. To jumpstart that negotiating, Trump and congressional leaders were meeting Thursday to try reaching agreements. \nThe prospects for successful White House talks were buffeted Wednesday when the impulsive Trump blurted to reporters that a shutdown \"could happen.\" He blamed Democrats, saying they want \"illegal immigrants pouring into our country, bringing with them crime, tremendous amounts of crime.\" \nLast week, an unexpected attack by Trump on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., prompted the two Democrats to skip a bargaining session that was planned then. \nThis time, the White House smoothed the waters by following up with a more peaceable, written statement. It praised Pelosi and Schumer for choosing to \"put their responsibility to the American people above partisanship\" and said Trump was anticipating productive talks between \"leaders who put their differences aside.\" \nLater, the White House issued another statement indicating Trump would sign the two-week spending extension. It also laid out administration budget goals, saying money for the military including missile defense and security along the border with Mexico \"must be prioritized in a long-term funding agreement.\" \nFor Republicans, a shutdown would put a humiliating bookend on a year in which they've controlled the White House and Congress with little to show for it. They want the public to focus instead on the GOP's prized $1.5 trillion tax bill, which party leaders hope to send Trump by Christmas. \nThe two-week spending bill also makes money available to several states that are running out of funds for the Children's Health Insurance Program. That widely popular program provides medical care to more than 8 million children. \nEven the head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, whose members have been threatening to oppose the temporary spending measure, predicted passage. \n\"No one wants a shutdown, including Freedom Caucus members,\" Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told reporters. \nThe roughly 30-member caucus has been trying to win promises from leaders of spending curbs and quick passage of a full-year defense budget in exchange for backing the short-term bill. Without support from many of them, Republicans would need votes from Democrats to push the temporary spending measure through the House. \nWhile many Democrats seemed likely to oppose the short-term bill, enough were expected to support it in the Senate to allow its passage there.

Catalonia\u2019s recent declaration of independence may have been a largely symbolic act but the economic hangover it has left in its wake is very real. Last month the number of unemployed in the region rose by 7,391 the highest rise in a month of November since 2009. During the same period the number of people registered with social security fell by 4,038 the sharpest fall since November 2013. The economic pain is already taking a psychological toll. According to a new poll published by Spain\u2019s Center for Sociological Research (CIS for its Spanish acronym), the number of households that fear that their economic situation will worsen in the next six months surged from 14.2% in August to 22.2% in October. By contrast, in Spain as a whole there was hardly any change, with the rate barely budging from 15.1% to 15.6%. Almost 3,000 firms have shifted the registered address of their headquarters outside Catalonia since the banned referendum on October 1, many to Madrid. Although the exodus has slowed in recent weeks, every day dozens of Catalan companies continue to change their registered office, despite the express appeal of Spain\u2019s Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, to stop doing so after the activation of Article 155 of the Constitution. The Catalan exodus has so far been purely administrative, with companies effectively shifting domiciles, the \u2018brass plate\u2019 of the business, to avoid legal and tax complications rather than moving staff or operations, which would have huge cost and logistical implications. Many of the companies worry that secession would leave them outside the Eurozone and exposed to the unpredictable policies and possible tax grabs of a new republic burdened with heavy debts. Such fears were compounded last week when Catalonia\u2019s deposed president Carles Puigdemont suggested that the region may be better off outside not just Spain, but also the European Union. \u201cPerhaps there are not many people who want to form part of this EU, so insensitive to the abuse of human rights, of the democratic right of a part of its territory only because a post-Franco right wants it to be that way,\u201d he told Israeli state broadcaster Kan. Puigdemont\u2019s comments, ironically made from Brussels, provoked a fierce backlash from both Spanish and Catalan politicians, as well as companies based in the region. They included the Volkswagen-owned SEAT group, which warned that if a new government in Catalonia called another referendum on secession from Spain and the European Union, it would not only change its headquarters, but would close the bulk of its facilities in Catalonia, including the Martorell plant. Those facilities directly support some 14,500 local jobs. Together with the Nissan plant in the Zona Franca district of Barcelona, SEAT\u2019s Martorell plant accounts for almost 20% of the total automotive production in Spain (555,000 vehicles out of a total of 2.8 million). The two factories underpin one of the most important industrial sectors in Catalonia, providing jobs for over 90,000 people as well as 7% of Catalonia\u2019s Gross Domestic Product. If SEAT or Nissan were to shut their facilities in Catalonia, it would be a massive blow for the region. In the short-to-medium term, it would also hurt Spain\u2019s economy, since it would take the companies up to two years to relocate their production facilities to other parts of Spain. In the interim they would probably shift production to other plants in Europe with excess capacity. In other words, Spanish exports would sharply decline, at least temporarily. This underscores a vital point (and one that is all too often ignored by people in other parts of Spain): what is bad for Catalonia\u2019s economy is not necessarily good for the rest of Spain, especially given the large role Catalonia plays in Spain\u2019s export economy. Although Catalonia makes up only 16% of Spain\u2019s population, its four provinces (Barcelona, Gerona, Lleida and Tarragona) account for 25% of its exports. Barcelona, of course, is the dominant region, accounting for $56 billion of Spain\u2019s total exports in 2016 ($277 billion), almost double what Spain\u2019s second biggest exporting province, Madrid, generated during the same period ($30.5 billion). If investment and production in Catalonia were to decline for a long period, this would have serious repercussions for Spain\u2019s exporting prowess. Yet this is precisely what many Spanish people are trying to achieve. According to a survey conducted by The Reputation Institute, 23% of Spanish people have stopped buying Catalan goods altogether. Another 21% are thinking of doing the same. So, Catalonia\u2019s biggest export market, the rest of Spain, is shrinking fast. As former Spanish minister Josep Borell recently warned, the boycott has reached such a scale that it risks severing economic ties between Spanish and Catalan businesses, ties that have taken decades to forge. Indeed, so serious is the threat that the central government in Madrid has even tabled a motion to be debated next week to prevent people from exercising \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against any products made in Spain, including those from Catalonia. How they hope to actually enforce such a policy, especially now that the genie of anti-Catalan sentiment is very much out of the bottle and spreading fast, is far from clear. But then, so much about Spain\u2019s relationship with its north-eastern province is far from clear these days. The overriding hope in Madrid (and many other parts of Spain) is that the people of Catalonia will rediscover their senses in time for December\u2019s literally make-or-break elections, and vote into power a coalition of unionist parties. But with the government offering so little in return for such a giant step, while threatening to maintain direct rule of the region should a majority of people once again vote for pro-independence forces, the chances are that the current mood of uncertainty is here to stay.

Do we still do N-fold cross validation? I guess yes? Then do we compare loss at the two 'X' points where validation loss is minimized or do we compare loss at two 'O' points where training loss is minimized? From my view, I prefer the first scenario to compare the 2 crosses but I don't know what is actually implemented in scikit learn or other packages?

Most universities have yet to publish their annual financial statements that contain details of executive pay. \nNews of Professor Slade\u2019s pay-off \u2013 believed to be a record for a UK university \u2013 is likely to intensify calls for further scrutiny of university vice-chancellors\u2019 pay. An independent inquiry into \u201cexcessive vice-chancellor pay\u201d should be set up and report back to the Prime Minister by the end of January, said the Labour peer Lord Adonis in a tweet on 5 December. \nLast week it emerged that Sir Christopher Snowden, vice-chancellor of the University of Southampton , became one of the UK\u2019s most highly paid higher education leaders in 2016-17, on a remuneration package totalling \u00a3433,000 . This is in comparison with the \u00a3352,000 that he was paid the previous year for the 10 months that he was employed, and comes after the institution announced plans to axe 75 academic jobs . \nA Bath Spa spokeswoman said that Professor Slade, a professor of media theory, had \u201cstood down\u201d as vice-chancellor last summer after \u201cmore than five years of distinguished service\u201d and, after taking legal advice, the university paid her \u201ca sum which reflected her contractual and statutory entitlements and was considered to represent value for money\u201d. \nThe university, which had 7,300 students in 2016-17, added that \u201crelevant Higher Education Funding Council for England guidance was taken into account and legal advice, based on this guidance, obtained\u201d before the sum was paid. In June, Hefce warned that enhanced severance packages \u201cshould not as a rule be provided out of public funds\u201d and must not reward poor performance. \nThe Bath Spa spokeswoman added that its remuneration committee, which does not include the vice-chancellor, was \u201cmindful of the need to respond to concerns about excessive salaries\u201d. \nHowever, the committee also took into account the \u201cperformance of the university in meeting key performance indicators, the individual contribution of senior staff to achieving the university\u2019s strategic objectives, the need for the university to be competitive in the higher education market, affordability and reputation\u201d. \nThe university also stressed that, under Professor Slade\u2019s five-year tenure, it had \u201cbecome one of the UK\u2019s leading creative universities\". \nHowever, the university\u2019s latest financial statements record a number of \u201cchallenges\u201d, despite its \u201cstrong financial performance\u201d and \u201crecord intake\u201d of 2,300 UK and other European Union students in 2016-17. In September 2017, its international student numbers dropped by 30 per cent and overall domestic and EU intake dipped to 2,100, while two subsidiary companies \u2013 Bath Spa U and Bath Spa Global \u2013 racked up significant losses, the accounts note. \nFigures available on Companies House show that Bath Spa Global \u2013 an international pathway college venture set up in 2014 in partnership with US firm Shorelight Education \u2013 has lost about \u00a31.4 million in the three years to July 2016, while its parent company Bath Spa U has lost about \u00a3736,000 over the same period. Professor Slade was a director of Bath Spa U until August 2017. The university\u2019s chief operating officer, Neil Latham, a former British Navy rear admiral, is also listed as a director of Bath Spa U, whose losses caused the university to write off \u00a3450,000 last year, the accounts show. \nSally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union, said: \u201cWe are seeing what happens when decisions are taken in secret without proper checks and balances. \n\u201cThis cannot be allowed to continue; we need an urgent overhaul of how senior pay and perks are determined, and how our universities are governed. \n\u201cHefce has already been asked to investigate the golden goodbye on offer down the road at the University of Bath and I presume they will look at this one as well. We need students and staff to have a role on the committees taking these decisions and we need to see the full minutes so we can be clear about how pay awards are decided.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christina sl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dame glynis breakwell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sally hunt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christina slade", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil latham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher snowden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben langdon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adonis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "slade", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hefce", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bath spa university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bath spa u", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university and college union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of bath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shorelight education", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bath spa global", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "companies house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bath spa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of southampton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "british navy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bath spa u and bath spa global", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:19.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ae8eb44bba9ab1368cdb4a3c04159b2ef5b11a77", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyivMP67ZVsvwflxSLqkb32BTEfxCxGvHmcYj9L0TrjZOwzr5RFGOlQJngioZXE6P2MAnMhb71PgjUvVQF3akAvl2TDNgrLIo3F7W_W3prImQ--", "site_full": "foodiehunger.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://foodiehunger.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Foodie", "title": "How to Make Crispy French Fries Recipe | Homemade Perfect French Fries Recipe", "title_full": "How to Make Crispy French Fries Recipe | Homemade Perfect French Fries Recipe", "published": "2017-12-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ae8eb44bba9ab1368cdb4a3c04159b2ef5b11a77", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyivMP67ZVsvwflxSLqkb32BTEfxCxGvHmcYj9L0TrjZOwzr5RFGOlQJngioZXE6P2MAnMhb71PgjUvVQF3akAvl2TDNgrLIo3F7W_W3prImQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tushar Kapoor (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "How to Make Crispy French Fries Recipe | Homemade Perfect French Fries Recipe", "text": "\n\n\nIngredients:- 3 large potatoes Oil for frying 1 tbsp corn flour 1 tbsp Salt  1 tsp Chilly powder 1 tsp corriander powder 1 tsp chaat masala 1 tsp pepper powder Parsley Black Pepper Method:- Peel the potatoes properly and cut into french fries shape.

They should pay heed to what Dr Kia has just said, about what the Bank Negara's lost RM30.5 Billion (not mere millions) could have done for Malaysia. \n\nMost certainly that dough can buy tons and tons of kembong and kerang (all GST-free), especially for one makcik suffering from so-called anaemia. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "suar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suaram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kit siang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sebastian loh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lim kit siang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahathir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kua kia soong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anwar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bnm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank negara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank negara malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal commission of inquiry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rci", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "rakyat malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:20.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "13dcbecdf576fe949402fe700c4139a4562600c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgw1Q9nTC8ngqB_gkevUFWeodF2SOFadAWnYzq_kMp2RDcxSmLO5DWMDTYsxIYboI7CliJYD46PlkarUF.z0g2HJS_bvCk5QyoiQXfHo_v2K5jGLvORVJWjokXLMGzmmwc0-", "site_full": "forums.jokersupdates.com", "site": "jokersupdates.com", "site_section": "http://forums.jokersupdates.com/ubbthreads/postlist.php?Cat=&Board=games", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "JokersUpdates.com: Games :Viewing forum: (Not logged in)", "title": "Name Ten -

President Donald Trump speaks in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, in Washington. Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital despite intense Arab, Muslim and European opposition to a m... \nBy CATHERINE LUCEYAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump's move to recognize the divided city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital may have triggered a worldwide chorus of critics but the president had his ears closely tuned to his supporters at home. \nFor Trump, the proclamation was an important way to make good on a pledge to his political base, which includes evangelical Christians and pro-Israel Republicans eager for such a move. \n\"While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver,\" the president declared Wednesday in announcing his decision. \"Today, I am delivering.\" \nThose were words to savor for a president who's been frustrated to see a number of key campaign pledges stalled or slowed - sometimes by a bitterly divided Congress, some by larger national or international concerns. \nRepealing the Obama era health care law is a promise unfulfilled, much to Trump's frustration. Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box - although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action. \n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" \nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. \nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" \nTrump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \n\"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\"  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment":

Hours later, another woman said Franken inappropriately squeezed \"a handful of flesh\" on her waist while posing for a photo with her in 2009. That brought the number of women alleging misconduct by Franken to at least eight. \nFranken, the former comedian who made his name on \"Saturday Night Live,\" faces a chorus of calls to step aside, and Democratic senators said they expected their liberal colleague to resign. \n\"Enough is enough,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. \"We need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is OK, none of it is acceptable, and we, as elected leaders, should absolutely be held to a higher standard.\" \nGillibrand was the first to call for Franken's resignation on Wednesday, but a torrent of Democrats quickly followed. \n\"I'm shocked and appalled by Sen. Franken's behavior,\" said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state. \"It's clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time. It's time for him to step aside.\" \nThough the writing appeared to be on the wall, Franken's departure was not certain. A tweet posted Wednesday evening on Franken's Twitter account said: \"Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate.\" \nLate in the day, Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York added his voice. \n\"I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately,\" Schumer said. \nThe resignation demands came in rapid succession even though Franken on Wednesday vehemently denied the new accusation that came from a former Democratic congressional aide, who said he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006. \nThe woman, who was not identified, told Politico that Franken pursued her after her boss had left and she was collecting her belongings. She said that she ducked to avoid his lips and that Franken told her: \"It's my right as an entertainer.\" \nFranken, in a statement, said the idea he would claim such conduct as a right was \"preposterous.\" \nBut it was soon clear that his position had become untenable. \nFellow Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who spoke to Franken, wrote on Twitter, \"I am confident he will make the right decision.\" \nThe pressure only mounted Tuesday, when Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., resigned after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. Rep Ruben Kihuen, D-Nev., faces pressure to resign as well over allegations reported by Buzzfeed that he repeatedly propositioned a former campaign worker. \nWhile Franken apparently is departing, Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore could be arriving, if he prevails in a Dec. 12 special election. Multiple women have accused the 70-year-old Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were teens and he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s. If Moore is elected, it could create a political nightmare for Republicans, who have promised an ethics probe. \nA national conversation about sexual harassment has intensified this fall after the heavily publicized case of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of many acts of sexual misconduct, including rape, by actresses and other women. Just on Wednesday, Time magazine named as its person of the year the \"silence breakers\" - women who have come forward on sexual harassment. \nPunishment has been swift for leaders in entertainment, media and sports while members of Congress have tried to survive the onslaught of allegations. \nFranken already faced a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into previous claims by several other women that he groped them or sought to forcibly kiss them. \nThe allegations began in mid-November when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan. \nOther allegations followed, including a woman who says Franken put his hand on her buttocks as they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Two women told the Huffington Post that Franken squeezed their buttocks at political events during his first campaign for the Senate in 2008. A fourth woman, an Army veteran, alleged Franken cupped her breast during a photo on a USO tour in 2003. \nFranken has apologized for his behavior but has also disputed some of the allegations. \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Juliet Linderman in Washington and Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Alabama, contributed to this report.

There\u2019s so much more to the story than anyone realizes. I must face Stony, my ex, and confess everything. I don\u2019t want to. I\u2019d rather have five teeth pulled. While I\u2019m awake. Without anesthesia. But this is something I have to do, something I need to do. Not just for Stony. I need to do it for me. Especially for me. I can\u2019t move forward with my life until I gain closure from the past. When I meet Grayson Elliott, I am easily pulled into his orbit and it\u2019s exactly where I\u2019d love to stay. He makes me laugh and not take life so seriously. He makes me want to live again. But I don\u2019t love me right now, and that healing needs to come first. I\u2019m not relationship-ready or marriage material. My mind is focused on redemption. I want it. I need it.

I\u2019m pretty sure the entire world is lying about love and the joke is on me. I know I want a man in my heart and in my life. Unfortunately, most men immediately push my OFF button and I lose interest quickly. Feeling pressure to prove I\u2019m trying to find my soulmate, I finally give in and agree to a date. Huge mistake.

Ugh. It\u2019s magical inside the fenced-in property, as if I just walked into a secret garden. Stony always said he was going to build himself an oasis in the middle of the prairie land, and he did it. I didn\u2019t expect it to be quite this beautiful. Green grass covers small rolling hills. Sidewalks meander the property. Flower beds bloom madly with all the colors of the rainbow. It\u2019s almost like being inside of a Thomas Kinkade painting. I want to run. I want to turn around and erase this serene picture from my mind. I\u2019m not sure I want to witness Stony\u2019s happily-ever-after. The consolation is that now I know I didn\u2019t ruin his life. I should feel grateful for that knowledge. I kind of do and I kind of don\u2019t. My emotions are a tangled mess when it comes to Stony. I\u2019ve had two years in jail and a little over a year in Galveston to think about this moment, to anticipate exactly what I want to say to him. Now that it\u2019s upon me, I can feel my mind going blank. But I\u2019m doing it anyway. I march forward with determination in every step and I push on the doorbell before I can change my mind. I hear a Windsor chime echo through the house in a majestic sort of way. A little more cringing goes on inside of me at the perfection of it all. The seconds before the door is answered seem interminable. I\u2019m a hot mess. Lock me in a tank with hungry\u2014no\u2014starving sharks. Put me in a lion\u2019s den and let them have me for dinner. Make me appear on that dumb TV show,  Naked and Afraid. Anything but this. I don\u2019t want to face Stony. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t. \nExcerpt #2:  THE  DOOR OPENS and there he is, looking just as handsome as I remembered. He\u2019s wearing shorts and I can see his prosthetic leg. He\u2019s wearing a short-sleeved shirt and I can see his mottled skin plain as day. I did that to him. And I hate myself for it. Hate. Hate. Hate. I ignore my negative thoughts and concentrate on Stony. He looks confident and fit. His hair is longer, combed back on his head in a stylish sort of way. He\u2019s sporting the unshaven look with a slight beard that only adds to his masculinity. His tanned skin proves he spends a lot of time outdoors. There\u2019s still a deep line between his eyebrows that speaks to the intensity of his personality. In spite of everything, he\u2019s the vision of health and vitality. I know how hard he\u2019s worked to achieve it and I\u2019m impressed with his tenacity. He\u2019s the poster child of someone who refuses to give up no matter how many times life knocks him down. I wish I had his strength. Standing this close, I want to fall into his arms and let him hold me. It seems the natural thing to do, but things have changed. Drastically. His eyebrows furrow even deeper\u2014and the action is not lost on me\u2014then he says, \u201cMia?\u201d I swallow. He doesn\u2019t seem happy to see me, but then the constant lack of a smile makes him hard to read. \u201cHi, Stony.\u201d I\u2019ve surprised him, that\u2019s obvious. And not in a good way. He doesn\u2019t say anything, he just stares at me. So I say, \u201cCan I talk to you?\u201d He hesitates and says, \u201cUh . . .\u201d I hate his hesitation, the way he looks so unsure. \u201cPlease,\u201d I say. I\u2019m not above begging. I need to do this. \u201cI\u2019m not here to cause problems for you, I swear. I know you\u2019re a married man now. I would never do anything to jeopardize your relationship. I\u2019m not trying to come between you and your wife.\u201d \u201cStop it, I know that,\u201d he says and he means it. At least he knows me well enough to know I would never do something like that. Now that he\u2019s married, Stony is off-limits to me. But we do have some unfinished business. He seems to think things over for a moment, then he comes to a decision. He nods and says, \u201cSure.

The 3 Series has often been a Motor Trend favorite, but considering how much more emphasis BMW has placed on luxury over sport for the midsize 5 Series, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic. Likely debuting as a 2019 model in sedan form with 4 Series variants to follow, keep reading for our best guesses on what to expect for the 2019 BMW 3 Series. \nPhotos of the outgoing 3 Series and camouflaged next-gen 3 Series are pictured below Lighter Weight \nThanks to a move to BMW\u2019s flexible KLAR architecture that also underpins the new X3 crossover, the 2019 3 Series could drop a few pounds compared to the current car. That\u2019s a change that should benefit drivers across the expansive 3 Series lineup, from the entry-level successor to the 320i all the way up to the next M3 and M4. More Power? \nAlong with a slight reduction in weight, the 2019 3 Series should also see a bump in power for the 340i model that might be renamed M340i. The current 340i makes 320 hp and 330 lb-ft of torque from a turbocharged inline six-cylinder engine, but we expect a 2019 M340i model to match the 2018 X3\u2019s 355 hp and 369 lb-ft. We\u2019ve tested a 2016 340i with a manual transmission accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in 5.1 seconds (BMW estimates 4.9 seconds for the manual and 4.8 seconds for the automatic) and expect the 340i\u2019s successor to dip closer to 4.5 seconds. \nA plug-in hybrid model will also return, though BMW will probably want to transition some of those customers to an upcoming four-door inspired by the fully electric i Vision Dynamics concept . Want a Manual? \nIf you\u2019re the type of driver who still wants a manual transmission, you\u2019re probably not buying a luxury sport sedan, but BMW will be happy to oblige if that\u2019s important to you. Although a six-speed manual is currently available on the 320i, 330i, 340i, and M3, BMW might restrict the do-it-yourself option on the 2019 3 Series to one or two variants so that Audi doesn\u2019t own those bragging rights alone among top-rated competitors\u2014the A4 2.0T with all-wheel drive is offered with a six-speed manual. As for the extremely entertaining Alfa Romeo Giulia, the automaker doesn\u2019t currently offer a manual transmission. At a launch event for the Giulia, in explaining why there was no option of a manual transmission in the U.S., Alfa Romeo cited extremely low take-rates for manuals as well as the expensive nature of getting the additional variant emissions-certified. \nMost 3 Series models will probably use different versions of an eight-speed automatic. In a review of the new 2018 X3 M40i, we said the eight-speed feels \u201c alert and responsive .\u201d And in that eight-car comparison that included a 330i, despite the issues we had with the BMW, we appreciated its \u201clinear acceleration, minimal turbo lag, and excellent transmission programming.\u201d An Interior More Befitting That Price Tag \nPart of what sank the 2017 BMW 330i in that eight-car Big Test comparison was an interior that hadn\u2019t aged well compared to some of the other competitors we tested at the same time and the average materials quality. We\u2019re hopeful here. We described the new 2018 X3\u2019s interior as \u201cplush and premium\u201d\u2014a noticeable step up from the cabin of the cheap-feeling outgoing car. BMW\u2019s 10.0-inch central screen will likely be an option on higher trims, and the car will also offer a digital instrument cluster display. As for the Gesture Control feature that has been spreading around BMW\u2019s lineup, just keep in mind the gimmick is actually useful when you want to skip ahead to the next track (but otherwise not worth paying extra for). Will It Get Bigger? \nWe hope not. In that eight-car comparison, the 3 Series was lauded for its interior comfort and decently sized rear seats. The new 2018 X3 is longer and a little wider than its predecessor, but we hope the 2019 3 Series won\u2019t get bloated. Instead, a lighter-weight and similarly sized car that handles better and is more connected to the road sounds like a better focus to us. Then again, a slightly larger 3 Series might make sense to BMW if, despite the SUV-crazed automotive market, product planners decide there\u2019s still enough of a gap at the bottom of its lineup for a 1 Series four-door or 2 Series Gran Coupe . Currently, the 320i base model and X1 crossover are the only four-door BMWs available for under $40,000. Will the Coupe and Wagon Return? \nBefore the 6 Series lineup added a Gran Turismo model, it discontinued the coupe model. We wonder what BMW will decide to do with its U.S. lineup for the 3 and 4 Series, specifically with the 4 Series coupe and 3 Series wagon. BMW\u2019s 3 Series wagon is refreshingly offered without a crossoverlike visual appearance package, but the automaker also has the 3 Series Gran Turismo for customers who want more cargo-carrying capability. Aside from the 3 Series sedan and the possibility of a 3 Series Gran Turismo and 4 Series coupe, the lineup will also likely include a 4 Series convertible and 4 Series Gran Coupe (a stylish four-door). Radical New Styling! \nJust kidding\u2014thanks to a handful of extremely well defined brand-design traits that we\u2019ve seen for decades across the lineup including the Hofmeister kink and dual-kidney grille, the new 3 Series will clearly resemble the 5 Series and 7 Series but with some important detail changes to give the car its own identity.
