Porto's Vincent Aboubakar led the way as they qualified for the last 16 Two first half goals from Cameroon star Vincent Aboubakar helped Porto grab a place in the last 16 of the European Champions League with victory over Monaco. \nTheir 5-2 win in the final group game, coupled with RB Leipzig's defeat by Besiktas, was enough to see them through. \nAboubakar's opener came in the 9th minute, he doubled the lead just after the half-hour mark and Algeria's Yacine Brahimi added a third before half time. \nBy that stage both teams had been reduced to 10 men, because Porto's Felipe and Monaco's Rachid Ghezzal were sent off after a clash between the two. \nMonaco looked like they might make a game of it when Kamil Glik scored a penalty on the hour, but the lead was back to three just minutes later, when Alex Telles scored a fine goal. \nA late strike from Radamel Falcao against his old club was not enough to get Monaco back into the game and Tiquinho Soares completed the rout with a couple of minutes to go. \nAboubakar has now scored 17 goals in all competitions this season, but he described the win as a \"great collective performance\" after the game.

Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box - although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action. \n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" \nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. \nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" \nTrump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \n\"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\"  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "catherine luceyassociated press  was", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron david miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilan goldenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill galston", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for a new american security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east security program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faith and freedom coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:04.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7a1a22a2f7b113df783b91f831d404c0b15993b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrersk20g92Ik50wchZ0ppzd2noApq11HTr93Ie3G5vVMAyUusyjeXo0kMPXAfV6xiCL18DCXhtYtwhxZYecr03", "site_full": "texashuntingforum.com", "site": "texashuntingforum.com", "site_section": "http://texashuntingforum.com/forum/ubbthreads.php/forums/47/1/", "site_categories": ["hunting_shooting", "sports"], "section_title": "Wild Hog &amp; Javelina Hunting | Texas Hunting Forum", "title": "New hog trap question", "title_full": "New hog trap question | Wild Hog & Javelina Hunting | Texas Hunting Forum", "published": "2017-12-05T18:13:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e4037346820ccbd134b917db147632386c1d7181", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrersk20g92Ik50wchZ0ppzd2noApq11HTr93Ie3G5vVMAyUusyjeXo0kMPXAfV6xiCL18DCXhtYlta9HtNkl8Lk0xWeUTMFpk-", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Kung Fu Widgeon", "published": "2017-12-06T08:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Wire the gates together, tie them to a root style trigger in the back on the trap, 2 handfuls of corn inside, 2 handfuls in a straight sparse line in front, set in piggy place and arm day one.

Free Commander\u2019s XP is collected once you get your 19-pt Captain, whenever you play ANY ship using that 19-pt Captain. The Free Commanders XP goes into a common pool that can be used to upgrade ANY captain you have, irrespective of national lines.\nMy personal opinion is that if you align your 19-pt Captains, you can \u201cfarm\u201d Free Commanders XP on many ships w/ relatively few 19 pt Captains.

Hours later, another woman said Franken inappropriately squeezed \"a handful of flesh\" on her waist while posing for a photo with her in 2009. That brought the number of women alleging misconduct by Franken to at least eight. \nFranken, the former comedian who made his name on \"Saturday Night Live,\" faces a chorus of calls to step aside, and Democratic senators said they expected their liberal colleague to resign. \n\"Enough is enough,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. \"We need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is OK, none of it is acceptable, and we, as elected leaders, should absolutely be held to a higher standard.\" \nGillibrand was the first to call for Franken's resignation on Wednesday, but a torrent of Democrats quickly followed. \n\"I'm shocked and appalled by Sen. Franken's behavior,\" said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state. \"It's clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time. It's time for him to step aside.\" \nThough the writing appeared to be on the wall, Franken's departure was not certain. A tweet posted Wednesday evening on Franken's Twitter account said: \"Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate.\" \nLate in the day, Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York added his voice. \n\"I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately,\" Schumer said. \nThe resignation demands came in rapid succession even though Franken on Wednesday vehemently denied the new accusation that came from a former Democratic congressional aide, who said he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006. \nThe woman, who was not identified, told Politico that Franken pursued her after her boss had left and she was collecting her belongings. She said that she ducked to avoid his lips and that Franken told her: \"It's my right as an entertainer.\" \nFranken, in a statement, said the idea he would claim such conduct as a right was \"preposterous.\" \nBut it was soon clear that his position had become untenable. \nFellow Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who spoke to Franken, wrote on Twitter, \"I am confident he will make the right decision.\" \nThe pressure only mounted Tuesday, when Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., resigned after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. Rep Ruben Kihuen, D-Nev., faces pressure to resign as well over allegations reported by Buzzfeed that he repeatedly propositioned a former campaign worker. \nWhile Franken apparently is departing, Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore could be arriving, if he prevails in a Dec. 12 special election. Multiple women have accused the 70-year-old Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were teens and he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s. If Moore is elected, it could create a political nightmare for Republicans, who have promised an ethics probe. \nA national conversation about sexual harassment has intensified this fall after the heavily publicized case of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of many acts of sexual misconduct, including rape, by actresses and other women. Just on Wednesday, Time magazine named as its person of the year the \"silence breakers\" - women who have come forward on sexual harassment. \nPunishment has been swift for leaders in entertainment, media and sports while members of Congress have tried to survive the onslaught of allegations. \nFranken already faced a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into previous claims by several other women that he groped them or sought to forcibly kiss them. \nThe allegations began in mid-November when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan. \nOther allegations followed, including a woman who says Franken put his hand on her buttocks as they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Two women told the Huffington Post that Franken squeezed their buttocks at political events during his first campaign for the Senate in 2008. A fourth woman, an Army veteran, alleged Franken cupped her breast during a photo on a USO tour in 2003. \nFranken has apologized for his behavior but has also disputed some of the allegations. \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Juliet Linderman in Washington and Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Alabama, contributed to this report.

Technology from the little-known Swedish company is built into 4 billion advanced flat-panel displays for smartphones, TVs and tablets every year, giving the company a 100 percent market share. \nWhile total market dominance might be the dream of many executives, for Olving it's a hurdle. \n\"If you have a 100 percent share, it's hard to grow faster than the market,\" said Olving, whose company's machines make the masterplates used to manufacture displays in a process not unlike the use of negatives in classic film photography. \nMachines like Mycronic's are used to write microscopic images on plates, which then act as templates for mass production of high-resolution displays and computer chips. The bigger the display or TV screen being produced, the more accurate the template has to be and Mycronic's systems can cost $40 million each. Since the advent of the smartphone a decade ago, every advanced-display manufacturer in the world uses Mycronic's products. \nSince Olving took over as CEO in mid-2013, Mycronic has strengthened its grip over its main market and the stock has advanced some 600 percent. Her challenge is to broaden Mycronic's offering and reduce the company's reliance on so-called pattern generators, which is an intermittent business in terms of orders that stood for more than 60 percent of sales last year. \nOlving's response has been to buy fast-growing companies in related fields, such as electronics assembly and dispensing equipment. Mycronic has sealed five deals in the past two years and is poised to keep buying, Olving said. Her goal is to more than double sales by 2023, to 5 billion kronor ($600 million), mainly based off growth in Mycronic's Assembly Solutions unit. \nOlving was one of Automotive News Europe's 25 Leading Women in the European Automotive Industry in 2008 during her time at Volvo. \nMycronic, founded in the early 1980s with technology developed at Stockholm's Royal Institute of Technology, predicts growth in the push for autonomous driving and advanced safety features in cars, a business it accessed through last year's $35 million purchase of Automation Engineering in the U.S. The unit sells solutions for assembly of precision camera modules. \nMany vehicles today don't have a camera, but more new cars increasingly come equipped with sensor or camera-based cruise control and collision warning systems. In the future, standard cars will have six to eight cameras and premium vehicles will have more, Olving said, quoting external sources. \nWith some 93 million light vehicles sold globally last year, according to LMC Automotive, that's a lot of cameras. Such equipment might also be added to city infrastructure to monitor self-driving traffic, she said. While AEI already holds about half of the global market in its segment, that can grow, she said. \n\"It's not unthinkable that in-house manufacturers of the camera equipment may leave the business as it's not seen as core, similar to previous developments within the auto industry,\" Olving said. \nMore needed \nWhile Olving expects \"fairly large organic growth\" for the company, she needs more acquisitions to reach her sales target in four to seven years from 2016, when revenue was 2.32 billion kronor. For 2017, the company forecasts 2.80 billion kronor in sales and Olving wants to reach her 5 billion-krona target \"as quickly as possible.\" \n\"We systematically look for electronic equipment companies with high growth,\" Olving said. \"We have a gross list with interesting candidates\" and \"there are a lot of interesting objects in Asia but also in Europe and in the U.S.,\" she said. \nMycronic takes a cautious approach when it comes to acquisitions given its small size, which means the company can't afford to fail with M&A, Olving said. The Swedish company needs to \"do its homework,\" she said. \nAssembly Solutions is becoming an increasingly important leg at a time when focus in the pattern writer market shifts to capabilities --ever-improving resolution, bigger-sized screens and new applications -- rather than on adding capacity. \n\"The part of Mycronic that will have the highest growth going forward is assembly solutions and it's also within that area that we will focus our acquisitions,\" Olving said. \nAutomotive News Europe contributed to this report", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lena olving", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mycronic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanna hoikkala bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olving", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "volvo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mycronic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lmc automotive", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stockholm's royal institute of technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "assembly solutions", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mycronic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stockholm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:05.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "19e0e742c83618ff211d1b25cd991fe3a6d18a8d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvC0GHFYuIov.NR83bpcM5h0I4S_GLErv1U6mNOvu9xtMr.wrHs_Abn7EgZCd8gBA92hXzs4SYGrHXbKkICnyuTma5l8AI_IVEQWrbcByjDpQ8s2U6L7K8lWiFpV82PzK_3Y0ve9bpnJo-", "site_full": "www.4-traders.com", "site": "4-traders.com", "site_section": "http://www.4-traders.com/rss/FeedNews.php", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Stock market news - Company News  - 4-Traders.com", "title": "Mediatek : Monthly Sales Revenue November 2017", "title_full": "Mediatek : Monthly Sales Revenue November 2017", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27554, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aeed6633645197a16fa1f36ee4ad0b10dd43ca01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvC0GHFYuIov.NR83bpcM5h0I4S_GLErv1U6mNOvu9xtMr.wrHs_Abn7EgZCd8gBA92hXzs4SYGrF35bt3qzgvqQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "www.4-traders.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Mediatek : Monthly Sales Revenue November 2017", "text": "MediaTek Inc.

Thank you for your patience in this regard. \u2013 David McKay (editor) & team Steinhoff sheds more blood as analysts warn of further fallout Dec 07 2017 10:58 Christo Wiese jumps in as Steinhoff CEO quits over accounting failures \nCape Town - Investors continued their relentless beating of Steinhoff International, sending the share price down another almost 40% to an intra-day low of R11.00 following the resignation late on Tuesday night of CEO Markus Jooste with immediate effect amid an accounting scandal. \nThis share price drop is in addition to the more than 65% dive over the previous three sessions, taking the loss in market value to over R130bn. \nBy 10:27 on the JSE the shares were changing hands down 26.52% at R12.94, bring the market capitalisation to just under R56bn. READ: Steinhoff share-price collapse blindsides optimistic analysts \nThe fallout follows a dramatic increase in uncertainty around the group, the integrity of management and what the truestate of the business is. \"The only trustworthy information is that the CEO has resigned and that an investigation into accounting irregularities has been launched,\" said Alwyn Van Der Merwe, Director of Investments at Sanlam Private Wealth. \nIn an investor note he said their analysis suggests that the worst-case scenario for Steinhoff relating to the German and Dutch court cases against the firm by its former JV partner is a decline in value of \u20ac1.9bn, or R6.34 a piece. \n\"We then assume a worst-case scenario where fines and/or accounting irregularities come to a further \u20ac2.0bn or R6.67/share.\" \nHe warned that the drop in Steinhoff\u2019s share price will have a detrimental effect on Sanlam Private Wealth's performance for this month and for 2017 as a whole.The SIM Value Fund has a 4.94% shareholding in Steinhoff International. \nJames Paynter, founder & financial market analyst at Dynamic Outcomes, said in an emailed response to Fin24 it seems long term sentiment for Steinhoff already peaked in April last year, and since then sentiment has progressively started turning negative. \"The market was primed for a major sell-off, and this event was just the kind of trigger the market needed,\" he said. \nAbdul Azeez Davids, Head of research at Kagiso Asset Management said the fallout at Steinhoff comes as no surprise. \"For years investors have questioned the very low tax rate that Steinhoff was paying.\" \nHe said resignation by CEO, Markus Jooste, \"who besides being a central figure, was also primarily responsible for Steinhoff\u2019s international expansion\", brings into question not only current, but also past results. READ: Steinhoff rocked as accounting probe claims CEO \n\"Credibility of the AFS is instantly being doubted - and it is now difficult to determine the true value of the company. We do not know what the ongoing and even new investigations might yield, but in light of the current revelations, there is the distinct possibility of regulatory fines, criminal and civil suits.\u201d \nThe public prosecutor's office of Oldenburg in Germany confirmed to Fin24 on Wednesday that it was still investigating possible accounting irregularities and fraud at Steinhoff. \nGerman prosecutors said in an emailed statement that, as previously reported, they were still investigating \u201cfour current and former managers of a group\u201d for accounting fraud. READ: German prosecutors still probing Steinhoff for possible accounts fraud \nThe statement said the balance sheet of the company may have been inflated. German authorities, meanwhile, are still scrutinising and evaluating the \u201cextensive documents and data\u201d obtained during searches. It did not say when these searches took place. \nHowever, in November 2015, ahead of its listing of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on 7 December, Steinhoff said in a media announcement that German authorities had searched its offices in Westerstede, where Steinhoff has its European headquarters. \nSteinhoff announced in its own statement late on Tuesday that it had approached PwC to launch an independent investigation into accounting irregularities, and that CEO Markus Jooste had resigned with immediate effect. READ: Steinhoff's Markus Jooste admits he made 'some big mistakes' \nMeanwhile Sean Ashton, Chief Investment Officer of Anchor Capital said the asset manager has taken an in-principle decision to exit its holdings, \"but given the share price response we will do this in a manner that maximises value for our clients\". \nHe said it is likely that fundamental value is above current levels \u2013 even in a break-up of the business scenario \u2013 but the company has clearly lost the trust of institutional investors, including Anchor Capitol. \"This could weigh on listed values for some time.\" \nAnchor Capitol had a 5.3% holding in Steinhoff. * SUBSCRIBE FOR FREE UPDATE : Get Fin24's top morning business news and opinions in your inbox.

You had the affair, not him. Whether there were problems in the relationship or not is not the point. The affair was your choice, your mistake, your fault. Grow up and own it. No amount of telling us how inadequate he made you feel by being so dynamic himself is going to make it not your fault.\nFeeling sorry for yourself is not justification for an affair. It might be a big part of the reason you indulged yourself but it in no way justifies it. You seem very keen to make yourself the victim here.\nYou only told him about the affair a month ago and you expect way too much of him already if you think he will be angry and upset for a week or two at most then go straight back to the way things were before. It doesn't work like that.\nDo you think that now he knows, he should be just grateful and relieved you chose to stay with him, instead of angry and confused that you strayed in the first place? That's an incredibly narcissistic way of thinking.\nI agree that at some point the injured party needs to stop with the anger, the endless questions and the endless handwringing and move to a state of acceptance, if not forgiveness exactly.

Mr Sanalla also thanked the communities across the southern region for their ongoing patriotic efforts and insistence on putting the nation's interests on the top of all other priorities. \nHis Excellency the Minister then honoured Mr Sanalla by awarding him a Shield of Thanks and Appreciation for his recent award of Chief Executive Officer of the Year at the prominent Petroleum Economist magazine awards - recognising that Mr Sanalla insisted that this award was for all Libyan people and was richly deserved by all working in the country's oil sector. Mr Sanalla repeated his deep respect for the country's courageous employees, risking so much for the country's future. \nNOC - National Oil Corporation published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 09:06:03 UTC . \nOriginal document http://noc.ly/index.php/en/new-4/2977-minister-of-local-government-honours-noc-chairman \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/F17F51F89175AE61D699757F0C057F1D6AA3B299", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mustafa sanalla", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bedad gonso", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sanalla", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "noc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "petroleum economist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "government of national accord's ministry of local government", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noc - national oil corporation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "alaweina municipality", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "libya", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:07.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8c7fd54430ac352e77ae04ae184abcd3f046d7c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl9dBKdqTU2x44549924X4KJxJOG4VgLU50RrjIozHqrJ5wb7mqB9HUMw90U8MwBFNq9z4a6mE7eWrRTy2kowsTM-", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "[Path of Exile]War for the Atlas Expansion Dec 8 67", "title_full": "[Path of Exile]War for the Atlas Expansion Dec 8 - Page 67 \u2014 Penny Arcade", "published": "2017-12-06T10:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 39, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/8DDBNVR065TV.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8253, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cfbc04f31c91f8e1325a8d9228f9c473317bf311", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl9dBKdqTU2x44549924X4KJxJOG4VgLU50RrjIozHqrJ5wb7mqB9HUMw90U8MwBFNq9z4a6mE7eWfKu6NIWRMvyBB.nqy8vP0g--", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "Rius", "published": "2017-12-06T19:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "D3 moved towards a system where they did all their balancing with unique item set buffs (like +5000% damage to these abilities as a set bonus), and subsequently everyone using that ability had to wear the same gear as everyone else, de-emphasizing rares into oblivion.

Granted a jugg is stronger vs roombas and spikes but the slayer is no slouch at those as long as there was something to slay before entering the trap area.

In fact, dividend growth is more important to long-term returns than dividend yield and P/E expansions. According to an post by Matthew A. Young at Young Investments, dividend growth accounts for a large portion of returns. From the article : \nDividend Growth is Key \nMSCI published a report last year highlighting the importance of dividend growth to the return of global equity benchmarks. The chart below, taken from the report, shows that the longer the time horizon, the more important dividend growth becomes to overall return.
