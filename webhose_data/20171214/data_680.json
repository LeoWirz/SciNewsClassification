Funds are often distributed by intermediary agencies in the UK, making comprehensive data difficult to analyse, but even this baseline number would equate to the loss of about 10% of all annual foundation grants, or half of what the Big Lottery Fund distributes each year. \nPiper, tune etc. \nThis is all rather out of the totalitarian handbook. A very lite version of course but still. One of Anne Applebaum\u2019s recent books runs through how the socialists (ie, Soviets) took over Eastern Europe. The entirety of civil society was absorbed into the Borg. Everything must be, and was, state directed. The Scouts, chess clubs, women\u2019s charity organisations, all became state directed, state run. Those who tried to maintain independence from said state structures were persecuted. \nSure, the EU\u2019s been doing it by doling out the cash but it\u2019s the same basic idea. If all the bits and pieces of civil society are assimilated into the Borg then there\u2019s no independent civil society any more, is there? Job done. 37 comments on \u201c So, now we know why the third sector is so Remoaner then \u201d bloke in spain \n\u201cFunds are often distributed by intermediary agencies in the UK, making comprehensive data difficult to analyse\u201d \nI\u2019ll bet they are! Mr Ecks \nIts our fucking money anyway. \nAnd are these charities \u201cworried\u201d.? \nRemainiac scum on their Boards or whatever may see danger to the cash flow and a chance to suck EU dick in one sound bite perhaps. And the Project Fear media liars (Uni-marxtrained TM) will peddle the crap but that doesn\u2019t mean that any of their posturing has anything to do with reality. Mr Yan \nWith a chunk of cash taken from each intermediately by the top \u2018management\u2019 to spunk on their friends in Islington. Little seen by the needy at the bottom. Another example of living of the state\u2019s tit. The Meissen Bison \nThis is excellent news. Charities that are strapped for cash for want of donors should put up the shutters. Martin December 7, 2017 at 10:39 am \nMr Ecks, have you tried using English? You\u2019d put your point (whatever it is) across better. \n10% of all foundation grants? Now that would be surprising. I\u2019d have said closer to 1% but has been 4 years since I worked with those grants. Regional government grants now, those could include EU money but the bulk of EU funding was done through applying direct. UK government grants were bad enough to apply for and prove spending with, EU grants were tougher and a lot more (measured in inches) paperwork. Still, UK charities can always apply to the leave campaign who promised so much\u2026.. Rob \nEven without the cash the side they choose would be obvious, simply from ideology and class. The money is a nice touch though, it taints them when they try and dress in the stolen robes of principle and ethics. Bernie G. December 7, 2017 at 10:57 am \nI guess the charities see the voting public\u2019s sympathies as right of centre rather then left. As a consequence they assume we have more of a reluctance to flash the cash than our social democratic cousins on the continent. It\u2019s our money after all, and we may choose to spend it another way. DBC Reed December 7, 2017 at 10:58 am \nShouldn\u2019t be any need for charities in the Thatcherite Utopia.Destroying the old demand management economy where people\u2019s incomes were kept in line with price levels has freed everybody to enjoy the unalloyed bliss of free markets.You\u2019re stuck in Middlesborough and cant afford to move where there\u2019s work in Cambridge? Fuck off Commie! (Just because we admit that the housing market\u2019s broken doesn\u2019t mean to say that other markets don\u2019t work!) Mr Ecks December 7, 2017 at 11:01 am \nAnyone the Leave campaign had to make \u201cpromises\u201d to in order to get support for the country AND the cause of freedom is an arsehole. \nIs that you Martin? Were you looking for the biggest promises to fill your pocket with stolen goodies before you decided between freedom and tyranny? \nI\u2019ll try \u201cEnglish\u201d when you stop being for sale. Hallowed Be December 7, 2017 at 11:05 am \nTo summarise the article/situation. Currently \u00a3258m flows from UK taxpayers to EU. Then EU institutions distribute to UK charities. Naturally the allocation decisions reflect EU goals and ambitions. Post Brexit the Government will now have the option of leaving \u00a3258m in the taxpayers pocket or redistribute it to the public sector to reflect British goals and ambitions. Consequently UK charities currently receiving EU funding are gearing up their UK media and lobbying operations to put the squeeze on a weakish Theresa May to ensure that doesn\u2019t happen. Mr Ecks December 7, 2017 at 11:14 am \nAnd is this the Thatcherite Utopia Reedy? \nThe shithole we find ourselves in is run by INGSOC\u2013be it ZaNu or BluLab. Free markets have little to do with most of the shit that goes on. Mainly because its hard to find a market that your fucking govt pals aren\u2019t meddling in if not outright controlling. \nFatch talked up free markets and did a very little in that direction . But your state buddies have horned in everywhere even since your precious 1950s . Indeed we still ARE living in your shitty mixed economy and the mess we see is the result. \nAnd the 10 millionth fucking time the housing market is being fucked by socialism and your dear friends the state. That is what your \u201cbroken\u201d phrase actually means. \nYou do have three words of shining sanity in your liquid-laugh style comment. \nFuck Off Commie. \nA rare moment of lucidity for you.

All of my pillows are down filled, and I am always switching them up with covers from H&M . Pillow covers are so much more affordable and take up less storage space! \n\n\nIn the bedroom, it is still white and bright just how I like it. We also usually have a small tree in here too, but this year none of my trees worked when I pulled them out of storage. Wamp, wamp. I was disappointed, but used garland instead to bring out the festive touches. \n\n\n\nIf you follow along on Instagram , I shared I was looking for faux garland that looked very real. I remembered I had some I had bought last year from Grandin Road that I loved. So, I purchased more this year and love that it comes pre-lit and is battery operated. The perfect combo! \n\n\n\nThis sign from Down Grace Lane is one of my favorites and I have had it for years. It seemed like the perfect fit above our headboard. Our white linen duvet is still one of my favorites and I embrace all the wrinkles. Plus its just so comfy! A simple pillow from Danielle Oakey Shop was all I needed to complete the look. \n\n\n\nOn the night stands, I kept it simple again with some vases and faux greenery. Both were from Target\u2019s Dollar Spot a few years ago. On one side, I added these miniature stockings that I\u2019ve had for years for another festive touch. Hopefully, Santa brings me a present Christmas morning. \ud83d\ude42 \n\nThis year I have been taking it slow and enjoying the season. Watching movies, baking cookies, and sipping hot cocoa. Usually this time of year, I am so stressed I can\u2019t even think straight and I vowed not to do that this year. A very simple Christmas is totally worth it. \nWhat do you think? Share with me!

The composites were used for the adsorption of methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) in aqueous solution. The results indicated that MIL-100(Fe) and GO formed a sandwich-like structure, and the crystal structure of MIL-100(Fe) was reserved in the composites. The attachment of GO layers to the MIL-100(Fe) decreased the surface area from 1690 to 1602 m 2 /g, and pore volume from 0.996 to 0.770 cm 3 /g when 5% ( w / w ) GO was added, due to the coating of MIL-100(Fe) by GO sheets. The addition of 5% ( w / w ) GO increased the adsorption capacity for MB (from 1019 to 1231 mg/g) and MO (from 667 to 1189 mg/g). The composites showed a better thermal stability than MIL-100(Fe); the decomposition temperature increased from 280 to 350 \u00b0C. The addition of GO improved the properties of MIL-100(Fe) as an adsorbent for MO/MB from aqueous solution.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2jnNJpJ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:58.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ac61de1381e710799b51beb8c210f36ef35b00e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAptNzSKjTMEEy3Qgbs7L3OTwRHp1jVNV9nmAh69su1zzhDdAzbmQguv5WggT4MxiPOscvOAz0Z.ByqY0MMxBkwmgk0TCTtXvFVXhWsNvo3Ms7jolNOIuL71ewzWh_bJ3.0U-", "site_full": "mtwiki.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://mtwiki.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "MT Wiki: Upcoming Movie, Hindi TV Shows, Serials TRP, Bollywood Box Office", "title": "Ranveer Singh Upcoming Movies List 2017, 2018 Release Dates", "title_full": "Ranveer Singh Upcoming Movies List 2017, 2018 Release Dates", "published": "2017-12-07T12:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ac61de1381e710799b51beb8c210f36ef35b00e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAptNzSKjTMEEy3Qgbs7L3OTwRHp1jVNV9nmAh69su1zzhDdAzbmQguv5WggT4MxiPOscvOAz0Z.ByqY0MMxBkwmgk0TCTtXvFVXhWsNvo3Ms7jolNOIuL71ewzWh_bJ3.0U-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Hrithik Shah (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "Ranveer Singh Upcoming Movies List 2017, 2018 Release Dates", "text": "Ranveer Singh Upcoming Movies List 2017, 2018 Release Dates. \nLatest Update: Ranveer Singh Next Upcoming Movies List 2017 - 2018 New Release Dates.

U.S. health of... \nBy LAURAN NEERGAARDAP Medical Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens. \n___ \nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Almost 9 months later here I am, about 65 pounds lighter.\nI did no exercice at all until september (just CICO and log everything/kitchen scale)\nsepember/oct 2x training a week, 74 & 80mns workout alternating approx 55% cardio and 45% upper/lower muscle building (but no lifting though).\nSince november I now go 4-5/week of this regimen.\nUpped my cals from 1550 to 1650. Plan to keep same but add 200 daily cals of Whey once I hit 158/155 pounds.\nBought a body fat measuring scale in June ( I know they are not that reliable) and my bf from my first measurement on it when from 22.2% on 06/30/17 to this morning where it read 16.1%\nSo basically where do i go from there? I wanna max my gain but do things well and in order, methodically, as I did with the weight loss part.\nMy question is probably basic so will I be ok just reading the wiki?\nI basically want to start lifting asap and be able to do more pull-ups (can only do 5 so far t_t)\nHow should i go about things?\nShould i keep doing cardio?\nthks in advance\n\n\nSubmitted December 07, 2017 at 02:36AM by dolpiff\nvia reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/7i5baw/30m_sw226_cw161_end_of_my_weight_loss_journey_in/?utm_source=ifttt", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cico", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:59.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3c44f77202f3feb2c78b72ba4f7686939c391e24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8MhJEbIk6Hp4_GAaXVPzclrcy_I2jd5ygQjcvyBLEyL1B93BwOA.qqP8uTvxKGlZ4_c.8JxQIVs2CMX79741MuQ92QeEhI5ny9bUhli0fMrg_ui4pIb173OziwzzPn10LXKHTguOhRvg--", "site_full": "www.dnaindia.com", "site": "dnaindia.com", "site_section": "http://www.dnaindia.com/services/rss/news-latest.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Latest News", "title": "Australia celebrates 'day for love' as it allows same-sex marriage", "title_full": "Australia celebrates 'day for love' as it allows same-sex marriage", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://static.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/2017/12/07/631048-7afp-afpuy1nw.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1715, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 1, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3c44f77202f3feb2c78b72ba4f7686939c391e24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8MhJEbIk6Hp4_GAaXVPzclrcy_I2jd5ygQjcvyBLEyL1B93BwOA.qqP8uTvxKGlZ4_c.8JxQIVs2CMX79741MuQ92QeEhI5ny9bUhli0fMrg_ui4pIb173OziwzzPn10LXKHTguOhRvg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "Australia celebrates 'day for love' as it allows same-sex marriage", "text": "Australia became the 26th nation to legalise same-sex marriage on Thursday, prompting cheers and singing from a packed parliament public gallery in a country where some states ruled homosexual acts to be illegal until just 20 years ago.\nLawmakers, who had cast aside a conservative push to allow religious objectors to refuse service to same-sex couples, waved rainbow flags and embraced on the floor of the chamber, after the overwhelming vote in favour of the bill.\nFewer than five of 150 MPs voted against it.\nAlso read Australian lawmaker proposes to same-sex partner on floor of parliament \"What a day. What a day for love, for equality, for respect,\" said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. \"It is time for more marriages.\"\nThe law, which will also recognise same-sex marriages solemnised in foreign countries, takes effect from Saturday. Because a month's notice is required for the state to recognise a marriage, the first legal same-sex unions will be in January.\nFive-time Olympic gold-medal winner, the swimmer Ian Thorpe, who came out in 2014, said the law reflected contemporary Australia and would support people identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual queer or intersex (LGBTQI).\n\"It will give each of us the sense of what modern Australia is, and is, in fact, the way that most of us see this country as being, and will allow LGBTQI people in our nation to know that fairness is one of our values,\" he told reporters in Canberra.\nAustralians had overwhelmingly endorsed legalising same-sex marriage in a postal survey.\n\"What a moment for the country,\" said Christine Forster, a Sydney councillor and the sister of former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, standing among throngs of rainbow-clad campaigners for a \"Yes\" vote, outside parliament with her female partner.\nShe said she planned to go to her brother's house to celebrate.\nAbbott, who is still a member of parliament, was one of the most prominent \"no\" campaigners. He left the chamber before the vote.\nThe bill cleared the upper house last month.\nDuring the debate in the lower house on Monday, a politician proposed to his same-sex partner.\nBoth Turnbull's Liberal-National coalition government and the main opposition Labor Party had said they wanted to pass it by Dec. 7.\nBut despite the support of the main parties, religious organisations and conservative lawmakers had voiced strong opposition and proposed dozens of amendments.\nDuring the debate, they pressed for broad protections for religious objectors, among them florists and bankers, to refuse service to same-sex couples.\nBut their efforts were rejected.\n\"These amendments, rather, are a shield for people and organisations that hold to a traditional view of marriage. They are not a sword to be wielded in the service of bigotry,\" government MP Andrew Hastie said in parliament.\nAmendments to permit lay celebrants to decline to solemnise same-sex marriages and businesses opposed to the unions to refuse service at wedding receptions were all defeated, one after the other, during three days of debate.\n\"Love has won, and it's time to pop the bubbly,\" Greens MP and same-sex marriage supporter Adam Bandt said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine forster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew hastie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ian thorpe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prez donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam bandt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "labor party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal-national", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east  australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:59.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7dd2d0e28bc458f734f601804579146747c3bd92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRqpmWgFu_zjVSTJiPW7NCK1iY0zpf8tFTaWF.O7FlEUbNtXQBurnSpi7xwxGbXwFnGj3cDNXe4w7D.l1lfL9gem1kqEDVQAkbF43vmOvSB9iDKCyYrJx1lKlMH_PPOVlE-", "site_full": "www.datalounge.com", "site": "datalounge.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["entertainment", "non_standard_content", "celebrity_fan_gossip", "adult"], "section_title": "", "title": "Death rate quadruples amongst Deplorable opioid addicts", "title_full": "Death rate quadruples amongst Deplorable opioid addicts", "published": "2017-12-07T00:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.619, "main_image": "https://www.datalounge.com/images/dl-default-og.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31405, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7dd2d0e28bc458f734f601804579146747c3bd92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRqpmWgFu_zjVSTJiPW7NCK1iY0zpf8tFTaWF.O7FlEUbNtXQBurnSpi7xwxGbXwFnGj3cDNXe4w7D.l1lfL9gem1kqEDVQAkbF43vmOvSB9iDKCyYrJx1lKlMH_PPOVlE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T00:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "Death rate quadruples amongst Deplorable opioid addicts", "text": "Death rate quadruples amongst Deplorable opioid addicts \nWhite, low-income earners, and Medicare recipients were responsible for the biggest upticks in opioid-related poisonings. \nWhat will Trump do to keep his voters from killing themselves?

He often answers phone calls from those in crisis. And for 40 years, he has worked to understand why farmers take their lives at such alarming rates \u2013 currently, higher rates than any other occupation in the United States. \nThat industries decline in importance is simply a truth about our universe. As productivity rises we need fewer people to perform that task. Thus some of them must leave said production. We\u2019re simply not going to get the world getting richer without this happening. \nThis doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s easy of course. People tend not to change their lives until forced to do so. And that forcing will indeed often enough include a great deal of economic pain. \nThere is no specific solution to this. There\u2019s a general one, sure. The process of transition from one mode of life to another could be made easier. I\u2019ve a great affinity for the Danish view of these things. Good unemployment pay, good training opportunities. Losing a job really isn\u2019t all that much of a stress or a strain. Obviously, losing a business will still be stressful but it\u2019s still not an economic wipe out. \nThe other part of the system is that after some period of time (maybe 2 years for Denmark?) support ceases to near nothing. Labour is made liquid \u2013 not perhaps le mot juste as it\u2019s a bit close to Soylent \u2013 which is economically efficient. The Danish unions simply don\u2019t whine and strike and obstruct about job losses as a result. \nThere\u2019s thus a general solution available, a support net for those who must transition. But there isn\u2019t a specific one for farmers nor any other particular industry or line of work. Simply because we do want sectors where productivity is rising fast to have fewer people doing the stuff, assuming that there\u2019s a limit to the demand or the actual product itself. That\u2019s rather what economic advance is.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rosmann", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "iowa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denmark", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:59.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5abb6ca66f3f6470021886434ea5e64c80b2a416", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSyNlkItiSHsoRq7nHQfcRUFkZOtnkduFZBgSCCNBseHcH8ems5_MJAgkY_E5G9dRpRxLrKK.LzboU.Qtzw9wjjljmsXdSCbaY_PALBGLpeQA--", "site_full": "www.vakilno1.com", "site": "vakilno1.com", "site_section": "http://www.vakilno1.com/feed", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "legal_issues"], "section_title": "", "title": "SC: Judicially Separated Wife is also entitled for Maintenance", "title_full": "SC: Judicially Separated Wife is also entitled for Maintenance", "published": "2017-12-07T11:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.vakilno1.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bribe-150x150.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 73546, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5abb6ca66f3f6470021886434ea5e64c80b2a416", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSyNlkItiSHsoRq7nHQfcRUFkZOtnkduFZBgSCCNBseHcH8ems5_MJAgkY_E5G9dRpRxLrKK.LzboU.Qtzw9wjjljmsXdSCbaY_PALBGLpeQA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Shilpi Sharan", "published": "2017-12-07T11:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "SC: Judicially Separated Wife is also entitled for Maintenance", "text": "SC: Judicially Separated Wife is also entitled for Maintenance \nDecember 07, 2017 \nSanju Devi vs The State Of Bihar \nDate of Judgment: December 06, 2017 \nIn this recent case taken up by the Supreme Court yesterday the Court rejected High Court\u2019s order whereby the Petitioner was disentitled from maintenance under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 on the ground that the husband and wife had already judicially separated. \nBackground- In the case, the Petitioner had applied for maintenance under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 , wherein the Trial Court had awarded maintenance of Rs.4,000/- per month to the Petitioner. \nAggrieved by Trial Court\u2019s award of maintenance, the Petitioner\u2019s husband preferred revision petition in the High Court. By the impugned order the High Court observed that the Trial Court has not given the finding that the petitioner was unable to fend for herself, therefore, she was not entitled for maintenance. \nThe aggrieved Petitioner appealed in the Supreme Court. The Respondent in the case contended that there is already a decree of judicial separation and in view of Section 125(4) of the CrPC the petitioner was not entitled to any maintenance. \nBench\u2019s Observation \nThe Two-Judge Bench of Supreme Court in the case in view of the aforesaid contention categorically stated that the aforesaid view of the Respondent is rejected and opined that if a divorced wife is entitled for maintenance then there is no reason why a wife who is judicially separated is not entitled for maintenance. \nHere it will   Section 125(4) of the CrPC stated that no wife shall be entitled to receive an allowance from her husband under this section if she is living in adultery, or if, without any sufficient reason, if she refuses to live with her husband, or if they are living separately by mutual consent. \nThe Apex Court also stated that in the case the High Court should have enquired into the question whether the petitioner is entitled to maintenance or not and, if so, the quantum of maintenance and should have not rejected the Petitioner\u2019s appeal merely because the Trial Court had not given a finding that the petitioner was not able to look after herself, therefore, she was not entitled for maintenance. \nIn view of the aforesaid, the Supreme Court has set aside High Court\u2019s impugned order and has remanded the matter to the High Court for fresh consideration.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sanju devi", "sentiment": "negative"},

Except it\u2019s a little more complicated than that, in the sense that their list is voted for (i.e. no one person or team specifically decided to place Peaks at #2) and that voters were expressly told they could include TV series, or indeed any other form of visual art (although Peaks was the only non-film to make the top ten, Sight & Sound have since tweeted a list of music videos, computer games, and other such things, that also received votes). \nSome people seemed to find the very notion of counting Twin Peaks \u2019 third season as a film to be personally offensive. It must\u2019ve been like rubbing salt in the wound when respected French film magazine Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma went and ranked it 1st on their list . \nMany digital column inches have been spun out of this, naturally. Two of the more interesting / accurate ones I\u2019ve read are Matt Zoller Seitz\u2019s 25-tweet thread/rant and Vadim Rizov\u2019s kinda rebuttal at Filmmaker Magazine . For my part, it\u2019s nine years almost to the day (just one day short!) since I wrote this piece on the TV vs. film shebang, albeit from a slightly different tack (TV movies vs. \u2018real\u2019 movies). My main point was that it\u2019s a kinda arbitrary distinction nowadays. That\u2019s only become more the case in the almost-decade since. \nSimilarly, I think most of the handwringing over Peaks \u2019 inclusion in these lists has been stupid. As I said, Sight & Sound specifically okayed the inclusion of TV \u2014 The Return wasn\u2019t singled out as \u201cyeah, it\u2019s TV, but it\u2019s so good we\u2019ll count it as a film\u201d, a notion that\u2019s been projected on this news by some commentators (mainly TV critics) so they can then take great offence at it. But if Sight & Sound \u2019s voters had considered any other season of 2017 TV to be worthy of inclusion, it had just as much chance of making it in. I don\u2019t know what Cahiers \u2019 rules were, but I\u2019m going to assume they were similar \u2014 and they\u2019ve included TV before (of all things, the first season of 24 made their top ten back in 2002). \nPersonally, I\u2019m not really sure where I come down on the issue of Twin Peaks: The Return in particular. I mean, it\u2019s definitely a TV series, isn\u2019t it? But it\u2019s also virtually an 18-hour movie, isn\u2019t it? Can it be both? Why can\u2019t it be both? As I said, I kind of err towards the broad position of \u201cwhy differentiate?\u201d As someone put it in a comment I saw somewhere else, it\u2019s all linear non-interactive visual media. Still, I probably won\u2019t be including it in my own year-end best-of list, but is that because I don\u2019t think it should be on a movie best-of list or because I wasn\u2019t wholly convinced/entertained by it as a work? \nAnd if you were wondering what I did think of it in more detail, here are all the posts I reviewed it in while it was airing:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david lynch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt zoller seitz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vadim rizov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "filmmaker magazine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:00.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "16d36a153019ee7a7345b75a1727956be323516f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsKzDbKpciiQPRiYP8cncFCrXAp89JXc_hCSTyuFrZE5xyrsiWj72jjdSVA.I73qPboofV84uAF53cYbcJ3pivKP8ynnV88Hjj0AqHdCYhGdRQs_DNN7f1uPwtQuZWtUPI5c0Ao_ec00xi", "site_full": "community.ebay.com", "site": "ebay.com", "site_section": "https://community.ebay.com/t5/Shipping-Returns/bd-p/shipping-returns-db?q=_change_me_", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Shipping &amp; Returns - The eBay Community", "title": "Be ware of international returning, nobody you can...", "title_full": "Be ware of international returning, nobody you can... - The eBay Community", "published": "2017-12-07T00:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.217, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a40b99dd4d645557349404596d55fce062ed9371", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsKzDbKpciiQPRiYP8cncFCrXAp89JXc_hCSTyuFrZE5xyrsiWj72jjdSVA.I73qPboofV84uAF53cYbcJ3pivKP8ynnV88Hjj0AqHdCYhGdRQs_DNN7f1uPwtQuZWtUPI5Xyr6ynTTkoIs2OXRYyv1Ns-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "chicswatch", "published": "2017-12-07T03:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "For those who are still confused about why I get my full refund which should be proved delivery comfirmation first, but still lost the other 2 cases of returning shipping cost.

So, I didn\u2019t quite end on my terms. \n\u201cHowever, when you are a rugby player you feel like you are going to play forever. \n\u201cWhen you have done something you love since the age of seven it is going to be difficult to change \n\u201cI am a laid back guy and I can adjust and I will work just as hard in my new career paths.\u201d \nAnd Higham is optimistic he will be fit for a cameo performance against the Warriors in the New Year. \n\u201cI have trained nearly every day, either on my own or with a couple of the lads,\u201d he explained. \n\u201cI have also got the Tri Fitness gym at Leigh and I have been jumping in with with classes there. \n\u201cHopefully, I can get the ball in my hand and do some team training before and after Christmas. \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be going out there throwing too many wayward passes.\u201d \nLeigh Centurions owner Derek Beaumont said: \u201cI am looking forward to seeing Micky play his last game in a Leigh shirt. \n\u201cAnd having also played for Wigan it\u2019s perhaps a great setting for his finale. \n\u201cMicky has been a legend in the game and is a legend of a bloke and a great role model to his own children and those in the rugby community.

The patent, titled \u201cGraphene-based multi-modal sensor\u201d describes a one atom thick architecture and utilizes several of Grolltex\u2019 2D materials technologies to produce what the company internally calls \u2018The smallest, most sensitive sensor in the world\u2019. The company is working on initial applications for these sensors that are targeting the bio-sensing and defense fields as leading-edge users of this technology. \n\u201cOur single atom thick sensor design, in the strain sensor configuration, is so sensitive that it captures a robust and repeatable signal on the contractility strength of individual \u2018cardio myocytes\u2019 or heart cells as they beat\u201d, said Jeff Draa, company co-founder and CEO. \u201cThis can be a holy grail for fields such as cardiotoxicity testing as it has the capacity to be a significant time and money saver in the new drug testing and approval process\u201d. \nAdditionally, the single layer graphene sensor covered by this patent has a very high threshold for thermal coefficient of resistance, meaning it experiences little to no signal drift when exposed to extreme levels of heat. This makes it an ideal sensor for measuring micro strain in high speed aeronautical vehicles. These sensors are so small and thin, they can be layered into the skins of airplanes, helicopters or other high stress vehicles to real-time measure and detect micro stress at architectures and levels not currently possible with today\u2019s sensing technologies. These sensors could also be discreetly placed within critical structures such as bridges or buildings. \n\u201cWe have had strong interest in this sensor design from several large, multi-national corporations and we are currently evaluating the possibility of development agreements with potential partners in strategic areas\u201d said Draa. The company is currently producing samples of this sensor technology for selected strategic partners toward future collaboration. According to Draa, \u201cThe readings from our sensor are literally unbelievable, meaning that when we share our data with people in the sensing field, they don\u2019t believe it and we have to show them\u201d. \nGrolltex, short for \u2018graphene-rolling-technologies\u2019, uses patented research and technologies initially developed at the University of California, San Diego, to produce high quality, single layer graphene and other 2D materials and products in a sustainable and manufacturable way. \nAbout Grolltex: Grolltex, Inc., is a nanotechnology materials, products and equipment company focusing on the optimization and advancement of the key material \u2018graphene\u2019 and related 2D materials, including hBN or \u2018hexagonal boron nitride\u2019.

Dark craft with unrecognizable lights witnessed at a distance. dropped single bright white light that disappeared before impact with ground. \nI was driving home along the 210 freeway heading westbound, just before the 118. it was between 11:10 and 11:20pm there have been, and continue to be, large brush fires in the area, so stars weren't visible. yet there was still a small cluster of lights that didn't appear to be moving very quickly or behaving like helicopter lights that drew my eye. my initial reaction was that it was probably a plane or, more likely, a helicopter surveying the fire damage or perhaps performing some sort of fire rescue operation or something. i then noticed that the lights on the object were arranged across the entire body (as far as i could tell) of the craft. there seemed to be two central lights that maintained a white light while three other blue lights would turn on and off sequentially from right to left across the object. it's possible they wrapped all the way around the craft, but size and shape were impossible to tell at that distance and without any other illumination in the sky. there was also one consistent green light next to the two white lights. the light display seemed out of the ordinary for a helicopter as the only way for the blue lights to have been so spread out was if they were arranged from the head to the tail of quite a sizable helicopter. if this were the case, based on the direction the object was traveling, the lights must have been lighting up from tail to head. i've never seen such lights on a helicopter, but i'm no expert. upon first seeing the object it seemed to be moving slowly to the north. it paused briefly and then dropped a bright white light. the light appeared immediately below the other lights, traveled very quickly toward the ground and winked out about halfway between the object and the ground. the object then started floating slowly to the south. it should be noted that although it was first moving one way and then the other, the arrangement of lights did not appear to change. the blue lights continued from the right side of the craft to the left, and the other lights, although they winked off on occasion, did not reorient themselves as if they were facing a different direction. upon seeing the object i definitely did a double take, but i remained calm. i attempted to take a picture on my phone, but the sky was too dark and the object was too far away for it to register on the picture. it didn't help that i was driving a moving car, either. i kept my eyes on it as long as possible (without endangering myself or any other drivers) and tried to note the arrangement of lights. it wasn't until that \"flare\" dropped from the object that i was really surprised by what i was looking at. at that point i thought perhaps this wasn't jus an odd assortment of lights on a really big helicopter. i eventually passed under the craft and could no longer see it. \nLatest UFO Sighting \nCredit: MUFON \nAny duplication, in part or in whole, is forbidden without permission of copyright holder.

I am disabled & walk with a cane or sometimes a walker. On many occasions I have tried to safely enter the store but have encountered cars who insist on parking & blocking the entrance to the front door...even the handicap access has been blocked making it very dangerous for anyone with a walking disability to get into the store safely. I spoke with store mgr, David Jensen, about this situation & was totally shocked by his response. The Assistant Store Mgr was present along with several other customers who heard his response to me. He stated that it was not his responsibility to keep cars from parking in the fire lane directly in front of the store & that he had no responsibility for handicapped people trying to enter the Dollar Tree. I did inquire about his knowledge of the Americans With Disabilities Act which does offer protection those with disabilities & he said \"quite frankly, I do not care about people with disabilities trying to enter his store & quite frankly it was not his problem.\" Needless to say, it was impossible to try to discuss it further with him. I have had 30+ surgeries & have earned the right to handicap parking & access to any store by LAW. It would take very little effort on his part to make the store access safe for everyone...example: placing cones in the fire lane, placing no parking signs directly in front of the store to include the small area where the curb is flattened for wheelchair access. Call the police & have them let folks know they are breaking the law. Mr Jensen laughed at all my suggestions, turned his back on me, went into his office & slammed the door.\nThe store itself is filthy...floors probably not been mopped since the store opened. There are unopened boxes on every aisle. The Dollar Tree offers good products at good prices. With a Store Manager that actually cared about his store, it could be a GREAT place. Sadly, with the likes of this store Manager, it is not going to happen. I do not expect any action to be taken regarding my complaint. I do have protection under the Americans With Disabilities Act & will not hesitate to use them should I be hurt or injured while in or on your property. With the high level of traffic through that area, it is just a matter of time until someone is hurt. Your store manager has NO regard for people with disabilities. Due to his lack of knowledge of pertinent laws & his obvious lack of respect for individuals entering the store...he should be fired immediately as he is a BIG LIABILITY for the Dollar Tree.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:04.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4c2afb2a68f8d6dfbcc160d61bc4e9c29881e293", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8RjMYmHraOQLOqC8We0m5xbPDsE8Zjx6vJZ9m5Pn81VCGghVeRdRyiM152Nfc7XwKsjBsM2uAwldM_4K7IG5_r", "site_full": "www.acousticguitarforum.com", "site": "acousticguitarforum.com", "site_section": "http://www.acousticguitarforum.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=49", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Auctions and Deals - The Acoustic Guitar Forum", "title": "Martin HD-28VS (Used)", "title_full": "Martin HD-28VS Acoustic Guitar (Used) - The Acoustic Guitar Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T17:10:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.626, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45043, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4c2afb2a68f8d6dfbcc160d61bc4e9c29881e293", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8RjMYmHraOQLOqC8We0m5xbPDsE8Zjx6vJZ9m5Pn81VCGghVeRdRyiM152Nfc7XwKsjBsM2uAwldM_4K7IG5_r", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "AGFbot", "published": "2017-12-06T17:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "Martin HD-28VS (Used)", "text": "$4,898.37\nEnd Date: Jan-05 18:58\nBuy It Now for only: US $4,898.37\nBuy it ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/thumbs/images/g/LTUAAOSw1NFaKKvG/s-l225.jpg", "http://cgi1.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?MfcISAPICommand=MakeTrack&item=192389367730&ssPageName=RSS:B:SHOP:US:104", "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Martin-HD-28VS-Acoustic-Guitar-Used/192389367730?hash=item2ccb4cc7b2:g:LTUAAOSw1NFaKKvG"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:04.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a24ef30ce166ab427b30477e1aa2abc0f84f3a33", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWpNLvf7hUa0CRrgQ0S_qMRJnV0QCfMDppyXpc713tPkYisZhYyt.4en9TJik4qcRIQpo2vH_Tyg4ql2imGr_tAmIXPPXzIxuqpfrlhl1m.FQyVGC1LzOSD2nt0FMMBy7xVeoAIeLvLhg--", "site_full": "news.business-news-blog.eu", "site": "business-news-blog.eu", "site_section": "http://news.business-news-blog.eu/feed/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Business, finances, forex", "title": "Flu Epidemic in Bulgaria is Expected in late January and early February", "title_full": "Flu Epidemic in Bulgaria is Expected in late January and early February", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "BG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a24ef30ce166ab427b30477e1aa2abc0f84f3a33", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWpNLvf7hUa0CRrgQ0S_qMRJnV0QCfMDppyXpc713tPkYisZhYyt.4en9TJik4qcRIQpo2vH_Tyg4ql2imGr_tAmIXPPXzIxuqpfrlhl1m.FQyVGC1LzOSD2nt0FMMBy7xVeoAIeLvLhg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "Flu Epidemic in Bulgaria is Expected in late January and early February", "text": "December 7th, 2017 \nA flu epidemic is expected in late January or early February, reports mediapool. \nThere is already a first case of influenza in the country, announced the chief state health inspector Angel Kunchev in Rousse.
