He is set to travel to Israel and to the West Bank city of Bethlehem. It was not clear what Rajoub's remarks meant for the West Bank portion of Pence's trip. \nTrump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and to advance plans to move the U.S. Embassy to the contested city has sparked outrage across the region. \n___ \n9:30 p.m. \nThe Palestinians are asking the U.N. Security Council to take urgent action and demand that President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel be rescinded. \nPalestinian Charge d'Affaires Feda Abdelhady-Nasser said in a letter to the council president that Trump's declaration violates numerous council resolutions and could lead to \"a never-ending religious war.\" \nThe letter cites several council resolutions that prohibit changes to the status of Jerusalem. \nAbdelhady-Nasser urged the Security Council to send \"a clear message\" reaffirming relevant laws and resolutions and \"opposing this unilateral and provocative decision.\" \nShe warned that disregarding \"these fundamental legal, political and religious dimensions of the question of Jerusalem can only aggravate already heightened tensions.\" \nTrump's decision could lead to the \"exacerbation of religious sensitivities that risk transforming this solvable political-territorial conflict into a never-ending religious war, which will only be exploited by religious extremists, fueling radicalism and strife in the region and beyond,\" Abdelhady-Nasser warned. \nThe Security Council has scheduled an emergency meeting on Trump's announcement on Friday. \n___ \n9:15 p.m. \nThe Israeli military says it struck targets in the Gaza Strip in response to projectiles fired at Israel. \nThe military says that a projectile exploded Thursday in southern Israel, in addition to two earlier ones launched from Gaza which fell short and landed in the Palestinian territory. \nThe military says a tank and aircraft struck two military posts in Gaza. The military says it holds Hamas responsible for any fire emanating from the Gaza Strip. \nThe border violence comes a day after President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh called for Palestinians to launch a new uprising against Israel in the wake of Trump's declaration. \n___ \n8:45 p.m. \nJapan's U.N. ambassador says the U.N. Security Council will hold an emergency meeting Friday on President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nEight countries opposed to the U.S. move requested an emergency council meeting and Japan's Ambassador, Koro Bessho, told reporters Thursday that an open session would take place late Friday morning after previously scheduled briefings. \nThe eight council nations \u2014 Bolivia, Egypt, France, Italy, Senegal, Sweden, United Kingdom, and Uruguay \u2014 requested that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres brief the 15-member council. \nBut U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said Thursday that U.N. Mideast envoy, Nikolay Mladenov, will address Friday's meeting by videoconference because he is \"the lead expert on the ground.\" \nGuterres said after Trump's announcement Wednesday that the issue of Jerusalem must be resolved through direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. \nHaq said Thursday \"we've always been concerned about ensuring that the status quo in the city of Jerusalem is preserved and hope that all sides will exercise calm and restraint.\" \n___ \n7:30 p.m. \nThe leader of Hezbollah is calling for a sustained diplomatic campaign by Arab and Muslim nations to pressure the U.S. into reversing its decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nHassan Nasrallah said Thursday that all Mideast negotiations must be halted until President Donald Trump walks back his declaration, which the Hezbollah leader said was an \"undisguised American aggression\" against the Palestinian people. \nThe Lebanese militant group is one of the leading military threats to Israel. Hezbollah attacks forced Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon in 2000, and the group went to war with Israel again in 2006. Nasrallah, who spoke in a televised address, did not threaten military action over Jerusalem, but said he supports Palestinian calls for a new intifada, or uprising. \nHe said the U.S. administration is pragmatic and will respond to popular pressure. He called on people to take to the streets and flood social media with their protests, and on governments to register their protests with American ambassadors before expelling them. \n___ \n7 p.m. \nThe Israeli military says two rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip and fell short, landing in the Palestinian territory. \nThe military says sirens wailed Thursday in southern Israel but that the rockets didn't land in Israeli territory. \nThe rockets come a day after President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, sparking clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces in the West Bank. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the rockets. \nThe border between Israel and Gaza has been largely quiet since a 2014 war between Israel and Hamas. Violence has occasionally flared since then. \n___ \n6:30 p.m. \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel says the status of Jerusalem needs to be negotiated in the context of a two-state solution and is reiterating her opposition to U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize the city as Israel's capital. \nWhile stressing that the U.S. was an important part of the peace process, Merkel told reporters in Berlin on Thursday that Germany supports United Nations efforts for a two-state solution. \nShe says \"it is clear that in the framework of negotiating a two-state solution the status of Jerusalem also needs to be dealt with... and in that context we disagree with the decision yesterday.\" \n___ \n6:05 p.m. \nNobel laureate Desmond Tutu says \"God is weeping over President Donald Trump's inflammatory and discriminatory recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\" \nThe 86-year-old former archbishop, a veteran of the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa, rarely makes public statements because of health problems. \nHis new statement says that \"it is our responsibility to tell Mr. Trump that he is wrong.\" \nHe adds that \"God does not discriminate\" between people of various religions and that \"those who claim divine rights for themselves to physical property on earth are false prophets.\" \n___ \n6 p.m. \nA man holding a Palestinian flag smashed the windows of a kosher restaurant in Amsterdam before being detained by two police officers. \nThe vandalism Thursday came a day after U.S. President Donald Trump enraged the Arab and Muslim worlds by announcing he would recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nThe man is captured on video smashing the windows using a white implement before going into the restaurant and then coming out carrying the Palestinian flag and an Israeli flag. \nTwo police officers initially watch him without intervening before subduing him using pepper spray. One of them wrestled him to the ground. \nIn a video statement posted on Twitter, police spokesman Leo Dortland says the suspect was a 29-year-old Amsterdam resident with a temporary residency permit. Dortland did not give the suspect's nationality. \n___ \n5:15 p.m. \nThe Palestinian president says he is rallying international opposition to President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, which he called an \"unacceptable crime.\" \nAt a meeting with Jordan's king, President Mahmoud Abbas said Thursday that he rejects Trump's decision and believes America has hurt its credibility in the region. \nAbbas says the Palestinians have been rallying Arab support as they formulate a response. He says he has been communicating with other world leaders. \n\"Fortunately, there was a positive response from all the countries in the world, from Europe and from Africa and countries close to America that don't support the U.S.,\" he said. \"These all are messages to Trump that what he did is an unacceptable crime.\" \n___ \n4:40 p.m. \nPalestinian officials say dozens of protesters have been lightly wounded in a number of demonstrations in the West Bank. \nClashes broke out Thursday between Israeli forces and Palestinian protesters following U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nThe Palestinian Red Crescent says dozens of people have been wounded, mostly from tear gas inhalation. It says six people were wounded by rubber bullets and one person from live fire. The Israeli military denies that live fire was used. \nThe Palestinian Health Ministry says the injuries are all minor. \nTrump's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. The Palestinians seek east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. \n___ \n4:30 p.m. \nAn Israeli city plans to name a park after U.S. President Donald Trump in honor of his decision to declare Jerusalem the capital of Israel and move the embassy there. \nDavid Even Zur, the mayor of the northern Israeli city of Kiryat Yam, calls Trump's move \"historic.\" He says it was \"a brave, unprecedented step which none of his predecessors were prepared to do.\" \n\"Donald Trump proved to the entire world that Jerusalem is in his heart and we will prove to him in this way that he is in our hearts,\" Even Zur said in a statement Thursday. \nThe park, which will include a children's playground and will be located in the city center, is set to be inaugurated next year. \nThe move reflects the positive Israeli response to Trump's declaration, which was widely denounced by Arabs and Muslims. \n___ \n3:30 p.m. \nLebanon's Hezbollah says the U.S. declaration of divided Jerusalem as the capital of Israel has closed all paths to negotiations, calling it a \"treacherous and malicious aggression\" against the rights of Palestinians. \nHassan Fadlallah, the spokesman for the militant group's parliamentary bloc, said Thursday that the U.S. announcement reaffirms that the only way to restore rights is through armed \"resistance.\" \nLebanon is technically at war with Israel. Hezbollah attacks forced Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon in 2000, and the group went to war with Israel again in 2006. \nFadlallah said the decision is likely to have \"catastrophic repercussions\" on regional and international stability, urging Arabs and Muslims to move fast to respond. \nHe said President Donald Trump's decision \"intentionally\" bypassed the United Nations and international resolutions and was a \"rude belittling of the Arab and Muslim worlds' people and states.\" \n___ \n2:55 p.m. \nEU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini says U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is worrying and could send the region back to darker times. \nMogherini said on Thursday that Trump's Jerusalem announcement \"has a very worrying potential impact.\" \nShe says that \"the announcement has the potential to send us backwards to even darker times than the one we are already living in.\" \nMogherini called for calm and appealed for the \"the status quo of the holy places\" in Jerusalem to be preserved. \nShe also warned that Trump's \"move could diminish the potential role that the United States could play in the region and create more confusion around this.\" \n___ 2:50 p.m. \nThe Russian Foreign Ministry has expressed concern about the U.S. administration's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and warned that it could destabilize the region. \nThe ministry reaffirmed Moscow's view that the status of Jerusalem could only be settled through talks between the Palestinians and Israel in line with the United Nations resolutions. \nIn a statement released on Thursday, it said that the U.S. move has caused a \"serious concern\" in Moscow. \nIt said that \"a new U.S. position on Jerusalem risks exacerbating the situation in Palestinian-Israeli relations and in the region as a whole.\" The ministry called on all parties involved to \"show restraint and refrain from actions fraught with dangerous and uncontrollable consequences.\" \n___ \n2:40 p.m. \nHundreds of Islamists have rallied in major cities across Pakistan, condemning President Donald Trump for declaring the city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nThe demonstrators dispersed peacefully after Thursday's rallies in the capital, Islamabad. Similar anti-U.S. rallies were also held in Karachi, the country's largest city, and in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, as well as in the city of Multan in Punjab province. \nThe rallies came a day after Trump's announcement angered the Muslims across the world. Islamabad has asked the United States to reconsider any move that alters the legal and historical status of Jerusalem. \nMuslim-majority Pakistan has already reiterated its support for the Palestinians, who claim east Jerusalem as the capital of their hoped-for state \n___ \n1:45 p.m. \nThe al-Qaida-linked extremist group al-Shabab is urging Muslims to take up weapons in response to President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nThe group's spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud says it calls \"on all Muslims to raise arms and defend the blessed al-Aqsa from the Zionist occupiers supported by America, because what was taken by force can only be restored by force.\" \nHis message was carried by the Somalia-based group's news agency. \nAl-Shabab, the deadliest Islamic extremist group in Africa, calls the U.S. decision on Jerusalem as \"evidence of an escalation in its aggression against Islam and Muslims.\" \nAl-Shabab was blamed for the massive truck bombing in Mogadishu in October that killed more than 500 people and was one of the world's deadliest attacks since 9/11. \n___ \n1:15 p.m. \nHundreds of Palestinians are protesting in cities across the West Bank and Gaza Strip against President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nThe demonstrators are burning posters of Trump and of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as American and Israeli flags. Clashes between Israeli security forces and Palestinian protesters were reported at several locations. \nRallies were underway on Thursday in the West Bank cities of Hebron, Ramallah, Nablus, Jenin and Bethlehem. A demonstration was also being held outside the Damascus Gate of Jerusalem's Old City. \nPalestinians have called a general strike on Thursday and are preparing for more mass protests on Friday. \n___ \n1 p.m. \nThe Afghan Taliban have denounced the U.S. administration's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital as a \"reckless step\" and say President Donald Trump's decision will \"fan the flames conflict in the entire world especially the Middle East. \nA Taliban statement to the media on Thursday says that with the decision, America exposed its \"colonialist face and declared enmity toward Islam as well as support for policy of occupation and colonization of Muslim lands.\" \nThe statement also called on Muslims world over and Islamic countries to back the \"oppressed Palestinian nation.\" \nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani, meanwhile, says his government is \"deeply concerned\" over Trump's move which \"hurts the sentiments of the entire Islamic world.\" \n___ \n12:45 p.m. \nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has responded to criticism over President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital by saying that he U.S. president is merely recognizing reality. \nTillerson defended Trump's move on the sidelines of an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe conference in Vienna. Foreign ministers from the OSCE nations are roundly condemning the decision. \nTillerson says the United States would still support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \"if that's the desire of the two parties.\" He says Jerusalem's final status is still for Israelis and Palestinians to workout. \nTillerson says \"the whole world\" wants a peace process and the U.S. still believes there's an opportunity. \n___ \n12:40 p.m. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron says he disapproves of the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, calling it a \"unilateral decision.\" \nHe says the status of Jerusalem should be part of an international decision between Israel and the Palestinians.

The solution can only be found via negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians under the aegis of the U.N.\" \n___ \n11:45 a.m. \nIraq's government has decried the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, calling it \"unjust\" and urging the United States to revoke it. \nIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in a statement on Thursday warned of \"dangerous consequences\" for the region's stability and the world. \nHe says the U.S. should \"retreat from that decision in order to stop a dangerous escalation that leads to extremism and creates an atmosphere which helps terrorism.\" \nMeanwhile, hundreds of Iraqis are gathering in Baghdad to protest President Donald Trump's move. \nThe protest leader, Abdul-Latif al-Himaim from Iraq's Sunni Religious Endowments, told the protesters: \"Jerusalem is our identity, Jerusalem is Arab.\" \nHe says: \"You can uproot a palm tree from a grove, but you will not be able to uproot Jerusalem from our hearts and from Palestine.\" \nIraq is a key U.S. ally in the region, with more than 5,000 American troops remaining in Iraq, according to Pentagon.

But Hamas' ability to carry out attacks is more limited. Israel has imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip, and many of Hamas' supporters in the West Bank have been arrested. \nEven so, Hamas possesses a large arsenal of rockets in Gaza capable of striking many areas in Israel. \n___ \n10:30 a.m. \nSaudi Arabia's royal court, led by King Salman and his powerful son, are condemning the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nIt's a rare public rebuke by the royal court of U.S. ally and President Donald Trump. \nSaudi Arabia, a regional powerhouse that could help the White House push through a Middle East settlement, said on Thursday the kingdom had already warned against this step and \"continues to express its deep regret at the U.S. administration's decision,\" describing it \"unjustified and irresponsible.\" \nTrump's move puts the Sunni nation in a bind. The kingdom, particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. \nU.S. Embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa have warned American citizens of possible protests as a result of Trump's decision. \n___ \n9:40 a.m. \nSchools and shops are closed in the West Bank, as Palestinians are protesting President Donald Trump's recognition of contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nPolitical groups have called for protest marches in West Bank town centers at noon on Thursday. \nTrump's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. \nThe Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. In recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Trump was seen as siding with Israel which claims the entire city. \n___ \n9:30 a.m. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is accusing his American counterpart of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" by declaring the divided holy city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nErdogan also compared President Donald Trump to a \"blender\" that is stirring up trouble in the region. \nThe Turkish leader said, addressing Trump: \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it.\" \nErdogan added that \"political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace.\" \nHe also said: \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right,' he is mistaken.\" \nErdogan spoke to a group of workers on Thursday who had gathered at Ankara's airport, before he departed for an official visit to Greece. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nPalestinians, Israelis and the wider Middle East are bracing for the fallout after President Donald Trump's seismic shift in recognizing the bitterly contested Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was to travel to Jordan on Thursday to meet with King Abdullah II.

REUTERS \nBy Yasmeen Abutaleb \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Josh Brookhart has four health insurers to choose from in Seattle's King County for 2018, more than many Americans like him who buy coverage on the Obamacare individual market. \nYet none of the plans cover all the complex medical care needed for his seven-year-old son, Gabriel. \nBorn with an extreme form of Chiari malformation, Gabriel required surgery to reinsert a part of his brain into his skull. He lives with hydrocephalus, or extra fluid in his brain, and spina bifida, which causes abnormal development of the spinal cord. \nThe Brookharts' insurer, Regence BlueShield of Washington, said in June it would exit the Obamacare markets in 2018, citing unsettled marketplaces across the country, a move common to many insurers uncertain about the program's future under President Donald Trump. \nAll of Gabriel's specialists, who span multiple medical centers and practices and have been coordinating his care for five years, were covered under Regence. \nBased on the limited options for 2018 enrollment, the Brookharts plan to pick an insurer that will cover some of Gabriel's care and expect to pay tens of thousands of dollars for the rest of his needs. \n\"I would pay a high price for a good policy. It's just mind-boggling to me that it doesn't exist no matter how much I would want to pay,\" Brookhart said. \nGabriel's case shows how difficult it can still be to find adequate healthcare for very complex conditions four years after Obamacare took full effect. In many cases, an insurer will cover medical care but not certain prescription drugs. In other cases, an insurer may cover one specialist doctor but not others, or cut expensive academic medical centers out of their networks to lower costs. \nPatients with complex medical cases often take high-cost prescription drugs, rely on specialists who sometimes coordinate their care and may require sophisticated surgeries, among other needs. \nThe challenge of finding adequate healthcare on the Obamacare market is expected to intensify as the Trump administration strips away aspects of the law, healthcare experts say. \n\"Instability is just a very stressful thing for people dependent on a stable connection to the healthcare system,\" said Daniel Polsky, professor at the University of Pennsylvania and executive director of the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics. \"Even just a change of doctors could result in some difficult health consequences.\" \nRESTRICTED CHOICE \nU.S. consumers have often complained that subsidized health insurance under former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act restricted their choice of doctors, or forced them to change providers. In some cases, that may mean switching primary care providers. But for patients with serious medical needs it can prevent them from seeing their specialists. \nThe Obama administration attempted a fix, directing more federal oversight of the plans, requiring transparency from insurers on what they did, and did not, cover and setting guidelines for insurers to cover enough healthcare providers. \nTrump has promised to repeal Obamacare and is using executive powers to undermine it, including a rule finalized in April that allows individual states to determine whether insurers provide enough access to doctors. \nThe administration has also proposed giving states more authority over their insurance markets and allowing them to water down some Obamacare benefits in 2019. That could create wide discrepancies in access to doctors among states, said Sabrina Corlette, an expert on health insurance markets at Georgetown University. \nThere is no national estimate of how many people with complex medical cases may struggle to find a plan that covers their particular doctors. About 2.2 million people on the individual market have some form of a pre-existing chronic condition, according to Avalere Health, a research and consulting firm. \nSeventy-three percent of the Obamacare 2018 individual market is comprised of restrictive plans, or those that cover fewer providers, according to Avalere, up from 68 percent in 2017 and 54 percent in 2015. \nResearch has shown that insurers are more likely to offer limited access to doctor practices in markets where they compete against one or more rivals. This helps keep insurer costs down, and therefore allows them to offer lower prices. \nMatt Slaby of Denver, Colorado, can choose between six Obamacare insurers, but none cover all the care for his genetic blood clotting disorder, called Factor V Leiden. He relies on the bloodthinner Xarelto, which costs about $400 per month without insurance, to prevent life-threatening clots. \nHis insurer from last year, Cigna Corp , dropped his plan from the Denver market for 2018. \n\"There are no plans that cover everything I need,\" Slaby said. \"Finding two or three, the intersection of things that keep me alive, that's the challenge.\" \nIn U.S. counties with a single insurer, there is less incentive to whittle down the provider list because there is no competition. The departure of major insurers including Aetna Inc and Humana Inc from Obamacare markets has left about half of U.S. counties with only one insurer selling plans, up from one-third in 2017. \nBut that does not guarantee that a sole insurer in a market will cover medical care at any specific hospital or physician practice. \nIn Virginia's Chesterfield County, a single insurer, Cigna, is offering Obamacare coverage, presenting a tough choice for Jodi Smith Lemacks, whose son was born with a heart defect. The plan does not cover her son's specialists at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) five hours away, where Joshua Lemacks, 14, has been treated since he was in utero for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. \nThere is no cure for his condition. In three major surgeries, doctors at CHOP have rerouted Joshua's anatomy so that his blood can pump through one heart chamber instead of two. They have also provided medication, some through a clinical trial, to help prolong his heart's ability to function in this way. \nLemacks spends $6,000 to $7,000 a year out-of-pocket for Joshua's medical expenses, and once had medical debt close to $100,000 due to the surgeries.

The current 14-day ATR for Madrona Domestic ETF (FWDD) is currently sitting at 0.32. The ATR measures the volatility of a stock on a day-to-day basis. The average true range is typically based on 14 periods and may be calculated daily, weekly, monthly, or intraday. The ATR is not considered a directional indicator, but it may reflect the strength of a particular move. \nChecking in on some other technical levels, the 14-day RSI is currently at 63.15, the 7-day stands at 59.64, and the 3-day is sitting at 44.68. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a commonly used technical momentum indicator that compares price movement over time. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold. The RSI may be useful for spotting abnormal price activity and volatility. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. The normal reading of a stock will fall in the range of 30 to 70. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued. A reading under 30 may indicate that the stock is oversold, and possibly undervalued. \nAnother technical indicator that may be a powerful resource for determining trend strength is the Average Directional Index or ADX. The ADX was introduced by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970\u2019s and it has stood the test of time. The ADX is typically used in conjunction with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to help spot trend direction as well as trend strength. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Madrona Domestic ETF (FWDD) is noted at 24.63. Many technical analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. \nThe   %R is another technical indicator worth taking a look at. Madrona Domestic ETF (FWDD) currently has a 14 day Williams %R of -32.86. The Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and -100 measuring whether a security is overbought or oversold. The Williams %R is similar to the Stochastic Oscillator except it is plotted upside-down. Levels above -20 may indicate the stock may be considered is overbought. If the indicator travels under -80, this may signal that the stock is oversold. Chart analysts may also use the indicator to project possible price reversals and to define trends. \nMadrona Domestic ETF (FWDD) currently   61.63. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal. \nBy Journal Contributor", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "j. welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "madrona domestic etf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atr for madrona domestic etf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:34.072+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "13aa9154a1da5dbd3485108fce889cd4443a0d58", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.IpbRpFOTOuM722U2Ecn0mRMasH6rUQ9hLDQDgfPH8IlLfoLnPdn28jcXm6cLKNFi7Qg5bjuMIB878elWZNN8x", "site_full": "www.theolympian.com", "site": "theolympian.com", "site_section": "http://www.theolympian.com/news/nation-world/?widgetName=rssfeed&widgetContentId=712015&getXmlFeed=true", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nation & World News | TheOlympian.com &", "title": "A better mammogram?

U.S. health officials are beginning a huge study to compare traditional mammograms with 3-D versions, to see if the newer choice might really improve screening for breast cancer. Montefiore Health System via AP) A better mammogram? Huge study putting 3-D scans to the test By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer December 07, 2017 12:55 AM WASHINGTON \nA better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray \u2014 and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat \u2014 overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms \u2014 known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" \u2014 with standard two-dimensional digital mammography.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles \u2014 not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death \u2014 but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening \u2014 that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tova koenigs", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "otis brawley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tova koenigsberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "etta pisano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mccaskill-stevens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "worta mccaskill-stevens", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "montefiore health system", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mobile & apps in", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "u.s. preventive services task force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montefiore einstein center for cancer care", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american cancer society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beth israel deaconess medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american college of radiology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national cancer institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lauran neergaard ap medical", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:34.079+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fd4920fbaec1756f65e95f2dcd0cc156875d6cb2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.BfYtXdcIUvRvMKDAl4_VLp0jeXpqPv7aLVcKf9RiA4j0qd._yghhnVEtqke0ov9JLUPGKHOCuPQZOeNDDz.h33HCtbHGG_vNZlq94zkagL.aPKtJ6BLYg6lOol3rjRaDKdWPxRer1S6gZu2_YBBGCSh9Y0RECQqEC93RC42NuF3FmPS1bWGeT2UnBeZfNfWL0MTL8Na36XQ--", "site_full": "www.pantagraph.com", "site": "pantagraph.com", "site_section": "http://www.pantagraph.com/search/?f=rss&amp;t=article&amp;c=template&amp;l=50&amp;s=start_time&amp;sd=desc", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "www.pantagraph.com - RSS Results", "title": "What to Expect From TransCanada Corporation in 2018", "title_full": "What to Expect From TransCanada Corporation in 2018", "published": "2017-12-07T10:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/pantagraph.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/2c/22c0d3a5-5f86-5d45-a75e-65c8e4150ec2/59b15f4153d23.image.jpg?crop=580%2C326%2C0%2C29&amp;resize=580%2C326&amp;order=crop%2Cresize", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 44692, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fd4920fbaec1756f65e95f2dcd0cc156875d6cb2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.BfYtXdcIUvRvMKDAl4_VLp0jeXpqPv7aLVcKf9RiA4j0qd._yghhnVEtqke0ov9JLUPGKHOCuPQZOeNDDz.h33HCtbHGG_vNZlq94zkagL.aPKtJ6BLYg6lOol3rjRaDKdWPxRer1S6gZu2_YBBGCSh9Y0RECQqEC93RC42NuF3FmPS1bWGeT2UnBeZfNfWL0MTL8Na36XQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "What to Expect From TransCanada Corporation in 2018", "text": "What to Expect From TransCanada Corporation in 2018 Dec 7, 2017 This Fast-Growing, High-Yield Stock Just Added Some More Fuel to Keep Its Payout Heading Higher \nCrude oil and refined products MLP Magellan Midstream Partners (NYSE: MMP) has been great to income-focused investors over the years.

A major Spanish wholesale operator is one of the first customers to deploy this new solution.\nThe two new modules \u2013 the PM 200FRS02 and PM 200FRS02-SF \u2013 are the latest advanced networking solutions from Ekinops, a leading supplier of next-generation optical network equipment.\nWith the new modules, service providers can reduce their capital and operational costs and improve the business case for deploying new capacity. Their small form factor provides operational savings with the ability to fit up to 1.2 terabits per second of capacity in only two rack units. That minimizes space requirements while using less than half the power per gigabit of competitive offerings.\nIn addition, the PM 200FRS02-SF provides single fiber operation, giving service providers the option of cutting fiber costs in half. This single fiber capability was key for Aire Networks, Spain\u2019s fourth largest wholesale operator. It is now using the Ekinops modules in its 27,000-kilometer fiber network that covers 90 percent of the country.\nAire Networks has seen its traffic double in the first three quarters of 2017 and sought to improve network operations while keeping operational expenses as low as possible. What the service provider really wanted was a solution that would offer 200G transmission in single fiber mode and guarantee scalability for the future, and Ekinops offered the best solution to meet its requirements.\n\u201cNot only did Ekinops offer exactly what Aire Networks needed, they moved quickly to provide the solution to us and were flexible and easy to work with at every step of the way,\u201d said Ra\u00fal Aledo Coy, CEO of Aire Networks.\n\u201cWe have been able to reduce the form factor in these new modules by a factor of three while reducing power requirements by a factor of two. That delivers an order of magnitude improvement in service density and network cost, key factors for Aire Networks and for other Ekinops customers when it comes to profitability,\u201d said Mark Burton, EMEA Vice President of Sales at Ekinops. \u201cThis demonstrates Ekinops\u2019 continued commitment to providing our customers the most efficient and flexible optical transport solutions.\u201d\nBoth the PM 200FRS02 and PM 200FRS02-SF modules employ dual QSFP28 client ports with software-selectable line side modulation that can be provisioned as either DP-QPSK or 16QAM to create 100G or 200G transport links. These new generation modules provide enhanced functionality in one-third the space of previous equipment, occupying only a single slot in an Ekinops 360 chassis, for three times the capacity per shelf.\nBy selecting the modulation format that best meets an operator\u2019s capacity and distance requirements, the PM 200FRS02 and PM 200FRS02-SF can support any metro, regional or long-haul application including converged metro transport, data center interconnection (DCI), mobile backhaul, enterprise connectivity and submarine transport.\nEkinops is also adding to the flexibility of the modules by introducing the PM 100G-AGG companion card for multiplexing up to ten 10G multiprotocol client services into a G.709 standard OTU4 that connects to one client port on the PM 200FRS02 or PM 200FRS02-SF. This modular approach allows 10G services to be carried efficiently over 100G or 200G links and allows the service provider to combine both 10G and 100G clients on a single 200G link for greater resource utilization and bandwidth efficiency.\nAbout Ekinops\nEkinops is a leading provider of open, fully interoperable Layer 1, 2 and 3 solutions to service providers around the world. Our programmable and highly scalable solutions enable fast, flexible and cost-effective deployment of new services for high-speed, high-capacity optical transport as well as virtualization-enabled managed enterprise services.

98.5", "text": "Roche drug cocktail doubles chance of holding lung cancer at bay Thursday, December 07, 2017 1:01 a.m. EST \nBy John Miller \nZURICH (Reuters) - Adding Roche's immunotherapy Tecentriq to older drugs doubled the percentage of lung cancer patients who survived a year without their disease advancing, an outcome some experts labelled unprecedented. \nThirty seven percent of patients in a closely watched clinical trial who received Tecentriq, Avastin and chemotherapy reached the one-year mark without their cancer progressing (PFS), according to data released on Thursday. \nFor patients getting only Avastin and chemotherapy, that fell to 18 percent. \nRoche's announcement in November that its Impower 150 trial had broadly succeeded in first-line lung cancer patients helped spur a one-day, $12 billion rally in the Basel-based drugmaker's market capitalisation. \nThursday's release of specific numbers at a European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Geneva could further fan investor optimism that the Swiss drugmaker is gaining on rivals Merck & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb. \nRoche Chief Executive Severin Schwan sees an opportunity to leap-frog ahead as competitors still await their own lung cancer combination trial results. \n\"This is very, very promising,\" Dr Solange Peters, the head of Medical Oncology at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois in Lausanne, Switzerland, said on the latest results. \n\"Doubling PFS (progression-free survival) at one year is something we have not seen with any targeted therapy in unselected patients to date.\" \nIn a second significant trial result, Roche also released positive interim data from its recently approved haemophilia drug Hemlibra dosed every four weeks, saying the results were consistent with previous studies of the medicine dosed once a week or every two weeks. \nRoche said it would submit the results from both studies to regulatory authorities around the world. \nThe Swiss company's shares rose more than 1 percent in Zurich. \nAnalysts said the \"highly significant\" risk reduction from the study will help cement Tecentriq as a strong competitor to Merck's Keytruda. \n\"We see the Impower 150 outcomes sufficient for Roche to submit a robust data package to the health authorities and very likely obtain a marketing authorization in the U.S. by mid-2018,\" wrote Bruno Bulic, a Baader Helvea analyst with a \"buy\" rating on Roche shares. \nRoche is counting on $150,000-per-year Tecentriq to help replace revenue from its $20 billion-per-year trio of Avastin, Herceptin and Rituxan whose patents have expired or will shortly, exposing them to cheaper competition. \nAccording to estimates collected by Reuters, Tecentriq annual sales are seen topping $4.6 billion by 2023. \nLung cancer is easily the biggest oncology market, with about 220,000 people in the United States due to be diagnosed this year and 155,000 seen dying from the disease often caused by smoking. \nIn Roche's 1,202-patient study, patients getting Roche's immunotherapy survived an average of 8.3 months without their disease getting worse, only modestly better than the PFS of 6.8 months for those getting chemotherapy and Avastin. \nStill, analysts focused more on the 38 percent reduction in risk of disease progression or death in the Tecentriq group, well within the range they have said would signify a robust result. \nOVERALL SURVIVAL \nFor a set of patients who expressed a specific biomarker called \"Teff\" that Roche is exploring to help identify people who may respond best, the results were more robust, with a 49 percent risk reduction and PFS at 11.3 months for the Tecentriq group versus 6.8 months. \nRoche, which said serious adverse events were seen in 25.4 percent of patients getting the Tecentriq combination compared with 19.3 percent in the Avastin-chemo group, is still awaiting Impower 150's overall survival data in the first half of 2018. \nStill, the trial's head, Dr Martin Reck of Germany's Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf, said those numbers \"look encouraging\". \nTecentriq is already approved in bladder cancer treatment and for lung cancer patients who have failed chemotherapy. \n(Reporting by John Miller; Editing by Ben Hirschler/Mark Potter/Susan Fenton) More From Health ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

Others, like Wall Street adviser Tom Lee, expect bitcoin to top $100,000. \nOn Wednesday, its hypervolatility was on full display as it broke through $13,000 for the first time on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange , jumping more than 11 percent on the day.. Since August 2011, bitcoin has averaged a daily price change of nearly 3 percent, up or down, compared with a daily average change in the U.S. dollar-euro cross rate of less than 0.5 percent since the euro's debut in 1999. \n\"Maybe it's just the most unique market that is going to continue to go up forever and ever and so everybody on the long side is going to make money and it's a great thing, but I've been around long enough to know that's not going to work out so well,\" said John Lothian, CEO of advisory firm John J Lothian and Company. \nAs a virtual currency, bitcoin can be used to move money around the world without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government, which is a double-edged sword, said Steve Grob, director of group strategy at Fidessa. \n\"There is no backstop. If suddenly tomorrow everyone decided bitcoin was worthless, it would be worthless, and I\u2019m not sure whether people have really thought that one through,\" he said. \nTraditional banks remain skeptical of dealing with bitcoin exchanges. Earlier this year, Wells Fargo & Co stopped processing wire transfers for an exchange called Bitfinex, leaving customers unable to transfer U.S. dollars out of their accounts, except through special arrangement with the exchange's lawyer. \nStill, new entrants, from retail investors to high-frequency traders, have piled into bitcoin. U.S.-based crypto-exchange Coinbase said it added 100,000 accounts in the three days around the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, for 13.1 million overall. \nIf the futures market were to exceed the size of the spot market, with current daily trading volume of around $6 billion per day, the underlying price could be more susceptible to manipulation, said Kevin Zhou, co-founder of crypto currency fund Galois Capital. \n\"You've seen these problems before in bitcoin futures, where right before the settlement, the price pegs it high or low and then bounces back right after,\" he said. \nRISK OF AN 'AVALANCHE' \nAs volumes increase, there are also questions about the robustness of the technology at bitcoin exchanges, Lothian said. \n\"Particularly when you're talking about a high-frequency approach to this where people are trying to arb multiple exchanges.\" \nLast month, the Gemini bitcoin exchange, which will set the price for Cboe's futures contract, and GDAX and Kraken, two of the four exchanges in CME's bitcoin index, had systems issues. \n\"Every single bitcoin exchange receives and is receiving complaints by users due to the unbelievably surging bitcoin price and the result that has on capacity,\" Christina Yee, a Kraken representative, recently told Reuters in an email. \nKraken is planning to launch a new trade engine \"soon\" which should increase the exchange\u2019s capacity, Yee said. \nThe volatile nature of bitcoin could also present a risk to clearing houses, said Thomas Peterffy, CEO of Interactive Brokers Group Inc . \nClearing houses act as a middlemen between the parties to futures transactions. If there were a wild price swing in bitcoin and a smaller brokerage failed to meet its margin call, the clearing house would have to take over the position, further moving the price of bitcoin, which could cause other brokers to fail, Peterffy said. \n\"If that happens at a time when bitcoin spikes up for whatever crazy reason, there could be an avalanche,\" he said. \nQuestions like these have kept some futures market operators on the sidelines, for now. Intercontinental Exchange Inc , owner of the New York Stock Exchange and ICE Futures U.S., opted not to join CME and Cboe in the race to be first with a bitcoin future. \n\"We didn't think it was obvious to rush out a product and be first and settle against an index on a lot of exchanges that are not particularly transparent,\" ICE Chief Executive Jeffrey Sprecher said this week at a Goldman Sachs conference. \n(Reporting by John McCrank and Anna Irrera;

In a storm of tweets last weekend, Trump called the nation's top law enforcement agency a biased institution whose reputation is \"in Tatters \u2014 worst in History!\" and urged Wray to \"clean house.\" \nDemocrats are pushing Wray to respond forcefully, while Republicans echo Trump in suggesting they worry about political bias in special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of possible Trump campaign ties to Russia during the 2016 presidential election. \nRep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., chairman of the committee, seized on revelations that an FBI agent was removed from Mueller's team because of anti-Trump texts. Never miss a local story.

Jerrold Nadler of New York, top Democrat on the House Judiciary panel, predicted Trump's attacks will only grow louder as Mueller continues investigating. \"Your responsibility is not only to defend the bureau but to push back against the president when he is so clearly wrong, both on the facts and as a matter of principle,\" Nadler told Wray. \nWray's tenure as the new FBI chief would be difficult enough even without the intense scrutiny of the Russia investigation. Since he was sworn in on Aug. 2, the U.S. has experienced two of the deadliest shootings in its modern history and an attack seen as terrorism in Manhattan. \nTrump's weekend tweets created a fresh dilemma for Wray. With his bosses, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Sessions' deputy, Rod Rosenstein, staying publicly silent, it fell to Wray to defend the agency. But FBI directors traditionally have been low-key and stoic \u2014 with Wray's predecessor, James Comey, a notable exception. \nAnd Trump's firing of Comey while he led the Russia probe shows what can happen to a director who antagonizes the president.

It reinforced its refusal to join a new coalition after Merkel's talks with two smaller parties collapsed last month. \nHowever, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made clear that he doesn't want a new election, and Social Democrat leader Martin Schulz reversed course. \nAt a previously scheduled party congress Thursday, Schulz is seeking members' approval for a resolution approving talks on \"whether and in what form\" the Social Democrats can support a new government.

Yesterday, Urban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government Minister Noh Omar announced that the cabinet had set up a  five-minister  committee to review appeals from developers against the ban. However, DAP national publicity secretary Tony Pua said that this would open the appeals process to \u201csweet-talk\u201d. \u201cNow, the ministers have granted themselves full discretionary powers to grant approval to any developer who can sweet-talk (his) way to win the hearts of the ministers. \u201cHave we now become a communist regime where the government dictates how many left shoes to manufacture?\u201d Pua asked in a statement today. \n\nThe  ban  on all on new shopping malls, offices and residential units priced above RM1 million was first announced on Nov 19 by Second Finance Minister Johari Abdul Ghani ( photo ) following a Bank Negara quarterly report that warned of an  oversupply  of unaffordable homes in the property market.  Johari had stressed that there would be \u201c no U-turn \u201d on the moratorium. Following this announcement, Works Minister Fadillah Yusof and Federal Territories Minister Tengku Adnan Tengku Mansor both suggested there would be some leeway for developers to appeal the ban. Tengku Adnan also said Putrajaya-backed projects Bandar Malaysia and TRX, which include many high-end properties, would not be affected as their master plans had already been approved, prior to the ruling that came into effect on Nov 1. Pua criticised this exemption as being \u201cbiased\u201d. \u201cThe fact that Bandar Malaysia ( photo below ) has not even found a developer with a plan appears immaterial to the ban exemption. \u201cThe biased exemption of such projects by government-linked companies (GLCs) has created an uproar among the private sector, which then lobbied hard to ease the ban,\u201d he added. \n\nLack of consistency in policy-making Following the setting up of the five-minister committee and a  The Edge Markets  report yesterday that quoted Johari as saying developers of offices and malls could now \u201capproach relevant ministers with their plans\u201d and provide justifications, the Petaling Jaya Utara MP accused the government of performing a \u201cdouble-twist somersault\u201d on the property ban. \u201c(These) multiple twists and turns worthy of a world-class acrobatic act only go to prove that the Najib administration is completely clueless in policy-making,\" Pua said.  \u201cHow does the above (decision to set up a ministerial committee), for example, even address the main issue of the lack of affordable housing in the country and the largest oversupply of residential properties? \u201cThe cabinet must remedy its knee-jerk policy-making mechanism and instead conduct a thorough study with all stakeholders, Bank Negara and think-tanks to design consistent, constructive and incentivised policies,\" he said.  Pua went on to urge the government to ensure continued growth and sustainability of the property sector and the economy.- Mkini ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "- mkini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony pua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noh omar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "najib", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fadillah yusof", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tengku adnan tengku mansor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johari abdul ghani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tengku adnan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bandar malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "urban wellbeing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank negara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "petaling jaya utara", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bandar malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:37.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ca26b1d249287df3e09eb5467e825fd01688cde9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W6Fy5i3XVyjBcR7jreoisK80qWX7ZMDmNk8eIK4UkxPv6vYo.GCHDFq9.gJVIu6RREpIs2m5.2tL7yQ78LaW.F8-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Ask Reddit...", "title": "What is the most perfect animated movie?", "title_full": "What is the most perfect animated movie?

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Sharp Corp <6753.T> will ask the government to help it form an alliance with rival Japan Display Inc <6740.T> in OLED technology to better compete with South Korean makers, its chief executive said on Thursday. \n\"We should create a Japan alliance\" in organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels, Tai Jeng-wu told reporters at the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), after Sharp's shares returned to the bourse's first section after a year's absence. \nOLED screens are gaining in popularity as they are generally thinner, more flexible and offer richer colors than liquid crystal display (LCD) panels. Apple Inc has adopted OLED screens for its new iPhone X. \nSharp and Japan Display, both Apple suppliers, plan to start OLED panel production next year or later. South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <005930.KS> already supplies OLED panels to global smartphone vendors while LG Display Co Ltd <034220.KS> does likewise for television set makers. \n\"Do we want (OLED) technology in Japan or not? I'd like to speak with the industry ministry and INCJ (the Innovation Network Corp of Japan) on the matter,\" Tai said. \nState-backed INCJ owns 36 percent of Japan Display, which was formed by combining the ailing display units of Sony Corp <6758.T>, Hitachi Ltd <6501.T> and Toshiba Corp <6502.T>. \nTai also said he would contact the government for potential investment in JOLED, a Japan Display affiliate, which sold its inaugural batch of OLED screens to Sony on Tuesday. \nJOLED, which boasts a low-cost printing process for OLED panels, is seeking to raise 100 billion yen ($888 million) in investment from materials, equipment and electronics makers to expand production capacity. \nJapan Display and INCJ declined to comment. JOLED declined to provide immediate comment. \nTai, former vice chairman of Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn) < 2317.TW >, became head of Sharp last year after Foxconn took control of a Japanese firm hit by price competition and falling sales in LCD panels. \nTai has said he would step down once Sharp turns profitable at the net level and its shares return to the TSE's first section. \nSharp forecasts net profit of 69 billion yen for the year through March, which would be its first annual profit in four years following cost-cutting under Foxconn. \nIts shares returned to the TSE's first section on Thursday for the first time since August last year, when they fell to the second section after Sharp booked negative net assets. \nWhen asked about his future, Tai on Thursday said he wants Sharp's board to select a co-chief executive next year to whom he could transfer some of his responsibilities. \n($1 = 112.0200 yen) \n(Reporting by Makiko Yamazaki; Editing by Christopher Cushing) More From Business ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "makiko yamazaki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "x.  sharp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters/kim kyung-hoon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher cushing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tai jeng-wu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tai", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "est sharp corp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hon hai precision industry co ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hitachi ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan display inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "incj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan display", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung electronics co ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "innovation network corp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharp corp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toshiba corp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lg display co ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tokyo stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foxconn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sony corp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joled", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tokyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tokyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taiwan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:37.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "18a5aa87461f7385a4467c0eb08714202da02cc1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg94KALLIDb2_GtKkqT172ZgPRpp4_1KG0CtBnb5ABXKSJJIYj80wyEPRAtHzzVqlM8_mNtG0dd6yR4O_JEaPjE.EslLzkzJ8FdWAX1hdsulBu7FRISgtlheHzotky05PSBc1uHJdNkj4yheEBQnAk7L", "site_full": "wincountry.com", "site": "wincountry.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "music", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "Breaking slow: Asia set to raise rates next year, but still lag Fed | News | WIN 98.5", "title_full": "Breaking slow: Asia set to raise rates next year, but still lag Fed | News | WIN 98.5", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.14, "main_image": "http://radiocms-images.us1.eldarioncloud.com/resize/600/https://storage.googleapis.com/media.mwcradio.com/mimesis/2017-12/07/2017-12-07T043714Z_1_LYNXMPEDB608L-OUSBS_RTROPTP_3_BUSINESS-US-ASIA-ECONOMY-RATES-ANALYSIS.JPG", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "18a5aa87461f7385a4467c0eb08714202da02cc1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg94KALLIDb2_GtKkqT172ZgPRpp4_1KG0CtBnb5ABXKSJJIYj80wyEPRAtHzzVqlM8_mNtG0dd6yR4O_JEaPjE.EslLzkzJ8FdWAX1hdsulBu7FRISgtlheHzotky05PSBc1uHJdNkj4yheEBQnAk7L", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Midwest Communications Inc.", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Breaking slow: Asia set to raise rates next year, but still lag Fed | News | WIN 98.5", "text": "Breaking slow: Asia set to raise rates next year, but still lag Fed Wednesday, December 06, 2017 11:37 p.m. EST FILE PHOTO: The Federal Reserve headquarters in Washington September 16 2015. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo \nBy Marius Zaharia \nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Tighter monetary policy is coming to Asia next year. Yet it will lag the Federal Reserve's rate hikes as Asian central banks balance an exports-led revival in growth with a slowdown in regional locomotive China. \nThat will mark a shift from a few months ago when most economists expected Asian policy makers to hold their ground or even ease further, but the trade windfall behind a synchronized uptick in global growth is seen lasting longer. \nLast week South Korea took advantage of the trade boom to normalize policy, lifting rates for the first time in more than six years, and analysts expect Malaysia and Philippines - where growth has also benefited from a surge in public investment - to hike in the first quarter. \nWith the benefit of hindsight when the Fed in 2013 signaled it was time to exit ultra-low rates and sparked a taper tantrum, regional central banks should be more confident of looking at the strength of their own economies rather than that of the United States. \n\"The last couple of years has shown us that monetary policy in this region can decouple from the U.S,\" said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ. \n\"Obviously they are cognizant of what the Fed does and capital flows ... (but) this is not a case of central banks being forced to act just because the Fed is looking to tighten further.\" \nThat de-coupling has been on show in the past two years as Asia shrugged off four U.S. rate hikes, and some countries even cut rates over that period. \nSouth Korea was the first major Asian economy to lift rates since Indonesia's November 2014 move, which was reversed three months later as markets eventually took the view that a U.S. lift-off won't necessarily derail global growth. \nCHINA FACTOR \nOf course, the Fed cannot be totally ignored as it is expected to hike again next week and two to three more times in 2018. Korea and Malaysia have some of the lowest real interest rates relative to the United States since the global financial crisis and were responsible for most of the net bond market outflows in Asia in October. \nAustralia and New Zealand could hike later next year, China might raise its short-term policy rates, while some analysts expect even India and Indonesia, which have been cutting recently, to reverse their moves. \nChina is emerging as a key driver of Asia's policy track next year, with growth in the world's second-biggest economy set to lose momentum as authorities there extend a year-long crackdown on financial risks. \nThe numbers show Asia is less dependent on American growth than in the past. \nWhile emerging Asia's trade with the United States has gone up by 40 percent since the global financial crisis, its trade with China has risen 120 percent, according to Reuters calculations based on IMF data. Emerging Asia now trades 70 percent more with China than it does with the United States. \nThat means monetary tightening in the region will lag the Fed, as long as any capital outflows driven by the narrower rate differentials do not lead to significantly weaker currencies. Stubbornly low inflation and elevated household debt may also slow rate hikes in some countries. \n\"We have a picture where the average Asian central bank hikes less than the U.S.,\" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics. \n\"We can argue they can do that without putting pressure on their real economy or financial sector because first, in some countries like India or Indonesia rates start from a higher level than in the United States and they have a buffer and secondly, the dollar would not strengthen a lot.\" \nThe good news is that during synchronized global growth the dollar historically tends to be stable or weaker, suggesting that Asian currencies will likely avoid a sharp shakeout. \nKuijs expects the 4-8 percent strengthening in Asian currencies this year to come to a halt in 2018, when some might weaken slightly, but by less than 4 percent. BofA Merrill Lynch sees most currencies flat in 2018. \nFLAT CURVES \nThe other element mitigating the risk of capital outflows is that while short-term bond yields are rising in the U.S. and Asia in anticipation of higher rates, long-term yields have remained stable as markets are yet to be convinced of any global inflationary pressures. \nWhile U.S. two-year yields rose from 1.2 to 1.8 percent this year, 10-year yields dipped 6 basis points to 2.39 percent, still below South Korean yields . \n\"We're pretty comfortable with the monetary policy outlook for Asia,\" said Bryan Collins, portfolio manager, fixed income, at Fidelity International, who sees opportunities in long-dated Asian debt. \n(Reporting by Marius Zaharia; Editing by Shri Navaratnam) More From Business ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "khoon goh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shri navaratnam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marius zaharia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bryan collins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louis kuijs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuijs", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "imf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fidelity international", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oxford economics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bofa merrill lynch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:37.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "01a19513ba32c4d5aef4734aa8724d75023c527e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poyz8dKy4Kf6MNm.9bZTlsNWK3GygQFjTF9fK6HLEWW5IKSetuH351YJ0h9nJzvNFr4puib_vG8aKdRXlIiBrTosrQcPcPvDKvs-", "site_full": "infokerjakediri.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://infokerjakediri.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "LOWONGAN KERJA TERBARU AREA KEDIRI", "title": "Lowongan Kerja Esther House of Beauty Kediri", "title_full": "Lowongan Kerja Esther House of Beauty Kediri", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ID", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "01a19513ba32c4d5aef4734aa8724d75023c527e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poyz8dKy4Kf6MNm.9bZTlsNWK3GygQFjTF9fK6HLEWW5IKSetuH351YJ0h9nJzvNFr4puib_vG8aKdRXlIiBrTosrQcPcPvDKvs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Yaol Josefat (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "Lowongan Kerja Esther House of Beauty Kediri", "text": "POSISI: \n1.

Translate Thursday, December 07, 2017 Bugs In The Cold There is something morally wrong about mosquitoes and snow flurries floating through the same air at the same time. Tuesday was allegedly the first snow of the year here, and although I didn\u2019t see it\u2014the flakes apparently melted before they hit the ground\u2014I did see, and get bitten by mosquitoes, many of whom have moved indoors in response to the cold weather. I\u2019ve got to remember to buy an electric mosquito paddle for my classroom. Tuesday was kind of a personal mess. For the second time in a year, I slept through my nap alarms and missed the first half of my first afternoon class. I got a call from the principal to the effect of \u201cWhere the heck are you?! The kids came downstairs to get me!\u201d I arrived at school looking distinctly disturbed, and she didn\u2019t yell at me, just remarked that I looked exhausted during the faculty meeting earlier in the day. I\u2019ve been really tired. I feel old and I look old. The sleeping pills don\u2019t appear to be doing a dime\u2019s worth of good. I followed the directions to the letter, and still lie awake past the wee hours. Last night I got a maximum of four hours\u2019 sleep. I\u2019ve been so tired that I\u2019ve been shaking involuntarily (although some of that may be due to the cold\u2014sometimes my \u201clonghanels\u201d as Granddaddy called them, don\u2019t keep me as toasty as I would like) and some students have asked if I am OK. Nonetheless, I haven\u2019t been depressed, although my memory is dreadful. I\u2019m getting extra exercise returning to rooms and floors I\u2019d left where I\u2019ve forgotten something. There is still no word from the publisher about the Two Motherlands, Two Fatherlands manuscript. If and when I get a positive response on the subject, I think I\u2019ll drop to the floor and sob with relief. In the amount of time it\u2019s taken me to translate this thing and (I hope and pray) find a welcoming publisher, Jacob had earned two wives. During my preparations for my Thanksgiving celebration, I found a sweet potato souffl\u00e9 recipe that will hereafter be part of my standard repertoire. It\u2019s delicious, and healthy, with one tablespoon of honey added to the filling, alongside several teaspoons of citrus zest (I\u2019ve been using tangerines because they are plentiful); the only sugar is in the topping. I could eat it by the bucketful. I tried baking the sweet potatoes at a higher temperature this go round, and though the skins were rather burnt, it was easier to separate them from the meat of the potato. I would go get a smoothie this evening (I try to get one once, and only once, a week), but all I want to do is curl up with a huge mug of steaming hot herbal tea and think sleepy thoughts. But I\u2019ve got two more classes to teach before I can bundle up and trudge home. No matter how tired I am, I am animated in the classroom, but away from my students I crash into near-immobility. Is that the definition of an \u201cintrovert who can\u2019t shut up,\u201d as my sister once phrased it?
