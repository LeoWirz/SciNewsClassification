Why Quora? \nThere is a multitude of ways that you can use Quora to improve your content marketing success , and there are even more benefits: Get more traffic: First off, it is a great platform for driving traffic to your blog, or any other pieces of content you have posted online. More high quality traffic : One of the things I have discovered with Quora is that, while it is not as big a traffic-driver as Facebook and Twitter (at the moment!), it does tend to drive more quality traffic \u2013 meaning, traffic that takes action, and spends more than a few seconds on my website. Quora, in my case, has one of the lowest bounce rates, as well as one of the highest conversion rates of all my traffic sources Boost your authority: Quora is a great platform for sharing and demonstrating your knowledge. It can be instrumental in boosting your authority in your niche and help you get social influencer status. Learn more about your audience: One of the reasons Quora has survived for longer than other similar platforms, and is still so successful is, it that it is used by real people looking for real answers. This can help you learn a lot about your audience \u2013 what they need help with, how they search for answers online, what questions they have, and so on. \nHere are some of the ways that you can use Quora as part of your content marketing strategy: Write Better-Targeted Content \nAs I mentioned before, Quora is a great place to learn more about your target audience, and what questions they have. \nAdditionally, it is a great platform for content research. All you have to do is use the search bar to enter your keywords and find relevant questions, as well as topics that you can follow for a consistent stream of new questions: \nIt will help you understand more about your target audience, what types of questions they have, and what content would provide them with value. \nQuora can also be used for keyword research \u2013 or rather, to help you understand even better how people search for things online. The more you use Quora, the more you will notice how people use the platform in a very natural way, both with questions and with answers: the terms they use, the way they formulate questions and answers, and so on. Use Quora to Drive Quality Traffic to Your Blog \nIf you have a blog, it is worth using Quora to help promote your blog and drive traffic to it. How? The short answer: find relevant questions and answer them. \nThe long answer: Find relevant questions using the search bar, as well as the topics you follow. Check to see whether a question is worth responding to. Scroll down to see the question stats, and check to see if there are too many answers already (which means yours will likely get lost). Check to see if it hasn\u2019t been answered in a long time and whether it has enough views or followers. Ideally, if you are going to answer older questions, only pick those that have lots of people following the question. However, if you do find a very recent question, jump on it, even though it doesn\u2019t have any followers yet. This way, you will be among the first to answer, and if your answer is good enough, you will get the upvotes needed for your answer to appear first in the questions\u2019 feed. This one, for example, is a great question to answer \u2013 it has just been asked, and it has no answers: Answer the question! When you are answering a question on Quora, the most important thing that you need to remember is that you need to actually answer the question \u2013 no fluff, no beating around the bush. Be honest and try to answer the question to the best of your ability; after all, that is the whole purpose of Quora. And, the reason it is still popular today is that people actually make the effort to give their best, most informed answers, no matter what the subject is. If you can include some screenshots to illustrate your point, all the better. Your answers\u2019 tone: Quora is pretty informal, so when you answer the question, don\u2019t write it as you would a blog post, for example. Address the person who asked the question, and write the answer in a natural, friendly way. Structuring your answers: Make your answers as easy to read as possible. Use headlines, use bullet-points, break up your answer with relevant imagery, and so on \u2013 you want people to be able to read your answer quickly and comfortably, or to skim it if that is their intention Place your link: In order to drive traffic, you will need to add the link you want to promote to your answer. The best way to go is to be as transparent as possible \u2013 simply mention that by reading this article, viewing this video, etc., they can get more answers, or a better-detailed answer and then link to your post. So long as the links you provide offer some extra value, it is ok to add a link \u2013 however, make sure to use different links and not be too aggressive, or you might get your account suspended. \nFollow this advice and create a Quora schedule to stick to: whether 1 answer a day, 3 a week or 3 a day, every answer counts. Drive Traffic with Quora Ads \nAnother way to drive traffic with Quora is to use their advertising program. It is a great alternative, particularly if you find yourself disillusioned with other social media ads. \nIn a recent test conducted by the Social Media Lab , they wanted to see whether they would get more conversions when they linked the Quora ad to a blog post, versus a landing page. \nThe results showed that linking to a landing page can get you more lead conversions (a 6.87% conversion rate, to be specific). However, the ads linking to blog posts got more impressive results (double) with clicks and traffic \u2013 over 109k impressions and 68% of all clicks (959), as well as a 1.98% conversion rate (19 free trials were procured). Conclusion \nQuora is currently an underutilized content marketing tool; although plenty of people are using it to drive traffic and boost awareness of their name, there are more ways in which Quora can be of massive help: for keyword research, for getting targeted content ideas, and for driving more conversions. \nAre you using Quora as part of your content marketing strategy? And if so, how?

Redakcija BIF on 05/12/2017 - 10:37 in Ekonomija , Slajder , Vesti   125 times! \nKada je u pitanju investiranje u akcije, ova godina je na globalnom nivou bila odli\u010dna. Gotovo svi najva\u017eniji indeksi na svetu zna\u010dajno su porasli, pri \u010demu su investitori ostvarili iznadprose\u010dno visoke prinose. \nAko je suditi po istoriji, kraj godine bi tako\u0111e trebalo da bude odli\u010dno vreme za ulaganje. Naime, analiti\u010dari i statisti\u010dari su na ameri\u010dkom berzanskom tr\u017ei\u0161tu primetili interesantan fenomen. U nedelju izme\u0111u katoli\u010dkog Bo\u017ei\u0107a i Nove godine cene akcija gotovo uvek rastu. SP500 indeks, koji je dobar pokazatelj ukupne situacije na tr\u017ei\u0161tu, u poslednih 46 godina, u poslednjim danima decembra je rastao u \u010dak 35 godina. U ne\u0161to manjoj meri, akcije imaju tendenciju rasta tokom celog decembra, a taj fenomen se zove \u201cSanta Claus rally\u201d ili u slobodnom prevodu \u201cRast cena kojeg donosi Deda Mraz\u201d. Mnogi investitori smatraju da ovaj fenomen nije slu\u010dajnost. \nAnaliti\u010dari Admiral Markets-a u nastavku navode nekoliko argumenata koji idu u prilog rasta cena akcija u vreme Bo\u017ei\u0107a. Prvi argument je op\u0161ti optimizam u vreme praznika. Budu\u0107i da na berzama trguju milioni ljudi, a ve\u0107ina ih je zbog Bo\u017ei\u0107a dobro raspolo\u017eena, ve\u0107a je verovatno\u0107a da \u0107e krajem godine biti spremniji da kupuju nego prodaju akcije. Neka istra\u017eivanja su \u010dak otkrila statisti\u010dku povezanost izme\u0111u lo\u0161ih vremenskih uslova u velikim finansijskim gradovima i pada cena na berzi. \nDrugi argument je sezona godi\u0161njih odmora bankara, fond menad\u017eera i profesionalnih tradera. Naime, upravo ova kategorija investitora odra\u0111uje ve\u0107inu \u201cshort sellinga\u201d, tj. otvaranja prodajnih pozicija s kojima se mo\u017ee profitirati na padu cene akcija ili ostalih instrumenta, npr. valute na Forex tr\u017ei\u0161tu. Budu\u0107i da je manje profesionalaca aktivno u bo\u017ei\u0107no vreme, manji je interes za prodaju instrumenata, pa kupci prevladavaju. \nTre\u0107i argument se temelji na \u010dinjenici da cijene akcija i berzanskih indeksa imaju tendenciju dugoro\u010dnog rasta. U poslednih 100 godina, ameri\u010dke akcije u proseku rastu gotovo 10% godi\u0161nje. Zbog toga, u svakom kra\u0107em periodu, uklju\u010duju\u0107i bo\u017ei\u0107no vreme, rast je ne\u0161to izgledniji scenario od pada. \n\u010cetvrti argument je jo\u0161 jedan fenomen op\u0161te poznat na finansijskim tr\u017ei\u0161tima, a radi se o proro\u010danstvu koje samo sebe ispunjava. Zagovornici ovog argumenta smatraju da nije bitno kako je do\u0161lo do toga da akcije rastu krajem godine. Onog trena kada je fenomen otkriven, investitori su masovno po\u010deli da kupuju akcije u predbo\u017ei\u0107no vreme, kako bi profitirali na tome. Upravo ta kupovina uzrokuje dodatni rast koji potvr\u0111uje teoriju, a vremenom ovaj fenomen postaje sve izra\u017eeniji. \nNo, \u010dak i ako se zanemare sezonski razlozi, ekonomska situacija u SAD je odli\u010dna. Sude\u0107i po BDP-u, ekonomija je u poslednjem kvartalu porasla za 3,3%, stopa nezaposlenosti pada i trenutno iznosi 4,1%, a ne treba zanemariti i \u017eelju predsednika Trampa da uvede nove poreske olak\u0161ice, \u0161to bi smanjilo tro\u0161kove poslovanja kompanija i verovatno dovelo do nastavka rasta cena akcija.

Currently, miners refrain from selling diamonds in India as it attracts as much as 33 percent tax, at par with those paid by local companies on their income, according to the Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council . \nSlashing taxes will bring India at par with international centers such as Antwerp and Israel, cut out middlemen and boost supply of rough diamonds in the nation where 14 out of every 15 of the gems are polished. It will reduce costs for small merchants who have to travel or pay traders to buy the stones from the overseas centers. \n\u201cThis is our grudge and not the miners\u2019 grudge as we want them to come and sell here,\u201d said PraveenShankar Pandya, chairman of the exporters\u2019 group. \u201cMore miners coming to sell in these zones will help companies get a direct supply to goods rather than going through the middlemen.\u201d \nThe trade ministry also wants the integrated goods and services tax on import of rough diamonds to be reduced to 0.10 percent from the current 0.5 percent to 3 percent range depending on the grade, the people said. While commerce ministry spokesman Nitin Wakankar did not immediately respond to a phone call seeking comment, finance ministry spokesman D.S. Malik said if a proposal has been received, it will be considered in due course. \nExports of gems and jewelry from India between April and March is estimated to remain around last year\u2019s level of $43 billion . An earlier target of 10 percent annual growth was scrapped due to a slowdown in global demand, introduction of a five percent import tax by major buyer U.A.E and the roll out of the goods and services tax in July this year also hurt demand, according to GJEPC. \nThe trade ministry also expects a reduction in import duty on gold to 2 percent from the current 10 percent in the federal budget due February, the people said. The government had raised the import tax on gold three times in 2013 to curb imports, narrow a record current-account deficit and stop a slump in the rupee.

MESSING UP YOUR MAKEUP How to Reapply Your Sunscreen without Messing Up Your Makeup \nBecause this is a legit summer concern \u2600\ufe0f\ud83d\ude13 Helen Wallace \nvia GIPHY \nAnd since we live under the harsh African sun AND it\u2019s summer, it\u2019s even more important that we slather it on daily. We also know that if we are going to be spending time outdoors, applying it once in the morning is not going to keep us protected all day. So how do you reapply it if you are wearing makeup? Don\u2019t wear makeup? You could do that. Or you could follow these tips so that you can slay without feeling the burn. \nvia GIPHY 1 First Things First \nBefore you even THINK about heading outdoors, it\u2019s important that you put enough sunscreen on your face.. This should be done after cleansing your face and before applying your makeup. Not sure how much you should be using? It might seem extreme, but it\u2019s recommended that you spread half a teaspoon of sunscreen on your face. Wait for it to absorb before you reach for your makeup bag. 2 Extra Protection \nInstead of using your regular foundation, why not opt for a tinted moisturiser that contains SPF instead? This should not replace your conventional sunscreen but can be added on top of it to give you coverage, even out your skin tone and provide even more protection from the sun\u2019s rays. Alternatively, look for more full-coverage foundations that also contain SPF. 3 Choose Your Formula Wisely \nIf you generally use powder foundation summer is the season to make a switch to the liquid variety. This will make it easier when it comes to reapplying your sunscreen as the consistencies are the same. This means that you can reapply the sunscreen then touch up your base and blend the two together so that the finish is even and not a hot cakey mess. \nAnother makeup change to make in summer that will help with sunscreen touch-ups is using a liquid blush . For exactly the same reason as foundation. It will help you blend like a boss. 4 Spray It Don\u2019t Say It \nSetting sprays \u2013 we love them. And many of them also contain SPF. This means that you can set your makeup after first application as well as whenever you touch up throughout the day and get more protection from the sun. And in this case, less is not more, MORE is more! You can even use a high-quality sunscreen mist instead of a setting spray for that extra boost. \nEnjoy the great safely and flawlessly this summer!

We went up to Doddabetta Peak with great hopes of a visual treat. It is the highest peak in the Nilgiri Hills. But we were sorely disappointed with what we saw and experienced.\n\nDoddabetta is a 9 km drive from the Botanical Gardens of Ooty. It was a scenic drive up to the peak with tea gardens along the way. But from where the road branches off the Kotagiri Road, the road condition deteriorates and you have to negotiate some dangerous hair-pin bends with huge pot-holes. On top of that you have to pay a toll of Rs.20 to use this road. Then you have to pay Rs.7 per head as entry tax, and Rs.12 if you are carrying a camera (nothing for mobile camera!). Parking is haphazard and always crowded on weekends, and there are a lot of stalls and eateries around the parking lot with garbage all around.\n\nThe views from the peak were good, but not good enough to compensate for the negatives. I would give this place a miss the next time around. There are better places to see in and around Ooty.

Something so weird and horrible was bound to take a while to sink in. Like the Twin Towers vanishing from the New York skyline, it just felt weird and wrong. As a result, it took a long time for people to get used to President Donald. \nImmediately after his election, however, people started reminding each other that this is Not Normal. That we shouldn\u2019t become complacent or ever stop railing against the corrupt, senile, fascistic incumbent. We may finally be getting used to the fact that Trump is president, but we should never make peace with it. \nResults have been pretty good. There has been a great deal of protest, the public outcry over Obamacare\u2019s rollback was sufficient to smother Trump\u2019s healthcare plans, and recent electoral results are showing a big leftwards swing. Consider Virginia electing an openly transgendered woman to the House of Delegates, for example. \nIn spite of all the protest and righteous fury, there is still one thing that has become normalized: Donald Trump\u2019s constant bullshit. \nIt must be driving him crazy. \nThe problem with Trump is that he\u2019s basically a walking orange sack of daddy issues. Also that he\u2019s a racist sex offender who probably has dementia and wants to bang his own daughter. \n\u2026Okay, there are a LOT of problems with Trump, but the daddy thing is significant. Consider his telling response when asked about how his father would have taken his bid for the presidency. \u201cHe absolutely would have let me do it,\u201d Trump responded, a touch defensively. \nPretty much everything Trump does is geared towards making himself look big and important. He\u2019s desperate for people to be impressed by him, which is normally the sign of someone who was never treated as though they were special at home. Trump isn\u2019t smart enough to figure out the root cause of his own issues, so he built skyscrapers, covered everything in gold, bullied and abused women and, ultimately, ran for President. \nAnd through it all, he lied. Constantly. Pathologically. It\u2019s not enough that he has actual skyscrapers with his name on them. He has to tell people they\u2019re bigger than they really are . It\u2019s not enough that he\u2019s somehow made it to president \u2013 he has to insist that he had the largest inaugural crowd of all time. Even when the press is critical of him, he has to say that he\u2019s the most criticized and vilified politician in history, because he can\u2019t help but insist that he\u2019s the most . \nThe most wealthy. The most successful. The most maligned. It doesn\u2019t matter, as long as it\u2019s him because he\u2019s special, dammit, even if his daddy never told him so. \nThe result is that the one thing we have normalized during the first quarter (please, God\u2026) of Trump\u2019s presidency is that he\u2019s full of shit, and so can be safely ignored. \nOf course, being ignored is the worst thing in the world to people like Trump, and the beauty of it is that it will make him want to lie even more. Go bigger. More outlandish. Anything to appear impressive. The more he lies, the less seriously he is taken. The less seriously he is taken, the angrier he gets about it and the more he lies. Pretty soon, Trump will be claiming to be eight feet tall and world kickboxing champion. \nAgain, Trump is too old and stupid to see the error of his ways. He\u2019ll just keep lying, and being frustrated that his lies aren\u2019t taken seriously, and lying more, like a man impotently pushing at a \u201cPull\u201d door and becoming increasingly annoyed that it remains shut. \nThe Trump Presidency is a horrible thing in a great many ways. But watching Trump\u2019s inevitable spluttering implosion play out in slow motion might just be the most entertaining thing on TV.

For a link to this deal, visit our station website /waystosave Matt Granite , WKYC 2:37 AM. MST December 07, 2017 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nCLEVELAND, OH - If you're a parent, grandparent, aunt or uncle - you've seen them everywhere! Those bright colorful magnetic toy building blocks are flying off shelves at toy and hobby stores. If you can find them in stock, it's unlikely you'll find them on sale - until today. Cheaply made magnetic tile knock-off sets (which are everywhere this holiday season) can be hazardous and kids often feel the difference in minutes. Unlike Lego sets which each have their own suggested age range, magnetic tiles work well with kids as young as 3 but can equally captivate a 9-year-old. Click the play button to watch a 5-, 6- and 9-year-old unbox and engage with this deal. One of the best parts about today's deal is that if a child in your family has existing Magna-Tiles, Magformers, Picasso Tiles or Playmags, this set is compatible with those pieces. Features include: - Scalable with no limitations (kids can build as big as they want) - Wide variety of striking colors and shapes - Includes wheeled vehicle base, pane windows, castle balustrades and more - Recommended for girls and boys ages 3-12 - Teaches younger kids the difference between shapes - Helps older kids with balance, dexterity and design skills - Highly creative allowing kids the ability to build in 3D Was: $79.99 Now: $49.99 Matt Granite is a freelance consumer reporter who produces stories and video for this station, Amazon Live and others.

He packed his bag with his most treasured possessions before going to bed: the 1 terabyte hard drive with his evidence against the Islamic State (IS) group, an orange notebook half-filled with notes on Ottoman history, and, a keepsake, the first book from Amazon delivered to Mosul. He passed the night in despair, imagining all the ways he could die, and the moment he would leave his mother and his city. He had spent nearly his entire life in this home, with his five brothers and five sisters. He woke his mother in her bedroom on the ground floor. \"I am leaving,'' he said. \"Where?'' she asked. \"I am leaving,'' was all he could say. He couldn't endanger her by telling her anything more. In truth, since the IS had invaded his city, he'd lived a life about which she was totally unaware. He felt her eyes on the back of his neck, and headed to the waiting Chevrolet. He didn't look back. For nearly two years, he'd wandered the streets of occupied Mosul, chatting with shopkeepers and Islamic State fighters, visiting friends who worked at the hospital, swapping scraps of information. He grew out his hair and his beard and wore the shortened trousers required by IS. He forced himself to witness the beheadings and deaths by stoning, so he could hear the killers call out the names of the condemned and their supposed crimes. He wasn't a spy. He was an undercover historian and blogger . As IS turned the city he loved into a fundamentalist bastion, he decided he would show the world how the extremists had distorted its true nature, how they were trying to rewrite the past and forge a brutal Sunni-only future for a city that had once welcomed many faiths. He knew that if he was caught he too would be executed. \"I am writing this for the history , because I know this will end. People will return, life will go back to normal,'' is how he explained the blog that was his conduit to the citizens of Mosul and the world beyond. \"After many years, there will be people who will study what happened. The city deserves to have something written to defend the city and tell the truth, because they say that when the war begins, the first victim is the truth.'' He called himself Mosul Eye . He made a promise to himself in those first few days: Trust no one, document everything. Neither family, friends nor the Islamic State group could identify him. His readership grew by the thousands every month. And now, he was running for his life. But it would mean passing through one Islamic State checkpoint after another, on the odds that the extremists wouldn't stop him, wouldn't find the hard drive that contained evidence of IS atrocities, the names of its collaborators and fighters, and all the evidence that its bearer was the man they'd been trying to silence since they first swept in. The weight of months and years of anonymity was crushing him. He missed his name. From the beginning, Mosul Eye wrote simultaneously as a witness and a historian. Born in the midst of the Iran-Iraq war in 1986, he had come of age during a second war, when Saddam Hussein fell and the Americans took over. At 17, he remembers going to a meeting of extremists at the mosque and hearing them talk about fighting the crusaders. \"I should be honest, I didn't understand.'' As for the Americans, whose language he already spoke haltingly, he couldn't fathom why they would come all the way from the United States to Mosul. He thought studying history would give him the answers. The men in black came from the north, cutting across his neighborhood in brand new trucks, the best all-terrain Toyotas money could buy. He had seen jihadis before in Mosul and at first figured these men would fade away like the rest. But in the midst of pitched fighting, the extremists found the time to run down about 70 assassination targets and kill them all, hanging enormous banners announcing their arrival in June 2014. By then a newly minted teacher, the historian attended a staff meeting at Mosul University, where the conquerors explained the Islamic State education system, how all classes would be based upon the strictest interpretation of the Quran. To a man who had been accused of secularism during his master's thesis defense just the year before, it felt like the end of his career. In those first few days, he wrote observations about the Islamic State group on his personal Facebook page _ until a friend warned that he risked being killed. With the smell of battle still in the air, he wandered the streets, puzzling over its transformation into a city at war. He returned to find his family weeping. The smell of smoke and gunfire permeated the home. On June 18, 2014, a week after the city fell, Mosul Eye was born . \"My job as a historian requires an unbiased approach which I am going to adhere to and keep my personal opinion to myself,'' he wrote. ``I will only communicate the facts I see.'' By day, he chatted with Islamic State fighters and vendors, and observed. Always observed. By night, he wrote in his native Arabic and fluent English on a WordPress blog and later on Facebook and Twitter. The city turned dark, and Mosul Eye became one of the outside world's main sources of news about the Islamic State fighters, their atrocities and their transformation of the city into a grotesque shadow of itself. The things IS wanted kept secret went to the heart of its brutal rule. \"They were organized as a killing machine. They are thirsty (for) blood and money and women.'' He attended Friday sermons with feigned enthusiasm. He collected and posted propaganda leaflets, including one on July 27, 2014, that claimed the Islamic State leader was a descendent of the Prophet Mohammed's daughter. Back home, writing on his blog in his other, secret identity, he decried the leaflet as a blatant attempt \"to distort history'' to justify the fanatics' actions. He drank glass after glass of tea at the hospital, talking to people who worked there. Much of the information he collected went up online. Other details he kept in his computer, for fear they would give away his identity. Someday, he told himself, he would write Mosul's history using these documents. The most sensitive information initially came from two old friends: one a doctor and the other a high school dropout who embraced Islamic State's extreme interpretation of religion. He was a taxi driver who like many others in Mosul had been detained by a Shiite militia in 2008 and still burned with resentment. He swiftly joined an intelligence unit in Mosul, becoming \"one of the monsters of ISIS '' _ and couldn't resist bragging about his insider knowledge. Once he corroborated the details and masked the sources, Mosul Eye put it out for the world to see. He sometimes included photos of the fighters and commanders, complete with biographies pieced together over days of surreptitious gathering of bits and pieces of information during the course of his normal life _ that of an out-of-work scholar living at home with his family. \"I used the two characters, the two personalities to serve each other,'' he said. He would chat up market vendors and bored checkpoint guards for new leads. He took on other identities as well on Facebook. Although the names were clearly fake, the characters started to take on a life of their own. One was named Mouris Milton whom he came to believe was an even better version of himself _ funny, knowledgeable. Another was Ibn al-Athir al-Mawsilli, a coldly logical historian. International media picked up on Mosul Eye from the first days, starting with an online question-and-answer with a German newspaper. The anonymous writer gave periodic written interviews in English over the years. Sometimes, journalists quoted his blog and called it an interview. In October 2016, he spoke by phone with the New Yorker for a profile , but still kept his identity masked. Intelligence agencies made contact as well and he rebuffed them each time. \"I am not a spy or a journalist,'' he would say. ``I tell them this: If you want the information, it's published and it's public for free. Take it.'' First the Islamic State group compiled lists of women accused of prostitution, he said, stoning or shooting around 500 in the initial months. Then it went after men accused of being gay, flinging them off tall buildings. Shiites, Christians and Yazidis fled from a city once proud of its multiple religious. When the only Mosul residents left were fellow Sunnis, they too were not spared, according to the catalog of horrors that is Mosul Eye's daily report. He detailed the deaths and whippings, for spying and apostasy, for failing to attend prayers, for overdue taxes. The blog attracted the attention of the fanatics, who posted death threats in the comments section. Less than a year into their rule, in March 2015, he nearly cracked. IS executed a 14-year-old in front of a crowd; 12 people were arrested for selling and smoking cigarettes, and some of them flogged publicly. Seeing few alternatives, young men from Mosul were joining up by the dozens. The sight of a fanatic severing the hand of a child accused of stealing unmoored him. The man told the boy that his hand was a gift of repentance to God before serenely slicing it away. It was too much. Mosul Eye was done. He defied the dress requirements, cut his hair short, shaved his beard and pulled on a bright red crewneck sweater. He persuaded his closest friend to join him. \"I decided to die.'' The sun shining, they drove to the banks of the Tigris blasting forbidden music from the car. They spread a scrap of rug over a stone outcropping and shared a carafe of tea. Mosul Eye lit a cigarette, heedless of a handful of other people picnicking nearby. \"I was so tired of worrying about myself, my family, my brothers. I am not alive to worry, but I am alive to live this life. I thought: I am done.'' He planned it as a sort of last supper, a final joyful day to end all days. He assumed he would be spotted, arrested, tortured. The tea was the best he had ever tasted. Somehow, incredibly, his crimes went unnoticed. He went home. \"At that moment I felt like I was given a new life.'' He grew out his hair and beard again, put the shortened trousers back on. And, for the remainder of his time in Mosul, smoked and listened to music in his room with the curtains drawn and the lights off. His computer screen and the tip of his cigarette glowed as he wrote in the dark. The next month, he slipped up. His friend the ex-taxi driver told him about an airstrike that had just killed multiple high-level Islamic State commanders, destroying a giant weapons cache. Elated, Mosul Eye dashed home to post it online. He hit \"publish'' and then, minutes later, realized his mistake. The information could have come from only one person. He trashed the post and spent a sleepless night. \"It's like a death game and one mistake could finish your life.'' For a week, he went dark. Then he invited his friend to meet at a restaurant. They ate spicy chicken, an unemployed teacher and the gun-toting ex-taxi driver talking again about their city and their lives. His cover was not blown. The historian went back online. Alongside the blog, he kept meticulous records _ information too dangerous to share. His computer hard drive filled with death, filed according to date, cause of death, perpetrator, neighborhood and ethnicity. Accompanying each spreadsheet entry was a separate file with observations from each day. \"ISIS is forcing abortions and tubal ligation surgeries on Yazidi women,'' he wrote in unpublished notes from January 2015. A doctor told him there had been between 50 and 60 forced abortions and a dozen Yazidi girls younger than 15 died of injuries from repeated rapes. April 19, 2015: \"The forensics department received the bodies of 23 ISIS militants killed in Baiji (Northern Iraq). They had no shrapnel, no bullets, no explosives and the cause of death does not seem to be explosion. It is like nothing happened to the bodies. A medical source believes they were exposed to poison gas.'' July 7, 2015: \"43 citizens were executed in different places, this time by gunfire, which is unusual because they were previously beheadings. A source inside ISIS said that 13 of those who were executed are fighters and they tried to flee ..'' He noted a flurry of security on days when the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, seemed to be in town. Many in Iraq, especially those who supported the Shiite-dominated leadership in Baghdad, blamed Mosul for its own fate. Mosul Eye freely acknowledged that some residents at first believed the new conquerors could only be an improvement over the heavy-handed government and the soldiers who fled with hardly a backward glance at the city they were supposed to defend. But he also wrote publicly and privately _ of the suffering among citizens who refused to join the group. He was fighting on two fronts: \"One against ISIS, and the other against the rumors. Trying to protect the face of Mosul, the soul of Mosul.'' He tested out different voices, implying one day that he was Christian, another that he was Muslim. Sometimes he indicated he was gone, other times that he was still in the city. \"I couldn't trust anyone,'' he said. In his mind, he left Mosul a thousand times, but always found reasons to stay: his mother, his nieces and nephews, his mission. But finally, he had to go. \"I had to run away with the proof that will protect Mosul for years to come, and to at least be loyal to the people who were killed in the city.'' And he did not want to become another casualty of the monsters. \"I think I deserve life, deserve to be alive.'' A smuggler, persuaded by $1,000 and the assurances of a mutual acquaintance, agreed to get him out. He was leaving the next day. Mosul Eye had no time to reflect, no time to change his mind. He returned home and began transferring the contents of his computer to the hard drive. He pulled out the orange notebook with the hand-drawn map of Mosul on the cover and the outlines of what he hoped would one day be his doctoral dissertation. Into the bag went \"Father Bombo's Pilgrimage to Mecca,'' an obscure American satirical novel from 1770 that he had ordered from Amazon via a new shop that was the only place in town to order from abroad online. It was time to leave. He wanted to make sure his mother would never have to watch the capture and killing of Mosul Eye. On Dec. 15, 2015 he left Mosul, driving with the smuggler to the outskirts of Raqqa, a pickup point that alarmed him. From there he and other Iraqis and Syrians were picked up by a second set of smugglers and driven by convoy to Turkey. They had no trouble crossing the border. In Turkey, Mosul Eye kept at it: via WhatsApp and Viber, from Facebook messages and long conversations with friends and relatives who had contacts within IS. From hundreds of kilometers away, his life remained consumed by events in Mosul. By mid-2016, deaths were piling up faster than he could document. The IS and airstrikes were taking a bloody toll on residents. His records grew haphazard, and he turned to Twitter to document the atrocities. In February 2017, he received asylum in Europe with the aid of an organization that learned his backstory. He continued to track the airstrikes and Islamic State killings. He mapped the airstrikes as they closed in on his family, pleading with his older brother to leave his home in West Mosul. Ahmed, 36, died days later when shrapnel from a mortar strike pierced his heart, leaving behind four young children. It was only then that Mosul Eye revealed his secret to a younger brother _ who was proud to learn the anonymous historian he had been reading for so long was his brother. \"People in Mosul had lost hope and confidence in politicians, in everything,'' his brother said. Mosul Eye ``managed to show that it's possible to change the situation in the city and bring it back to life.'' As the Old City crumbled, Mosul Eye sent coordinates and phone numbers for homes filled with civilians to a BBC journalist who was covering the battle, trying to get the attention of someone in the coalition command. He believes he saved lives. Then, with his beloved Old City destroyed, Mosul Eye launched a fundraiser to rebuild the city's libraries because the extremists had burned all the books. None of his volunteers knew his identity. An activist who helped co-found a `Women of Mosul' Facebook group with Mosul Eye describes him as a \"spiritual leader'' for the city's secular-minded. \"He was telling us about the day-to-day events under ISIS and we were following closely with excitement as if we were watching a movie. Sometimes he went through hard times and we used to encourage him. He won the people's trust and we became very curious to know his real personality,'' said the activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she believed she was still in danger. From a distance, finally writing his dissertation on 19th century Mosul history in the safety of a European city, he continued to write as Mosul Eye and organize cultural events and fundraisers from afar _ even after Mosul was liberated. The double life consumed him, sapped energy he'd rather use for the doctoral dissertation and for helping Mosul rebuild. And it hurt when someone asked the young Iraqi why he didn't do more to help his people. He desperately wanted his mother to know all that he had done. He felt barely real, with so many people knowing him by false identities: 293,000 followers on Facebook, 37,000 on WordPress and 23,400 on Twitter. In hours of conversation with The Associated Press, he agonized over when and how to end the anonymity that plagued him. He did not want to be a virtual character anymore.

I took a couple of days to jet off to Odisha and explore tropical vibes. It had been a while since I traveled anywhere, so I was excited to go for a little getaway.  Odisha ( formerly known as Orissa) is a state located on the eastern coast of India, with a coastline of about 485km. So yes, the state is home to exotic beaches too, along with significant shrines, amazing forts, vibrant culture and breathtaking architecture.We got super lucky with seeing one of the most beautiful pink skies I\u2019ve ever seen. This marvelous sunset definitely made my evening so much better in the Puri beach. Below is a little visual film that I made for this amazing trip. Hope you enjoy it!

Fans are excited to find out that their favorite game will include 50 new creatures. Furthermore, game developers will also incorporate outside weather conditions. On December 6th, Niantic, the game developer, has announced that Pokemon characters from Pokemon Sapphire and Pokemon Ruby will become part of the mobile game.\nNiantic launched the game in 2016. Pokemon Go has become so famous because it has incorporated augmented reality technology. The game allows players to use their smartphones to search for Pokemon characters in the physical world. Hence, they need to start a race to gather as many Pokemon as possible. The list of the new Pokemon also includes Mudkip, Torchic, and Treecko.\nThe exquisite update for Pokemon Go will blow your mind However, the most important addition is not about adding new characters, but the incorporation of real-world weather. Niantic indicates that when the forecast indicates rainy weather, players could spot the fun characters \u201csplashing around\u201d. Furthermore, real-world weather conditions will also influence players\u2019 ability to cast particular magic attacks. For instance, if the weather is rainy, then you will not be likely to cast a spell like Charizard\u2019s Fire Spin. That spell will be more effective when sunny.\nThe fact that Niantic decided to incorporate the real-life weather into Pokemon Go\u2019s gameplay demonstrates that game developers continue to push boundaries even more. The use of augmented reality takes a new turn. Game developers update this app periodically, implementing new augmented reality features. These features have boosted the popularity of the game.\nSumming up The exquisite update will help you find out the weather, establishing what spells you will be able to cast. Furthermore, you can also chase new characters, being brought from previous Pokemon games. The new update will bring 50 characters from Pokemon Sapphire and Pokemon Ruby.\nImage Source: Pokemon GO \nThe post Fans Are Thrilled: Pokemon Go Gets an Exquisite Update appeared first on The Next Digit .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mudkip", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pokemon sapphire", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "niantic", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:41.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4618d27cf657c407d2451bceee19da2cfb3bcf64", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYkgRLTDQR4Wl5ANP3J6CgtzIv312HjvjRtZEqTkEuRY.dUfdoXB6gCTqXWsFxwBXngjqTNAln2ofxeOop4Gn_2fg--", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Toymaker Lego wins Chinese copyright case against brick imitators", "title_full": "Toymaker Lego wins Chinese copyright case against brick imitators", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.999, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/irLagMRlGdDl_6CtJG3e2A--~B/aD01MzM7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/images/US_AHTTP_REUTERS_OLUSBUS_WRAPPER_H_LIVE_NEW/2017-12-07T095832Z_1_LYNXMPEDB60OY_RTROPTP_3_LEGO-RESULTS_original.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 15, "comments": 0, "shares": 15}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4618d27cf657c407d2451bceee19da2cfb3bcf64", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYkgRLTDQR4Wl5ANP3J6CgtzIv312HjvjRtZEqTkEuRY.dUfdoXB6gCTqXWsFxwBXngjqTNAln2ofxeOop4Gn_2fg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Toymaker Lego wins Chinese copyright case against brick imitators", "text": "Tweet Share Sets of Lego bricks are seen at a toy store in Bonn, Germany, September 5, 2017. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay More COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Lego has won a landmark case in China against two companies that manufactured and sold toys almost identical to its LEGO Friends range but branded Bela, the Danish toymaker said. It is the first time that Lego has succeeded in a copyright competition case in China, where copies of its colorful bricks and figures have been a recurrent problem as it seeks to gain share in the $31 billion toys and games market. Earlier this year, the Beijing Higher Court passed a ruling that recognized the Lego logo and name in Chinese as 'well-known' trademarks in China, putting the toymaker in a better position to act against infringement of its trademarks. The China Shantou Intermediate People's Court had ruled that \"certain Bela products infringed upon the copyrights of the Lego Group and that manufacturing and selling of those products constituted acts of unfair competition\", Lego said in a statement on Thursday. The court also decided that Lego is protected under Chinese \"anti-unfair competition law\" for \"the distinctive and unique appearance of certain decorative aspects of its packaging across particular product lines (in this case, LEGO Friends)\" Capturing the imaginations of Chinese children with its bricks is key to reviving growth for the unlisted company after disappointing revenues in its core U.S. and European markets has brought an end to a decade-long sales boom. Lego, whose name is derived from the Danish \"leg godt\" meaning \"play well\", is competing with Barbie maker Mattel Inc (MAT.O) and Hasbro (HAS.O), the firm behind My Little Pony, for a slice of the Chinese market. The case was filed against two Chinese companies, which had been manufacturing and selling Bela products that were almost identical to Lego's. They will now have to stop copying Lego's packaging and logos, it said. \"We think this is very important for the continued development of a favorable business environment for all companies operating in the Chinese market,\" Lego's vice president of legal affairs, Peter Thorslund Kjaer said.

His case garnered national media attention after an October Facebook post by his mother Deirdre detailing her son\u2019s ordeal went viral. Liam\u2019s heartbreaking story has been covered by local TV stations, and even \"Good Morning America\" last month. \nLiam returned to his Garden City, Long Island home the day after Thanksgiving, after spending more than two months receiving intensive treatment in New Jersey. Deirdre O\u2019Brien told our sister publication the Irish Voice that the family \u2013 Liam\u2019s four siblings and his father, Keith \u2013 is thrilled to have him home, but progress is coming slowly. \n\u201cWe\u2019re taking baby steps, taking it day by day. There\u2019s still a long road ahead,\u201d said O\u2019Brien, a nurse at Memorial Sloan Kettering in Manhattan. \nLiam has not returned to eighth grade at Garden City Middle School, where he was harassed on a daily basis during seventh grade by some soccer teammates who belittled his skills and his looks. He also endured physical assaults, including having his face shoved into a gym locker on his 13th birthday in September. 5 Liam O\u2019Brien with the jockeys at Aqueduct Racetrack on Saturday. \nLiam is spending his days in therapy and receiving tutoring. The O\u2019Briens are enormously grateful for the good wishes he has received. Liam Neeson, one of Liam\u2019s favorite actors, called the family twice to offer his support, and the New York Jets hosted the O\u2019Briens at Sunday\u2019s game against Kansas City in MetLife Stadium. \n\u201cLiam Neeson was so nice and supportive. And our Liam was so excited to hear about the calls because he loves his movies. You could tell he genuinely cared about Liam\u2019s story,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. 5 Still of Liam Neeson in Taken. \nThe Jets day out was organized by a Garden City friend who works for the National Football League. The team was happy to host the O\u2019Briens on Sunday, and even gave the family two field passes so that Liam and his dad could meet his favorite player, Matt Forte. MetLife also lit one of its billboards with an anti-bullying message. \n\u201cIt was like having the old Liam back on Sunday, he was so happy and excited,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cThe players huddled with him and encouraged him. I can\u2019t say enough about them.\u201d 5 Big fan of the Jets! Liam O'Brien. \nLast Saturday was especially meaningful for the O\u2019Briens. The New York Racing Association honored Liam by offering the second race on the card at Aqueduct Racetrack in his honor, and all the jockeys riding on the day wore orange bands to support anti-bullying efforts. \nThe day was spearheaded by Liam\u2019s uncle, jockey John Velazquez, the Hall of Famer whose storied career includes two Kentucky Derby wins and 15 Breeders\u2019 Cup championships. Velazquez is married to Leona O\u2019Brien, sister of Keith. The Dublin-born trainer Leo O\u2019Brien is Liam\u2019s grandfather, and dozens of friends and family members were on hand in the winner\u2019s circle after the second race, holding a #WeStandWithLiam banner. \n\u201cThere was a presentation organized for Liam and all the jockeys took part. They gave him great support. It was so nice to see,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \nThe support is greatly needed as Liam is far from his old self. He says he doesn\u2019t want to play soccer again because of the teammates who tormented him. Liam was always a standout athlete and Deirdre O\u2019Brien is deeply saddened that her son no longer wants take part in a sport he\u2019s loved for years. \nAs far as school goes, it\u2019s uncertain if he will return to Garden City Middle School come January, or switch to somewhere else. As of now he has no desire to go back because \u201che\u2019s still afraid,\u201d his mother says. Should he eventually decide to head back to Garden City, the O\u2019Briens would be fully supportive. \n\u201cHe\u2019s not there yet. I\u2019ve tried to explain to him that it would be great for him to go back to Garden City and show how strong he is, but we don\u2019t want to push him. Maybe in a few weeks he will feel better. Right now we\u2019re just happy that he\u2019s back home.\u201d \nLiam has been uplifted by all the support from family, friends and the media. \u201cHe really has,\u201d O\u2019Brien says. \u201cI keep telling him how many supporters all over the place he has, and how he will hopefully be able to show the kids who bullied him that he\u2019s much stronger than they are.\u201d \nKeith and Deirdre O\u2019Brien noticed changes in their son during seventh grade, after he made the middle school\u2019s soccer team. Liam brushed off their concerns, but his lack of appetite and rapid weight loss this past summer told a different story. He finally shared his anguish with his parents a few days after he turned 13 in September, telling them about the daily harassment. 5 Liam O'Brien. \nLiam\u2019s appetite at that point was virtually non-existent. He was checked into a local hospital where a feeding tube was inserted to boost his nutrition and was then moved to New Jersey for more intensive treatment. \nThe O\u2019Briens alerted the Garden City School District about the bullying and physical abuse, but the district, after an investigation, said there was no evidence to support their claims. After Deirdre O\u2019Brien\u2019s Facebook post gained media traction the district issued a statement which said in part, \"We are jointly attempting to further improve upon the resources and programs available to move toward the elimination of all forms of bullying in our schools as quickly as possible.\u201d \nThe O\u2019Briens filed a notice of claim against the district with intent to sue.

Below is what he posted\u2026 \nI live around Yaba area of Lagos. From Sabo down to Iwaya, you see boreholes donated by Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, MFM. \nMany months ago, I was working on a report and I needed to carry out some laboratory tests. When I got to University of Lagos\u2019 Chemical Engineering lab, I was directed to the university\u2019s central lab which I gathered is the largest and most equipped. Entering, I saw that the lab was donated by Daniel Olukoya, founder of MFM who is actually an alumnus of the school. \n\nAs much as the leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, embarrasses itself on the pages of newspaper, CAN runs one of the largest displaced persons camps in the northeast. For three years that I have been mobilizing relief materials for displaced persons in the northeast, aside individuals and a few NGOs, Christian organizations have been a larger donor of relief materials. My phone would ring, and the caller goes, \u201cI am Pastor JJ. We have bags of cloths, please how do we get these to the displaced persons in the northeast?\u201d \nCharis Family Church, in 2015, opened its facility as a collection center for relief materials. The pastor, Bayo Adeyinka, and a team raised almost a million naira to sort logistics. \nJust yesterday, another pastor whose church\u2019s team once gave me bags of relief materials for IDPs, told me they have 33k left in the account, and he asked what this can sort for the IDPs. He also wants us to meet this week so he can drop with me, bags of relief materials. \nA man reached out to me many months ago. He needed information on how he can move 1000 cartons of flour (or wheat?) from Lagos to any of the IDPs camps in the northeast. I did a check on the man, he is a pastor. \nIn Lagos here, the Catholic Mission and a couple of other missionary hospitals are always on medical outreach to the IDPs. \nI understand there is an ongoing debate on whether or not paying tithe is a Christian practice. Sincerely, those arguing against come with strong points. And sadly, responses from Daddy GO and others are so weak, far from convincing. \nGet it right, it is the duty of Lagos Water Board to provide water for Lagosians, but MFM now shares in this responsibility. It is the duty of NEMA and the Refugees\u2019 Commission to attend to the victims of insurgency, but CAN and a couple of other Christian organizations share largely in this. \nSo, above all, if I am paying tithe or giving church my money, I do so because of some of these things I have mentioned in this post \nWell here\u2019s another Angle \u2026\u2026 \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "femi owolabi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "femi owolabi owolabi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iwaya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bayo adeyinka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel olukoya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sabo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lagos water board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of lagos\u2019 chemical engineering", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mfm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christian association of nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic mission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charis family church", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "refugees\u2019 commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nema", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lagos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yaba", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:41.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d5548d2b143f1df662595eacdc976778ce513a50", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9qnDRWylZ5xsAEx5xJikcxqizE63kJ4QOQzpy_izuhr9J4EvN8NAgIS.2hu72uShiEJDNVD.X4vZxJX5X1P3AYl9DxCD5OKZ2K_ye_vAJkoubqAPAbsvpkSiFVJdmdofDnBnxTZAkRDQ--", "site_full": "www.theage.com.au", "site": "theage.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.theage.com.au/rssheadlines/education/article/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "TheAge RSS News Headlines", "title": "Ross Edwards' canoe finally makes landfall", "title_full": "Ross Edwards' canoe finally makes landfall", "published": "2017-12-08T04:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.theage.com.au/content/dam/images/h/0/0/r/p/9/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.h00rr5.png/1512641231656.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d5548d2b143f1df662595eacdc976778ce513a50", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9qnDRWylZ5xsAEx5xJikcxqizE63kJ4QOQzpy_izuhr9J4EvN8NAgIS.2hu72uShiEJDNVD.X4vZxJX5X1P3AYl9DxCD5OKZ2K_ye_vAJkoubqAPAbsvpkSiFVJdmdofDnBnxTZAkRDQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nick Galvin", "published": "2017-12-08T04:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "Ross Edwards' canoe finally makes landfall", "text": "It was in 2000 that celebrated Australian composer Ross Edwards first metaphorically launched the canoe that inspired Emerald Crossing , a work for piano quartet.\nCommissioned by the now defunct Perth-based Australian Piano Quartet, Emerald Crossing was inspired by a \"waking dream\".\nSHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Ross Edwards: Prefers to let the music do the talking.  Photo: Christopher Pearce \"A canoe was being propelled slowly across calm green water, possibly a lagoon, towards an island,\" explains Edwards. \"No doubt symbolic at a deep level, I had the feeling that the journey was ceremonial \u2013 that a ritual was being enacted, and that the point of arrival would hold special significance.\"\nAnd now, more than 17 years later, that elegant canoe has finally reached its destination with the completion of a second, companion movement to Emerald Crossing entitled Sea Star Dances .\n\"The second movement celebrates landfall in a series of dance episodes,\" says Edwards.\nSea Star Dances was commissioned by the very much alive Australia Piano Quartet and the University of Technology, Sydney, as part of an education program called MusEd.\nAdvertisement It will be played on Sunday in a program that also includes work by Schubert and Shostakovich.\nHowever, that performance will not technically be a world premiere as Sea Star Dances , which is designed to integrate easily into HSC programs, was first played in October to an audience of high school music students.\nYou will now receive updates from Entertainment Newsletter Entertainment Newsletter Get the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy . \nOn that occasion Edwards recounted his own musical journey, telling the youngsters about his lifelong fascination with nature and the Australian bush and how the natural world saved him in the early 1970s from \"composer's block\".\n\"It was the most paralysing thing that I have ever experienced,\" he says.\nIn particular he was disillusioned by trends at the time in Europe.\n\"I couldn't relate to any European music,\" he says. \"I had nothing against it, it was just that it just didn't make sense. What was going on in Europe at the time \u2026 was pretty ugly stuff.
