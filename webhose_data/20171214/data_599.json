He has got $100 million in the bank.\n\"It's tough to get punched in the face every day when you've got $100million.\"\nMcGregor has however insisted that he would win a rematch should he and 50-0 Mayweather ever get back in the ring.\nMcGregor and Mayweather go at it in Las Vegas (Image: Getty Images North America) The American is once more retired having snapped a two-year ring absence to take on the Irishman, and this week claimed that he 'carried' McGregor through 10 rounds before the fight was stopped.\nAccording to McGregor, Mayweather's ability to adjust in the ring took him by surprise - but he believes changes in a training camp would see him take victory second time round.\n\u201cIf it happened in a rematch, it\u2019s a simple adjustment of me having a heavier sparring partner coming in, in the later rounds, and lean on me and walk me down,\" said McGregor, as reported by Boxing Scene.\n\"Where as in my sparring in the lead up to the camp, we were always against fast, twitchy, light on their toes opponent with a Philly shell style and their backs against the ropes. Never against forward pressure because he\u2019s never fought like that so it took us by surprise and I got beat.\n\u201cIf I had a rematch, I would correct that and I would beat him. He\u2019s retired. I\u2019m not going to start calling him out of retirement. I\u2019m going to leave him to it.

Cement Limited traded in a close range. J.K. Cement Limited     43,453   632.7 and high of 1196. Indian Economy\u2019s 2 Giants \nThe Indian stock market is one of the fastest growing equity markets in the world today. While it currently makes up only 12% to 14% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP)\u2019 far from the 70% corporate sector making up the entire GDP of the US, India\u2019s corporate sector is rampantly thriving to become one of Asia\u2019s leaders. \nAs of this month, nearly 8,000 companies are listed on the Indian equity market. More than half of these are listed on the two main stock exchanges in India combined\u2019 the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE), representing about 4% of the country\u2019s GDP. \nRegular session on both the BSE and the MSE starts at 9:15 a.m. and concludes at 3:30 p.m. The BSE \nThe BSE, having been established in 1875, is the first stock exchange in Asia. It is also the first to acquire a permanent recognition under India\u2019s Securities Contract Regulation Act of 1956. \nPresently, the BSE is the 11th biggest stock exchange in the world with a total market capitalization of $1.70 trillion as of January 23, 2015. Moreover, it is also considered as one of the fastest stock exchanges in the world with a speed of six microseconds. \nThe BSE first touched its four-digit figure on July 25, 1990; the 5,000 mark on October 11, 1999; the 10,000 mark on February 6, 2006; the 20,000 mark on December 11, 2007; and the 30,000 mark on March 4, 2015, an event that was driven by the efforts of the Reserve Bank of India. J.K. Cement Limited is a stock traded on the Indian stock exchange. \nThe biggest declines on the BSE happened during the onslaught of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and when the Chinese central bank had suddenly moved to devalue the yuan. On January 21 and 22, 2008, the BSE has lost more than 2,000 points while on August 24, 2015, it has dropped over 1,700 points. \nThe SENSEX 30 is the free-float index that measures the 30 most active stocks on the BSE. It weighs stocks based on liquidity, market capitalization, floating-stock-adjustment depth, and other factors. The NSE \nThe NSE was founded in 1992 as the 1st demutualized electronic stock exchange in the country. Presently, it supports about 230,000 terminals throughout India. The NSE is owned and operated by the Indian Index Services and Products (IISP). \nThe NIFTY is the index that measures the 50 most active stocks across 24 industries on the NSE. Consequently, it covers a broader portion of India\u2019s corporate sector than the SENSEX 30. J.K. Cement Limited has relatively good liquidity. \nThe NIFTY has a base value of 1,000 and its base date is 1995. Like the SENSEX 30, it comprehensively weighs stocks based on liquidity, market capitalization, among others. \nInvesting in BSE and NSE stocks is strongly recommended for investors today. As the Indian economy continues to grow and become one of Asia\u2019s biggest, it only makes sense to start betting on its equity market as early as now. Professional analysts might be interested how this will affect J.K. Cement Limited. \nMore news for J.K. Cement Limited (NSE:JKCEMENT) were recently published by: Economictimes.Indiatimes.com, which released: \u201cBuy JK Cement, target Rs 1175: ICICI Direct\u201d on November 15, 2017.

(AP Photo/Adel Hana) Adel Hana \nJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the fallout from President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital (all times local): \n11:35 a.m. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says President Donald Trump \"bound himself forever\" to the history of Jerusalem by recognizing the city as Israel's capital. \nNetanyahu claimed other states are considering following the U.S. lead and recognizing Jerusalem. He spoke on Thursday at the Foreign Ministry. \nNetanyahu says that \"we are already in contact with other states that will make a similar recognition.\" \nHe says the \"time has come\" and expressed confidence that others will follow suit and move their embassies to Jerusalem. \nMeanwhile, the Israeli military said it will be deploying additional troops to the West Bank ahead of Friday, when mass Palestinian protests are anticipated in response to Trump's move. \nThe army statement on Thursday says it will deploy several battalions to the territory while other troops have been put on alert to address \"possible developments.\" \nPalestinians went on strike across the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip on Thursday and protests are expected on Friday after midday prayers. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n11:25 a.m. \nThe top leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas is calling for a new uprising against Israel in the wake of President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nIsmail Haniyeh spoke to his followers in the Gaza Strip on Thursday and called the U.S. decision an \"aggression on our people and a war on our sanctuaries.\" \nHe says the uprising should begin Friday, the Muslim holy day. \nHaniyeh then added: \"We want the uprising to last and continue to let Trump and the occupation regret this decision.\" \nHamas killed hundreds of Israelis during an armed uprising in the early 2000s. But Hamas' ability to carry out attacks is more limited. Israel has imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip, and many of Hamas' supporters in the West Bank have been arrested. \nEven so, Hamas possesses a large arsenal of rockets in Gaza capable of striking many areas in Israel. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n10:30 a.m. \nSaudi Arabia's royal court, led by King Salman and his powerful son, are condemning the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nIt's a rare public rebuke by the royal court of U.S. ally and President Donald Trump. \nSaudi Arabia, a regional powerhouse that could help the White House push through a Middle East settlement, said on Thursday the kingdom had already warned against this step and \"continues to express its deep regret at the U.S. administration's decision,\" describing it \"unjustified and irresponsible.\" \nTrump's move puts the Sunni nation in a bind. The kingdom, particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. \nU.S. Embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa have warned American citizens of possible protests as a result of Trump's decision. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n9:40 a.m. \nSchools and shops are closed in the West Bank, as Palestinians are protesting President Donald Trump's recognition of contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nPolitical groups have called for protest marches in West Bank town centers at noon on Thursday. \nTrump's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. \nThe Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. In recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Trump was seen as siding with Israel which claims the entire city. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n9:30 a.m. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is accusing his American counterpart of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" by declaring the divided holy city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nErdogan also compared President Donald Trump to a \"blender\" that is stirring up trouble in the region. \nThe Turkish leader said, addressing Trump: \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it.\" \nErdogan added that \"political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace.\" \nHe also said: \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right,' he is mistaken.\" \nErdogan spoke to a group of workers on Thursday who had gathered at Ankara's airport, before he departed for an official visit to Greece. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n8:50 a.m. \nPalestinians, Israelis and the wider Middle East are bracing for the fallout after President Donald Trump's seismic shift in recognizing the bitterly contested Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was to travel to Jordan on Thursday to meet with King Abdullah II. The monarch is seen as Abbas' closest Arab ally, and the two leaders might try to coordinate a response to Trump's policy change. \nIn Wednesday's move, Trump defied worldwide warnings and insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, describing his decision as merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. \nTrump also said the United States would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable for that. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Despite its widely utilization, there seems to be a great variability in their organization, clinical practice, and safety among centers.Aim of the studyTo obtain updated information on clinical practice in different perioperative areas of the CRS-HIPEC.Patients and MethodsAll 25 members of the Spanish Surface Peritoneal Malignancy (GECOP), were invited to answer an online survey, to describe their usual practice in different perioperative areas of the CRS-HIPEC.ResultsSurvey was responded by 100% of centers. This study represents more than 800 patients treated annually. Seventy per cent of respondents perform CRS-HIPEC for more than 5 years. The most frequent technique was Coliseum (88%). Routinely non-invasive monitoring of cardiac output is used by 92% of centers. More than 50% of centers administer oxaliplatin (74%), or mitomycin-C (65%) in colorectal cancer; cisplatin in gastric cancer (73%) and mesothelioma (74%). Ovarian cancer is treated with cisplatin and various combinations, in 64%. Spillage protocol was available in 100% centers.ConclusionsData showed an important variability in volume of patients per center, selection of cytostatic agents, professional training and safety measures applied. The standardization of CRS/HIPEC procedures based on the best available evidence, the individualization of patients and the consensus among professionals, constitute an important part of the basis that will allow us to improve results of this complex procedure.\n\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2zXYANl\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "neus esteve-p\u00e9rez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pedro cascales-campos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rafael morales-soriano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juan jos\u00e9 segura-sampedro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pedro barrios", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "european journal of surgical oncology aut", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:59.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6eb43b8bcdf3dfd3eccb162fad7f95973083ba7f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU46RXCtAcM6LmPbP9kyp1oRXX_68B7p.U7UIA4ox8vawz2A7pjqq0DLQu5W9s_tU1R7iVZWj3XHCjQ--", "site_full": "lonestarboars.com", "site": "lonestarboars.com", "site_section": "http://lonestarboars.com/forums/6-8spc.58/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "6.8SPC | Lone Star Boars", "title": "6.8 spc Gold dot on sale", "title_full": "6.8 spc Gold dot on sale | Lone Star Boars", "published": "2017-11-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9746e9a5576ef85eecbe0a380ae98fa35556696e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU46RXCtAcM6LmPbP9kyp1oRXX_68B7p.U7UIA4ox8vawz2A7pjqq0DLQu5W9s_tU1R4Unz_dWywNJVgwabwsSBtf", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "FrankT", "published": "2017-11-29T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "got mine for $9 years ago, still a good price for the brass and target ammo...lol", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:59.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "95ad662c0d23ee218ef357d2b68a2f485ad9f9b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTtDTMGU_6v2V44R4UuLnBtjcuaQANCxyGKeY.wXNY4Yes5COfaXQdhpAFxXAzYPKPbwJnaFO8jO5301eIuUTeCoP4aQhvDs1XABgu9c4wSxuibGiDv9EK1rvvhur.K9_z2dOb6lSxx.giu_VgEU_V_blXQn6och6U_WAQuyGxadMVLYVrZS8mRpVhdczFmzHI-", "site_full": "h30434.www3.hp.com", "site": "hp.com", "site_section": "https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/HP-Connected-Mobile-Printing-and-Cloud-Printing/bd-p/Photo", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "HP Connected, Mobile Printing and Cloud Printing - HP Support Forum", "title": "Officejet 250 not printing on BT hub, but okay on other rou... 6452780", "title_full": "Officejet 250 not printing on BT hub, but okay on other rou... - HP Support Forum - 6452780", "published": "2017-12-07T00:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://h30434.www3.hp.com/html/assets/fb_large.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 316, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d8394c11329cd2b9e7a22b03f9b3d9d17d850de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTtDTMGU_6v2V44R4UuLnBtjcuaQANCxyGKeY.wXNY4Yes5COfaXQdhpAFxXAzYPKPbwJnaFO8jO5301eIuUTeCoP4aQhvDs1XABgu9c4wSxuibGiDv9EK1rvvhur.K9_z2dOb6lSxx.giu_VgEU_V_blXQn6och6U_WAQuyGxadMVLYVrZS8mRzc7sBDZvOlOCqic7bwTziQ--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "robmar0se", "published": "2017-12-07T01:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Actually the BT hub is dual frequency - as is common with dual band routers , they will receive/transmit on both frequencies simultaneously.

This would mean the current system of auto-enrolment would be extended and gig companies would be required to contribute to the pensions of those working for them. The calculation is based on the minimum auto-enrolment contribution from the gig company , which in the long term is 3 per cent of applicable salary \u2013 and would be higher if the Government elected to remove salary band restrictions in its review of auto-enrolment. \nThe findings follow the announcement last week from The Work and Pensions Select Committee and the Business Select Committee that a draft Bill has been drawn up which would make \u2018gig\u2019 companies pay holiday and sick pay, realising that the labour market is \u201cnot working for everyone\u201d. Earlier this year, the Government-commissioned review of employment practice led by Matthew Taylor, recommended a new status for gig workers as \u2018dependent contractors\u2019, an alternative worker status that would require gig companies to treat those who worked for them as employees. It also proposed enabling individuals to put aside 4 per cent of their income when completing tax returns, an alternative form of auto-enrolment that would encompass more people. \nThe \u2018Restless Worklife\u2019 study with Zurich and the PPI therefore tested two possible policy changes: the first, if gig workers could be auto-enrolled into a workplace pension as per the current system and the second, the 4 per cent contribution through self-assessment recommendation. \nThe study found that this typical worker earning \u00a325,000 could end up with a final pension pot of \u00a377,600 if he/she had been auto-enrolled into a workplace pension which, when added to the State Pension, could give him/her an income per year of \u00a313,600 at retirement. \nIf the Taylor review recommendation of enabling individuals to put aside 4 per cent of their income when completing tax returns was applied, a typical worker could end up with a final pension pot of \u00a375,600 at retirement. When combined with the State Pension, this would equate to an income at retirement of \u00a313,500. This approach would be more beneficial to those who are self-employed in the true sense of the word and have no access to an employer of any kind. \nChris Atkinson at Zurich UK, said: \u201cEmployment law is lagging far behind advances in working practices, which is leaving some people in the gig economy at risk of being denied basic rights. Clearly defining the status of gig workers will ensure that those who should rightly be defined as employees do not miss out on valuable workplace benefits, including the opportunity to save into a company pension. That said, there are still millions of gig workers who have no access to a workplace pension because they are self-employed in the truest sense of the word. For that reason, the Government should also extend auto-enrolment through the self-assessment tax process, to ensure nobody is excluded from the chance to build a nest egg for retirement.\u201d Sharing", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chris atkinson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taylor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew taylor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "state pension", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "business select committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ppi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pensions policy institute", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "zurich uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zurich", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:00.037+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "646f66a09f37f3fa31a3a127aa1bb741fff1e4f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAitI_xnYNWiAGivVjmFCbRMs-", "site_full": "groups.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://groups.google.com/a/googleproductforums.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=categories/gmail/android", "site_categories": ["business"], "section_title": "Gmail Help Forum - Google Product Forums", "title": "having trouble getting on one of my alternate accounts", "title_full": "having trouble getting on one of my alternate accounts - Google Product Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "http://www.google.com/images/icons/product/groups-128.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "646f66a09f37f3fa31a3a127aa1bb741fff1e4f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAitI_xnYNWiAGivVjmFCbRMs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "illadelph75", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "having trouble getting on one of my alternate accounts", "text": "I forgot my password to my alternate accounts, then I have extreme trouble remembering what it was, then when I try to do the \"account help\" and a type in the verification code checking one of my alternate accounts, it says that \"Google can't prove I am the owner of that account\"\nPL ASE\nH LP\nM", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:00.056+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "58e769beeeccb02a925bb9404cf5f78610e4bf8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm1bx_gY45j0EzepZTpWmC4K", "site_full": "www.ooyuz.com", "site": "ooyuz.com", "site_section": "http://www.ooyuz.com/newsanalysis?term=abrams", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "abrams News Results and Analysis |OOYUZ", "title": "Star Wars: Episode 9 is Likely to End the Skywalker Saga", "title_full": "Star Wars: Episode 9 is Likely to End the Skywalker Saga : Related Articles | OOYUZ", "published": "2017-11-29T15:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.017, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53324, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "58e769beeeccb02a925bb9404cf5f78610e4bf8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm1bx_gY45j0EzepZTpWmC4K", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "SlashFilm", "published": "2017-11-29T15:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "Star Wars: Episode 9 is Likely to End the Skywalker Saga", "text": "We\u2019re now less than a month away from the release of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, but as is often the case, we\u2019re looking even further ahead in the future of the Star Wars franchise and wondering what lies in store for us in a galaxy far, far away.

Despite the growing threat and lack of in-house expertise, only half of employers look for cybersecurity skills when recruiting new IT talent. \nIn fact, the lack of cybersecurity skills may be due to a wider skills gaps facing the UK tech industry. Nearly a third of tech employees said they felt they were insufficiently trained in coding, cybersecurity and cloud migration. The gaps in employees\u2019 skills is translating to the businesses they work for with 23 per cent saying their business is missing programming and cybersecurity skills. \nHowever, despite awareness around the risk of cybersecurity and the lack of preparedness, only 22 per cent of employers are currently training their existing staff in cybersecurity. \nThree-quarters of employers agree that universities should be responsible for making sure tech employees are equipped with the necessary skills the industry is currently lacking. However, of the graduates entering the tech industry, 38 per cent of tech employers believe they are lacking the necessary cybersecurity skills needed. \nOf the companies looking to recruit cybersecurity experts, 82 per cent are currently struggling to fill these roles, with 30 per cent believing this is due to an industry skills gap and 25 per cent saying it\u2019s down to being a competitive hiring market for people with these skills. How to address the cybersecurity skills gap? \nDominic Harvey, Director, CWJobs said: \u201cThe government has started taking steps to address the skills gap with plans to treble the number of computer science teachers in schools, introduce a national centre for computing, and boost digital skills with the provision of distance learning courses.\u201d \nIt is welcome news for tech employers. Prior to these measures being announced, CWJobs found that 65 per cent of employers thought the government had not invested enough in training the next generation of tech employees. \nEmployers are not shirking their responsibilities either, with only 55 per cent of those surveyed saying their company has its own training programme for entry-level employees, who are looking to be trained in a new area of their business, and 58 per cent of employers are retraining existing staff to address the skills gap. \nDominic Harvey, also added: \u201cIt\u2019s really encouraging to see the government listened to the concerns of the tech industry and responded by putting in plans to upskill the next generation of tech employees. This is not only important for the UK to keep pace globally, but so that businesses and organisations can be adequately prepared in the event of a cyber security attack, for instance. Now that we have a commitment from Government \u2013 and a clearer sense of where the skills are needed in areas like coding and cybersecurity \u2013 all parties can make a concerted effort to direct the new resources where they are needed most.\u201d Sharing", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cwjobs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dominic harvey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nhs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "equifax", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:00.078+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8fdffb56e282adb7819cc6512aa5bc3a51566824", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSv1D9ZbkQFmMQgnw2m4NktUNlqnXW.16ceGYAewrWQOsN7p3ipU3CXhg2RPu_y79oRtsOcoptOw1f.KX77GRclpP0iNHZrZNXyLPvA1SDBxXj.VQpc7p93gTe573kzSn9", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "popular links", "title": "After watching Shrek, Eleanor couldn't help but think she was committing an atrocity.

Fukrey took time to introduce characters, now the audience know more about us so this time it\u2019s ten notches up,\u201d he added. Trending Fukrey Returns also features Pulkit Samrat, Manjot Singh, Varun Sharma, Priya Anand, Richa Chadda, Vishakha Singh and Pankaj Tripathi. The film is scheduled to release on Friday. The team of Fukrey Returns on Wednesday sought blessings at the Golden Temple here before the Bollywood film\u2019s release on Friday.
