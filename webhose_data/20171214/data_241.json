X Doubts over Team USA\u2019s participation at Winter Olympics US ambassador to the UN says situation with North Korea has to be watched closely 31 minutes ago \nThe Alpensia Ski Jumping Center in PyeongChang. Photograph: Yonhap/EPA The presence of American athletes at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang is still \u201can open question\u201d because of the continued tensions in the region, according to the United States\u2019 ambassador to the United Nations. The relationship between the US and North Korea remains extremely tense, which could raise questions of how safe it is for Americans to compete in neighbouring South Korea in February. North Korea carried out an intercontinental ballistic missile test last week, with the US and South Korea conducting extensive military drills in response. Asked whether US athletes competing was a \u201cdone deal\u201d or was still an open question, Nikki Haley, the US representative to the UN, told Fox News: \u201cThere is an open question, but in the talks we have it\u2019s always about \u2018how do we protect the US citizens in the area?\u2019. So those are conversations that are happening daily. \u201cWe have to watch this closely and it\u2019s changing by the day. \u201cCertainly (the Games) are a perfect opportunity for them to go and do something they have all worked so hard for. What we will do is make sure we\u2019re taking every precaution possible to make sure they\u2019re safe and to make sure we know everything that\u2019s going on around them.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nikki haley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "team usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pyeongchang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pyeongchang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alpensia ski jumping center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:27.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f19e3e0056c8d6a80e8a0d795ba87377b5747d1c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpT10SbfbZ61EcDeCx6bZr1FURTq8MYGN2QOSLC4tfOaf7MNtq_e5lzhOTLD20TvIhsq7MPie0RaxmLIiEMhLNB65w42j6D6KbMcD79MqpNjAA--", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "https://www.hotukdeals.com/tag/audiovisual?page=5\n", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Audiovisual Deals \u21d2 Cheap price, best Sale in UK - HotUKDeals - page 5", "title": "Sennheiser Urbanite headphones \u00a349.99 - instore at HMV (High Wycombe)", "title_full": "Sennheiser Urbanite headphones \u00a349.99 - instore at HMV (High Wycombe) - HotUKDeals", "published": "2017-12-02T00:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.174, "main_image": "https://images.hotukdeals.com/threads/thread_full_screen/default/2845980_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1864, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f19e3e0056c8d6a80e8a0d795ba87377b5747d1c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpT10SbfbZ61EcDeCx6bZr1FURTq8MYGN2QOSLC4tfOaf7MNtq_e5lzhOTLD20TvIhsq7MPie0RaxmLIiEMhLNB65w42j6D6KbMcD79MqpNjAA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-02T00:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "Sennheiser Urbanite headphones \u00a349.99 - instore at HMV (High Wycombe)", "text": "Found 1st Dec Reduced to \u00a349.99 seems a good price for these in store at HMV High Wycombe", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https://www.hotukdeals.com/deals/sennheiser-urbanite-headphones-4999-instore-at-hmv-high-wycombe-2845980&title=Sennheiser%20Urbanite%20headphones%20%C2%A349.99%20-%20instore%20at%20HMV%20%28High%20Wycombe%29", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://www.hotukdeals.com/deals/sennheiser-urbanite-headphones-4999-instore-at-hmv-high-wycombe-2845980&text=Sennheiser%20Urbanite%20headphones%20%C2%A349.99%20-%20instore%20at%20HMV%20%28High%20Wycombe%29&via=HotUKDeals"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:27.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "136f1a693ad3b8e033a7cf47e186ce386e29dd3d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KvZtRHOQUvzzuNjKVN5oGoBHNE8UPBQsoSOhVN7cTAZ8BnH1ROEyI6yx8NoQN1LMfyBeMb6l3fDYrR8Kf__.U5nmI3uMYfCKAF.oAYFja3y1fQFPoEjp.", "site_full": "www.bendbulletin.com", "site": "bendbulletin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "X-Hop beers on tap at Worthy Brewing;

Experimental tasting series returns to Bend brewery", "text": "View stories and bio Worthy Brewing Co. continues to provide one of the more interesting brewery destinations in the region. Beyond the brewery, pub and beer garden, visitors are treated to the sights of growing hops (in the summer), the greenhouse and Garden Club, and, completed this year, the domed observatory. At its core, however, Worthy is still about the beer, and this year the brewery has been bustling with several notable projects. The brewery showcased a new hop variety, Strata, with the release of the eponymously named Strata IPA early in the year. Worthy has a special connection to the development of this hop, as owner Roger Worthington also owns hop supplier Indie Hops. Indie Hops collaborates with Oregon State University\u2019s hop breeding program to develop new strains of hops. Strata is the first to emerge from this program and make the leap to a commercially grown brewing variety. The strain was developed from Perle, a German aroma hop developed and released in 1978, which typically exhibits earthy and spicy herbal characteristics, such as black pepper and sometimes even mint. Worthy began experimenting with Strata, then known as X-331, late in 2016. It was a hit with the brewers, and after four trial versions, the brewery officially launched StrataSphere IPA in January. The name was shortened to simply Strata IPA, and in September, following this year\u2019s hop harvest, Worthy released it in 22-ounce bottles. The defining aroma characteristic of Strata is tropical fruit \u2014 including notes of pineapple, mango and orange marmalade, with what the brewery describes as an underlying \u201cwhiff of herbal dankness.\u201d Fruit carries into the flavor as well, highlighting pineapple and citrus along with some spicy herbal notes hinting as to the hop\u2019s heritage. The malt base is clean and bready and gets out of the way to highlight the hops. Overall, it has a nice \u201cmoreish\u201d quality to it that I would also describe as appetizing; you take a sip and immediately want more. The 2016 acreage for Strata was limited, with only 9 acres harvested. Indie Hops planted an additional 60 acres, and Worthy plans to release Strata IPA in cans late next year with the increased availability of the hops. More recently, Worthy\u2019s X-Hop experimental tasting series returned, a similar project to a series of beers they offered in the spring. In a comparable manner to how the brewery released Strata, it brews beers utilizing new, experimental hop varieties, and solicits public feedback on each beer. The current release lineup runs through the end of December. The hop varieties are designated by letter and number combinations, such as C7-9-1-499 (the first hop used in the series). At some point, if the popularity and development of that strain matures to general brewing use, it has the potential to be named and cultivated for commercial use. On the other hand, strains that fare poorly in the trials are likely to be abandoned. The X-Hop beers are available on draft at Worthy for two weeks until the next beer is tapped. Its second beer in this experimental series is on tap now, and the third beer will be released Dec. 15. Finally, just before Thanksgiving, Worthy released the latest vintage of its annual imperial stout specialty, Dark Muse, along with 2016 Dark Muse aged in bourbon barrels. Dark Muse is a hefty 10.1 percent alcohol by volume, though it hides the alcohol well behind layers of rich chocolate and sweet toffee. The barrel-aged version aged for 13 months in Woodford Reserve Bourbon barrels, a long contact time that tends to impart highly potent wood and bourbon character. The brewery\u2019s description of the process reads, \u201cWe blended in a small amount of 2017 Muse to balance the intense bourbon aromas and flavors. This vintage picked up a pleasant amount of oak and adds a small amount of dried fruit and hazelnut.\u201d Its time in the barrels allows the beer to gain an additional percent of alcohol by volume, and though boozy, the strength is well concealed. I found it to have a subtle aroma with essence of chocolate, vanilla and bourbon with a hint of maple syrup. In flavor there is a nice expression of the bourbon with elements of charred wood and vanilla, lightening up the body of the base beer with a pleasant alcoholic heat that\u2019s present but mellow. With deep background notes of chocolate this is an excellent dessert beer that would pair equally well with chocolate desserts as with a cheese tray or a mixed-berry cobbler. All of these beers are currently on tap, so if you find yourself visiting for one of the brewery\u2019s other highlights, make sure to take the time to grab a pint. \u2014 Jon Abernathy is a Bend beer blogger and brew aficionado.

If we all just did this instead of telling other people what hero to play it would just be 5 dps vs 5 dps. I don't see the issue. All 12 of those people have the right to choose any hero they want.\nIf you really think the OTP is the issue you should really reconsider because if you think flexing is so great then you should be GM right? You're 1/6 people so there's 5 chances to get a \"worthless OTP\" and the enemy team has 6 chances to get a \"worthless OTP.\"\nYou you should be winning 1/6 games more than all the One Tricks because swapping is clearly the greatest way to play the game and everyone should do it forever.

\u2022 Santa Ana winds continue to whip up fires, making them difficult to fight", "text": "\nBy Sarah Parvini, Louis Sahagun and Cindy Carcamo \nLos Angeles Times OJAI, Calif. \u2014 Crews battling a massive wildfire that has caused tens of thousands of Ventura County residents to flee are bracing themselves for a day of heavy winds Thursday, when forecasters predict fire-stoking gusts of up to 80 mph. By Wednesday evening, the Thomas Fire had scorched about 90,000 acres and carved a path of destruction that stretches more than 10 miles from Santa Paula to the Pacific Ocean. Forecasters say strong Santa Ana winds, coupled with low humidity, will offer \u201ca recipe for explosive fire growth.\u201d \u201cWe stand a good chance of a challenging night and day tomorrow,\u201d California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, spokesman Tim Chavez said, adding that there\u2019s potential for fire growth on the northwest side and a high probability of spot fires. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a difficult night and day.\u201d The focus Wednesday, officials said, was keeping the fire out of the Ojai Valley while assessing the devastation in the cities of Ventura and Santa Paula. The hot Santa Ana winds that drove the fire at remarkable speed Tuesday had lessened greatly Wednesday. However, they were predicted to increase again Thursday. \u201cWe are in the beginning of a protracted wind event,\u201d said Cal Fire Chief Ken Pimlott. \u201cThere will be no ability to fight fire in these kinds of winds,\u201d Pimlott said. \u201cAt the end of the day, we need everyone in the public to listen and pay attention. This is not \u2018watch the news and go about your day.\u2019 This is pay attention minute-by-minute \u2026 keep your head on a swivel.\u201d Among those residents who took Pimlott\u2019s words to heart were Kristy Cantrall, who left a garden hose poised on the roof of her Santa Paula townhome, just in case. Only a day earlier, the Thomas Fire was a half-mile away from her cul-de-sac neighborhood on Vela Court, prompting neighbors to climb up to their roofs and spray their homes with water. Helicopters hovered overhead, dropping buckets of fire retardant on eucalyptus trees that had caught fire just north of the neighborhood. Cantrall\u2019s son Colin drove from Simi Valley to water down his mother\u2019s home Tuesday night. \u201cOnce we saw copters come down, we knew we had to water,\u201d he said. He planned to do the same Wednesday if the fire flared up. Meanwhile, they just kept an eye on the news. State fire officials say about 12,000 homes remain threatened by flames, while 50,000 people have been forced to flee. Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency, as approximately 1,100 personnel continued to battle the blaze. At least one firefighter has been injured. A Bend Fire crew was sent Wednesday as part of an Oregon task force to assist the firefighters. It is the second time in two months a Bend crew has been sent to California. In October, Bend firefighters were among a group from Oregon sent to help crews battle the deadly fires that destroyed the northern part of the state. Fire officials said the area they\u2019ve dubbed \u201cbranch one,\u201d which includes Ojai, the bucolic mountain town known as a haven for spiritual seekers, health enthusiasts and celebrities, is one of their priorities. Firefighters are putting together a plan to protect Ojai and have expressed concern that winds could push the flames toward the city. \u201cThe fire is here and wrapped around the community,\u201d said Shane Lauderdale, a Cal Fire branch director, as he huddled with other officials in a downtown parking lot. With a map of the Ojai Valley spread over the hood of a crew vehicle and ashes falling around him, Lauderdale said that more equipment and firefighters are being rushed to areas south and east of the town. \u201cWe\u2019re taking advantage of the current calm to concentrate resources along a defensive line,\u201d he said. Firefighters are moving heavy equipment to meet the blaze on the edge of town, while hand crews are cutting fire breaks. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get a lot more work done today,\u201d Lauderdale said. The fire threat is considered dire until Friday, when punishing Santa Ana winds are predicted to abate. However, Ojai City Manager Steve McClary said, \u201cUntil we have fog drifting in from the west and light rain, we won\u2019t feel like this thing is behind us.\u201d Officials said the southeast area of the Thomas Fire was one of their highest priorities because of the \u201ctremendous volume of fire\u201d in that area. They reiterated a message spread Wednesday morning \u2014 to put out even small bushes on fire along roads and extinguish the smallest embers on the way to bigger blazes because \u201cthat\u2019s how it\u2019s spreading from house to house.\u201d The fire was the worst of several major blazes across Southern California, including one in Bel-Air that closed the 405 Freeway on Wednesday, one in the Angeles National Forest near Sylmar and another in the Santa Clarita Valley. At least 150 structures \u2014 including one large apartment complex and the Vista Del Mar Hospital, a psychiatric facility \u2014 were consumed by flames. But Cal Fire suspects the true number is hundreds more; firefighters just haven\u2019t been able to get into some areas to know for sure. Geoff Marcus walked past the charred remains of his Dodge Ram in the driveway of his Ventura home and surveyed the rubble that was left behind. The raging Thomas Fire chewed through the five-bedroom house he grew up in and his family has owned for 60 years. \u201cI\u2019m looking to see what we can salvage,\u201d Marcus, 58, said. He spent the morning rummaging through the ashes with his two sons, Steven and Daniel. Together, they were able to scrounge a few ceramic plates and mugs. Marcus said he and his mother evacuated Monday and had no more than 10 minutes to leave. He saw the flames \u2014 \u201can orange glow like the earth was angry\u201d \u2014 and knew it was time to evacuate. \u201cIt was enough time to grab the family and that was it. That was all I had,\u201d he said. Both his neighbors\u2019 homes also burned, along with one house across from his and the homes along a nearby ridge. On Wednesday, smoke rose from the ground, which was still radiating heat. \u201cI feel loss but my family is safe, and, well, that\u2019s all I care about. These are all possessions that can be replaced,\u201d he said, walking through piles of burned wood and appliances. Behind him, a blackened shower stood perfectly intact. \u201cThis was a happy place where we celebrated Thanksgiving and Christmas. Everything my mom has collected and cherished is gone,\u201d he said. As his sons looked through the property, Marcus searched for one particular artifact \u2014 a portion of the driveway where he and his father had carved their names in 1984. \u201cI was hoping to find some jewelry, but it all melted,\u201d he said. The home was renovated in 2008, he said. Marcus and his mother are staying at his nephew\u2019s house nearby until his insurance company provides him with temporary housing. \u201cI kept hoping we\u2019d come back and there would be a house,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we rebuild and start over. There\u2019s not much you can do otherwise.\u201d His son Steven popped his head up where the fireplace once stood. \u201cHey!\u201d he shouted. \u201cI found an angel!\u201d He waved a small \u201cPrecious Moments\u201d figurine with a halo atop its head, then tossed it to his brother with a laugh. At a briefing Wednesday morning, Rich Thompson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, told crews that Santa Ana winds would pick up again Thursday. Officials noted that \u201cthe wind has overwhelmed everything. \u2026 It\u2019s driven the fire across all kinds of terrain.\u201d \u201cYou hear the winds are going to be slacking a little, but keep in mind by slacking we mean gusts of 80 go down to 35,\u201d said Cal Fire Battalion Chief Tim Chavez. \u201cIf you notice the air gets still and quiet for a little while, stay there.\u201d Crews were warned of firefighter deaths that occurred in this area in the past during \u201ca similar situation to today, a weakening Santa Ana.\u201d Ventura County Fire Capt. Steve Kaufmann said 50,000 residents had been evacuated from their homes and many don\u2019t know the fate of their properties. 18949619 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "louis sahagun", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sarah parvini", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cindy carcamo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "colin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lauderdale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pimlott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristy cantrall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vela court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa ana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rich thompson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerry brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shane lauderdale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ken pimlott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve kaufmann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas fire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim chavez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve mcclary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geoff marcus", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national weather service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cal fire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angeles national forest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california department of forestry and fire protection", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cal fire battalion", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "los angeles times ojai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa ana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ojai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sylmar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ojai valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cantrall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vista del mar hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ojai city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa paula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa clarita valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simi valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bel-air", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:27.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4cb73fefe7f61557ab1177bd4c81a55651389abc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLv7Ej4RLGCzK6Iy_H6aNT3RcB3t4.dnVd8Ktkww5q92VYYxu2agIptc", "site_full": "us.battle.net", "site": "battle.net", "site_section": "https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/22813879/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "General Discussion - Overwatch Forums", "title": "This is how I deal with OTPs in Overwatch -", "title_full": "This is how I deal with OTPs in Overwatch - Overwatch Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T16:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "/forums/static/images/social-thumbs/overwatch.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 462, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bf1668ee2a334528307875aa4b4f7f4103c3f7f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLv7Ej4RLGCzK6Iy_H6aNT3RcB3t4.dnVd8Ktkww5q92VVU8n2uXnTHYD4QEgTNty0Q-", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "Quest", "published": "2017-12-07T17:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "12/07/2017 12:54 AM Posted by Gromnus 12/07/2017 12:40 AM Posted by Quest I feel you're stumbling on some semantics and such, my friend.\nLet's clear this up, I am not demonizing one tricks or anything like that, at least not intentionally. I am simply trying to illuminate and demonstrate the self-contradictory and inherently self-defeating/hypocritical premise that one tricks operate on. I'm not on a crusade to paint any one as \"foolish and hard-headed\" as you put it.\nDoes that make it easier for you? Intentionally or not, you're saying that One-Tricking for ANY reason is bad and you should feel bad for doing it. Yes, within the context of competitive, it is my opinion that one tricking is selfish and bad. The only contradictions I see is the argument that \"They're forcing people to play around them.\" while trying to force that person to play around them. Like it's suddenly a terrible thing that you have to \"play around\" a teammate because they're an off-meta or something. Playing around people, or in other words, trying to maximize the potential of each individual on your team, is a very sound and logical way to approach this game. \"Forcing\" I do not agree with in any way. Cooperation I fully encourage. Sometimes surrendering your hero choice to another player is the better choice for the team as they are objectively better (a reality I have to face as a Tracer main, but a situation many off meta one tricks can avoid for the most part). And there's the people who get mad at someone for playing something they don't want them to play, and refuse to switch themselves thinking something like \"This'll show them!\". And THEN there's the people who think a one-trick should never be allowed to tell anyone else to switch because they won't themselves. That's just silly. I agree, and have never said anything differently. Everyone deserves the opportunity, and we should all make an effort to work with eachother's strengths, even if that means in order to maximize a teammates potential I have to choose a suboptimal pick for myself. These are all very common things that happen, and are reinforced to the extreme because of posts like yours that, \"intentionally or not\", demonize one-tricks as the sole cause for any loss they are a part of, especially if they can't play their one character. I will go deep into the reasons for loss and all sorts of things with you. The flaws of the SR system, so on and so forth. I'm down. I'm not saying, and never have, that OTPs are the SOLE AND ONLY PROBLEM.\nYou have yet to address the fact how one tricking is only a viable option when you are able to, through the ladder, avoid a person who is exactly like you. I don't really accept the \"oh well lel that's how it goes\" approach when it comes to someone taking your hero choice as I don't feel like the people you are matched to play with deserve that.\nI care about the people I play with.

I am saying that, fundamentally, the viability of one tricking is dependent on avoiding people that are like you in the ladder. The moment you encounter someone like you, that is a one trick of the same hero as you with a faster computer, you throw the entire SR system out the window, that your approach to the game (one tricking in comp) is no longer a viable option. I mean, you literally couldn't complete this reiteration of your argument without relying on SR. Come on dude.\n12/07/2017 12:52 AM Posted by Quest I acknowledge the possibility that there may be people out there that are better at Tracer than I am, and as such in the best interest of the team and for the sake of winning, I should surrender my hero of choice to them. In that situation, I feel it is necessary, and I prepare for such a situation, that I must be able to perform on a secondary hero in a way that is remotely close to the SR I was matched according to. Skirting over your mention of SR again, Congrats. You're a decent human bean. Anyone that wouldn't do this is probably not. OTP or not.\n12/07/2017 12:52 AM Posted by Quest A main can very well possess acceptable, for the SR range, skills on another hero. A one trick is a one trick. If they were equally capable on another hero, they wouldn't be a one trick. They'd be a main. This is exactly what I was talking about earlier, you're assuming one-tricks literally can't do anything other than their character, rather than being mildly sub-par. They one-trick, yes, that means they play their character at all times that it is possible. And the only time it is not possible is when someone else picks it. You are implying that a one-trick that has to play another character is so bad that he will be the sole reason your team loses, or has a hard time winning.\nHeck, it's entirely possible that someone who one-tricks is as good or better on another hero. Some people just limit themselves like that. It's not unfair for them to not play that character. It's in no way unfair for someone to not play their best.

One-Tricking is a viable option even with a full team of say, 6 Torb OTs. As long as they aren't $hit people, they'll still choose other characters. Heck, they'd probably play a bit better as a team, even if slightly sub-par, because they know the ups and downs of their main. Maybe they win, maybe they just get outplayed. There's not much you can do about $hitty people, there's not much you can do about throwers and smurfs, why is the biggest problem to you OTPs? It's just another thing you can't avoid. They are just as much of a minority as throwers and leavers are, only they actually contribute to the game as best they can. Some of them even get to quite high ranks. If you don't like seeing the bad ones, rank up more. You evidently already know how to do that. I'd even argue that if you rank yourself up out of your current level, you might learn something new, higher level strategies or such.

There is a high expectation of winning a case when one has decided to hire the Florida foreclosure attorneys . The experts can fight for the rights of a victim at all capacity. The following are tips for getting a good lawyer.\n\nDealing with lawyers whose reputation is incredible guarantees your success in the case at hand. A wise client takes time to talk to the individuals, who have been working with this specific expert so as to have an idea of what you should expect. Also, it would be wise to go to the website and see what other client comments about the work done so far. If the views are pleasing, then you can go ahead and work with him or her.\n\nOne should identify an experienced lawyer from that who is not experienced by checking in the documents of merits. One should be keen to inquire about the cases handled and get to know if you can be allowed to contact other customers or not. If there is no problem with talking to others who have received the same services, you can be sure that the lawyer will handle your case in a right way.\n\nExcellent communication skills are essential in this field of specialization. An advocate should be in a position to take time to listen to what the client has to say so as to know how to handle things. It is after this that the expert is allowed to give his or her view so as to help the victim recover from the condition. One should ask any relevant question to ensure everything is clear.\n\nBefore you get to hire an expert, you should be aware of his or her personality. In case the expert is not friendly or social, it is clear that you will have a hard a time trying to make things work for you. One should hire a person, who has no problem with picking calls or responding to your texts any time you want to know something. It is crucial especially when there is no time for you to meet.\n\nThere is nothing good like making sure you are dealing with an honest expert, who is ready to face reality and give you the best in future. Counselors, who are not upright to their clients lead to frustration. It is good to be confronted with the truth that will help you sort out things in the right way despite the situation. Honesty is a virtue that many lawyers lack.\n\nOne should be committed to the work given. Being a lawyer calls for dangerous people, who spend most of their time trying to get things that can help them meet the demands of the clients. One should avoid any experts, who are not ready to sacrifice for the sake of you.\n\nHiring any lawyer is not an easy task like many people think. It requires a lot of commitment to ensure that one gets an expert in this field. Consultation should be done to make sure the selection made will offer services as expected. The process should take quite some time to ensure everything falls into place without confusion.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are searching for information about Florida foreclosure attorneys , come to our web pages today.

's Westminster leader has insisted a no deal Brexit would lead the Scottish Government to begin making preparations for a second Scottish independence referendum.\nAs Theresa May \u2019s hope of a breakthrough with Brussels was fading fast, Ian Blackford also claimed that a C ommons majority for a soft EU withdrawal can be formed to stop Britain falling off a hard Brexit cliff-edge.\n\u201cWe would have a conversation with the people of Scotland and at that point we would be asking the Parliament in Edinburgh to put in place the mechanisms for a second referendum,\u201d explained the Highland MP.\nAs the clock ticked away towards the December 14/15 European Council, sources at Westminster suggested the Prime Minister would not be travelling to Brussels on Thursday for a meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, to seal a deal on the first phase of talks and to ensure that next week the EU27 concluded \u201csufficient progress\u201d had been made to move the negotiations on to the second phase about trade and transition.\nOn Monday, the Democratic Unionists vetoed the UK Government\u2019s proposal to maintain \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d on trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\nAfter a 24-hour delay the DUP leader Arlene Foster had a brief conversation with Mrs May but said there was \u201cstill work to be done in London\u201d with party sources suggesting the row over the Irish border could take \u201cseveral days\u201d to sort out.\nRuth Davidson , the Scottish Conservative leader, told the PM in no uncertain terms that any separate deal for Northern Ireland would have \"unravelled the entire United Kingdom\", and the 13 Scottish Conservative MPs, including David Mundell, the Scottish Secretary, would not vote for it.\nThe UK Government swiftly backtracked. David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, insisted that any regulatory alignment would cover the whole of the UK and not just Northern Ireland while Mrs May pledged at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions that her Government would protect the \"constitutional integrity\" of the Union.\nBut Tory Brexiteers, said to include Boris Johnson , the Foreign Secretary, and Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary, are concerned that any UK-wide regulatory alignment would produce a soft Brexit with the country effectively operating to the rules of the single market and customs union.\nNicola Sturgeon seized on such a prospect, tweeting: \u201cThis could be the moment for opposition and soft Brexit/remain Tories to force a different, less damaging approach - keep the UK in the single market and customs union.

County mulls code change in battle of religious freedom vs. conservation", "text": "View stories and bio Deschutes County moved a step closer to resolving a long-running dispute that has pitted religious freedom advocates against wildlife conservationists. On Wednesday morning, the Deschutes County Commission deliberated on a potential amendment to the county\u2019s code that would affect whether churches are allowed in a portion of the county zoned to protect mule deer and other animals. Conservationists and some county residents are concerned that allowing churches could stress Deschutes County\u2019s shrinking deer populations, but other residents believe the provision violates religious freedoms and could lead to a lawsuit stemming from a federal law. \u201cI think our country was built by people with strong religious faiths,\u201d said Phil Henderson, Deschutes County commissioner, during the deliberation Wednesday. During the deliberation, Deschutes County Planning Manager Peter Gutowsky presented the commissioners with five options, ranging from leaving county code as it is, to striking the word \u201cchurch\u201d from the list of prohibited uses, allowing churches in the wildlife zone even during the winter, when the deer use the range. The three commissioners expressed their desire for churches not to be singled out as a prohibited use. However, Commissioner Tammy Baney added that she wanted to see a compromise that allows small Bible studies and other gatherings in the zone, while providing a backstop against large events during the winter. \u201cI think the desire would not be to allow, without any sort of review to mitigate impacts, large-scale outdoor activities,\u201d Baney said. The amendment stems from a long-running dispute between Deschutes County and John Shepherd, a pastor who operates a church out of his home located in the Metolius winter deer range, where churches are prohibited. Shepherd has held church services and conducted weddings on his 216-acre property outside Sisters since 1999, but was notified he was in violation of county code three years ago. The Land Use Board of Appeals overturned a permit for Shepherd\u2019s church in 2016, on the basis that the county\u2019s code explicitly prohibits churches. Since then, Shepherd has turned his attention to the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, a federal law signed by President Bill Clinton in 2000. Shepherd believes the county\u2019s code represents a clear violation of the law, which is designed to protect houses of worship from discrimination by local governments. The county held a public hearing Nov. 6, where the commission heard testimony both in favor of Shepherd\u2019s position, and on behalf of Deschutes County\u2019s deer population, which has declined since the 1970s. Additionally, 44 people provided written testimony, roughly split between support for religious freedom, and those supporting continued restriction in the county\u2019s winter deer range. Shepherd said after the meeting that he would not file a lawsuit on any amendment that removes churches from the list of prohibited uses, though he\u2019d prefer an outcome that allows outdoor events on his property during the winter. \u201cI\u2019m open to a reasonable compromise,\u201d Shepherd said. Gutowsky said county staff would prepare a draft of an amendment following board\u2019s guidance, which would be reviewed Dec. 18. \u2014 Reporter: 541-617-7818, ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "phil henderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tammy baney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shepherd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gutowsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter gutowsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john shepherd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill clinton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "land use board of appeals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deschutes county commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "deschutes county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:28.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "94d67ec7a3051139b2e62dd03cde05aea76ea191", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KvZtRHOQUvzzuNjKVN5oGdPesY9QyY4m3yxb2BwZuzFBgsqq5pdQUfcNJrR0.Hg8Ol9gRb1m_bVJLa1MGsamzKRgFvKXwsy8-", "site_full": "www.bendbulletin.com", "site": "bendbulletin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Ben Sollee plays (and bikes) in Bend; Cellist, songwriter brings new band to Volcanic Theatre Pub", "title_full": "Ben Sollee plays (and bikes) in Bend; Cellist, songwriter brings new band to Volcanic Theatre Pub", "published": "2017-12-07T10:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.018, "main_image": "http://www.bendbulletin.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=MZfWoB7JD9QY7M$BrMjYVM$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYtTNS6KKFizL4ek6NypF4C0WCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 93497, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "94d67ec7a3051139b2e62dd03cde05aea76ea191", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KvZtRHOQUvzzuNjKVN5oGdPesY9QyY4m3yxb2BwZuzFBgsqq5pdQUfcNJrR0.Hg8Ol9gRb1m_bVJLa1MGsamzKRgFvKXwsy8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brian Mcelhiney", "published": "2017-12-07T10:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "Ben Sollee plays (and bikes) in Bend; Cellist, songwriter brings new band to Volcanic Theatre Pub", "text": "View stories and bio About two years ago, Kentucky singer-songwriter and cello virtuoso Ben Sollee was supposed to play the Domino Room with 17-piece symphonic rock band Mother Falcon, but the show ended up canceled at the last minute.

There's now no mandate for a hard brexit and probably never was. The euref made no distinction between hard and soft, in fact brexit leaders deliberately fudged that- promising reduced immigration while holding up Norway and Switzerland as successful countries outside the EU- without mentioning both are in the single market. Plus many other mistruths -unquestioningly disseminated by 'our' media -that, in the eyes of the world, reduced its claim to be a fair and democratic vote and left UK as a global laughing stock . I suspect May and pals are quietly stitching a face saving deal that will, more or less, leave UK in the single market. Even the media are subtly sidelining Johnson et al.

The Angel Gabriel calls Mary \u201cfull of grace\u201d (Lk.1,28): in Her there is no room for sin, because God has always chosen Her as the mother of Jesus and has preserved Her from original sin. http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/on-the-feast-of-the-immaculate-conception \nDespite the pontiff\u2019s claim, the Bible shows that other than Jesus (Hebrews 4:15), \u201call have sinned\u201d (Romans 3:23)-that includes Mary. \nHere is some of what The Catholic Encyclopedia says about this Catholic feast: The feast of the Immaculate Conception \nThe older feast of the Conception of Mary (Conception of St. Anne), which originated in the monasteries of Palestine at least as early as the seventh century, and the modern feast of the Immaculate Conception are not identical in their object. \nOriginally the Church celebrated only the Feast of the Conception of Mary, as she kept the Feast of St. John\u2019s conception, not discussing the sinlessness. This feast in the course of centuries became the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, as dogmatical argumentation brought about precise and correct ideas, and as the thesis of the theological schools regarding the preservation of Mary from all stain of original sin gained strength. Even after the dogma had been universally accepted in the Latin Church, and had gained authoritative support through diocesan decrees and papal decisions, the old term remained, and before 1854 the term \u201cImmaculata Conceptio\u201d is nowhere found in the liturgical books, except in the invitatorium of the Votive Office of the Conception\u2026 \nToday the Conception of St. Anne is in the Greek Church one of the minor feasts of the year. The lesson in Matins contains allusions to the apocryphal \u201cProto-evangelium\u201d of St. James, which dates from the second half of the second century (see SAINT ANNE). To the Greek Orthodox of our days, however, the feast means very little; they continue to call it \u201cConception of St. Anne\u201d, indicating unintentionally, perhaps, the active conception which was certainly not immaculate. In the Menaea of 9 December this feast holds only the second place, the first canon being sung in commemoration of the dedication of the Church of the Resurrection at Constantinople. The Russian hagiographer Muraview and several other Orthodox authors even loudly declaimed against the dogma after its promulgation, although their own preachers formerly taught the Immaculate Conception in their writings long before the definition of 1854\u2026 \nIn the Western Church the feast appeared (8 December), when in the Orient its development had come to a standstill. The timid beginnings of the new feast in some Anglo-Saxon monasteries in the eleventh century, partly smothered by the Norman conquest, were followed by its reception in some chapters and dioceses by the Anglo-Norman clergy\u2026 \nThe \u201cMartyrology of Tallaght\u201d compiled about 790 and the \u201cFeilire\u201d of St. Aengus (800) register the Conception of Mary on 3 May. (Holweck, F. (1910). Immaculate Conception. In The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved December 8, 2012 from New Advent: http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07674d.htm) \nFrom the above we see that: The \u2018Feast of the Immaculate Conception\u2019 is NOT an original Christian observance. The first version of it developed around the seventh century in the Greek/Orient ( Eastern Orthodox ) church. Greek/Orient ( Eastern Orthodox ) church does not consider it to be of much importance. A falsely named and false book (the so-called Proto-evangelium of James ) was claimed centuries later to support this (having read the so-called Proto-evangelium of James , let me state that any \u2018support\u2019 even from it is weaker than weak). The Russian Orthodox denounced the idea of the \u2018immaculate conception of Mary.\u2019 The Western Church of Rome did not start to observe a version of it until the 11th century. Until 1854 the term Immaculate Conception was not officially used. The date itself seems to have been changed. \nThus, the \u2018Feast of the Immaculate Conception of Mary\u2019 was not an original Christian observance. \nBasically, Catholic dogma, defined in 1854 teaches that Mary was conceived without \u2018original sin\u2019 and that she allegedly lived a completely sinless life. Since Catholic scholars realize that this was not the original position of their early theologians (which they normally call \u201cearly Church fathers,\u201d but are called \u201colder Fathers\u201d below), The Catholic Encyclopedia declares: Proof from Tradition \nIn regard to the sinlessness of Mary the older Fathers are very cautious: some of them even seem to have been in error on this matter\u2026 these stray private opinions merely serve to show that theology is a progressive science. (Holweck, F. (1910). Immaculate Conception. In The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved December 8, 2012 from New Advent: http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07674d.htm) \nNotice that the so-called \u201cProof from Tradition\u201d disproves the belief in Mary\u2019s claimed sinlessness. And instead of this being a biblical or early tradition, it developed over time. \nHere is some of what I wrote about this subject in the past (note: DRB is an abbreviation for Douay-Rheims Bible, which is a Catholic-approved version): \nIn the 19th century, there was a female apparition in France, known as the Lady of Lourdes. One of the statements she reportedly stated in 1858 was, \u201cI am the Immaculate Conception!\u201d \nNow this is an unusual and biblically contradictory idea as the Bible teaches that all have sinned (Roman 3:23) except Jesus (Hebrews 4:15), as He is the only one who had a biblically immaculate conception, but not the Marian kind. \nFor non-Catholics, let me explain that what became an extra-biblical Catholic doctrine was that Mary was conceived unlike all other humans and free of what many refer to as \u201coriginal sin.\u201d Specifically this \u201cdogma\u201d has been explained in Dr. Ludwig Ott\u2019s 20th century book Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma as: \u201cMary\u2019s freedom of original sin was an unmerited gift of God, and an exception from the law that was vouchsafed to her only.\u201d \nHis book also teaches: The doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of Mary is not explicitly revealed in scripture\u2026 Neither the Greek nor the Latin Fathers explicitly (explicite) teach the Immaculate Conception of Mary. \nSo where did it come from? \nLet\u2019s have a look at some comparative religion. Before the birth of Christ, the Iranian goddess Aredvi Sura An\u0101hit\u0101, known as the Persian Diana, was called \u201cthe virgin, \u201c\u201cthe immaculate. \u201c Kore-Persephoneia was also the \u201cimmaculate Maiden\u201c and \u201cVirgin of the World\u201c who gave birth to a son for Zeus, and she is believed to be same goddess Diana. Hence, it appears that at least some of the idea was part of paganism associated with \u201cDiana\u201c goddess worship. \nJumping forward to the 12th century, a British monk Eadmer began to promote the idea of an Immaculate Conception of Mary. When he did so, \u201cSt. Bernard of Clairvaux\u2026 (about 1140), warned the faithful that this was an unfounded innovation\u2026\u201d So was the Catholic saint Bernard wrong in condemning Monk Eadmer\u2019s heresy here? Of course not! Others, at least as late as the 17th century supported Bernard\u2019s position on this. \nYet, after claiming to see an apparition in Rue du Bac, Paris in 1830, the Catholic saint Catherine Labour\u00e9 claimed Mary \u201cwas conceived without sin.\u201d The extra-biblical teaching of the so-called \u201cImmaculate Conception\u201d did not become a type of Catholic dogma until December 8, 1854. It, thus, was not part of early apostolic tradition\u2026 \nIn a letter to her confessor dated June 12, 1930, L\u00facia {of Fatima fame} claimed that she was told the following on the night of May 29th-30th, 1930: There are five kinds of offenses and blasphemies against the Immaculate Heart of Mary: (1) blasphemies against her Immaculate Conception; (2) against her perpetual virginity; (3) against her divine maternity, refusing to accept her at the same time as the Mother of humankind; (4) by those who try to publicly implant in the hearts of children an indifference, contempt, or even hate for this Immaculate Mother; and (5) for those who insult her sacred images. \nPriest Andrew Apostoli, in his Fatima for Today book, wrote: Those who commit such blasphemies against our Lady are in grave danger of losing their souls, for these sins seriously offend God himself. \nI was shocked to read the above. \nNow if all five of those statements are blasphemies, then many early Catholic and Eastern Orthodox saints are guilty of blasphemy by that definition. History records that recognized Catholic and/or Eastern Orthodox saints such as Melito, Irenaeus, Theophilus of Antioch, Origen, Basil, Cyprian of Carthage, John Chrysostom, Ambrose, Hilary, Gregory of Tours, Bernard of Clairvoux, Bonaventure, \u201cAlbert the Great,\u201d and Thomas Aquinas all took one or more positions that the \u201cmessenger\u201d apparently considered to be blasphemous. \nSince Priest Apostoli says that salvation may be lost for taking positions against those messages, does not this mean that he is challenging the validity of the sainthood of all Catholic-approved saints who took such supposedly \u201cblasphemous\u201d positions? \nHe surely does not intend to, but that is what some of the \u201cblasphemy messages\u201d really mean\u2026 Teaching Against the Immaculate Conception It needs to be understood that the idea of an Immaculate Conception for Mary was not an early tradition of the church nor is it taught in scripture. The Catholic Encyclopedia article of the Immaculate Conception clearly recognizes this: No direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture. \nSo, the doctrine is simply not provable from the Holy Bible. \nOne aspects of the belief in Mary\u2019s \u201cImmaculate Conception\u201d is that \u201cshe was immune from all sin, personal, or inherited.\u201d Yet, scripture states: 23 For all have sinned, and do need the glory of God. 24 Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption, that is in Christ Jesus, (Romans 3:23-24, DRB) 15 For we have not a high priest, who can not have compassion on our infirmities: but one tempted in all things like as we are, without sin. 16 Let us go therefore with confidence to the throne of grace: that we may obtain mercy, and find grace in seasonable aid. (Hebrews 4:15-16, DRB) \nAll, including Mary, sinned, and need redemption through Christ Jesus (and not Mary) according to the Bible. \nNotice that the Catholic Encyclopedia article of the Immaculate Conception also teaches: * Origen\u2026thought that\u2026for her sins also Christ died (Origen, \u201cIn Luc. Hom. Xvii\u201d). *\u2026St. Basil writes in the fourth century: he sees in the sword, of which Simeon speaks, the doubt which pierced Mary\u2019s soul (Epistle 259). * St. Chrysostom accuses her of ambition, and of putting herself forward unduly when she sought to speak to Jesus at Capharnaum (Matthew 12:46; Chrysostom, Homily 44 on Matthew). \nThe book Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma also admits that \u201cindividual Greek Fathers (Origen, St. Basil, St. John Chrysostom, St. Cyril of Alexandria) taught that Mary suffered from venial personal faults, such as ambition and vanity, doubt about the message of the Angel, and lack of faith under the Cross\u2026\u201d \nEither those Catholic saints (or Orthodox saints in the case of Origen) were not committing blasphemy, they were not really saints, and/or the messages that L\u00facia was told did not come from God. \nAdditionally, as late as the early 5th century, even the Catholic saint Augustine would not teach as dogma that Mary was without sin. \nAbout 1140, the Catholic saint Bernard of Clairvaux warned the faithful not to believe the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of Mary as it was an unfounded innovation. \nThe Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma also teaches that \u201cthe leading theologians of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries (Petrus Lombardus, St. Alexander of Hales, St. Bonaventure, St. Albert the Great, St. Thomas Aquinas\u2026) rejected the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.\u201d \nThus, to teach that it is blasphemy or a serious sin against God to not accept the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of Mary (as being different than how other humans were conceived) does not seem to be a biblical or early historical truth\u2014even Catholic saints opposed the view. \nNotice also what Jesus taught: 32 And the multitude sat about him; and they say to him: Behold thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee. 33 And answering them, he said: Who is my mother and my brethren? 34 And looking round about on them who sat about him, he saith: Behold my mother and my brethren. 35 For whosoever shall do the will of God, he is my brother, and my sister, and mother. (Mark 3:32-35, DRB) \nJesus is showing that all who do God\u2019s will are His mother, brother, or sisters. If Mary was sinless or conceived differently, He would have not included His mother in those statements. \nThe Eastern Orthodox in their Patriarchal Encyclical of 1895 declared: XIII. The one holy, catholic and apostolic Church of the seven Ecumenical Councils teaches that the supernatural incarnation of the only-begotten Son and Word of God, of the Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mary, is alone pure and immaculate; but the Papal Church scarcely forty years ago again made an innovation by laying down a novel dogma concerning the immaculate conception of the Mother of God and ever-Virgin Mary , which was unknown to the ancient Church (and strongly opposed at different times even by the more distinguished among the Papal theologians). \nThus, the Eastern Orthodox have long taught that the idea of an \u201cImmaculate Conception\u201d of Mary was \u201cunknown by the ancient Church.\u201d386 And they correctly teach that Jesus alone is pure and immaculate, and refer to the Immaculate Conception teaching as a novel \u201cinnovation.\u201d An innovation adopted since the 1800s is not an original teaching\u2014true traditionalists cannot accept such late traditions as essential. \nSince Pope Benedict XVI considers that those of the Eastern Orthodox are churches in \u201cthe proper sense,\u201d387 obviously the Pope does not believe that they are committing sin or blasphemy in denying the modern teaching of the Immaculate Conception of Mary. Nor should anyone else based upon what the Bible teaches. \nThe pro-Vatican news source Zenit.com reported these two items: Best Wishes for the Feast of the Immaculate Conception \nROME, DEC. 7, 2012 (Zenit.org).- Padre Pio said that \u201cThe Madonna is the shortcut to get to God.\u201d \nThere is no doubt that in order to see the face of Jesus, we must turn to His Mother, and it is to Her who we look to heal our diseases, to turn our tears into prayer. http://www.zenit.org/article-36131?l=english Vatican City, December 07, 2014 \u2026 \nHere is the translation of the Holy Father\u2019s address before and after the recitation of the Angelus today to the faithful gathered in St. Peter\u2019s Square. \n* * * \nDear brothers and sisters, \u2026 \nThe Virgin Mary is the \u201cpath\u201d that God Himself has prepared to come into the world. Let us entrust to Her the expectation of salvation and peace for all men and women of our time. http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/on-the-lord-s-consolation \nThis also is in conflict with scripture. It is by Jesus\u2019 stripes we are to be healed (Isaiah 53:5), not Mary. Jesus, not His mother Mary, is the one mediator. \u2018Mary\u2019 is NOT the one to whom Christians entrust their salvation. Salvation comes through Jesus Christ, and only Jesus Christ, according to the Bible (Acts 4:12), not Mary. \nHere is something I wrote related to the mediator matter on page 249 of my book Fatima Shock! : \nMark Miravalle, a professor of theology at Franciscan University of Steubenville, wrote: Let us pray daily for the solemn definition of Our Lady\u2019s spiritual motherhood as co-redemptrix, mediatrix of all graces, and advocate, which truly reveal the saving actions of motherly intercession which come forth from her Immaculate Heart, and thus to bring the Church and the world a giant step closer to the Fatima-prophesied \u201cEra of Peace.\u201d \nYet, there is nothing in scripture about Mary bringing in an era of peace or being our intercessor\u2014the only intercessor listed in the Bible is Christ (Romans 8:34; Hebrews 7:25)\u2014the Bible says He is the \u201cone mediator\u201d (1 Timothy 2:5, DRB). The Bible shows that we are only to call upon the name of the Lord/God/Jesus (2 Timothy 2:22; Romans 10:12-13; Acts 26:20)\u2014never Mary. \nAlthough it is proper for Christians to state that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was blessed (Luke 1:48), it is blasphemous to insist that she was sinless (cf. Romans 3:23) and that one must turn to Mary in order to see Jesus (1 Timothy 2:5). \nFatima is a town in Portugal where an immodestly-dressed \u2018Lady\u201d allegedly appeared to three children once a month for six months in 1917 (watch also Did the Lady of Fatima Wear a Short Skirt? ). Many decided that Mary, the mother of Jesus, appeared there. But the \u2018Lady\u2019 never claimed to be Mary and absolutely could not have been. Yet, Pope Francis dedicated his pontificate to her. If Pope Francis actually adopts the agenda of the \u2018Fatimists\u2019, who believe that peace will only come to the earth if a pope and his bishops will consecrate Russia to the allegedly immaculate heart of Mary, this could well be a major fulfillment of biblical prophecies related to false declarations of peace as found in Ezekiel 13:2-20 and 1 Thessalonians 5:3. \nJesus warned that all but the very elect will be deceived (Matthew 24:24). The Apostle Paul added that signs and lying wonders will deceive those that do not have the love of the truth (2 Thessalonians 2:9-10). Marian apparitions may very well be part of that deception and the more that Pope Francis and others emphasize \u2018Mary,\u2019 the easier it will be for people to believe deceptive apparitions. \nThere is nothing in the Bible, or even in early church writings, that supports the view that December 8th is to be a festival for some type of \u2018immaculate conception\u2019 of Mary. Those who are willing to believe what the Bible teaches, as well as truly connect-the-dots related to early church history, will realize that. Sadly, however, multiple millions are not willing to do so. \nSpeaking of the Bible and festivals, a reader sent me the following: \nIn fact, the Interfaith Calendar organization lists 14 religious holidays for the month of December. Here are those holidays with a little explanation on each. \nDec. 6: Saint Nicholas Day \u2014 Christian \nThis holiday honors the birth of Saint Nicholas, the saint who serves as a role model for gift-giving and is commonly known as Santa Claus , according to Interfaith Calendar. \n\u2026 Hanukkah \u2014 Judaism \nThis is the eight-day Jewish festival of lights , which celebrates the Maccabean revolt in Egypt. Eight candles are lit with a menorah to honor the holiday. \nDec. 8: Immaculate Conception \u2014 Catholic \nIn the lead-up to Jesus\u2019 birthday celebration on Christmas, Catholics celebrate the day of Immaculate Conception to honor his mother Mary, who they say was preserved from original sin for her entire life . \nDec. 8: Rohatsu (Bodhi Day) \u2014 Buddhist \nThis holiday celebrates the historical Buddha\u2019s decision and vow to sit under the Bodhi tree until he reached spiritual enlightenment. It\u2019s celebrated through meditation and is embraced similar to how Christians celebrate Christmas to honor Jesus Christ . \nDec. 12: Advent Fast begins \u2014 Orthodox Christian \nThough Advent began this last weekend, the fasting starts midway through the month with only two weeks until Christmas.

As a result, MAVENCLADis now approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses and to delay the progression of physical disability. Following completion of 2 courses of treatment, no further treatment is required in years 3 and 4. The changes bring the Product Information [1] in line with the latest clinical trial evidence supporting MAVENCLAD. MAVENCLADis the first and only oral short-course treatment to provide efficacy across key measures of disease activity in patients with RRMS, including disability progression, annualized relapse rate and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity. \n(Logo: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/472778/Merck_Logo.jpg ) \n\"Multiple sclerosis is a debilitating disease where new treatments are needed,\" said Professor Bill Carroll , Clinical Professor of Neurology at the University of Western Australia and the Perron Institute, and a consultant neurologist at the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital as well as President-elect of the World Federation of Neurology. \"Mavenclad will be a welcomed treatment option for patients with the relapsing-remitting form of MS. As an oral therapy taken in two short courses over a 2-year period, Mavenclad will be convenient for all eligible patients in Australia , including those who may not live close to their treating healthcare professional.\" \n\"We are pleased the Therapeutic Goods Administration has updated the Product Information for Mavenclad in Australia to reflect additional clinical data,\" said Simon Sturge , Chief Operating Officer at the biopharma business of Merck. \"Our next step is to work closely with the Australian government to bring this treatment advance to patients as quickly as possible.\" \nMAVENCLADhas been subject to a comprehensive clinical development program in multiple sclerosis (MS), that includes more than 10,000 patient years of data with over 2,700 patients included in the clinical trial programs, [2] and up to 10 years of observation in some patients. \nMAVENCLADis a selective immune reconstitution therapy [3],[4] which simplifies treatment administration, by giving patients just 2 short annual courses of tablets with a maximum of 20 days of treatment over 2 years providing a lasting treatment benefit of at least 4 years. MAVENCLADworks by selectively targeting B & T lymphocytes followed by a distinct pattern of lymphocyte reconstitution, without continuous suppression of the immune system. [5] \nThis registration update for MAVENCLADin Australia follows the recent approval of MAVENCLADin Europe and in Canada . MS affects more than 23,000 Australians with most people diagnosed between the ages of 20-40. [6] Merck plans additional filings for regulatory approval in other countries, including the United States . \nMAVENCLAD Minimum Product Information: Indications: MAVENCLAD is indicated for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses and to delay the progression of physical disability. Following completion of the 2 treatment courses, no further cladribine treatment is required in years 3 and 4. Re-initiation of therapy after year 4 has not been studied. Contraindications: Patients with hypersensitivity to cladribine or to any of the tablet excipients, infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active chronic infections (tuberculosis, hepatitis), immunocompromised patients, including patients receiving immunosuppressive or myelosuppressive therapy, moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60mL/min), during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

Recommendations to avoid co-administration with potent ENT1, CNT3 and ABCG2 transporter inhibitors. Adverse reactions: Very Common: Lymphopenia (may be severe, Grade 3 or 4). Common: Rash, alopecia, oral herpes, dermatomal herpes zoster, decrease in neutrophil count. Dosage and administration: Haematological and infections screening criteria for starting and continuing therapy have to be met before initiating MAVENCLAD therapy or administering any subsequent treatment course. The recommended cumulative dose of MAVENCLAD is 3.5mg/kg body weight over 2years, administered as 1treatment course of 1.75mg/kg per year. Each treatment course consists of 2treatment weeks, one at the beginning of the first month and one at the beginning of the second month of the respective year. Each treatment week consists of 4 or 5days on which a patient receives 10mg or 20mg (one or two tablets) as a single daily dose, depending on body weight. Patients should receive no more than 2 treatment courses over two consecutive years. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. Following completion of the 2 treatment courses, no further cladribine treatment is required in year 3 and year 4. Re-initiation of therapy after year 4 has not been studied. \nBased on approved PI dated 5 December 2017 \nAbout MAVENCLAD \nMAVENCLAD(cladribine tablets) is approved in the European Union for the treatment of highly active relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). MAVENCLADis approved in Canada and Australia for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). MAVENCLADis a short-course oral therapy that selectively targets lymphocytes thought to be integral to the pathological process of relapsing MS (RMS). In August 2017 , the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization for cladribine tablets for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) in the 28 countries of the European Union (EU) in addition to Norway , Liechtenstein and Iceland . MAVENCLADis currently under clinical investigation and not yet approved for the treatment for any use in the United States . \nThe clinical development program for MAVENCLADincludes: The CLARITY (Cladribine Tablets Treating MS Orally) study: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MAVENCLADas a monotherapy in patients with RRMS. The CLARITY extension study: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study following on from the CLARITY study, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MAVENCLADover an extended administration for four years. The ORACLE MS (Oral Cladribine in Early MS) study: a two-year Phase III placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MAVENCLADas a monotherapy in patients at risk of developing MS (patients who have experienced a first clinical event suggestive of MS). The ONWARD (Oral Cladribine Added ON To Interferon beta-1a in Patients With Active Relapsing Disease) study: a Phase II placebo-controlled study designed primarily to evaluate the safety and tolerability of adding MAVENCLADtreatment to patients with relapsing forms of MS, who have experienced breakthrough disease while on established interferon-beta therapy. PREMIERE (Prospective Observational Long-term Safety Registry of Multiple Sclerosis Patients Who Have Participated in Cladribine Clinical Studies) study: interim long-term follow-up data from the prospective registry, PREMIERE, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MAVENCLAD \nThe clinical development program of Cladribine in MS comprises more than 10,000 patient years of data with over 2,700 patients included in the clinical trial program, and more than 10 years of observation in some patients. \nAbout Multiple Sclerosis \nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination. The relapsing forms of MS are the most common. \nAll Merck Press Releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

For their paper, Blanchflower and Oswald investigate claims about happiness made by the Brookings Institution\u2019s Carol Graham in her recent book, \u201cHappiness For All?\u201d In the book, Graham draws primarily on Gallup data to argue American happiness is faltering as a rational response to growing inequality. Among Graham\u2019s most striking finding is, as she puts it, \u201cmarkers of well and ill-being, ranging from life satisfaction to stress, are more unequally shared across the rich and the poor in the U.S. than they are in Latin America, a region long known for high levels of inequality.\u201d Low-income Americans are particularly skeptical that hard work will improve their economic situation. Blanchflower and Oswald wanted to see if other data sources corroborated Graham\u2019s findings. They first turn to the General Social Survey, a nationally representative survey administered every several years and used frequently in social science work. The GSS data show, unambiguously, that Americans\u2019 evaluations of their own happiness has been falling in recent years. The decline is visible across multiple demographic groups. Declines have been steepest among Americans with the least education, and the happiness gap between the most-educated and least-educated Americans has nearly doubled since 1972. Blanchflower and Oswald note the GSS data show similar trends for Americans\u2019 feelings about their finances \u2014 everyone is less optimistic about money relative to 1972, but optimism has dropped particularly sharply among the least-educated. They call these disparities a form of \u201cpsychological inequality,\u201d which is both a reflection of actual monetary inequality and a driver of it \u2014 after all, it\u2019s difficult to improve your financial situation if you don\u2019t believe your financial situation can be improved. As another marker of psychological distress, Blanchflower and Oswald look at cross-country data on the experience of pain. In 2011, the International Social Survey Programme asked respondents in over 30 nations how often they had experienced bodily aches and pains in the past month. Americans were the most likely to report frequent pain, with 34 percent saying they experienced it \u201coften\u201d or \u201cvery often.\u201d The average across all countries surveyed was just 20 percent. \u201cAs the US is one of the richest countries in the world, and in principle might be expected to have one of the most comfortable lifestyles in the world, it seems strange \u2014 to put it at its mildest \u2014 that the nation should report such a lot of pain,\u201d Blanchflower and Oswald write. Aware that some of this could be attributable to question translation issues or cultural differences (for instance, Americans may just be more predisposed to complain about pain than members of other nations), the authors ran the numbers controlling for age, gender, marital status, labor force status and education. The United States remained an outlier even when these factors were accounted for. The nation\u2019s relatively stingy social safety net may be one factor contributing to this exceptionalism. Many Americans still lack access to health care, which is available universally in most other wealthy nations. The expense of health care, even for those who have insurance, could mean Americans experiencing aches and pains are more likely to tough it out and forgo treatment, relative to people in other countries. In the United States, health issues remain a major contributor to financial insecurity, meaning they likely contribute to some of the declining happiness and financial pessimism seen in the other research surveyed by Blanchflower and Oswald. All told, the data underscore how country-level material wealth can be a poor indicator for the well being of its inhabitants. 18946079 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christopher ingraham", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "graham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david blanchflower", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blanchflower", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carol graham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew oswald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oswald", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "international social survey programme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gallup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dartmouth college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "general social survey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of warwick", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "latin america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:30.160+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "89959dd999f111d6d5069309891e80862760c771", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpSIEnhqIRh.8LgYaVdQ0iYBGj7s1oflMjZdMpfEopdFWuQ.Q_EPHZHqonnS1qE76vhqKZAhnEhKi6gJz4Hkaexx", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "https://www.hotukdeals.com/tag/audiovisual?page=5\n", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Audiovisual Deals \u21d2 Cheap price, best Sale in UK - HotUKDeals - page 5", "title": "Corsair void pro rgb wireless in black - \u00a381.98 @ Scan", "title_full": "Corsair void pro rgb wireless in black - \u00a381.98 @ Scan - HotUKDeals", "published": "2017-12-02T05:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.723, "main_image": "https://images.hotukdeals.com/threads/thread_full_screen/default/2846159_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1864, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "310754f8befdc531226b193276f389e7b42bcc49", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpSIEnhqIRh.8LgYaVdQ0iYBGj7s1oflMjZdMpfEopdFWuQ.Q_EPHZHqonnS1qE76vhqKZAhnEhKi8WvHracOKuc6m9G1tCIqjhKulH.a2wcvQ--", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "joepineapples901", "published": "2017-12-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "joepineapples901 9 h, 2 m ago That seems a pretty substantial flaw for a headset.\nIt makes it very difficult to eat with the headset on", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:31.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "89959dd999f111d6d5069309891e80862760c771", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpSIEnhqIRh.8LgYaVdQ0iYBGj7s1oflMjZdMpfEopdFWuQ.Q_EPHZHqonnS1qE76vhqKZAhnEhKi6gJz4Hkaexx", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "https://www.hotukdeals.com/tag/audiovisual?page=5\n", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Audiovisual Deals \u21d2 Cheap price, best Sale in UK - HotUKDeals - page 5", "title": "Corsair void pro rgb wireless in black - \u00a381.98 @ Scan", "title_full": "Corsair void pro rgb wireless in black - \u00a381.98 @ Scan - HotUKDeals", "published": "2017-12-02T05:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.723, "main_image": "https://images.hotukdeals.com/threads/thread_full_screen/default/2846159_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1864, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "00ef7d7588d44d445c3b81726a32a884ebf412b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpSIEnhqIRh.8LgYaVdQ0iYBGj7s1oflMjZdMpfEopdFWuQ.Q_EPHZHqonnS1qE76vhqKZAhnEhKi8WvHracOKuc8NtwwRLpmKZGP_tVPzIrNg--", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "Spark", "published": "2017-12-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Spark 2nd Dec Same here but it's gone a bit weird since I installed the Creators Update \u2026 Same here but it's gone a bit weird since I installed the Creators Update last weekend.

Here Mills shows the Sunriver Emergency Operations Plan Map, in his office in the Sunriver Police Station in Sunriver in 2013. (Andy Tullis/Bulletin file photo) 6953397 A - A + When the police chief in a community is placed on leave, the people of that community deserve a full explanation. Sunriver Police Chief Marc Mills was placed on leave Sunday, according to a story by The Bulletin\u2019s Kyle Spurr. Bend Police Capt. Cory Darling is going to step in as interim police chief. The Sunriver Service District said there is an investigation and provided no other details. That is not good enough. Mills is the police chief. He plays a pivotal role in law enforcement. The public has a right to know what prompted the investigation, the content of the investigation and what, if any, action was taken. There shouldn\u2019t be any nonsense about concealing the matter with excuses. It\u2019s all too common that public agencies insist that disclosure of details of investigations into public employees is not possible because it would violate privacy or violate personnel rules. Government is the public\u2019s business. The public is entitled to know how it functions or malfunctions and how taxpayer dollars are spent. Mills used to work for the Deschutes Sheriff\u2019s Office before taking the Sunriver job in 2012. Many people may wonder if this investigation is connected to the investigations and firings of some employees at the sheriff\u2019s office. Bend Police Chief Jim Porter said he was told by Sunriver that it is not related to the sheriff\u2019s office. It\u2019s related to work at Sunriver, he said. Porter was not told what incident or incidents prompted the investigation. Mills deserves fair treatment. He may have done nothing wrong. But if it\u2019s serious enough to prompt an investigation and have him placed on leave, the public must have full confidence that any allegation was treated seriously, the investigation was conducted correctly and any action was appropriate. 18943246 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marc mills", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mills", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim porter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "porter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyle spurr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy tullis/bulletin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cory darling", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sunriver", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sunriver police station", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sunriver service district", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bulletin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sunriver police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deschutes sheriff\u2019s office", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:29:31.060+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc1eebed3e7b4444e97142f2cc45eaf1aef5d04f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCXe4Kso0K3yykQ8x36pfoLVu2xm9ydXYBcybrOpnwakGd4mPf24H0yo_Gs3VJC5ipR6GEvpW8lkjNtGtpfPonuDwlR._qG05EB_laMI940w--", "site_full": "www.robotshop.com", "site": "robotshop.com", "site_section": "http://letsmakerobots.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Let's Make Robots! | RobotShop", "title": "Automatic Parachute deployment with Arduino", "title_full": "Automatic Parachute deployment with Arduino", "published": "2017-11-30T22:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 18392, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dc1eebed3e7b4444e97142f2cc45eaf1aef5d04f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCXe4Kso0K3yykQ8x36pfoLVu2xm9ydXYBcybrOpnwakGd4mPf24H0yo_Gs3VJC5ipR6GEvpW8lkjNtGtpfPonuDwlR._qG05EB_laMI940w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Franciscodr", "published": "2017-11-30T22:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "Automatic Parachute deployment with Arduino", "text": "Clever how you created the parachute release mechanism.
