The last one, with white soles and blue straps has been immortalised by our Didi, who never hesitat to flaunt it , even while travelling abroad, as a classic example of \u2018Make in India.\u2019\nBe that as it may, if it is winter you can see hordes of NRIs arriving, normally on the cheapest tickets by Air India, all along twitching their nose of a poor service and jostling queues at the counters.

I caught one slurping the tastiest effluent from a \u2018Puchkawala,\u2019 and frantically searching for her bottled water for washing her hand and giving me a sheepish grin.\n\u201cWhen will we change, if ever,\u201d is the retort looking at the toilets, while I try to explain the Swatchh business embarked by our nation. \u201cDon\u2019t you tell me that people relieve in the open,\u201d eyes wild and bewildered they pose. \u201cYour parents in the villages did the same too,\u201d I try to be calm and assuaging. \u201cOh!

One cannot be an NRI, if you are not identified as one wherever you go. Rolling tongue and swallowing half what is said must be an identifiable trait.

I explain, \u201cbut the crowd is the sole reason for every brand from apple to Burberry to invade Indian markets.\u201d I have not been a pleasing host at all.\nWe take a short train trip to a religious place to fulfil some ritual and have been bombarded with the safety of the trains. \u201cDo I need to take a special insurance?\u201d I say our system provides an option for that too. One is busy packing his suitcase half full of toilet papers and tissue papers. Water for cleaning?\nEeesh!

Kina (tj. isto\u010dni delovi) je bila pod okupacijom ve\u0107 \u010detiri godine, Koreja preko \u010detrdeset godina, dok su Velika Britanija, Francuska i Australija bile zauzete ratom sa Nema\u010dkom, kome su posvetile svoje ljude, resurse i pa\u017enju. \nRa\u010dunaju\u0107i da \u0107e izbaciti SAD iz Tihookeanskog podru\u010dja, ali i da bi se osvetili za pretnju iz Va\u0161ingtona o mogu\u0107em embargu na naftu koju je Japan u ogromnom postotku uvozio iz Ameirke, poluge zahuktale ratne ma\u0161inerije carskog Japana ustremile su se ka istoku. Foto: Profimedia \nJapanska flota se primicala Havajima, delu okeana gde plovidba nije bila uobi\u010dajena zbog sna\u017enih vetrova i visokih talasa. Ta ruta je odabrana kako Amerikanci ne bi saznali za primicanje ogromne japanske flote, u \u010dijem je sastavu bilo \u0161est velikih nosa\u010da aviona: Akagi, Hirju, Kaga, \u0160okaku, Sorju i Zuikaku. \nSamu akciju je predvodio Isoroku Jamamoto, jedan od najsposobnijih japanskih admirala. \"Zemlja izlaze\u0107eg sunca\" napada \nSedmog decembra ujutru, mornarica i avijacija Japana napali su Perl Harbur, pomorsku bazu na Havajima u nameri da \"obogalje\" ameri\u010dke snage na Pacifiku. Foto: Profimedia \nU ovom napadu, Japanci su uni\u0161tili tri bojna broda, 120 aviona i preko 3.300 ameri\u010dkih vojnika, a o\u0161tetili su 16 dodatnih plovila. Ipak, glavna meta nisu bile u Perlu. Nosa\u010di aviona ameri\u010dke flote otplovili su ranije na manevre, na sever. Ovaj proma\u0161aj Japanci su izgubili u akciji 29 aviona, 5 malih podmornica i oko 50 pilota. \nJapanci su pa\u017eljivo pripremili akciju napada na ameri\u010dku pomorsku bazu Pearl Harbor na ostrvu Oahu (jednom od havajskih ostrva). S druge strane, na mati\u010dnim ostrvima, japanski piloti su se dugo pripremali za napad u\u010destalim ve\u017ebama dok su \u0161pijuni omogu\u0107ili podatke o polo\u017eaju brodova. Foto: Profimedia \nAmerikanci su znali da \u0107e, pre ili kasnije, izbiti rat s Japanom, ali nisu ni mogli ni zamisliti da \u0107e Japanci napasti njihovu bazu na Perlu avionima sa nosa\u010da. Zato su u toj luci Amerikanci koncentrisali ve\u0107inu svojih brodova misle\u0107i da su sigurni i spremni za delovanje ukoliko Japanci napadnu Filipine.

The preliminary numbers are just that. In the first few days of the program, 73 people had sought benefits and a grand total of four were referenced for drug testing. No word on how many of those four showed up for testing or tested positive \u2013 or on how much the screening cost. \nBut the suspicion that our state now assigns anyone who is on welfare speaks to our darker nature \u2013 not our better angels. And it may be costing taxpayers an investment with little, if any, return. \nIn a state that has more than its fair share of families living in neighborhoods right around the corner or just up the hollow from the poverty line, where the percentage of people on public aid outstrips much of the nation, why are we drug testing folks who are being emotionally tested already? \nWhere is our unconditional helping hand up? \nThis program and the politicians who approved of it cast a \u201cholier-than-thou\u201d suspecting eye on people for no other reason than they are poor and in need of help. Well, yes, grandstanding politicians can now boast that they are tough on \u201cwelfare cheats.\u201d \nBravo. Take a bow. \nIt doesn\u2019t take much research to realize the program smacks of demagoguery, namely profiling and pointing fingers at the less fortunate, and it fails spectacularly in other states at identifying drug abusers. Let\u2019s call this what it is: a populist appeal that plays on emotions and prejudices rather than standing on the side of reason and rationale. It makes us, as a people, less caring. \nIf there is such a thing as a redeeming value of the testing program it is that if people test positive, they can still receive benefits if they agree to substance abuse treatment or a counseling program and a job skills program. \nA second drug test failure leads to suspension of benefits. A third strike? They become permanently ineligible. \nYes, permanent, when we all know full well that drug dependency is a disease and curing it often takes multiple trips to treatment \u2013 if there is an open bed. \nOver the past decade, almost all states have proposed \u2013 but not always passed \u2013 some form of screening or drug testing of applicants. But there are problems. Consider: \n\u25cf On the legal side of the equation, applicants \u2013 in many states including West Virginia \u2013 can be tested on \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d of drug use. So much for \u201cinnocent until proven guilty.\u201d \n\u201cReasonable suspicion\u201d leaves too much to interpretation and plays to an unattractive base instinct of judging people based on appearance, which \u2013 as history has shown \u2013 most often targets minorities. \n\u25cf There\u2019s the cost. The program could very well spend state tax dollars \u2013 that\u2019s your money \u2013 without significant results. Given the state of a budget struggling to stay above water, there\u2019s not a lot of spare change to pay for fishing expeditions. Proponents of these bills have said they will save dollars by getting users off the public dole. But drug-testing programs in other states haven\u2019t seen such results. \n\u25cf And then there are test results that fly in the face of stereotypes. Missouri, according to state data gathered by ThinkProgress, tested 38,970 welfare applicants in 2014, turning up 48 positive drug tests. The cost? $336,297 \u2013 or just north of $7,000 for each positive result. Between 2010 and 2014, according to the same data, Arizona tested 142,424 welfare applicants and found a grand total of three positive drug tests. In seven states with existing programs, the rate of positive drug tests to total welfare applicants ranged from 0.002 percent to 8.3 percent. The national drug use rate is 9.4 percent. \nYes, drug use among the general population is higher than among those being tested to receive welfare. \nA meaningful social welfare program is a helping hand \u2013 not a hand out \u2013 to those down on their luck.

Let\u2019s trust that any budget reductions won\u2019t cut so deep as to seriously impair efforts to keep miners safe and to combat the health issues that often arise. \nThere\u2019s also an effort by U.S. Rep. Alex Mooney, a Republican who represents West Virginia\u2019s Second Congressional District, to take a step back on another factor that became an issue after the Upper Big Branch tragedy. And that\u2019s for mining companies to be forthcoming to their investors regarding their safety performance. \nMooney has introduced legislation that would repeal a rule added to federal securities law after Upper Big Branch. That rule required publicly traded companies to include details about mining company safety violation and worker deaths in their regular financial disclosures to investors. \nThe impetus for that rule came as investors of Massey Energy complained that the company had misled shareholders by boasting about its commitment to safety while its mines had hundreds of safety violations. That, they argued, caused investors to lose money when stock prices dropped after the shareholders, led by Massachusetts\u2019 state pension fund, claimed Massey Energy Co. violated federal securities laws by trumpeting its commitment to safety while its mines had hundreds of safety violations and caused investors to lose money when stock prices fell after the explosion. Alpha Natural Resources, the company that later purchased Massey Energy and in doing so inherited the lawsuit, eventually settled it for $265 million. \nMooney characterized his repeal bill as \u201cone part of our ongoing efforts to revitalize the coal industry and bring jobs back to West Virginia,\u201d itself a noble goal. He said it would eliminate, in a \u201csmall, but significant way\u201d duplicative paperwork. \nHowever, it\u2019s difficult to imagine that ending this reporting requirement will make much impact on mining companies\u2019 bottom lines. \nAny responsibly run company would have the safety violation and worker-death information on hand, and that could fairly easily be incorporated into relevant disclosures to investors. And keeping the requirement on the books also should serve as another way to encourage companies to keep worker safety and health top of mind. \nFor the sake of miners as well as the investors, this proposal should be rejected.

It would have included a number of crosses, with signs explaining each one represents a baby aborted during a specified amount of time. \nSuch \u201ccemetery of innocents\u201d displays had been used on the campus previously. But this year, university officials changed the rules. They said the crosses could be set up only if the student group also posted signs throughout the campus with a \u201ctrigger warning\u201d that, according to a published report, \u201curged people not to view\u201d the display. \nSeeing it might cause \u201cemotional trauma\u201d for some people, university officials explained. \nThat is the idea, of course, to prompt people to stop and really think about abortion. \nNow, attorneys representing the Alliance Defending Freedom are suing the university on behalf of the students, insisting the institution violated students\u2019 free speech rights. \nInsisting that those erecting the display also post signs urging people not to view it clearly does violate the First Amendment. \nUniversity officials must have understood that before restricting the student group\u2019s free speech rights. It will not surprise you that now, they insist it was all just a misunderstanding. \u201cIf mistakes were made, they will be addressed,\u201d they added in a statement last week. \nWhat else could they say \u2013 after being caught red-handed, attempting to enforce political correctness? \nUnfortunately, the attitude of at least some Miami University officials reflects similar philosophies at many institutions of higher learning. Certain ideologies can be promoted, but some must be suppressed. Students\u2019 tender sensibilities must be protected, even though serious discussion of many issues may cause \u201cemotional trauma.\u201d And those serious discussions are absolutely necessary in a functioning, free society. \nOn too many campuses, higher education has been replaced by propagandizing. Intellectual rigor is allowed only when it will not challenge liberal orthodoxy. \nOne wonders whether the politically correct crowd understands their demand, of limited free speech, represents a contradiction in terms. \nLikely, they simply do not care.

It will expire at the end of 2018. \nThe cost-sharing talks are drawing keen attention as US President Donald Trump has called on South Korea to pay more to maintain US troops on the Korean Peninsula. \nEarlier, the US also named its own top negotiator, gearing up for the talks with South Korea that observers expect to start early next year. \u2014 YONHAP Tags:", "highlightText": "",

11:00 Viet Nam News \nALGIERS \u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron has made his first official visit to Algeria, announcing that he came as a \"friend\" despite France\u2019s historically prickly relationship with its former colony. \nTies between Paris and Algiers have defrosted in recent years, a half-century after French forces brutally cracked down on independence fighters in a 1954-62 war that left some 1.5 million Algerians dead. \nMacron, the first French president to be born after the war, told news website Tout sur l\u2019Algerie on Wednesday that he was \"ready\" to see his country hand back the skulls of Algerian resistance fighters killed in the 1850s, which are held at the Musee de l\u2019Homme in Paris. \nAlgerian and French academics have long campaigned for the return of the 37 skulls, a symbolic hangover from France\u2019s 130-year occupation of Algeria. \nMacron arrived in Algiers under bright sunshine on Wednesday after stressing that he came as \"a friend of Algeria, a constructive partner who wants to strengthen our links\". \n\"I know the history, but I am not a hostage of the past,\" he told Algerian newspapers El Watan and El Khabar by phone ahead of his visit. \n\"But from now on, I hope... that we will turn together towards the future.\" \nMacron was welcomed at Algiers airport by Senate speaker Abdelkader Bensalah, Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia and Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel. \nHe later laid a wreath at a monument in central Algiers to those killed in the war, and walked through the centre of the capital, talking with passers-by. \nMacron later held a one-hour meeting President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, 80, who has rarely appeared in public since suffering a stroke in 2013 that has affected his speech and mobility. \nHe told reporters they discussed the US decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, crisis-hit Libya and the anti-terrorism struggle in the Sahel. \nUS President Donald Trump\u2019s decision was \"regrettable\", Macron said, calling for efforts to avoid violence. \nSecurity co-operation \nDuring his election campaign in May, the French leader called his country\u2019s colonial history a \"crime against humanity\", prompting criticism from some in France and praise from Bouteflika. \nBut on a recent trip to west Africa, Macon called for \"neither denial nor repentance\", stressing that \"we cannot remain trapped in the past\". \nParis is keen to build ties with Algeria, a key player in the fight against armed groups in the Sahel, and the region\u2019s crises are likely to figure in meetings with officials. \nThe Sahel, which stretches from Senegal to Sudan, has sunk into lawlessness since chaos engulfed Libya in 2011, Islamists overran northern Mali in 2012, and Boko Haram rose up in northern Nigeria. \nFrance has praised Algeria\u2019s \"experience in the fight against terrorism and radicalisation\", a reference to its decade-long civil war in the 1990s. \nMacron is due to host talks in Paris on December 13 on \"speeding up deployment\" of a five-nation anti-terrorism force in the region. \nHe touched a nerve in Algiers by choosing its regional arch-rival, neighbouring Morocco, for his first visit to the Maghreb. \nBut accompanied by artists and business executives on his Algiers mission, he hopes to boost economic ties. \nIn his interview with Algerian newspapers, he said: \"Algeria must open up more, there are still many obstacles to investment.\" But he also pointed to \"promising fields of co-operation\" between the two countries. \nFrance remains the largest foreign employer in Algeria although it is losing market share to other European countries and China. \nOn a visit to Algiers in November, French economy minister Bruno Le Maire said it was \"time to raise the bar\". \nMacron is set to leave Algeria for Qatar on Wednesday evening. \u2014 AFP Tags:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

The specialist audience used the opportunity to discuss highly energy-efficient and economical vacuum solutions with Busch\u2019s vacuum experts. Vacuum technology plays a central role in many applications relating to the processing and treatment of plastic. Visitors came from 25 countries, and were particularly impressed by the latest generation of Mink MV claw vacuum pumps, which are ideally suited for pneumatic conveying of materials and degassing of plastics. The contact-free compression principle ensures nearly maintenance-free operation. Mink claw vacuum pumps also feature high energy efficiency in all applications, which can be even further enhanced through the use of a variable speed drive. Many visitors to the Busch trade show booth were interested in vacuum systems for degassing during plastic extrusion. Vacuum systems from the Plastex series, which have been developed specially for degassing in extruders, guarantee optimum degassing. They can be individually adjusted to the materials to be processed, extruder types, and the material throughput. Visitors to the Busch trade show booth at Fakuma also received information about energy efficiency. The topic of energy efficiency during vacuum generation was of great importance, particularly for visitors who deal intensively with energy management according to ISO 50.001 in their operations. According to the Busch vacuum specialists, it is important here that, for example, entire processes are analyzed from an energy point of view so that the vacuum technology can be applied in ways that use resources as sustainably as possible. About Busch: Busch Vacuum Pumps and Systems is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of vacuum pumps, vacuum systems, blowers and compressors. Its extensive product portfolio comprises solutions for vacuum and overpressure applications in all industries, including the chemical, semiconductor, medical technology, plastics, and food sectors. It also covers the design and construction of customized vacuum systems, as well as a global service network. The Busch group is a family-owned company and is still managed by the Busch family. Busch Vacuum Pumps and Systems has 3,000 employees in more than 60 companies in over 40 countries worldwide. Busch is headquartered in Maulburg, in southwest Germany.

Karl Busch and his wife Ayhan Busch in 1963. Dr.-Ing. Karl Busch developed the \u201cHuckepack\u201d, which was the first vacuum pump that could be used for vacuum packaging of foodstuffs. The follow-up product, the compact \u201cR 5\u201d rotary vane vacuum pump, revolutionized food packaging. A further milestone represented the development of the \u201cCOBRA\u201d screw vacuum pump. In 1971 the international expansion of the Busch group started with the founding of a sales company in the UK. The first production plant outside Germany was established in the USA in 1979.

Black Girl Magic before we knew what to call it.\ud83d\udc51 Dec 7 Black Suburb Kids AREN\u2019T Black, period. you didn\u2019t have to use your oven heat the house. your lights never got cut off. you never had to deal with gun violence. no one in your family had to move weight. you don\u2019t know what it feels like to be black. you never had to go through a metal detector to go to school. you never saw police harass your neighborhood on the daily. you never did \u201cstore runs\u201d with your cousins. you never had to wait until the 1st and 15th to get stuff from the store. you never had to share a room with your siblings. you don\u2019t know what it feels like to be black. you never had a candy lady. you never had to wait in the food stamp line. you never had to stretch your last. you would never know what oppression is. you don\u2019t know how if feels to be black. Whoops! Sorry. Didn\u2019t know there was a \u201cBlack Criteria\u201d. That\u2019s funny some black colleagues of mine still can see my color, because the white people I was around sure did notice. Asking me questions during the Civil War part of our history lesson like \u201cWas your Grandma a slave?\u201d. Nope sorry to burst your bubble Bob, she sure wasn\u2019t. Touching my hair when I never warranted it. Telling me Happy Kwanzaa instead of Merry Christmas. Telling me that I wouldn\u2019t be at any of the birthday parties because they \u201cran out of invitations\u201d, or they \u201chad mine at home and forgot it\u201d, even though we supposed to be school bffs. h or what about that time that girl in 4th grade asked me if I was excited to eat lunch because fried chicken was on the menu for the day, and the entire class turned red with laughter. Don\u2019t forget about the constant egg-shell walking because you were never quite sure when the attention would be turned on you and you\u2019d be the butt of the joke. Only of course, Black suburb child, you\u2019re too white to be around your \u201cBlacker\u201d family, so it\u2019s not like they\u2019ll understand you either. As a result I submerged myself into books, but that\u2019s weird because black people don\u2019t read. Who opens books? Reading isn\u2019t fundamental, and we absoutely don\u2019t need it to advance our culture and continue our heritage for the generations to come. Am I right? I\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t know that in order to be familiar in my full black identity I had to be raised in the hood or have hood affiliation. I\u2019m sorry that my experience being one of the only black children in a room of white faces can\u2019t get me a ticket on the Freedom Bus. I\u2019m sorry that the \u201cgood life\u201d I had means I have to shut up about rights for people of color in America. I\u2019m also sorry that because I never had to eat ramen noodles growing up that I shouldn\u2019t be upset when someone non-black makes a racially charged comment to me. I\u2019m sorry that because I never have seen someone get shot in front of me that I can\u2019t protest, or \u201cFight the Power\u201d. As if knowing you\u2019ll never be smart enough in the eyes your elementary school setting compared to other kids( but always athletic), and you\u2019ll face countless comments and snickers daily (and you cant do anything about it because you\u2019ll be the villain) from grades K-5th, isn\u2019t enough. Somewhere in between \u201cyou people\u201d and \u201cI wasn\u2019t raised to see color\u201d there was this gray area kids like me lived in, survived in, thrived in. The odds were stacked. We excelled. Because we knew that WE were the first real encounter white kids our age would have with black people, and we wanted to prove them WRONG. Kids like me had to beat every stereotype just to be taken seriously. Kids like me had to watch every move we made in an all white school because they didn\u2019t look at us the same (i.e. super predators). Kids like me had to find ways to defend MY race, just to turn around and have the people I\u2019ve been working hard to represent, tell me I\u2019m not black enough. Kids like me suffered embarrassment, isolation, confusion, disownment, inadequacy, all that. (which doesn\u2019t have ANYTHING on systematic oppression against black families, police brutality, poverty, child sex abuse, failed education systems, drug infiltration, etc., and never will) What\u2019s funny though, is when the same people yelling \u201cYou ain\u2019t even really black!!!\u201d, get up mad when they see a black person join the PHC instead of the NPHC, or choose any predominately white affiliation/organization over the black \u201cversion\u201d . Eureka! Stop calling Black Kids W E I R D for being smart. eccentric. bookworms. scientists. computer programers. art and theatre lovers. music lovers for ANY genre of music. non-Christian (went there). Harry Potter lovers. musicians of any kind. hippies. skateboarders. ETC. then get mad when they don\u2019t have very many black friends, and say they \u201cswitched up\u201d or \u201cwent to the other side\u201d. We want to be on your side, but you shut us out. We came to you first and you denied our Black-pplication. Well let us take our. . . uncultured, never wore Jordans because we were wearing Sketchers, unable to identify with \u2018The Struggle\u2019, was giving slavery presentations in the 1st grade to the possible offspring of our oppressors, stereotype breaking, \u201cyou\u2019re pretty/nice/handsome/respectable for a black person\u201d behinds on down to the welfare line, so we can figure out how much one has to endure to cash in this melanin for an \u201cofficial\u201d black card.

The deconstructed version of the Jigarthanda at the Permit Room didn't quite work for me and yet it was comforting to see this dish on the menu. If I have to pick one city for food in Tamil Nadu, it would be Madurai. Agreed, it might not have Chennai's International flavours or variety but what you get here is soul food using recipes that have stood the test of time. Madurai is also a haven for street food. From kothu parottas to mutton balls that melt in your mouth, from kari (meat) dosas that are a wholesome meal to super soft idlis, there's a food adventure waiting in almost every corner of its crowded, historic streets. This is after all one of the world's oldest living cities.Among all these culinary delights is the Jigarthanda, a cloyingly sweet dessert that is now part of the city's folklore. Of all the stalls and restaurants that sell Jigarthanda, nothing rhymes better than Jil Jil Jigarthanda (Jillu is also the Tamil word for cold).

However its at this time of year when people start planning trips for next year and if you\u2019ve not been, then we\u2019d highly recommend a visit to the \u2018Jewel of the Forth\u2019, the Isle of May.\nThe Isle of May is a national nature reserve home to thousands of breeding seabirds during the summer months, including over 40,000 pairs of Puffins (the largest puffin colony on the east coast of the UK). Its a unique experience and an opportunity to encounter nature at your feet and we mean that quite literally as you\u2019ll be walking over nesting Eider ducks and having to watch out for pecking Arctic Terns.\nThe island is open from April-September with boats sailing almost daily (weather dependent) from both the north side (Fife) and south side (Lothian) of the Firth of Forth. After you\u2019ve paid the boat fare, the island is free to enter and you can have up to three hours on the island exploring everything from the cultural history (the island is steeped in history dating back to the 7th Century), the buildings (free access to the main Stevenson lighthouse) the views and the wildlife, it really is well worth a visit.\nPeople often ask how they can support the important work we do looking after such a magnificent place like the Isle of May and we simply say; just visit. So if you\u2019ve been before or you are looking for something new, then get planning and we\u2019ll see you in 2018.\nLinks to boat companies operating to the Isle of May:\nMay Princess (sailing from Anstruther): http://www.isleofmayferry.com/ \nOsprey Rib (sailing from Anstruther): http://www.isleofmayboattrips.co.uk/ \nSeabird (sailing from North Berwick): https://seabird.org/visit/boats/isle-of-may-landings/10/22/159 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lothian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stevenson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "grey seals", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "anstruther", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north berwick", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:16:35.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4db9482b6268233994e1ed7ac6b2be652ccf1b6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9D2Qkpp6vWSMwMM8NxS2qQ4nMVF4sMvv9Bob7v5bEBIml1kqCxUqBsWUcsH9NmFAcdST4gnSdk2rSuT62fKw3axuaSDc2.X1Tb1030fxInkIX5c1CSvnaW", "site_full": "www.lse.co.uk", "site": "lse.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.lse.co.uk/share-chat.asp?page=210", "site_categories": ["united_kingdom", "travel", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Share Chat on London South East.

Having just achieved a brilliant role in Ancient Languages at Oxford University and an even more advantageous engagement, the arrival of a letter - a demand - stamped Barcelona comes like a cold hand from behind. \nHe arrives back in that old, labyrinthine and near-mythic city a few days before the great 1888 World Fair, amid dread whispers of murders - the injuries reminiscent of an ancient curse, and bearing signs of the genius 16th century anatomist, Vesalius. Daniel is soon pulled into the depths of the crime, and eventually into the tunnels below Barcelona, where his own dark past and the future of science are joined in a terrible venture - to bring the secret of Vesalius to life. Gothic and gripping, this historical thriller makes of Barcelona a diabolical character - emerging out of the dark into a new electrical age, aflame with spirit, superstition and science. Published in eighteen countries, Jordi Llobregat's bestselling first novel mixes a passionate setting and cryptic mystery into a genre-crossing phenomenon. \n\nI love thrillers that keep me guessing until the very end and this book did just that. It is a thoroughly enjoyable gothic romp through Barcelona in 1888 in the few days prior to the World Fair. \n\nIf you can imagine Dan Brown combined with Wilkie Collins then you will get an impression of the pace and style of this book. It is an easy yet gripping read that benefits from not taking itself too seriously. I think this would be the perfect read to relax with over the upcoming festivities. \n\nThis is a lovely debut novel from Jordi Llobregat that has been published in 18 countries. When I read the previously mentioned Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code   I loved it at the time but, with all due respect to Mr. Brown, I never felt inclined to pick up another of his novels (although my husband has read his entire work to date.) However, I really can envisage myself reading lots more from Mr. Llobregat when he has written them of course. \n\nISBN: 978 1784293055 \n\nPublisher: Riverrun \n\nAbout the Author: \n\n\nJordi has a passion for cities, and in particular their historical evolutions and transformations. His mother\u2019s side of the family hails from Barcelona, and his great grandfather worked in the forge that produced Pere Falqu\u00e9s\u2019 famous modernist lampposts found on the Paseo de Gracia. Jordi began writing at the age of twelve after watching the film The Man from Acapulco with Jean Paul Belmondo and Jacqueline Bisset.\n\nHe currently combines writing with his work as head of a company that works on community development in cities. His work has been included in several short story anthologies.\n\nHe is director of the noir fiction festival, Valencia Negra.

The Russia probe had finally netted a big fish.\nAs the details of the Flynn indictment seeped out into the press, however, the bombshell was revealed as another dud. To the dismay of many Trump opponents, nothing in Flynn\u2019s rap sheet demonstrated collusion with Russia. Instead, the indictment undermined the Russiagate narrative while implicating another, much more inconvenient foreign power in a plot to meddle in American politics.\nAccording to plea agreement Flynn signed with Mueller, Flynn admitted to lying to the FBI about a phone call he placed to the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergei Kislyak, during the transition period between the election and inauguration \u2014 not during the campaign. Flynn\u2019s first order of business with the Russian diplomat was to beseech him not to retaliate for sanctions imposed by Obama on Russia for still-unproven allegations that Russian intelligence agencies hacked the Democratic National Committee. In other words, Flynn was caught trying to influence Russia, not the other way around.\nThe only area where Flynn proposed any form of coordination with Russia was in defeating ISIS and Al Qaeda in Syria. The Trump administration\u2019s attempts to collaborate with its Russian counterparts in Syria have been the target of relentless sabotage from an opportunistic media and Obama era national security officials who considered the catastrophic semi-covert operation to arm Syrian insurgents a part of their legacy. Thanks to stifling Cold War atmosphere these elements have cultivated in Washington, the US has been reduced to an impotent bystander while Russia, Iran, and Turkey have joined together to impose an end to the proxy war that has ravaged Syria for the past five years.\nTo be sure, Flynn indictment did contain a stunning revelation of collusion between Team Trump and a foreign state. But it was not the country that the national media has obsessed over for the past year.\nFlynn was found by the FBI to have lobbied Kislyak to exercise Russia\u2019s veto against the passage of a United Nations security council resolution condemning the growth of Israel\u2019s illegal settlements. And he did so under orders from Jared Kushner, the presidential son-in-law and Middle East fixer, who was himself acting on behalf of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nThanks to Flynn\u2019s indictment, we now know that the Israeli prime minister was able to transform the Trump administration into his own personal vehicle for undermining Obama\u2019s lone effort to hold Israel accountable at the UN. A clearer example of a foreign power colluding with an American political operation against a sitting president has seldom, if ever, been exposed in such glaring fashion.\nKushner\u2019s deep ties to the Israeli right-wing and ethical breaches \nThe day after Kushner was revealed as Flynn\u2019s taskmaster, a team of researchers from the Democratic Super PAC American Bridge found that the presidential son-in-law had failed to disclose his role as a co-director of his family\u2019s Charles and Seryl Kushner Foundation during the years when his family\u2019s charity funded the Israeli enterprise of illegal settlements. The embarrassing omission barely scratched the surface of Kushner\u2019s decades long relationship with Israel\u2019s Likud-led government.\nDuring the 1990\u2019s, a teenaged Jared Kushner was forced to vacate his own bedroom so Netanyahu had a place to stay when he was in New York City for business. Since at least 2006, the Kushners have donated at least $315,000 to the Friends of the IDF, the American fundraising arm of the Israeli military, and tens of thousands of dollars to illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, from Beit El to Gush Etzion.\nThe Kushner family foundation has even donated to the Od Yosef Chai yeshiva, a West Bank-based Jewish religious institution that has served for a base of radical settler terror attacks against Palestinian villagers. The yeshiva has been led by a pair of rabbis who produced a genocidal tract that the Israeli newspaper Maariv described as \u201c230 pages on the laws concerning the killing of non-Jews, a kind of guidebook for anyone who ponders the question of if and when it is permissible to take the life of a non-Jew.\u201d\nTo orchestrate his futile attempt to scuttle a diplomatic imperative of the Obama administration, Netanyahu drew on these deep ties to the Kusher family. There are troubling indications that his intelligence agencies shared material that it gathered by spying on the US with Kushner and the Trump transitional team.\nEli Lake, a neoconservative columnist for Bloomberg who frequently relies on sources from both Trump and Netanyahu\u2019s inner circles, reported that Israel\u2019s \u201cenvoys shared their own intelligence about the Obama administration\u2019s lobbying efforts to get member states to support the [UN] resolution with the Trump transition team.\u201d\nThe subtext here was clear: Israel, a country that surveilled American diplomats during Iran deal negotiations in 2015 and which is notorious for its espionage across the West, had spied on the Obama administration during the lead-up to the UN vote and shared its \u201cintelligence\u201d with the Trump team. Once again, collusion has seldom been demonstrated as clearly or disturbingly as this.\nA Clinton mega-donor defends Kushner\u2019s collusion \nSo why isn\u2019t this angle of the Flynn indictment getting more attention? An easy explanation could be deduced from the stunning spectacle that unfolded this December 2 at the Brookings Institution, where the fresh-faced Kushner engaged in a \u201ckeynote conversation\u201d with Israeli-American oligarch Haim Saban.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been in the news the last few days, to say the least. But you\u2019ve been in the news about an issue that I personally want to thank you for, because you and your team were taking steps to try and get the United Nations Security Council to not go along with what ended up being an abstention by the US,\u201d Saban remarked to Kushner. \u201cAs far as I know there was nothing illegal there but I think that this crowd and myself want to thank you for making that effort.\u201d\nKushner nervously scanned the room, mumbled \u201cthank you\u201d to his host and forced an uncomfortable smile.\nSaban\u2019s political background lent special significance to his robust defense of Trump\u2019s son-in-law. Having earned his fortune in television and the Israeli telecom industry, he has become one of the Democratic Party\u2019s most generous individual donors. Saban\u2019s millions funded the construction of Democratic National Committee\u2019s headquarters and filled the campaign coffers of Bill and Hillary Clinton. In 2012, as a reward for Saban\u2019s handsome Super PAC donations to Obama, the president nominated the billionaire\u2019s wife \u2014 a former Playboy \u201cDisco Queens\u201d model and children\u2019s fashion designer with no diplomatic experience \u2014 as special US representative to the United Nations general assembly.\nThe spectacle of a top Democratic Party money man defending one of the Trump administration\u2019s most influential figures was clearly intended to establish a patina of bipartisan normalcy around Kushner\u2019s collusion with the Netanyahu government. Saban\u2019s effort to protect the presidential son-in-law was supplemented by an op-ed in the Jewish Daily Forward headlined, \u201cJared Kushner Was Right To \u2018Collude\u2019 With Russia \u2014 Because He Did It For Israel.\u201d\nWhile the Israel lobby ran interference for Kushner, the favorite pundits of the liberal anti-Trump \u201cResistance\u201d minimized the role of Israel in the Flynn saga. MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow, who has devoted more content this year to Russia than to any other topic, appeared to entirely avoid the issue of Kushner\u2019s collusion with Israel.\nThere is simply too much at stake for too many to allow any disruption in the preset narrative. From the journalist pack that followed the trail of Russiagate down a conspiracy infested rabbit hole to the Clintonites seeking excuses for their mind-boggling campaign failures to the Cold Warriors exploiting the panic over Russian meddling to drive an unprecedented arms build-up, the narrative must go on, regardless of the facts.\nMax Blumenthal is a senior editor of the Grayzone Project at AlterNet , and the award-winning author of Goliath , Republican Gomorrah , and The 51 Day War .
