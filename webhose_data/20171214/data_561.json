Well, Stevens has written a lengthy essay that addresses that very question. Read it here: \nTONYA HARDING, MY STAR \nby Sufjan Stevens \nI\u2019ve been trying to write a Tonya Harding song since I first saw her skate at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in 1991. She\u2019s a complicated subject for a song partly because the hard facts of her life are so strange, disputable, heroic, unprecedented, and indelibly American. She was one of the greatest figure skaters of her time, and the first American woman to perform a triple axle in an international competition. She was an unlikely skating star, having been raised working class in Portland, Oregon. Being a poor outsider, her rise to fame in the skating rink was seen, by some, as a blemish on a sport that favored sophistication and style. Tonya\u2019s skating technique was feisty, fierce, and full of athleticism, and her flamboyant outfits were often hand-made by her mother (who was abusive and overbearing). (They couldn\u2019t afford Vera Wang.) And then there was the Nancy Kerrigan incident. In January 1994, Tonya\u2019s then-boyfriend Jeff Gillooly hired an assailant, Shane Stant, to break fellow figure skater Nancy Kerrigan\u2019s leg at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships at Cobo Arena in Detroit, so that she would be unable to compete at the upcoming Winter Olympics. The after-math of the attack was recorded on camera and ultimately set off a media frenzy (and an FBI investigation). Gillooly and Stan were eventually found guilty, and Tonya pleaded guilty to hindering the prosecution, and was subsequently banned for life from the U.S. Figure Skating Association. Nancy Kerrigan recovered from her injury and won a silver medal at the Winter Olympics. Tonya Harding finished eighth. \nBut that\u2019s not even half the story. When Tonya and Gillooly got married, they filmed themselves having sex on their wedding night and produced one of the first-ever celebrity sex tapes (which they sold to Penthouse for $200,000 each). Tonya also had a brief career as a boxer, and is most famous for her bout with former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones (whose sexual harassment suit against Bill Clinton precipitated his impeachment in 1998). Tonya was also (very briefly) in a band called the Golden Blades (they were allegedly booed off the stage during their first and only performance). She also raced vintage automobiles (setting a record by driving a Ford Model A over 97 miles per hours on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah). And in 1996 Tonya used mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to revive an 81-year-old woman who collapsed at a bar in Portland while playing video poker. That\u2019s a lot to accomplish before the age of 30! \nTonya Harding\u2019s dramatic rise and fall was fiercely followed by the media, and she very quickly became the brunt of jokes, the subject of tabloid headlines and public outcry. She was a reality TV star before such a thing even existed. But she was also simply un-categorical: American\u2019s sweetheart with a dark twist. But I believe this is what made her so interesting, and a true American hero. In the face of outrage and defeat, Tonya bolstered shameless resolve and succeeded again and again with all manners of re-invention and self-determination. Tonya shines bright in the pantheon of American history simply because she never stopped trying her hardest. She fought classism, sexism, physical abuse and public rebuke to become an incomparable American legend. \nI admit, early drafts of this song contained more than a few puns, punch lines and light-hearted jabs\u2014sex tapes and celebrity boxing make for an entertaining narrative arc. But the more I edited, and the more I meditated, and the more I considered the wholeness of the person of Tonya Harding, I began to feel a conviction to write something with dignity and grace, to pull back the ridiculous tabloid fodder and take stock of the real story of this strange and magnificent America hero. At the end of the day, Tonya Harding was just an ordinary woman with extraordinary talent and a tireless work ethic who set out to do her very best. She did that and more. I hope the same can be said of us all.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tonya harding", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sufjan stevens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy kerrigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stevens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tonya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tonya harding", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vera wang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shane stant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff gillooly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gillooly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paula jones", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. figure skating association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cobo arena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "detroit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arkansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:09.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d966656b6b377329cddac2c1d059a313d98ba4ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21QhIqDBNAks71FyqZ7WmwWEfrJSImIfcXCZcA3NysxYOvFcPSk0L2S6_pSfAIcn4osPJG.BMGRGTrppQcO3cWAI", "site_full": "adolfo-payes.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://adolfo-payes.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "adolfo pay\u0102\u0160s -

Heute f\u00e4llt der Startschuss. Auch diesmal werden wieder ausl\u00e4ndische Produkte angeboten. Dies hat mehrere Gr\u00fcnde. \nSeit f\u00fcnf bis sechs Jahren setzen Fritz Dick und Co. nicht nur auf Schweizer Material, sondern auch auf jenes von ausl\u00e4ndischen Armeen. In diesem Jahr gibt es Artikel aus Italien, \u00d6sterreich, Deutschland, Frankreich, England, Niederlande, Bulgarien, USA und der Slowakei zu kaufen. Das Hauptangebot kommt allerdings aus der Schweiz \u2013 15 bis 20 Prozent stammen aus dem Ausland. Was ist der Grund dieser Ausland-Strategie? Es gebe nun mal Artikel von ausl\u00e4ndischen Armeen, die moderner seien oder die es in der Schweiz nicht gibt, sagt Fritz Dick. So bei- spielsweise Tarnfarbe, moderne Rucks\u00e4cke und Pullover sowie Schlafs\u00e4cke. \u00abDie Schweizer Armee dagegen ist stark bei Ledermaterialien und Faltlaternen\u00bb, sagt Dick. Lederg\u00fcrtel haben Kultcharakter \nEin weiteres neues Angebot h\u00e4ngt mit dem Ausland zusammen: Aus einem \u00dcberschuss von Schweizer Rohstoffen werden neue Accessoires. Sie werden in Bulgarien und Ungarn produziert. So entstehen aus Tarnstoff neue Regenm\u00e4ntel oder aus Schlafsackmaterialien neue Westen. Beliebt bei den Besuchern seien laut Dick insbesondere die Armee-Schokolade, die Gn\u00e4gi-Trikots von Alt-Bundesrat Rudolf Gn\u00e4gi, Pelerinen, Tarnnetze, Schlafs\u00e4cke oder Lederg\u00fcrtel, die schon fast Kult seien. \nIm Zentrallager in Lyss werden die Artikel gelagert dies in einer riesigen Menge. \u00abVerschiedene Waren haben wir f\u00fcnf oder sogar mehr Jahre am Lager\u00bb, sagt Dick. Denn der Schweizer Binnenmarkt sei zu klein, um die Artikel in nur einem Jahr abzusetzen. Diese grosse Lagermenge hat einen Vorteil: Denn so kann das Sortiment vor Ort an den Liquidationen t\u00e4glich ersetzt werden. \u00abDiesen Service erwarten die Kunden auch von uns.\u00bb Erstaunlich: Die Produkte sind billiger als im Ausland. Dies hat mehrere Gr\u00fcnde. Erstens k\u00f6nnen die Veranstalter die ausl\u00e4ndischen Produkte aufgrund des starken Frankens billiger einkaufen, was laut Dick den Kunden weitergegeben werde. Zweitens br\u00e4uchten sie keine teuren Verkaufsstellen, da die Produkte direkt eingekauft, ins Lager gebracht und schliesslich an den Messen verkauft w\u00fcrden. Und drittens k\u00f6nnten sie auf die Lagerbuchhaltung via Computer verzichten. \u00abWir sind nun schon so lange im Gesch\u00e4ft, dass es Erfahrungssache ist, den \u00dcberblick \u00fcber den Lagerbestand zu haben.\u00bb \nWas auff\u00e4llt: Waffen sind im Sortiment keine zu finden.

For weeks across the world, fans of the late Fela Anikulapo-Kuti have been celebrating what they call \u2018Felabration\u2019. But there is a forgotten  icon that will not be remembered by Fela\u2019s  fans, yet, without him, the late musician would have been unknown. Deputy Editor Adewale Adeoye digs up the file of Fela\u2019s grandfather,  the man who gave Africa some of today\u2019s most celebrated melodies. \n  The world of late Fela Anikulapo Kuti\u2019s  fans across the world has been lit up since barely a month ago, when Afrobeat music lovers began to rekindle the spirit of the legend, whose music and rebellious lifestyle, banished despair largely among the oppressed.  At Gbemisola street, Ikeja in Lagos, where his remains were interned since 1997, visitors from across the world have been visiting. Some kissed the cenotaph. Some cried. Many merely went there to pray that his soul be in eternal peace. \n But there was is the untold story of a man, of who little is known but without whom Fela would not have been. Even among his relations, the man\u2019s name like  the strange mew of a mid night cat, rings only a faint bell, despite his monumental contributions to the Christendom beginning from 1865, when he was less than puberty age. \n He was Fela\u2019s grandfather. He was equally the great grandfather of Nobel Laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka. If he was not a heroic icon, the British Museum would not be keeping some of his precious melodies, which he composed between 1800s and 1921, the year he visited England, a sort of evergreen intellectual property. When the late Prof. Olikoye Ransome-Kuti visited England, as recent as 1999, before his death, in that same England, a curator at the British Museum had asked him: \u2018Did you know Canon J.J Ransome Kuti\u2019, to whom Olikoye had responded with curious excitement: \u2018Yes. He was my grandfather.\u2019 The Brit went into the archive and brought a collection of music, by the late Canon, now converted into CD. A dazed Olikoye was reported by a journalist who interviewed him before his death to have said he was shocked to listen to his grandfather\u2019s voice, not in Abeokuta, his ancestral home, but right in far away British Museum. \n  No doubt, many people across the world, except some obscured researchers,  may never know much about him. Even his blood-bound relations do not have enough information about the man J.J Ransome-Kuti. The Nation met one of his great grandchildren, a middle aged lady, penultimate Saturday morning at her family home. She walked down the staircase, probably jumping over the steps, two at a time. Her maids had earlier caged three frightening dogs that keep vigil at the down alley apartment, located in the Anthony Village area of Lagos. She is a lawyer, and one in a third generation of the Kuti family. The oval face is the same as that of many of her genealogical peers. On that Saturday morning, she would soon be going for Felabration at the Shrine, where his cousins, Femi and Seun were billed to perform later post noon of that Saturday. \u2018Did you remember J.J Ransome Kuti?         The Nation asked Mrs Morenike Ledum, daughter of late Dr. Beko Ransome-Kuti. She is one of those who, at least has some faint memory of the late J.J Ransome Kuti. She has some scanty information on her great grandfather, except  that the memory is not enough to write a chapter in the life of a man who was reputed to have converted more people to Christianity, than any one in the last century and of whose songs are some of the most treasured diamonds at the prestigious British Museum and many Christian libraries across the world. \n \u2018What I know about him are those things handed down to me by my father\u2019, says Morenike. She is not the only one that knows little about a great music maestro nicknamed by the colonial masters as \u2018the Singing Minister\u2019 and who was nurtured to fame in Abeokuta at the ancient St Peters Cathedral, the first Church known to have been built on any land in Nigeria and one of Africa\u2019s oldest. The Nation gathered that the late Josiah Jesse Ransome-Kuti was a man who made unparallel contributions to the music world and to the Christendom, but of whom little is known to have been written. \nOldies who spoke to The Nation in Abeokuta, the capital of Ogun State and the ancestral home of the Kutis, did so with remarkable reverence yet with a lost sense of nostalgia. \u2018I do not think anyone has made contributions to the music history and the development of the Christendom more than Rev J.J Ransome Kuti, though little has been written about him and he has not been honoured by anyone\u2019, Pa Sowumi, who claimed his great grandfather, born in 1800, knew the late J.J, told The Nation at Abeoluta last Sunday. One old woman who is 100 plus said she remembers stories about the \u2018singing minister\u2019 who fought tooth and nail to wipe off idol worshiping in many West African communities, including Abeokuta and its environs. \u2018Ha, baba J.J. He was a great man. He fought the wizards and the Witches of the time. He fought the Ogboni confraternity. He won the battle,\u2019 another old woman of Ibadan origin, who said the late clergyman married from the Kudeti family in Ibadan, told The Nation. \n    Some near extinct old natives of Abeokuta spoke of stories passed on to them including how the late J.J used to go from one house to the other with a \u2018magic lantern\u2019 that captured the picture of Jesus Christ and that of Jerusalem. One source claimed that J.J used to spend the whole of his Sunday, beginning with the Sunday service up to the evening service in the late 1800s to 1930, the year he died. You can imagine children of Abeokuta in a Sunday school in the years around 1885: what kind of cloth did they put on? What kind of bible were they reading? How did they accept a new teaching about one God so different in history and conception, than the Sango, Orunmila and the Obatala that they had been used to? Even then, who was the first person to approach J.J, asking him to drop the believe in God through other means, other than Jesus Chirst? \n   Somehow, if there is a music gene in the human body, it is likely that Fela must have inherited the gene from his unsung grandfather. Imagine the evergreen melodies of J.J, one of which is the popular wake-up call on Chanels TV:  \u2018Kole baje o, kole baje o, ise oluwa\u2026\u2026..\u2019 \n\n\n   A very popular Sunday school Christian music, Eje ko mode O wa o, eje ko mode owa,\u2026 jojolo, omo kekerre jojolo awon looore Eledumare, eje komode O wa\u2019 (Let the little ones cluster around God, innocent jellies of which children are, the icons admired most by God, let the children, the little ones cluster around Him.\u2019 J.J composed the popular Egba Anthem \u2018Lori Oke ati Petele, Ibe lagbe bimi si o,\u2026\u2026Ibe lagbe tomi dagaba o, ile Ominira.\u2019 (Up hills and down the plains, there I was born, there was I liberated into manhood, Oh liberated soul-translated by Baba Oluwide). This track has been reinvigorated by the Juju musician, Ebenezer Obey and has become popular in the entire South West was .  Baba Omojola, 75, whose father, a clergy man, Pa Oluwide, the first ordained priest in Northern Nigeria-born in 1886, first to establish a non-governmental school in Northern Nigeria, St Michael Primary School-and who knew the late J.J in a chat with The Nation quoted his father as saying: \u2018My father told me J.J was the greatest of all the African music composers of the early 19th century.\u2019 He was responsible for composing some of the most famous hymns of the Anglican Church but that as it was the practice in those days, communities, rather than individuals, were the custodians of such intellectual properties, meaning that some of such melodies were not authored by those who composed them. For a man of whom little has been recorded, controversy on all his trademarks should be expected. One source said he composed this listed track, another said he merely translated it into Yoruba: \u2018Abide with me fast falls the evening tide, the darkness deepens; Lord with me abide, when other helpers fail and comfort flee, abide with me.\u2019 (Wa ba mi gbe ale fere le tan\u2026okun kun su\u2026). One source said J.J composed over 200 scintillating music tracks, many of which have been \u2018hijacked\u2019 by the English society as being original to it. \nOne of those listed is \u2018Like a bird in the deep, far away from its nest, I had wandered, my saviour from thee. But thy dear loving voice, called me home to Thy nest, and I knew there was welcome home.\u2019 \n    Some reliable archival sources told The Nation that J.J was a great player of the church organ. He was said to have played the organ in a way that attracted so many pagans, or non-Christian believers into the faith of what was known as the new world. \nWho really is J.J Ransome Kuti?. The story goes thus: There was a certain man of the tribe of Egba. His name was Josiah Jesse Ransome Kuti, the son of a certain Olikoye also of Abeokuta. The name Ransome, he was thought to have adopted having dropped his traditional middle name owing to pressure from the missionaries or rather due to his conviction that Christian believes were better than the orthodox. He was born in Abeokuta on June 15, 1855, the very year of turbulence in the history of the ancient city, at a time Abeokuta was besieged by men and women soldiers from Dahomey, but who were on three occasions defeated by Abeokuta\u2019s ancient warriors. \n  Mark you: Rev J.J Ransome Kuti should not be confused with Rev Oladotun Israel Ransome-Kuti, the first Principal of the famous Abeokuta Grammar School, Fela\u2019s father and husband of the late Mrs Funmilayo Ransome Kuti, the woman who was the only female Nigerian delegate to the various constitutional conferences in pre-independent Nigeria. Both were clergymen. Both were famous. But one came before the other. J.J was Isreal\u2019s father. J.J had eight children, three boys and five girls. In what appeared his own corset handwriting source from one of his great grandchildren, he listed the children thus: Josiah Oluyinka, born Feb 27, 1888, Anne Lape Iyalode, Oct., 20 1885, Isreal Oladotun, (Fela\u2019s father), April 30, 1891, Joshua Oleremi, Jan 6 1894, Victoria Suranah, June 20, 1899, Olusegun Olusade, June 29, 1902. He listed two children who died in the same year, to be Olufela Daniel and Susnnah Olubode. Both died in 1889. J.J\u2019s second daughter begot a grandson, famous for his stainless steel-heart, and literature. His name is Prof Wole Soyinka, the first African to win the Nobel Price for Literature. But there are some unknown facts about all the children, expecially his first born Josiah and family members speak about him with little knowledge about what fate befell him. \n   On one account, he was said to have had children, that he was an aide of the then Alake of Egbaland and that he was a rebel against the sacred social order. Little of the man is known till date. But the man was said to have given birth to children, some of whose lineages, now very advanced in years, live probably somewhere in Abeokuta. \n   J.J was a curate under Rev D.O Williams until January 1911 when Williams died, leaving him to take over the activities of the Church. Ancient sources say J.J would seat upon a seat by the temple, to compose his music. In the night, he would hang out to curse the witches, beckoning on the dark imps of which he had been empowered by God to humiliate, empower and deride, by virtue of his own newly acquired \u2018power of the Holy Spirit.\u2019 Though there were no records of any persecution that J.J might have suffered from the hands of a society that knew nothing apart from oracles and superstitions, but being banished and ex-commununicated by the largely superstitious and awe-ruled society of the time, was normal. At least the time he was born was a glorious peak for the dreaded Ogboni Confraternity and a time Kings were buried with hundreds of slaves thought would serve the royal, in the world beyond. J.J was reputed to have converted so many homes and families in Egbaland and beyond into Christianity, mostly using his mastery of the Church organ and his infinite ability to convert any little scene into music and dance.   He was said to have been described by the missionaries of his time as a \u2018honest, disciplined and transparent\u2019 man who lived and died as a devout Christian.  The Nation gathered that many of the greatest hits composed by him may have been adopted by western musicians, who have unlimited source to the British archive. \u2018He had a sonorous voice. He would sing all night to the delight of villagers. He was a wizard on the Church organ and a nightingale when he sings his chorus, with a scintillating baritone voice\u2019 one source told The Nation. \nOne of his greatest achievements was his infinite attribute of interpreting English hymns into Yoruba. \n   Leader of Yoruba Amnesty, Alfa Jubril Ogundimu says the lack of any outstanding trace of J.J\u2019s tremendous contributions to the world of politics and the art \u2018further depicts the dilemma of the black man, especially Nigeria as a people that lacks a sense of history.\u2019 Hear him: \u2018We have a government that does not keep records. We have a nation that does not care about history, worse still, we have a nation that cares less about her past.\u2019 He is of the opinion that since J.J was the first Nigerian clergyman to be made a Cannon, at a time when that revered title was the prerequisite of white men, his burial ground, should have been made a tourist attraction in Nigeria. Baba is optimistic that millions of Christians would wish to \u2018visit the graveside and pay homage to him. \u2019He describes wherever his remains lay, 78 years ago after he died,   \u2018remains a bundle of wealth perished underneath.\u2019 Unfortunately, not even J.J\u2019s relations know where J.J\u2019s  remains are buried. \nYet, his contributions to the Christian world are no doubt a sharp contrast to the faith of many of this offspring. For instance, how would Fela, who never believed in Christianity and lived a life ordained by Orisa, had felt if he had lived at a time his grandfather used to read Psalm 121 \u2018I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.?\u2019 Ogundimu says that scenario seems as important as imagining Canon J.J listening to Fela\u2019s famous lyric; \u2018My people, my people them go follow bishop, Amen, then go follow Pope Amen\u2026\u2026everyday na church, everyday na mosque\u2026\u2026... .my people, let us forget those gadem churches, those gadem mosques, including kerubu and sherabuuum uu.\u2019 But a fan of Fela says the diversity and plurality of thoughts and philosophy in the Kuti family of which both J.J and Fela represents remains one of the greatest sources of strength for the Kutis, a family reckoned globally for its many feats in art, music and science. \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

torn apart by ideas of hate, homophobia, racism and sexism. There is one politically motivated band out to destroy that creed, one song at a time. The hero band are the Downtown Boys and last night Auckland was very lucky to witness their destructive live show at Whammy bar. \nDowntown Boys are a five piece political punk band who, since 2012, have been using music as a form of protest against any type of discrimination. Fronted by Victoria Ruiz with support of longtime guitarist Joey La Neve DeFrancesco, they continue to perform their electrifying songs to audiences around the world and it was time for Auckland to get a glimpse of modern protest punk. \nDowntown Boys released their third album Cost of Living which was produced by legendary punk musician Guy Picciotto who is known for his role as guitarist in the nineties emo post-hardcore band Fugazi. \nBeing a major fan of Fugazi, I was curious to listen to the album in order to see if the band who have been described by Rolling Stone Magazine as \u201cAmerica\u2019s most exciting punk band\u201d were as good as they say. Truthfully I have never been a fan of pure punk music and wasn\u2019t too thrilled by the album but nevertheless I was eager to catch them live. \nOpening up for Downtown Boys was Auckland punk band, Hagseed who played an aggressively loud set which was entertaining and fun to watch. Definitely a perfect choice to open for Downtown Boys. \nDowntown Boys eventually played an hour after they were meant to start but hey, no bar show is ever on time. \nKicking off the set with full noise and full power, they drove straight into song off the latest album Clara Rancia . The show felt empty to start with but as soon as the rumbling punk tune could be heard, the room packed out and they grabbed everyone\u2019s attention. \nDisplaying amazing stage presence, the band would not stop moving and jumping around the stage. \nBefore continuing on the set with the second song, Joey shared with the crowd how crazy he felt being in New Zealand, having hailed all the way from Rhode Island. \u201cWe never thought we would be playing here\u201d he stated, I\u2019m sure any band of their popularity status would be thinking the same. \nThe show was a full on punk party, the saxophone added a touch of dance to the sound, as well a kind of seventies protopunk vibe. \nBetween each song, Victoria would discuss the meaning behind the song to come and would discuss issues that needed to be solved and stopped which would be met with cheers and claps. \nI have to hand it to Victoria, she\u2019s an amazing punk frontwoman. Engaging strongly with the crowd, passing audience members the microphone to sing, as well as jumping into the crowd to have a little dance with audience members at the back. She had also done her research on New Zealand before playing and offered some insight to what she had learnt from her trip to the museum that day, also sharing what an ex-member told her, who happened to be part Maori. \nPlaying a strong but short fifty minute set, the band ended with an explosive finale. Running around the stage and messing with their instruments, the saxophonist did not power down his manic dance routine throughout the show, finishing off with him ploughing his saxophone into the stage fan whilst pulling apart his instrument, truly outstanding showmanship and a real attention grabber. \nIt was safe to say I loved every minute of the performance, but my one negative opinion was that the microphone levels were too low, I could barely hear what Victoria was saying and her insightful lyrics ended up wasted having been drowned out, but then again when have I ever been to a bar show where the vocals were one hundred percent? \nAre Downtown Boys America\u2019s most exciting punk band right now? I could almost say yes, yes they are, that is before Me First and the Gimme Gimmes who I witnessed earlier this year. Downtown Boys truly tore the stage apart before King Gizzard could get the chance to outshine them later this week (another treat I eagerly look forward for). \nI am incredibly eager to see where this band will go from here, but I hope it\u2019s even more successful, they deserve it. \nJonathan Strock \nClick on any image to view a photo gallery by Reuben Raj:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "victoria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan strock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hagseed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guy picciotto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victoria ruiz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clara rancia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuben raj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joey la neve defrancesco", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "king gizzard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fugazi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rolling stone magazine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states of america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rhode island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victoria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auckland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:10.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "250d5e7e99b0fd90de43409fe34f05bf4a0c938b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8ziv3qTXG4lrDLkZWQNuP5IlcGf29WgsrkZBv5iiXkCnUdCDexNrNmuXOmwwO7vc-", "site_full": "viktorysayd.livejournal.com", "site": "livejournal.com", "site_section": "http://viktorysayd.livejournal.com/data/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "\u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u041c\u0438\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e", "title": "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442 \u0436\u0438\u043b\u044c\u044f \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0439 \u0421\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0418\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0432\u044b", "title_full": "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442 \u0436\u0438\u043b\u044c\u044f \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0439 \u0421\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0418\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0432\u044b", "published": "2017-12-07T08:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/viktorysayd/53169117/24529/24529_800.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "250d5e7e99b0fd90de43409fe34f05bf4a0c938b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8ziv3qTXG4lrDLkZWQNuP5IlcGf29WgsrkZBv5iiXkCnUdCDexNrNmuXOmwwO7vc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T08:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442 \u0436\u0438\u043b\u044c\u044f \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0439 \u0421\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0418\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0432\u044b", "text": "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442 \u0436\u0438\u043b\u044c\u044f \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0439 \u0421\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0418\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0432\u044b \u0432\u043e\u0442 \u0442\u0430\u043a. \u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442...

Though they were given little chance to advance after landing in the same group as the Premier League and Serie A leaders, Napoli. \n(Watch Fonseca turn up in a zorro mask:) \nCredit: @ PietroSalvatori \nAgainst the odds, Shakhtar booked their place in the knock out stages with 12 points on the board. \nEven the most optimistic Shakhtar fans had doubts about qualifying to the next stage. So much so the boss promised he'd don a zorro mask and cape if his side made it. \nA promise is a promise. A man of his word.

Even the translator put on a mask, too. Class. \n\"This is the most joyful press conference of my career,\" the Portuguese said via BBC . Shakhtar players celebrate opening the scoring. Image: PA \n\"I feel great joy. I think not only Shakhtar's supporters but all Ukrainians have to be proud of our team,\" he added. \nFonseca's charges could face the likes of Manchester United, Liverpool, Paris Saint-Germain or Barcelona, among others, ahead of Monday's draw. \nWe could had seen these kind of antics in the Premier League. \nFonseca was recently linked with the Everton job until they appointed 'Big Sam'. \nTake a bow, Paulo.

to East Kilbride on Saturday to play a gruelling two full-length matches against the remaining teams in their pool. \nAnd their match against Edinburgh proved to be a nail-biter, with an early lead by Borders gradually whittled down and the match too close to call until the final minute. \nEuphoria from the victory helped to overcome the immense fatigue amongst the small squad of nine, and following an hour or so of rest, Borders were back on court to face Aberdeen\u2019s elite. \nAberdeen put up a strong performance in the early stages, with the score remaining tight, but Borders gradually pulled away, buoyed on by the lure of an overall pool win. \nThree wins from three in their Performance League pool is an exceptional result for a small, rural squad. \nBorders awaits

At the same time you'll have to forget the superstitious hatred you have of each other. This will only be done outside of the city, away from the war. Every one of you who is capable should go out voluntarily, bringing some fraction of the knowledge that needs sharing. You won't be harmed if you go in good faith. And you will learn how to live with this planet, rather than against it. Eventually you'll have civilized communities that won't be either 'grubber' or 'junkman.' They'll be Pyrran.\" \"But what about our city here?\" Kerk asked. \"It'll stay right here--and probably won't change in the slightest. In the beginning you'll need your perimeter and defenses to stay alive, while the people are leaving. And after that it will keep going because there are going to be any number of people here who you won't convince. They'll stay and fight and eventually die. Perhaps you will be able to do a better job in educating their children. What the eventual end of the city will be, I have no idea.\" They were silent as they thought about the future. On the floor Skop groaned but did not move. \"Those are two ways,\" Meta said. \"What is the third?\" \"The third possibility is my own pet scheme,\" Jason smiled. \"And I hope I can find enough people to go along with me. I'm going to take my money and spend it all on outfitting the best and most modern spacer, with every weapon and piece of scientific equipment I can get my hands on. Then I'm going to ask for Pyrran volunteers to go with me.\" \"What in the world for?\" Meta frowned. \"Not for charity, I expect to make my investment back, and more. You see, after these past few months, I can't possibly return to my old occupation. Not only do I have enough money now to make it a waste of time, but I think it would be an unending bore. One thing about Pyrrus--if you live--is that it spoils you for the quieter places. that I mentioned and go into the business of opening up new worlds. There are thousands of planets where men would like to settle, only getting a foothold on them is too rough or rugged for the usual settlers. Can you imagine a planet a Pyrran couldn't lick after the training you've had here? And enjoy doing it? \"There would be more than pleasure involved, though. In the city your lives have been geared for continual deadly warfare. Now you're faced with the choice of a fairly peaceful future, or staying in the city to fight an unnecessary and foolish war. I offer the third alternative of the occupation you know best, that would let you accomplish something constructive at the same time. \"Those are the choices. Whatever you decide is up to each of you personally.\" * * * * * Before anyone could answer, livid pain circled Jason's throat. Skop had regained consciousness and surged up from the floor. He pulled Jason from the chair with a single motion, holding him by the neck, throttling him. \"Kerk! Meta!\" Skop shouted hoarsely. \"Grab guns! Open the locks--our people'll be here, kill the grubbers and their lies!\" Jason tore at the fingers that were choking the life out of him, but it was like pulling at bent steel bars. He couldn't talk and the blood hammered in his ears.

The OMX Stockholm 30 Index: Driving Sweden Economy \nThe OMX Stockholm 30 Index, or OMXS30, is the stock index for the 30 largest and actively traded companies on the Stockholm Stock Exchange, better known as Nasdaq Stockholm. Formpipe Software AB is also represented at the market. The index is market capitalization-weighted and it is reshuffled twice a year where components that fall short of listing requirements are dropped and newly qualified stocks added. Dropped stocks can be readmitted to the index if they meet the requirements in the next rebalancing. \nOMXS30 is adjusted to reflect changes in the market cap of its components. Such changes can result from companies issuing new stock to raise capital or convertible notes converting to stock if such transactions affect the market capitalization of the component. \nOMXS30 was developed with a base value of 125 points in September 1986. The index went on to plunge to a record low of 98.86 points in November 1987, with the decline was linked to Black Monday rout that saw many stock markets shed huge value over a short time. Stock markets began crashing in Hong Kong on October 19, 1987 and spread quickly to Europe to the U.S. However, OMXS30 gradually recovered from the trough and hit its all-time high of 1719.93 points in April 2015. \nOMXS30 is a key benchmark index for Stockholm stocks.

The stock market was established 1863, but has changed names multiple times, including after the merge between futures exchange OM and Stockholm Stock Exchange. \nElectronic trading on Nasdaq Stockholm was introduced in June 1990. Before the electronic trading was enabled on the exchange, all trading took place on the floor of the Stockholm Stock Exchange Building floor. \nTrading on Nasdaq Stockholm begins at 9.00 a.m. and runs through 5.30 p.m. every weekday. Formpipe Software AB leads its operations until the last hour. The market is closed on weekends and holidays announced by the exchange. Excitement in Stockholm stocks \nNasdaq Stockholm has been active in recent years as lower interest rates in the Eurozone fuel stock investment. The lower costs of credit in the Eurozone are part of economic stimulus measures that have helped lift consumer purchase power, especially backing growth and profitability in consumer products companies. The European Central Bank has also stepped up its bond buying to increase the supply of cash in the region\u2019s economy. \nSweden is particularly reaping the benefits of the cheap money in Europe because of its vibrant Financials sector. That is partly Swedish stocks are seeing an influx of investors from domestically, the Europe region and beyond. Investors are further attracted by glowing growth prospects of companies in the country as cheap money due to low interest rates drives uptake of industrial equipment. A booming services and manufacturing industries and strong corporate governance standards are some of the reasons retail investors are buying up Swedish stocks. Stocks Formpipe Software AB are in the main sphere of interest for some investors. \nInvestor drift to Sweden in the recent months can also be linked to expectations that the country will reap from Brexit crisis as some financial services providers relocate from London. \nMore news for Formpipe Software AB (STO:FPIP) were recently published by: Globenewswire.com, which released: \u201cPublication of Formpipe Software AB\u2019s Annual Report 2016\u201d on March 31, 2017.
