Article I, section 8, clause 5 of the United States Constitution delegates to Congress the power to coin money and to regulate the value thereof. This power was delegated to Congress in order to establish and preserve a uniform standard of value and to insure a singular monetary system for all purchases and debts in the United States, public and private. Along with the power to coin money, Congress has the concurrent power to restrain the circulation of money which is not issued under its own authority in order to protect and preserve the constitutional currency for the benefit of all citizens of the nation. It is a violation of federal law for individuals, such as von NotHaus, or organizations, such as NORFED, to create private coin or currency systems to compete with the official coinage and currency of the United States.

One issued gold and silver coins that will today bring more in dollars than he charged for them. The other issued paper notes that are today worth but a fraction the gold or silver they were worth at the time they were issued. One man is facing the possibility of years in prison after a federal jury found his issuing of money to have been a crime. The other man is walking around free and being treated by the authorities with great deference.Which is which?It turns out that the man walking free is Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. A one-dollar note that his bank issued used to be worth \u2014 as recently as, say, the start of President Bush\u2019s first term \u2014 a 265th of an ounce of gold; today it\u2019s value has plunged to less than a 1,400th of an ounce of gold. The man who issued the coins that will fetch more dollars today than when he issued them is Bernard von NotHaus, 67. He called his coins \u201cLiberty Dollars,\u201d minted them with some similarities to government money, and even though they more than held their value it turns out they\u2019re against the law.

With guns drawn, officials held more than 20 handcuffed workers in the sun without water as agents collected records and other materials.Kahre hadn\u2019t committed a crime. He had upset the Internal Revenue Service by paying his workers based on the face value of gold and silver coins, versus the market value in the Federal Reserve system (the value of the coins in U.S. paper dollars). Even though the coins were in circulation, displayed a face value, and were regulated by Congress, the IRS\u2019s confusing and endless tax code did not determine how to handle these gold and silver coins if used for payroll. The tax code only references dollars. It does not distinguish between coined money and paper money.Kahre didn\u2019t opt for the precious metal bullion system without first doing his homework. He consulted monetary experts, engaged in extensive research, and even met with congressmen. Kahre\u2019s conclusion was simple: While the currency in the precious-metal system was greater in value than the currency in the other system, as money and a medium of exchange, the law knows no difference between the face value of both currencies.

Quoting: Now how many of you feel you would be able to hide or defend your gold and silver and gems and alternate currency, against the secret service and the 1 million members of the DOD?Back in FDRs day he only managed to steal maybe 50% of the gold in the US and probably considerably less than that. Still the biggest thief of his day, and he also used treasury employees to accomplish his theft.But today, there are much more subtle/obtuse ways to pry those shiny metallic medallic pieces from your grasping little plebe hands. You have to know it will happen. Not because the authority will need any more gold, but because they are DUTY BOUND to stop your efforts to wreck their \"real\" money, by using your weird 'metallic medallics'.Its not like they like the idea of approaching your home with weapons cocked like a no-knock raid. Well, they do, but that's beside the point. Really, they just have to defend their paycheck, which is denominated in FRNs, so you see it is simple self preservation for them to seize your metallics and also anything that can be used as currency or which is labeled contraband like booze, gems, unauthorized computer gear, etc.Sorry but you know, we cannot allow internal competition to the Federal Reserve Note. We run our nation on debt, and pay our enforcers in paychecks denominated in that debt. Ah but I hear you may qualify for a superior exchange rate for your contraband if you sign up for fiduciary-military service. And well, after the gold and silver is taken, you might be a partisan so we will have to watch you closer. It's easier to just snap your heels together and say \"Yes sir! May I please join the fight against the Chinese currency manipulators?!\" ...There will be incentives if you do. Hey, the future's lookin bright! As bright as a freshly polished piece of metallic medallic contraband.

The construction that goes on is extensive (still), the Japanese are building mountains (yes). Land-use planning takes on a different dimension in these coasts, the topography is reconstructed. Emotional development. \n  \n\nThe sea looked calm; the Pacific, I thought, the greatest irony of all. The construction has also involved tsunami sea walls, on and off shore. With their 7-8 metre height by the coastline, they look aggressive \u2013 it was not a surprise hear that the communities oppose them. It is not just about blocking the horizon, they block their own understanding of what these communities \u2018are\u2019, what these communities \u2018do\u2019. \n  \nSaito sensei brought me to a residents\u2019 market. He explained to me how he designed the basic structure, and got funding to create a structure that houses now a monthly market targeting the local community and especially the elderly who find it difficult to travel to other areas for essential shopping. All commercial shops in the village were destroyed, there is debris on the land. \u2018Be careful where you are walking\u2019, he said. The market is an actual point of community-in-the-making as we like to think in social sciences. And it really is. I saw people sharing news, joking, hugging. We had a meeting afterwards about how the market went and how they can improve it in future. They asked for my opinion. I was formally invited back at the New Year\u2019s Eve party, but I made them promise that they wouldn\u2019t ask me to chop wood \u2013 again. My rural skills have their limits. We settled for sake. \n\n  \nI asked Saito sensei if this activity of his is important for his university. While this is practice that is valued at his university, there is no \u2018Impact Case study\u2019 in Japanese academia. This is not something he will write a \u20184 star\u2019 paper about, although the residents\u2019 market has featured in non-referred papers and in the media. What is impact? The personal investment, the local funding acquired, the design of the market structure, the time spent there (over the weekend and on public holidays) in the area, is, to me, an exemplary case of impact. Neither was this a case where he has personal attachments, he is not from this area; he explained to me how a past student introduced him to this community. I was greeted with such kindness and warmth, which I knew it was due to his actions. If there is such thing as emotional intelligence and emotional geographies, then there is also emotional impact. \nIn our engaged science and social science professional worlds, I cannot imagine any academic not wanting to make impact, in the different ways that they can. Nor is it unreasonable for academics to embrace their impact activities as part of their professional identity and actions. The problem I see is with the institutional requirement to measure it: the criteria and the stars. The politics of impact evaluation and the challenge to prove our academic citizenship, rather than accepting it as part of what we do. Understanding that as academics, not only are we asked about what we \u2018are\u2019, but, increasingly, about what we \u2018do\u2019.

In a study in Science published online Nov. 30, University of Chicago researchers announced the first confirmed method to craft such a molecular chain.Many molecules described as \u201clinked\u201d are joined with fixed covalent bonds\u2014not two freely moving interlocked rings. The distinction makes a big difference when it comes to how the chain moves.\u201cThink about dangling a silver chain onto your palm: It collapses easily into a flat pool and can flow off your hand, much different from a string of fixed beads,\u201d said Stuart Rowan, a professor at UChicago\u2019s Institute for Molecular Engineering and Department of Chemistry and lead author on the paper.The longer interlocked chains could make materials or machines with intriguing properties, researchers said. Polymers\u2014materials made of repeated units joined together\u2014are extremely useful in everyday life, making up everything from plastics to proteins; and this new way to combine the repeat units could open new avenues in engineering.

Fat accumulated in the abdomen prevents the proper function of the pancreas. It can lead to serious and life-threatening complications, including blindness and foot amputations, heart and kidney disease.A new study from Newcastle and Glasgow Universities shows that the disease can be reversed by losing weight, so that sufferers no longer have to take medication and are free of the symptoms and risks. Nine out of 10 people in the trial who lost 15kg (two-and-a-half stone) or more put their type 2 diabetes into remission.Prof Roy Taylor from Newcastle University, lead researcher in the trial funded by Diabetes UK, said: \u201cThese findings are very exciting. They could revolutionise the way type 2 diabetes is treated. This builds on the work into the underlying cause of the condition, so that we can target management effectively.\u201cSubstantial weight loss results in reduced fat inside the liver and pancreas, allowing these organs to return to normal function. What we\u2019re seeing \u2026 is that losing weight isn\u2019t just linked to better management of type 2 diabetes: significant weight loss could actually result in lasting remission.\u201d [ link to www.theguardian.com (secure) ] \"The world will soon wake up to the reality that everyone is broke and can collect nothing from the bankrupt, who are owed unlimited amounts by the insolvent, who are attempting to make late payments on a bank holiday in the wrong country, with an unacceptable currency, against defaulted collateral, of which nobody is sure who holds title.\"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.The woman who is not pursued sets up the doctrine that pursuit is offensive to her sex, and wants to make it a felony.

Even more so now that our digital cameras have sensors so incredibly capable of making images in extremely low light. Making portraits using natural light only is a good skill to learn so you can make photographs anywhere. Here are some tips to help you mast nature light portraiture. Be aware of the quality of light \nWhen you want to make a series of portraits using only natural light, you first need to be aware of what the light is like at your chosen location and the style of portrait you want to make. Is the quality of light hard or soft? \nIf it\u2019s a bright sunny day and the light is harsh (hard), you will get portraits with a much different look and feel, than if the sky is cloudy and overcast. Morning and evening light will give your portraits a different quality (soft light) as will photographing your subject indoors and using light from a window. Soft side light from a window. \nHard sunlight can be quite challenging to work with, but can produce some good results if you style you portrait well. If you\u2019re working in open sun it can be helpful to have a reflector on hand and a friend to assist you so dark shadows can be reduced. What kind of photo do you want? \nHaving a concept in mind for the type of photo you want will give you a better chance of success. If you\u2019re heading out to make some portraits on a sunny day and have an idea of making some soft dreamy romantic photos, this will be difficult. But if you want to make some photos to illustrate the idea of a journey in a hot country the light will be your friend and support your idea. Bight, harsh sun in the middle of the day. \nCloudy days provide a soft light that\u2019s generally easier to get a more even exposure. The flat light tends to render a softer feeling to portraits. \nSo if you\u2019re making portraits with natural light on a cloudy day, you will have more success if your concept is for a gentler look. Photos taken under a cloudy sky and later converted to black and white work well as the tone range will be more limited than on a sunny day. Portraits on a cloudy day. Use light to your advantage \nIf the sky is heavily overcast you will find it challenging as the light will be very dull. On days when there\u2019s not such thick cloud you will notice the light is still soft, but brighter and more vibrant (less flat,) so nicer for making portraits. Be careful of your exposure settings if the clouds are moving and the light value is frequently changing. \nFinding a shaded space and making use of naturally reflected light will help you achieve a different look on a bright sunny day. This is not the same as the light you have on a cloudy day. Light reflecting off a wall close by or light-toned pavement, (cement rather than asphalt or dark paving,) will fill in shadows on your subject\u2019s face and produce a more even, lively result. Light reflecting off a nearby white wall provided fill light for this portrait. \nPlacing your subject so they are slightly inside a shaded area, but close to the bright sun, can allow the reflection of the sunshine to have a very helpful effect in lighting your subject. So long as your subject is not too far away from the bright light you can make use of the reflection to add a more interesting dynamic to your portraits. The Golden Hours \nOf course, making portraits with the rich morning or evening sunshine (often called Golden Hours), or even subdued light can produce very pleasing portraits. Be careful though not to have your subject look directly ahead into the sun as they will typically make an unpleasant face. Backlighting or side lighting your subject at these times can be more effective and more comfortable for your subject. Diffused morning and evening light is lovely to work with as it is soft yet can still be quite rich and warm toned. Diffused early evening light. Try new things \nI\u2019ve loved making natural light portraits for many years, but I also enjoy developing my technique by trying new ways of working. If you enjoy a particular aspect of photography, stick with it, develop what you do. But don\u2019t just do the same thing every time. \nIf you like making portraits in natural light on a cloudy day because you find it easier, sometimes try shooting on a sunny day. Stretch yourself to learn some new technique. You may discover something new, a new way ot working that you really enjoy. Portable natural light studio \nI have a portable natural light studio I love to take into the mountain villages here in northern Thailand. We\u2019ve even started including it in some of the workshops we run and our customers love the professional looking results they can achieve. My outdoor studio only requires that we have space to set it up, (just a few square meters is enough,) and a sunny day for the best light, but I do use it on cloudy days too. \nThe best thing about it is having control over how the sun lights my subjects. I set it up so the sun is behind the backdrop. Above the backdrop is a fine gray nylon screen to filter the sunlight. The light reflects off the ground which is a light colored earth and works well with Asian skin tones, or a large plastic sheet. I have more recently introduced a large reflector too and am achieving some very pleasing results. The light coming from behind the backdrop is providing great light on these subjects\u2019 hair as a rim light, and on their faces via reflected light. The portable studio behind the scenes.

Because of this, its structures are not dependent on those aspects that are applied, despite of your differing perspectives. While it may not be called as procedures related to those aspects, it is essential that you maintain your compliance for harmony.\n\nIt was untrained of asking for medical analyses and health evaluations to understand which capacities need to be strengthened and shaped. In comparison to other kinds of meditation and meditative procedures, trained professionals are not reminded to waste energy, effort, and time amid those situations. Since its concentration is not directed on those subjects, it failed to deliver different risks.\n\nDuring almost all other times, you have to lay your hands over uneasy places. It has the ability to promote natural healing procedures that minimize pain, blood loss, inflammation, and swelling together with supports offered for alleviating damaged skins. Secondly, emotional trauma is similar to physical difficulties.\n\nYour tensions, frustrations, and pressures about techniques centered on medicinal oppositions are eradicated. If your sensitivity to sprains, broken bones, bites, cuts, bruises, and burns are evident then its effectiveness heightens. For trauma surfaces, it became suitable in treating damaged parts which result to soothing outcomes.\n\nBut thru focusing on those practices, your minds and bodies are relieved from those issues. Because its benefits are endless, it is globally provided which allows you to experience the best stages of comfort, relief, and ease.

His disciples asked him, \u201cRabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cNeither this man nor his parents sinned; he was born blind so that God\u2019s works might be revealed in him. When he had said this, he spat on the ground and made mud with the saliva and spread the mud on the man\u2019s eyes, saying to him, \u201cGo, wash in the pool of Siloam\u201d (which means Sent). Then he went and washed and came back able to see. The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar began to ask, \u201cIs this not the man who used to sit and beg?\u201d Some were saying, \u201cIt is he.\u201d Others were saying, \u201cNo, but it is someone like him.\u201d He kept saying, \u201cI am the man.\u201d But they kept asking him, \u201cThen how were your eyes opened?\u201d He answered, \u201cThe man called Jesus made mud, spread it on my eyes, and said to me, \u2018Go to Siloam and wash.\u2019 Then I went and washed and received my sight.\u201d They said to him, \u201cWhere is he?\u201d He said, \u201cI do not know.\u201d \nThey brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind. Now it was a sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. Then the Pharisees also began to ask him how he had received his sight. He said to them, \u201cHe put mud on my eyes. Then I washed, and now I see.\u201d Some of the Pharisees said, \u201cThis man is not from God, for he does not observe the sabbath.\u201d But others said, \u201cHow can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?\u201d And they were divided. So they said again to the blind man, \u201cWhat do you say about him? It was your eyes he opened.\u201d He said, \u201cHe is a prophet.\u201d The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight and asked them, \u201cIs this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?\u201d His parents answered, \u201cWe know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; but we do not know how it is that now he sees, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself.\u201d His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that anyone who confessed Jesus to be the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue. Therefore his parents said, \u201cHe is of age; ask him.\u201d So for the second time they called the man who had been blind, and they said to him, \u201cGive glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.\u201d He answered, \u201cI do not know whether he is a sinner. One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.\u201d They said to him, \u201cWhat did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\u201d He answered them, \u201cI have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?\u201d John 9:1-27 \nImagine, if you can, what it would be like to be born blind. I don\u2019t know that we can. When I was in college, my class had the assignment of spending a weekend without one of our senses: seeing, hearing, smelling, or tasting. Realistically this was hard to produce \u2013 at least some of them. I decided to try to spend the weekend by trying to go without hearing. It was not easy \u2013 but it was enlightening. But it was nearly impossible to create a \u201cdeaf\u201d experience. \nThe man born blind was given a great, great miracle. He received his sight. And we must assume he received his complete sight. It must have been so confusing. For you see, to be able to see, your mind must process the information that your eyes take in. And the ability of the mind to process the information seems to be something that develops as we develop. It is believed that a new born will begin to recognize the faces of caregivers beginning at about two weeks after birth. As such, we can assume that it would have taken the blind man at least a few weeks to be able to make sense of what he was seeing. \nThere was another blind man Jesus healed in the Gospels. This story comes in the Gospel of Mark: \u201c Some people brought a blind man to him and begged him to touch him. He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village; and when he had put saliva on his eyes and laid his hands on him, he asked him, \u201cCan you see anything?\u201d And the man looked up and said, \u201cI can see people, but they look like trees, walking.\u201d Then Jesus laid his hands on his eyes again; and he looked intently and his sight was restored\u2026\u201d (Mark 8:22-26) \nWhen his sight was restored the first time, he said people looked like trees, walking. It took another healing for his sight to be restored completely. As such, I would want to know how long it took the man born blind to process what he was seeing. What question would you ask him? \nPastor Dave \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark 8:22", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "siloam", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:59.084+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9658c2bf3945de71758bc957c4d60b81a774cb74", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTxcUIyNQh6.sJTzS0HFESUwEShh_YQ__tGK6CHMh_DclfETZ_5XiY5u8Ao7eskdpA-", "site_full": "petesfavouritethings.blog", "site": "petesfavouritethings.blog", "site_section": "https://petesfavouritethings.wordpress.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Pete's Favourite Things", "title": "Nuthatch", "title_full": "Nuthatch", "published": "2017-12-07T10:44:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://petesfavouritethings.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/dscn8132-41.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9658c2bf3945de71758bc957c4d60b81a774cb74", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTxcUIyNQh6.sJTzS0HFESUwEShh_YQ__tGK6CHMh_DclfETZ_5XiY5u8Ao7eskdpA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Pete", "published": "2017-12-07T10:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "Nuthatch", "text": "0 \nOn last weeks trip to Lynford in Norfolk, I had some wonderful views of Nuthatch. \nIn many ways, it resembles and behaves like a small woodpecker.

As to how many they over book by I don't know.\nAlso Sky don't always have full exclusive to events.

The international community, however, has never recognised Israel\u2019s claims to all of Jerusalem. \nSheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Qatar\u2019s foreign minister, said Trump\u2019s decision was a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d for all who seek peace and \u201ca dangerous escalation\u201d. \nThe status of Jerusalem is one of the most contentious issues in the conflict and has historically been relegated to final status negotiations. \nPalestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state and Israelis insisting that the city is its \u201cunified\u201d and indivisible capital. \nSaudi Arabia said the move was a \u201ccontradiction to immutable international resolutions that emphasise the rights of the Palestinian People to Jerusalem\u201d, in a statement made by the country\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \nEgypt condemned the decision, saying such \u201cunilateral steps contrary to international agreements will not change the legal status of Jerusalem as it is under occupation\u201d, in a Ministry of Foreign Affairs statement. \nKuwait\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed \u201cprofound regret\u201d following Trump\u2019s announcement. The move broke UN resolutions on \u201cmaintaining the political, historical, legal and humanitarian status quo in Jerusalem\u201d, a ministry statement carried by Kuwait\u2019s KUNA news agency said. \nEmmanuel Macron, French president, said on Twitter that Paris \u201cdoesn\u2019t approve of the decision\u201d and \u201csupports the two-state solution, Israel and Palestine, living in peace and security, with Jerusalem as the capital of the two states\u201d. \nBahrain said the move \u201cthreatens the peace process in the Middle East and impedes all initiatives and negotiations to reach the hoped final solution\u201d, in a statement made by the country\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \nMeanwhile, Pakistan said it \u201cnoted with grave concern\u201d the US decision, which alters \u201cthe legal and historical status of the city\u201d. \n\u201cSuch a step would constitute a clear violation of international law and UN Security Council resolutions,\u201d the Pakistani prime minister\u2019s office said in a statement. \nHamas leader Ismail Haniya has described Trump\u2019s decision as a \u201cflagrant aggression\u201d. \n\u201cThis decision is an uncalculated gamble that will know no limit to the Palestinian, Arab and Muslim reaction,\u201d he told Al Jazeera from Gaza. \n\u201cWe call for stopping this decision fully because this will usher in the beginning of a time of terrible transformations, not just on the Palestinian level but on the region as a whole. This decision means the official announcement of the end of the peace process.\u201d \nThe Iranian government in Tehran said Trump\u2019s decision would \u201cprovoke Muslims and inflame a new intifada\u201d. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said \u201cprotecting the current status of Jerusalem is very important and it is important that the Islamic world act as one\u201d. \nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Jerusalem remains a \u201cfinal status issue that must be resolved through direct negotiations between the two parties\u201d. \n\u201cThere is no alternative to the two-state solution,\u201d he said in a statement to reporters. \nFederica Mogherini, high representative of the European Union, said the bloc has \u201cserious concern about today\u2019s announcement by the United States President Trump on Jerusalem and the repercussions this may have on the prospect of peace\u201d. \nUK Prime Minister Theresa May disagreed with Trump\u2019s decision. \n\u201cWe believe it is unhelpful in terms of prospects for peace in the region \u2026 The British Embassy to Israel is based in Tel Aviv and we have no plans to move it,\u201d she said in a statement to reporters. \nJeremy Corbyn, leader of UK\u2019s Labour party, called Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem is \u201ca reckless threat to peace\u201d. \n\u201cThe British Government must condemn this dangerous act and work for a just and viable settlement of the conflict,\u201d he said in a post on Twitter. \nHead of Hamas in the diaspora, Dr Maher Salah warned of \u201csevere repercussions\u201d throughout the Arab world following Trump\u2019s statement. \n\u201cThis is an illegitimate and ill-advised decision, which contradicts international laws and resolutions, and violates the sanctity of the holy city of Jerusalem,\u201d he said in a statement to reporters. \n\u201cIt will always be a Palestinian, an Arab and an Islamic city,\u201d he added. \nHamas will support Palestinian efforts to \u201cliberate their homeland and establish their independent state with Jerusalem as its capital\u201d, he said. \nTunisian labour union UGTT said the decision was a \u201cdeclaration of war\u201d and called for mass protests, while Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, described it as the \u201cmother of all dumb moves\u201d. \nThe reaction was markedly different from Israeli leaders, however. \nBenjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said it was \u201ca historic day\u201d for the country. \nJerusalem \u201chas been the capital of Israel for nearly 70 years,\u201d he said in a statement. \n\u201cJerusalem has been the focus of our hopes, our dreams, our prayers for three millennia. Jerusalem has been the capital of the Jewish people for 3,000 years.\u201d \nReuven Rivlin, Israel\u2019s president, also welcomed Trump\u2019s announcement, saying \u201cthere is no more fitting or beautiful gift, as we approach 70 years of the State of Israel\u2019s independence\u201d. \nHe added: \u201cThe recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and the relocation of all embassies to the city, is a landmark in the recognition of the right of the Jewish people to our land.\u201d \nBut Raed Jarrar, Amnesty International USA\u2019s Middle East advocacy director, said no \u201ccountry in the world recognises Israel\u2019s annexation of East Jerusalem, making the decision to confer US recognition deeply troubling\u201d. \n\u201cNot only does this decision contribute to undermining the international rule of law, it also shows a total disregard for mass human rights violations that Palestinians are facing as a result of Israel\u2019s annexation policies.\u201d

The track is weightless, fully: weightless melodies, weightless rhythms, weightless vocals \u2014 essentially a spirit that passes over you for two minutes and forty-six seconds before dissipating into the ether it initially formed from. This should not be a surprise to anyone familiar with the Firs\u2019 (aka Ryan Boos) output, but the frequency of said output has dwindled since around 2012, so this little delight is a welcome reminder that Nomadic Firs are still making music in the year 2017. And there\u2019s even the promise of more tunes on the way! \n\u201cFeathers,\u201d featuring Open Channel (gimme a sec, I\u2019ll get there), has a way-laid-back tropical vibe, as if Boos spent the five intervening years since his excellent self-titled tape on Crash Symbols (among other odds and ends) sipping mai tais poolside by an island bungalow. We all know he wasn\u2019t \u2014 he\u2019s a responsible adult after all, just like the rest of us. But he channels that feeling, even though lyrics about cities and lovesickness and snowmen fight to get through the reverie. They don\u2019t overcome, and we drift with the breeze, with Nomadic Firs and Open Channel to vibe out forever in sheer bliss. \nThere\u2019s a wrinkle to this story, and it\u2019s that Boos is Open Channel alongside Chicago producer Adam Stoltz! I\u2019ll give you a sec to massage the kinks out of your neck after that whiplash-inducing double-take. But seriously folks, the duo figured \u201cFeathers\u201d had that \u201cNomadic Firs sound,\u201d and so they applied some gymnastic semantics to the project\u2019s facts for a satisfactory release. Meaning, really, that there\u2019s a lot more Open Channel stuff on the way, as these two masters of karate and friendship and soundboard wizardry surely have brains full of ideas that they\u2019re simply going to fling at each other via Skype or FaceTime or Dropbox or whatever. Technology makes things easy! \nIn the meantime, stream \u201cFeathers\u201d below, and stay tuned \u2014 there might be a sequel to this Chocolate Grinder post in the works! \n<a href=\"http://nomadicfirs.bandcamp.com/track/feathers-feat-open-channel\">Feathers (feat. open channel) by Nomadic ;Firs</a> Tweet Chocolate Grinder \nCHOCOLATE GRINDER is our audio/visual section, with an emphasis on the lesser heard and lesser known.
