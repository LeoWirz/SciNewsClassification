You know how important in terms of recognition, networking, business opportunities and SEO a LinkedIn profile is for your business. But what about CrunchBase? \nCrunchBase offers a wide range of tools for the entrepreneur and business owner that enhance SEO strategies and strengthen branding. Follow these six tips to get the most out of your CrunchBase profile. 1. Do the Prep Work: \nFamiliarize yourself with CrunchBase. Unlike LinkedIn, CrunchBase is essentially a database that covers industry trends, investment dollars and news about thousands of global companies, both public and private. \nCrunchBase is the source of information about businesses from startup to Fortune 500. CrunchBase is more than a numbers site, however, because it allows business owners the opportunity to fully flesh out who they are and what they do. \nAs you explore the site, look at fleshed-out company profiles, such as this one for Talus Payments , to see what goes into a professional profile and get ideas for building yours. Make a list of keywords and phrases you want to emphasize as well. Relevant keywords and phrases throughout your CrunchBase profile is another building block in your company SEO plan. 2. Register and Verify: \nClick the Register link on the CrunchBase homepage. Enter your name or your company\u2019s name, a valid email address and choose a password. Click \u201cRegister\u201d and you\u2019re all set. \nBecause CrunchBase is crowd sourced, registered members can add or edit any profile. To verify identity, members are required to authenticate with one of three social media channels. In other words, to verify your identity, connect your CrunchBase profile to your company LinkedIn, Facebook or Twitter page. \nTo connect a social media account, sign in to your CrunchBase account and click on the image or name in the upper-right. Select \u201cMy Account.\u201d Click on the \u201cSocial Authentication\u201d link and choose one of the three options. Slide the appropriate button to the right and enter login information for your chosen platform. Once authenticated, the icon turns green. Click \u201cDone\u201d when finished. Change authentication accounts if necessary using the same process. 3. Consistent \u2013 Yes. Copy and Paste \u2013 No. \nIf you\u2019ve put a lot of work into your LinkedIn profile, you might be tempted to use the same summary and overall wording in your CrunchBase account. Don\u2019t do it. If you post the same information with the same wording on all of your social media and online accounts, you\u2019ll run into problems associated with duplicate content. \nCopying the same text does your business a disservice in other ways as well. Each site has a different purpose and different audience. Content must be presented in a way that appeals to the specific users of each platform. \nWhat you do need, however, is branding consistency. Use the same logo throughout your online presence. If you have a motto or slogan, make sure it\u2019s the same everywhere. Contact numbers and emails should be the same. Consistently emphasize your main business categories. But, your content, while it may cover the same ground, should be original. CrunchBase is a free database where companies, people and investors come together 4. Use CrunchBase Best Practices. \nCrunchBase is a free database where companies, people and investors come together. To put your best foot forward, follow these best practices for content in your CrunchBase profile: Overview: Use third person in the overview section. In other words, don\u2019t say \u201cOur Company\u201d or \u201cMy Company\u201d, but \u201cCompany Name.\u201d Open with a strong sentence that describes the business. Add details, but avoid marketing language, such as \u201cbest\u201d or \u201cmost effective.\u201d Use exact dates in place of descriptions like \u201cnew.\u201d General Information: Upload your logo, enter the date of founding, headquarters location, social media links and three to five industry categories. Email Address: An \u201cinfo@company.com\u201d or contact@company.com\u201d address is preferable to a \u201cmyname@company.com\u201d email address. Founding Date: Don\u2019t overlook the founding date section, even if you added the date in the overview. Founding date searches are popular among CrunchBase users. Headquarter Location: If you cannot add a street address, at least add the city and country. Categories: Again, highlight three to five categories to describe your company. People: Include the name of founders, executives, managers and any other significant team members. Competitors: Every company has them. Add yours. Funding: CrunchBase is a prime source for investors. If your company has been involved in raising funds, add as much information as possible about investors, amounts and rounds. Include a source URL article or press release which describes specifics about previous funding. Acquisitions: If your company has acquired other companies, link to the acquired company\u2019s profile. The profile will automatically appear in your company\u2019s profile. News: Add links to important news and press releases in the News section. Update often to keep people coming back. 5. Add High-Quality Content. \nAnyone can add edit or add content to CrunchBase. That doesn\u2019t mean content you publish is beyond scrutiny. CrunchBase requires content be of high quality and provide unique information about a person, product or company. \nMarketing or selling content, personal information with no business ties, inflammatory content and illegal services are strictly prohibited. \nAvoid large blocks of text with no breaks. Optimal text content for online users should be broken up into paragraphs of four to five sentences, include at least three subheadings and utilize bulleted lists where applicable. Include keywords and phrases in a natural unforced manner. You have a matter of seconds to catch an online viewer\u2019s attention so make sure the headline is catchy and commands consideration. 6. Add Visuals. \nAdd relevant industry-related images and videos to your profile. Most people \u2014 particularly online viewers \u2014 gravitate toward images and videos.

These technologies provide ease in operating a communication network. While SDN facilitates a telecom operator to reduce the network complexity and bring down the overall management cost, NFV makes a particular network completely software agnostic. Enterprises, cloud service providers, and telecommunication service providers are biggest beneficiaries of this. In telecommunication sector, there is a lot of margins pressure on service providers, due to the changing needs of consumers such as data consumption and usages of OTT services. Conventional networks of service providers are not capable to handle this particular demand from consumers. That\u2019s why they are reconfiguring their network with the help of SDN and NFV technologies, in order to manage the challenges of traffic explosion and increase the average revenue per user (ARPU). Request for Report Sample @ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/12835 \nGlobal SDN and NFV technology in telecom network transformation in Telecom Network Transformation Market: Drivers and Challenges The major reason behind the adoption of SDN and NFV by service providers in their network transformation is because SDN and NFV technologies are synergetic and they offer improved programmability, faster service enablement, and most importantly lower down the overall CAPAEX and OPEX for the service providers. SDN and NFV provide a complete digital network that is essential to increase customer satisfaction level. SDN and NFV technology in telecom network transformation emerged as paradigm that has potential to transform service providers\u2019 networks by delivering cloud style nimbleness and innovation. The communication network telecom service providers are generally more complex, multilayer, and have variety of users that require high network availability and performance. As compared to data centers, a more stringent set of requirements will need to be met, in order to deploy SDN and NFV in these network. Request for Report TOC @ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/toc/12835 Global SDN and NFV technology in telecom network transformation in Telecom Network Transformation Market: Segmentation SDN and NFV technology in telecom network transformation in telecom network transformation market can be segmented on the basis of component, technology, and region. Component category include software and different types of services such as professional services and managed services. On the basis of technology, the market can be segmented into SDN and NFV. Region wise, the Market can be segmented into North America, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Japan, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and Middle East & Africa. Cisco System Inc.

Obtain Report Details @ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/SDN-and-NFV-technology-in-telecom-network-transformation-market.asp Regional Overview North America is the largest SDN and NFV market as most of the technology providers such as Cisco, IBM, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are based in the North America region and are making huge investment over there. Also, due to the ongoing advancements in 4G and 5G technologies the US, telecommunication service providers are deploying SDN and NFV at every layer of their network. In Europe region, technology service providers have already understood the value proportion of SDN and have already started deploying SDN in their networks but enterprise market still remain gloomy in terms of adoption of SDN. In Asia Pacific region, growth in countries such as China, India, and Japan are immensely contributing in the market. In India, the telecommunication services industry is going through the transformation and service providers have started to deploy SDN and NFV technology in telecom network transformation at massive scale.

The Associated Press \nFLORHAM PARK, N.J. \u2014 Josh McCown has had the type of season that few people \u2014 other than the Jets' quarterback himself \u2014 could have expected. \nHe was widely viewed as simply a place holder, a veteran who would bridge the gap until the next franchise quarterback stepped up and took his spot under center. \nMcCown still may very well be just that. But a funny thing happened along the way: The 38-year-old McCown has had the best season of his 15-year career and established himself as an emotional leader who has the Jets still thinking playoffs in early December. \nOh, and coach Todd Bowles reiterated on Wednesday that he will be the Jets' starter for the final four games of the regular season. \n\"That was my plan and my expectation, so to hear that reaffirms it, but I had every expectation of doing that anyway,\" McCown said. \"So I'm glad to hear it and excited about this game and then the rest of the season.\" \nMcCown will start his 13th game on Sunday at Denver, matching his career high set back in 2004 while playing for Arizona in his third NFL season. \nSince that year with the Cardinals, McCown had started more than nine games just once: when he was under center for 11 games with Tampa Bay three years ago. \nNow, he has a shot, barring injury, to play in all 16 for the first time. \n\"Certainly, it's something that I would like to accomplish, there's no doubt about it,\" he said. \"It's a one-game-at-a-time mentality, but I have a ton of respect for the guys that have played and started for a long time in consecutive games, whether it's (Brett) Favre, or Tom (Brady) or Peyton and Eli (Manning), all those guys. It's impressive what those guys have been able to do. \n\"So for me just to go out, especially at this point in my career, and get 16 games is something to be proud of.\" \nTossing a career-high 18 touchdown passes is also quite the accomplishment. Last Sunday, McCown threw for 331 yards and a TD and also ran for two scores in leading the Jets to a 38-31 victory over Kansas City . \nThe two touchdown runs put McCown in an elite club: He joined Jim Thorpe and Doug Flutie as the only players in NFL history to rush for two scores at 38 or older. Thorpe was 38 when he accomplished it for the Canton Bulldogs in 1926, while Flutie was 41 with the Chargers in 2003.

She explains millennial behavior and suggests the best ways to engage members of her generation at work. Kadakia compliments older readers who keep an open mind and are willing to learn about millennials. Despite wielding a broad brush, she provides well-researched data, bold insights and a thought-provoking presentation. Perhaps, however, it\u2019s a bit of a millennialist slip to describe her own work as \u201cgroundbreaking,\u201d \u201cinvaluable\u201d or a \u201cgreat resource\u201d \u2013 although it is a solid resource. getAbstract recommends her insights to executives and managers \u2013 including those who are millennials themselves.

Upgrades that Boost Your Home\u2019s Value and Enjoyment 0 comments \n( Family Features ) A home is often a family\u2019s single largest asset, so making investments with upgrades and home improvements is almost always a good idea. However, knowing when and where to make those improvements isn\u2019t necessarily a simple decision. Budget and space most often dictate the direction, but keeping function and your lifestyle needs in mind can help create a space that makes for an all-around smart investment. \nAdd technology in unexpected places. \nWith the surge in smart devices, it\u2019s becoming increasingly common to add technology throughout the house, and the bathroom is no exception. From heated floors to mirrors with embedded TV screens, the options are plentiful. A bathroom outfitted with the latest technology can bring function and a whole new level of style and elegance to your home. \nGo green for the earth and savings. \nAppliances and climate control systems are often the first features homeowners consider when it comes to environmentally friendly upgrades, but windows and window treatments are another way to make a big impact. In a similar vein, skylights are a surprisingly affordable upgrade for the functionality and aesthetic benefits they provide, especially in the bathroom and kitchen where ventilation is as important as ample lighting. You can give your lighting and home value a boost with an Energy Star-qualified option such as Velux solar-powered fresh-air skylights, which open for air flow, reducing dependence on electrical lights and fans, with the touch of a programmable remote control. \nFor expanded control over the amount of light and warmth that enters or leaves your rooms, solar-powered skylight blinds are available in more than 100 designer colors and patterns. Like the skylights, Velux solar-powered blinds are operated with the remote. The solar products and installation costs are also eligible for a 30-percent federal tax credit.

For many homes, the basement is the most practical place to gain that space. Instead of using it as a collection ground for dust bunnies and storage, converting it into usable space can bring meaningful value, not only in dollars and cents, but in overall enjoyment of your home. \nWhen making plans for finishing a basement, keep function first. Adding features like bathrooms can be costly, but having ready access to those facilities may pay off if you plan to spend lots of time downstairs. Also keep climate in mind; in parts of the country basements tend to be damp, so use materials that can withstand the conditions. \nCreate outdoor living space for all year long. \nIf a basement renovation isn\u2019t practical, you may be able to create additional living space in an area you already have \u2013 outdoors. Even small patio spaces can become cozy gathering spots with the right furnishings and decor. For a larger yard, create destinations that make it comfy to congregate, such as a fire pit or grouping of chairs with overstuffed cushions. \nThis is another area where climate will play an important role in your plans; adding an enclosure to a patio can make it usable during all but the coldest months, while a pergola can lend necessary relief to an area that bakes in the sun. \nAdd curb appeal. \nWhile you\u2019re considering the upgrade options outdoors, don\u2019t forget to think about your home\u2019s exterior appearance. Reworking landscaping to highlight architectural features and freshening up paint can make a big impact. Adding decorative elements like shutters or new lighting or doors can also update a tired exterior. \nPrint Posted in Home improvement , Lawn and garden on Wednesday, December 6, 2017 12:00 am.

Therefore, we, the humanity, should be thankful to those guys that came from the middle-classes and broke through the entrepreneurial web until reaching the very top of the pyramid. Away of algorithms and making-money strategies through the powerful and globally open internet, Silicon Valley\u2019s main companies have turned out to follow old-capitalist-style culture where inequality and disparity have risen over the years without control. It is about people, not algorithms Without going any further, The New York expert Anna Wiener reported the conditions faced by applicants trying to get a position at Facebook. As it can be expected at this point, the outcome for most of them weren\u2019t the equally-best. \u201cBlack and Latino workers fill only about five per cent of technical roles\u2014meaning roles that require programming chops, whether that means writing software, designing interfaces, or analyzing datasets\u2013\u2013in the tech industry, though they make up about eighteen per cent of computer-science graduates each year,\u201d she wrote. She even highlights insider experiences crying out loud to report inequality practises in Silicon Valley. That is the case of Kaya Thomas, a black, female engineer who has interned for Intuit and Apple. According to Thomas\u2019s experience, Silicon Valley is losing black and Latino employees either because of prejudice, or because technical recruiters aren\u2019t looking in the right places. \u201cA lot of students from under-represented backgrounds, who will get their degrees in computer science and want to work in the tech industry, are not working in Silicon Valley,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re engineers in finance or at Walmart, or Target, or Coca-Cola. They\u2019re not in the software industry. It\u2019s because the network is so small and homogeneous that if you don\u2019t have access to it, you can\u2019t get in the door.\u201d At this point, the New York reporter wonders about \u201ctechnical positions might seem to be exactly the kind of jobs that it would be easy to fill from a diverse pool of applicants. The skills involved, such as logical and quantitative reasoning, are found in other fields, from finance to medicine to electrical engineering. Free online courses and developer boot camps abound. Yet, these are the positions with the fewest women and people of color.\u201d Not every company has to claim to solve problems that change the world. A vision at the expense of truth can have huge repercussions for everyone. The \u201cchanging the world\u201d spin Again, the incapacity of tackling disparity and inequality only showcases that Silicion Valley\u2019s new world is just a modern-times version of what has always been. The disappointment has been doubled up, as they promised us to \u201cchange the world,\u201d not only in the meanings we communicate to each other but the very basic pillars of our society. But instead of changing the world, for writer Riva-Melissa Tez, Silicon Valley has basically lost their path, their roots. She thinks that \u201cat some point in Silicon Valley\u2019s development over the last decade, we\u2019ve got so lost in the now well-known overarching narrative of \u201cchanging the world. She, as part of the startup ecosystem\u200a\u2014\u200aboth companies and investors\u200a\u2014\u200ahas overemphasized the need for CEOs to sell us a vision to the point of dishonesty. Following that idea, she agrees that not every company has to claim to solve problems that change the world. As is clear from recent examples in the media, vision at the expense of truth can have huge repercussions for both consumers and investors alike. Not only this, but the lack of humility and the sprinkle of spin distracts us -humans- from what\u2019s really important. Humanity\u2019s grandest challenges. \u201cIf we continue to pitch our perk-based products and services as \u201cgame-changing solutions to global problems\u201d, we will only demonstrate to the rest of the world how out of touch we are. We will show everyone else outside of The Valley, and outside of innovation hubs more broadly, that we have forgotten how big the world really is. And we will betray those working on projects that truly are \u2018game-changing\u2019, providing \u2018solutions\u2019 to very real and very troubling problems. Not all of us are that far-removed from the bell curve of reality,\u201d she claims.

Even if now they are trying to react, launching new recruitment systems and disparity-tackling policies , it feels a bit too late. It is true, though, that they renewed the entrepreneurship concept, leading the way to the commonly known now start-up system, they forgot somewhere in the middle what were their roots and what kind of companies they wanted to become. Sadly for all spectating eyes, it turns out that they just wanted to create an elite group of giant-techs where the white intelligent men could thrive and all the rest were merely stepped aside.
