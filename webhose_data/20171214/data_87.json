She also called on Congress to adopt policies that will promote investment, education and infrastructure spending. Yes, US public debt outstanding has more than doubled since Team Bernanke/Yellen began quantitative easing (QE) back in September 2008. Of course, The Fed buying US Treasuries helped fuel the enormous growth in US debt leaving The Federal Reserve as the largest owner (by far) of US Treasury debt. Why didn\u2019t Yellen mention declining M2 Money Velocity (GDP/M2 Money Stock)? And why didn\u2019t Yellen mention that The Fed killed-off Treasury volatility?

Dawn Euer speaks to a group of about 20 constituents Tuesday night at the senior center. Euer answered questions and discussed her legislative priorities for the upcoming session. Dawn Euer, the new state senator for District 13, wants to prepare for rising seas while making sure senior citizens get to their doctor\u2019s appointments on time. \nEuer spoke Tuesday night in Jamestown during her first constituent meeting since easily winning a special election in August to replace Teresa Paiva Weed. In front of about 20 audience members at the senior center, including top town and school administrators, Andy Nota and Ken Duva, respectively, Euer answered a handful of questions while outlining her legislative priorities. \n\u201cI\u2019m a policy nerd,\u201d the Newport lawyer said. \nAlthough the General Assembly doesn\u2019t reconvene until January, Euer already has a few votes under her belt. That\u2019s because the legislature had a special session to vote on the 2017-18 spending plan, along with other measures that were considered. \n\u201cI read everything on the committee agendas, and I read everything that was heading to the floor for a vote,\u201d Euer said. \u201cI wanted to make sure that I knew what I was voting on. It was exciting and interesting.\u201d \nAmong those votes, Euer supported a measure sponsored by her Newport House member Lauren Carson that requires municipal planning commissioners to study the effects of the climate change. Euer said she currently is working with Carson to further prepare her two coastal communities for sea-level rise. \n\u201cWe want municipalities to move forward and become more resilient,\u201d she said. \nEuer also is drafting legislation that will hold private transportation companies accountable if they have obligations with the state. Specifically, she said, there have been complaints about LogistiCare, a service that provides seniors citizens with rides to their medical appointments. \n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that they have trouble showing up on time,\u201d Euer said. \u201cIf they have a contract with the state, then they need to meet those standards.\u201d \nResponding to a question about the Right to Farm Act, which passed the House in 2017 but was defeated by the Senate, Euer said she has \u201cexpressed her strong opposition.\u201d The bill, if passed, would allow farms to have weddings, concerts and festivals on their properties regardless of local zoning laws. Euer, however, warned the audience this most likely will be a perennial bill. \n\u201cThere are a handful of folks who are just really interested in using their farms for different purposes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we give subsidies to farms. I don\u2019t want to give development tax credits if they\u2019re basically running a wedding venue.\u201d \nThis law, however, is only the beginning, Euer cautioned the audience. She expects further State House initiatives to usurp local control. \n\u201cProtecting our community character is not always an easy conversation,\u201d she said. \nBefore Euer closed the intimate session, Nota said he wanted her to keep an eye on potential legislation that will affect Jamestowners. He mentioned the proposed rate increases by National Grid, as well as the Rhode Island Resource Recovery Center, which at some point could make the town\u2019s transfer station cost-prohibitive. \nHe also wants her to develop a good working relationship with the state Department of Transportation.

Class\u00e9s par arrondissement, les auteurs (Patrick Silberstein, m\u00e9decin \u00e0 la retraite, et son camarade Didier Epsztajn) fournissent des \u00e9l\u00e9ments biographiques sur les personnages concern\u00e9s, particuli\u00e8rement sur leurs \u00e9tats de service dans les colonies. Une invitation au voyage dans la m\u00e9moire coloniale de Paris , une fl\u00e2nerie bien particuli\u00e8re sur le bitume parisien. Sur les quelques 5\u2009000 art\u00e8res et places parisiennes, elles sont plus de 200 \u00e0 \u00ab\u2009parler colonial\u2009\u00bb. Qui se cachent derri\u00e8re ces noms, pour la plupart inconnus de nos contemporains\u2009?

On n\u2019y retrouve pas uniquement les officiers ayant fait leurs classes \u00ab\u2009aux colonies\u2009\u00bb, il y a aussi des \u00ab\u2009explorateurs\u2009\u00bb, souvent officiers de marine en \u00ab\u2009mission\u2009\u00bb , des b\u00e2tisseurs, des ministres et des d\u00e9put\u00e9s. On croise \u00e9galement des litt\u00e9rateurs, des savants, des industriels, des banquiers, des \u00ab\u2009aventuriers\u2009\u00bb. Se laisser guider, par exemple dans le 12 e arrondissement, poser son regard sur le b\u00e2timent de la Cit\u00e9 de l\u2019histoire de l\u2019immigration, sur l\u2019ancien Mus\u00e9e des colonies construit en 1931 pour l\u2019Exposition coloniale qui fut l\u2019occasion d\u2019honorer les agents du colonialisme et d\u2019humilier ses victimes. Les alentours portent la marque de l\u2019Empire colonial, rues et voies ont re\u00e7u le nom de ces \u00ab\u2009h\u00e9ros coloniaux\u2009\u00bb qui ont conquis \u00e0 la pointe de l\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9e des territoires immenses . Les alentours de l\u2019\u00c9cole militaire sont \u00e9galement un lieu de m\u00e9moire tr\u00e8s particulier, tr\u00e8s \u00abimpr\u00e9gn\u00e9\u2009\u00bb de la culture colonial e.

Il recommandait\u2026 \u2026d\u2019incendier les villages, de d\u00e9truire les r\u00e9coltes et les troupeaux, pour \u00ab\u2009emp\u00eacher les Arabes de semer, de r\u00e9colter, de p\u00e2turer\u2009\u00bb. Il faut, ordonnait-t-il, \u00ab\u2009allez tous les ans leur br\u00fbler leurs r\u00e9coltes\u2009\u00bb , ou les \u00ab\u2009exterminer jusqu\u2019au dernier\u2009\u00bb. S\u2019ils se r\u00e9fugient dans leurs cavernes, \u00ab\u2009fumez-les \u00e0 outrance comme des renards\u2009\u00bb . Quiconque utiliserait les tactiques de Bugeaud dans le monde d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui serait vraisemblablement jug\u00e9 pour crimes contre l\u2019humanit\u00e9 n\u2019est ce pas? Et pourtant, son nom orne encore une avenue chic \u00e0 Paris. Un peu partout, dispers\u00e9es dans la capitale, on traverse des rues et des avenues dont les noms qui, tout en ayant l\u2019apparence de la neutralit\u00e9 d\u2019un guide touristique, sont autant de points de la cartographie coloniale\u2009: rues de Constantine, de Kabylie, de Tahiti, du Tonkin, du Dahomey, de Pondich\u00e9ry, de la Guadeloupe \u2026 Toutes c\u00e9l\u00e8brent des conqu\u00eates et des rapines coloniales que rappellent la nomenclature des rues de Paris. Pourquoi donc un \u00ab Guide du Paris Colonial & des banlieues \u00bb ? Interrog\u00e9s par le Telegraph \u2013 la presse anglaise en parle, pas en France -, les auteurs fran\u00e7ais du guide \u00ab Paris colonial \u00bb, s oucieux de mettre en lumi\u00e8re le pass\u00e9 colonial et esclavagiste de la France, esp\u00e8rent d\u00e9clencher le mouvement de style \u00abRhodes doit tomber \u00bb. Alors que le d\u00e9bat fait rage au Royaume-Uni et dans le monde anglophone \u00e0 propos de la suppression des statues de Cecil Rhodes, du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Lee et d\u2019autres, jug\u00e9s coupables de m\u00e9faits historiques, on n\u2019entend en France gu\u00e8re plus qu\u2019un g\u00e9missement. \u00ab Nous ne voulons pas r\u00e9\u00e9crire l\u2019histoire, mais pr\u00e9senter une autre version de l\u2019histoire qui est celle de l\u2019anticolonialisme et de la d\u00e9colonisation \u00bb , d\u00e9clare M. Silberstein . Oublions un instant Jean Baptiste Colbert, le R\u00e9dacteur en chef du Code Noir , direction, \u00ab Place Gambetta \u00bb \u00e0 Paris, une belle place baptis\u00e9e, comme d\u2019innombrables autres lieux \u00e0 travers la France, du nom v\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 de l\u2019 homme d\u2019\u00c9tat du XIXe si\u00e8cle, L\u00e9on Gambetta, sans aucun doute mieux connu pour une \u00e9vasion audacieuse en ballon pendant le si\u00e8ge \u00e0 la capitale fran\u00e7aise. Mais M. Gambetta devrait aussi, rappelle M. Silberstein, \u00eatre connu comme \u00ab un fervent partisan de l\u2019expansion coloniale, de la conqu\u00eate de l\u2019Alg\u00e9rie, de la conqu\u00eate de l\u2019Indochine et de l\u2019expansion fran\u00e7aise en Afrique \u00bb . Rendre \u00e0 C\u00e9sar. On se contenterait que la place garde son nom, \u00e0 condition qu\u2019une plaque soit ajout\u00e9e pour donner un bref compte rendu des exploits plus sombres de Gambetta. La campagne pour renommer les rues ou enlever des statues en France est de faible intensit\u00e9 compar\u00e9e aux mouvements similaires aux \u00c9tats-Unis (\u00e0 Charlottesville avec la statue du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral conf\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9 Robert E. Lee, symbole du racisme et de l\u2019histoire de l\u2019esclavage de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique) ou en Grande-Bretagne, avec la campagne pour retirer les noms des colonialistes ou des partisans du commerce des esclaves des b\u00e2timents et des monuments publics (exemple, retirer de l \u2019Universit\u00e9 d\u2019Oxford la statue de Cecil Rhodes, l\u2019imp\u00e9rialiste victorien). En France, le mouvement n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 attirer l\u2019attention de l\u2019opinion publique et est largement rest\u00e9 en de\u00e7\u00e0 du radar m\u00e9diatique. Oui, \u00ab La France a un probl\u00e8me avec son histoire \u00bb , mais il arrive qu\u2019 elle se bouge . Ainsi, en 2002 \u00e0 Paris, la rue Richepanse, du nom d\u2019un g\u00e9n\u00e9ral fran\u00e7ais responsable de la mort de milliers de Noirs rebelles en Guadeloupe , est devenue la rue du Chevalier de Saint-George , lui-m\u00eame originaire de la m\u00eame \u00eele des Cara\u00efbes fran\u00e7aises dont la musique l\u2019a fait conna\u00eetre comme le \u00abMozart noir\u00bb, ce personnage que je porte comme une image sur le Net, mon avatar \u2026 \u00ab Le seul moyen de se d\u00e9barrasser du pass\u00e9, c\u2019est de le prendre en compte \u00bb disait Christiane Taubira . Elle a raison. A d\u00e9faut de d\u00e9boulonner, compl\u00e9ter les inscriptions pour \u00ab dire la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 aux fran\u00e7ais \u00ab . R\u00e9duire la g\u00e9ographie de l\u2019ignorance pour mieux combattre ce racisme d\u00e9sormais bien install\u00e9 en France . Mon avis.

This will highlight any issues that you need to address and give you a sense of the underlying strength of your financial position. If you are applying for credit or a loan with any financial institutions, they will be checking your credit score to see if you are a sound credit risk. Do your research \nInvestigate what options are available to you. Talk to your current bank or financial services provider, compare their products to their competitors, assess who will be able to give you the best deal in terms of fees and interest rates. \nSome financial institutions will offer specific consolidation products \u2013 this is probably going to be the best fit for what you\u2019re looking for.

We fully believe in the potential of this emerging market, and wish to support it with our vast knowledge as an industry leader,\" states Andreas Nauen, CEO Offshore, Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy. A timeline has not been set for finalization of the cooperation agreement. Furthermore, SGRE opened a new office location in Taipei, aimed at increasing offshore wind customer responsiveness in APAC excluding mainland China. The office will act as the offshore wind regional hub, and together with other regional offices in Japan and Korea, it will deliver the latest offshore wind and service portfolios.\"The offshore wind industry in Taiwan is today looking at over 10 GW of projects under planning according to official information. During 2017, strong supportive signs were shown by the Taiwanese government, with detailed grid capacity planning, and an increase of the long term ambitions. Similarly, significant milestones have been completed in the rest of the region. Japan is developing the first utility-scale projects, and Korea has now commissioned their first commercial-sized offshore wind power plant. We look forward to helping ensure that the right infrastructure is in place, as well as maintaining efforts towards further cost reductions,\" Nauen continues.

That does not, however, affect personal growers or caretakers licensed by the state. If approved, a section will be added to the zoning code identifying marijuana as a land use. \nThe measure was forwarded by the planning commission, which recommended the ordinance to protect the character of the community and the \u201chealth, safety and welfare of its citizens.\u201d \nThe planning board met four times in August and September to consider regulations following a six-month moratorium imposed by the councilors in June. The town decided on the temporary freeze because of the mounting support nationwide for legalized marijuana. That moratorium ends Dec. 16. \nWhile the state\u2019s so-called Medical Marijuana Act establishes a framework for commercial growers, it also requires them to comply with local ordinances. According to state law, growers only will be licensed after they \u201cprovide evidence of compliance with the local zoning laws for each physical address to be utilized as a compassion center or for the secure cultivation of medical marijuana.\u201d \nCurrently, marijuana is not mentioned in the town\u2019s zoning code.

This reduces battery capacity and lifespan and can even destroy the batteries. \n\nScientists at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and the Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich have now presented a process that, for the first time ever, allows this so-called lithium plating process to be investigated directly. This puts new strategies for quick-charging strategies close at hand. \nLithium plating, the depositing of metallic lithium at the anodes of lithium-ion batteries, is one of the primary factors that limits charging current. The performance of batteries suffers significantly from these metallic deposits. In extreme cases this can result in short circuits and even batteries going up in flames. \nWhen charging batteries, the positively charged lithium ions move through the liquid electrolytes and are deposited in the porous graphite anodes. However, the larger the current and the lower the temperature, the greater the probability that the lithium ions will not be deposited within the electrodes, as desired, but rather as a solid metallic layer on the outer surface \nEven though this phenomenon is basically well-known, many aspects remain shrouded in mystery. Until now, it was not possible to directly observe how and under which circumstances lithium plating takes place. \u201cUsing traditional methods of microscopy, we can only observe a battery after the fact, because it needs to be cut open,\u201d explains Dr. Josef Granwehr at the J\u00fclich Institute of Energy and Climate Research. \u201cIn the process, further reactions that distort the results become inevitable.\u201d \nEven highly developed processes like neutron scattering allow for only indirect analyses. Compounding the problem is the fact that available slots for measurements at research reactors and large particle accelerators are scarce. This makes these tools more suitable for fundamental investigations than for tedious, practical test series. \nElectrons show the way \nThe electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy process presented in the renowned scientific journal Materials Today, on the other hand, can be readily integrated into laboratory procedures \u2013 with only moderate investment. The method is akin to the better-known nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, albeit focusses on electron spins rather than atomic nuclei. \n\u201cElectrons are placed in an externally applied, static magnetic field,\u201d explains Granwehr. Unpaired electrons in the sample are \u201csounded out\u201d using microwaves. In the magnetic field, these stimulate the electrons to flip, which can be measured via the associated drop in microwave radiation intensity. EPR can differentiate between metallic lithium plating and lithium embedded in the graphite anodes. \nThe test cell is the key \n\u201cThe key to detecting lithium plating using EPR was the construction of a test cell compatible with the requirements of EPR spectroscopy while at the same time exhibiting good electrochemical properties,\u201d explains lead author Dr. Johannes Wandt. \u201cThe geometry is also important. Precise measurement results are contingent on the sample being exposed to the magnetic field but not the inevitably present electric field.\u201d \nTo ensure this, Wandt developed a rod-shaped cell while he was a doctoral candidate in the group of Prof. Hubert A. Gasteiger, Chair of Technical Electrochemistry at TUM, that allows the formation of metallic lithium to be detected directly and with quantitative precision. \n\u201cUsing this process, it is now for the first time possible to investigate lithium plating and the associated processes in a differentiated manner that is relevant to a whole array of applications,\u201d explains R\u00fcdiger-A. Eichel, a director at the J\u00fclich Institute of Energy and Climate Research. \u201cOne example is the development of safe and at the same time fast charging protocols. Our process make determining the maximum charging current before lithium plating sets in possible, as well as ascertaining other boundary conditions like temperature and the influence of electrode geometry.\u201d \nBeyond this, the methodology is well suited as a test procedure for a variety of battery materials, for example the development of new admixtures that suppress lithium plating. \n\u2014", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "forschungszentrum j\u00fclich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wandt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eichel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josef granwehr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johannes wandt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hubert a. gasteiger", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "technical university of munich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j\u00fclich institute of energy and climate research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chair of technical electrochemistry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tum", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:17.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e8042297998ddf2abf3d79f52a73e16403c65f6b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTjV8M2cA6rk4bk1j2qTDfLNT1vklZRmCRVvRisEPAtsNBWHH.k01ETEmxKtjPronImIxmtcfoaH79VyEf64THdlu3d_LrMzioCpg_gO8mE.zy4QUNduFyB", "site_full": "www.voanews.com", "site": "voanews.com", "site_section": "http://www1.voanews.com/templates/Articles.rss?sectionPath=/vietnamese/news/vietnam", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Voice of America", "title": "After Trump\u2019s Shift on Jerusalem, What\u2019s Next for Palestinians?", "title_full": "After Trump\u2019s Shift on Jerusalem, What\u2019s Next for Palestinians?", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://gdb.voanews.com/2D5002E2-FFBF-4484-89E1-AE86A295CDA5_cx7_cy15_cw84_w1200_r1_s.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5139, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 18, "comments": 0, "shares": 18}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e8042297998ddf2abf3d79f52a73e16403c65f6b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTjV8M2cA6rk4bk1j2qTDfLNT1vklZRmCRVvRisEPAtsNBWHH.k01ETEmxKtjPronImIxmtcfoaH79VyEf64THdlu3d_LrMzioCpg_gO8mE.zy4QUNduFyB", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "webdesk@voanews.com (Associated Press)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "After Trump\u2019s Shift on Jerusalem, What\u2019s Next for Palestinians?", "text": "The dramatic U.S. policy shift on contested Jerusalem is seen by the Western-backed Palestinian leadership as a dangerous betrayal and game changer that is bound to propel them into a risky confrontation with the U.S. and Israel on the global stage.\nPalestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas hasn\u2019t decided yet whether to formally abandon U.S.-led negotiations with Israel, a troubled process that after two decades has failed to bring the Palestinians closer to statehood. However, those close to Abbas say a Mideast era of stop-and-go negotiations and Washington\u2019s monopoly as mediator is now over.\nHere is a look at what could come next.\nA view of Jerusalem Old City seen from Mount of Olives, Dec. 6, 2017. Why Jerusalem matters \nTrump\u2019s recognition Wednesday of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital contradicts longstanding international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the holy city will be determined in negotiations. With Trump\u2019s sharp pivot, the U.S. is seen as siding with Israel, which claims all of Jerusalem, including the Israeli-annexed eastern sector the Palestinians seek as a future capital.\nThe dispute over Jerusalem forms the core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but transcends a mere real estate argument. The city, home to Judaism\u2019s holiest site, is also sacred to billions of Muslims and Christians worldwide, and perceived slights to their claims have triggered major protests or violence in the past.\nFILE - President Donald Trump shakes hands with with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas during their meeting in the Oval Office of the White House, May 3, 2017, in Washington. \u200b Abbas\u2019 response so far \nAbbas has been trying to rally international support, reaching out to leaders from Pope Francis to the EU foreign policy chief and Arab leaders. He warned Trump in a phone call that the U.S. shift will rock the region and threaten Washington\u2019s plans for a Mideast peace deal.\nIn a speech after Trump\u2019s announcement, Abbas said the U.S. has effectively removed itself from any role as a Mideast broker, but he did not say what immediate steps, if any, the Palestinians plan to take.\nAbbas is to hold internal consultations with officials from the Palestine Liberation Organization and his Fatah party, and plans to meet Thursday with his closest Arab ally, King Abdullah II of Jordan.\nA moment of truth? \nThe crisis over Jerusalem may push Abbas, the most steadfast Palestinian champion of seeking statehood through negotiations, to a point he avoided for so long \u2014 acknowledgment that the peace process isn\u2019t working, at least in its current format.\nCritics have argued that endless negotiations mainly serve Israel by providing diplomatic cover for its expansion of settlements on war-won lands. Abbas also derived some political legitimacy from the process, positioning himself as the only leader with a shot at delivering statehood.\nTrump says he remains committed to brokering a Mideast deal, despite the Jerusalem pivot. However, those close to Abbas say it\u2019s time to look for alternatives.\nAny talks with U.S. officials are now \u201csuperfluous and irrelevant,\u201d said Hanan Ashrawi, a senior PLO official. \u201cThe peace process is finished.\u201d\nAbbas has warned in the past that a failure to achieve a so-called two-state solution could prompt Palestinians to pursue a single state for two peoples, a prospect most Israelis reject.\nThe Palestinian leader may be reluctant to break away from his longstanding policies or lack the political courage to do so, but not shifting course now would be worse, said analyst Bassem Zbaidi.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the Palestinians to say no before coming under pressure to accept\u201d future U.S. proposals that could fall far short of their minimal demands, he said.\nFILE- The Washington office of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Nov. 18, 2017.The State Department said Friday that the office can stay open, with restrictions. \u200b Other options? \nSome PLO and Fatah officials suggested shifting from cooperation with the U.S. and avoidance of conflict with Israel to a more confrontational approach.\nFatah supports halting contacts with the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem, closing the PLO office in Washington and filing a complaint against the U.S. at the U.N. Security Council over plans to start a multiyear process of moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, said senior Fatah official Nasser al-Kidwa.\nThe Palestinians could also try to press prosecutors at the International Criminal Court to charge Israeli leaders with war crimes, including over settlement building, others said.\nAbbas has refrained from such a step until now, under apparent U.S. pressure.\nThe International Criminal Court prosecutor is currently conducting a preliminary examination of the situation in the Palestinian territories, but this is a more open-ended review and could take years. The probe was triggered by \u201cPalestine\u201d becoming a member state of the court. The status change, in turn, was made possible by the 2012 U.N. General Assembly recognition of a state of Palestine in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, the lands Israel captured in 1967.\n\nWATCH: In Controversial Announcement, Trump Recognizes Jerusalem as Capital of Israel \nEmbed code Copy and paste the embed code below.

An immediate goal is to persuade influential Western European countries to recognize a state of Palestine.\nPalestinian protesters burn tires as they wave Palestinian flags and pictures of late Palestinian president Yasser Arafat during a protest in Gaza City, Dec. 6, 2017. Defying worldwide warnings, U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday broke with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem. \nRisk or opportunity? \nFor Palestinians, Trump\u2019s policy shift offers both risk and opportunity.\nJerusalem has repeatedly been a flashpoint for violence, and Palestinian protest marches planned later this week could lead to clashes with Israeli troops.\nSuch confrontations can spin out of control, as they did more than a decade ago when they escalated into an armed uprising. Abbas staunchly opposes violence as counterproductive, but he may not be able to contain widespread public anger.\nSome say Trump\u2019s policy shift may create a moment of clarity and help end years of paralysis by making it impossible to perpetuate the idea that statehood is possible under the old paradigm.\n\u201cThat option is now off the table and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d said Diana Buttu, a former legal adviser of the Palestinian self-rule government. \u201cThis had really held us up for so many years.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mahmoud abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdullah ii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bassem zbaidi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pope francis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasser al-kidwa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanan ashrawi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arab", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "plo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.n. security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international criminal court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump recognizes jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.n. general assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine liberation organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judaism", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fatah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. consulate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem old city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mount of olives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine liberation organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oval office of the white house", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:17.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "67d6cf65ece6bf06e069fe5a0ba1b5847ebf7a24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94oobUZghFoTw5vtGrKAr.3R_sI_N9RzBgshSCZISDG8IcwLe8orr9frLqdSpm2.VtFyKGLrexmcgtD3Q.Z2AtumstD3taCYfHjjxaGHAMdOsvBOZ6ODY_FqZdbw1VPaQoyJf52ecAvQH62PycNgoTs2chsY_Sl84WaNdfIwNUCsWLYaaNuk_ZDdE-", "site_full": "www.amazon.co.uk", "site": "amazon.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product-reviews/B071VQ7G1D/ref=s9_acsd_ri_bw_c_x_9_r_w?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-4&pf_rd_r=EN3M6ZXK5TAQG2HRP10J&pf_rd_r=EN3M6ZXK5TAQG2HRP10J&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=59c7bca0-a516-473a-9895-61ecfb7b9e85&pf_rd_p=59c7bca0-a516-473a-9895-61ecfb7b9e85&pf_rd_i=2996091031", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Amazon.co.uk:Customer reviews: Then She Was Gone", "title": "The Sunday Times No 1 Bestseller", "title_full": "Amazon.co.uk:Customer reviews: Then She Was Gone: The Sunday Times No 1 Bestseller", "published": "2017-11-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.141, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "363355d1ffc752a25a8362b3cee88a7fb29f5c98", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94oobUZghFoTw5vtGrKAr.3R_sI_N9RzBgshSCZISDG8IcwLe8orr9frLqdSpm2.VtFyKGLrexmcgtD3Q.Z2AtumstD3taCYfHjjxaGHAMdOsvBOZ6ODY_FqZdbw1VPaQoyJf52ecAvQH62PycNgoTs2chsY_Sl84WaNdfIwNUCsWL697iXJ.RDlV73.G5RvRAquk_lxA7OnFFvSQb1yy4YDI-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "gillyflower", "published": "2017-12-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Love Lisa Jewell books, this was no exceptoion.

CT and MRI findings were compared on the following imaging findings: the shape of the cystic lesions and the presence or absence of septum, calcification, and high-intensity fluid on T1- and diffusion-weighted images ( b factor\u2009=\u20091000). The degree of contact with the pancreatic tail was compared between the EDCs and six of the MCNs at the edge of the pancreatic tail.\nResults The EDCs were round ( n \u2009=\u20093) or oval ( n \u2009=\u20095), while the MCNs consisted of three round, five oval, six pear-like, and six multilobulated lesions ( P \u2009<\u20090.05). Septum was present in 4 of 8 (50%) EDCs and 19 of 20 (95%) MCNs ( P \u2009<\u20090.05). The presence of calcification (2 of 8 [25%] EDCs vs. 8 of 20 [40%] MCNs), high-intensity fluid on T1-weighted images (2 of 7 [29%] EDCs vs. 5 of 20 [25%] MCNs), and high-intensity fluid on diffusion-weighted images (5 of 7 [71%] EDCs vs. 5 of 20 [25%] MCNs) were not significantly different. The degree of contact with the pancreatic parenchyma was similar between the two types of lesions.\nConclusion Although the imaging findings for EDC without a solid component and MCN overlap, a pear-like or multilobulated shape may favor a diagnosis of MCN.\n\n\nfrom #ORL-AlexandrosSfakianakis via ola Kala on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2B9CifE", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "edc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ola kala", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:17.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "affa26059e35d368c26e69e83df37208c866464e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSrrH298wF265Tor6rYrjLGi4Il_Up31q2IVdMXrBltB8raLv1OkPj.oMebVN3Bx1ytu5_9r7UGQQbN0kWO2nqPBv2nBT1mKN8v1Umha0MAZowp4Lq7ik.4yQWCOTnznnk-", "site_full": "threemenandafootball.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://threemenandafootball.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Champions League: cream rises but so do surprises \u2013 Three men and a football", "title": "Champions League: cream rises but so do surprises", "title_full": "Champions League: cream rises but so do surprises", "published": "2017-12-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "affa26059e35d368c26e69e83df37208c866464e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSrrH298wF265Tor6rYrjLGi4Il_Up31q2IVdMXrBltB8raLv1OkPj.oMebVN3Bx1ytu5_9r7UGQQbN0kWO2nqPBv2nBT1mKN8v1Umha0MAZowp4Lq7ik.4yQWCOTnznnk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "footyhead", "published": "2017-12-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "Champions League: cream rises but so do surprises", "text": "And so the Champions League groups stages are over this season. On the whole, the competition played out as expected \u2013 some groups were clearly loaded with strong teams that progressed easily (e.g. PSG, Bayern Munich, Man Utd, Liverpool, Barcelona, Man City). Indeed, in these groups, we predicted fairly accurately the teams that would be left scrapping only for third place, and for many (e.g. Celtic) that was a realistic expectation and an achievement in itself .\nSo whilst the group stages are a procession or endurance for some teams, it is the genuine surprises that lit up the competition this year. No one truly expected Tottenham to top a group with Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund. They not only put their Wembley hoodoo aside, they outplayed all teams and even kept their foot on the pedal last night to win against Apoel Nicosia and ensure top spot .\nMeanwhile Roma\u2019s achievements may have been even more impressive. A massive personnel change in the summer, a new manager and a wobbly start in the league meant very few people predicted success for them this season . However, they somehow pulled everything together, outplaying Chelsea over 2 legs and won the group , in the process confining the mighty Atletico Madrid to the Europa League (though undoubtedly their summer transfer ban has not helped their squad depth).\nThis all takes us to the knockout stages. In effect this is a new competition now \u2013 almost 3 months will pass until the teams meet, with plenty of time for form to fluctuate and injuries to accumulate. Not to also mention a transfer window to potentially improve teams\u2019 personnel . The key question is whether Tottenham and Roma got lucky and hit a purple patch at the right time of the season, or whether they are genuine dark horse outsiders for the title.

Vulnerable and believable characters who get wrapped up in a complex, shocking tale of desire with a brave and brilliant conclusion. I don't think I will ever forget this book. I recommended it to a poorly friend and she finished it in a day. Some of the reviews mention a predictable plot but what I think is so clever about the structure here is that Lisa allows you to discover the dark truths, things that are too dreadful to contemplate creep into your mind, and then - wham - a couple of pages later she confirms your worst fears. The author's ability to make the ending deeply moving and somehow uplifting is nothing short of magical.

CT and MRI findings were compared on the following imaging findings: the shape of the cystic lesions and the presence or absence of septum, calcification, and high-intensity fluid on T1- and diffusion-weighted images ( b factor\u2009=\u20091000). The degree of contact with the pancreatic tail was compared between the EDCs and six of the MCNs at the edge of the pancreatic tail.\nResults The EDCs were round ( n \u2009=\u20093) or oval ( n \u2009=\u20095), while the MCNs consisted of three round, five oval, six pear-like, and six multilobulated lesions ( P \u2009<\u20090.05). Septum was present in 4 of 8 (50%) EDCs and 19 of 20 (95%) MCNs ( P \u2009<\u20090.05). The presence of calcification (2 of 8 [25%] EDCs vs. 8 of 20 [40%] MCNs), high-intensity fluid on T1-weighted images (2 of 7 [29%] EDCs vs. 5 of 20 [25%] MCNs), and high-intensity fluid on diffusion-weighted images (5 of 7 [71%] EDCs vs. 5 of 20 [25%] MCNs) were not significantly different. The degree of contact with the pancreatic parenchyma was similar between the two types of lesions.\nConclusion Although the imaging findings for EDC without a solid component and MCN overlap, a pear-like or multilobulated shape may favor a diagnosis of MCN.\n\n\nfrom #MedicinebyAlexandrosSfakianakis via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2B9CifE\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "edc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:17.035+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f389f26c820ba1d3eab3056a12f4f9c2fa623d05", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrrRORleMxMhchsa62jNi555j1rK2EEQGI40o2AvQAgGrI5luetyRnF", "site_full": "southafrica.shafaqna.com", "site": "shafaqna.com", "site_section": "http://southafrica.shafaqna.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "South Africa News (News Reader) |", "title": "Espadachines de otra \u00e9poca", "title_full": "Espadachines de otra \u00e9poca", "published": "2017-12-07T10:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5727, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f389f26c820ba1d3eab3056a12f4f9c2fa623d05", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrrRORleMxMhchsa62jNi555j1rK2EEQGI40o2AvQAgGrI5luetyRnF", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "Espadachines de otra \u00e9poca", "text": "20 hours ago Espadachines de otra \u00e9poca Zuma confident of seamless handover to new ANC leadership - timeslive MEXICO ENERGY - Mexico opens power-line sector to private firms - efe | Most Popular (6 hours) Aduriz y Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda meten al Athletic en dieciseisavos de final de la Europa League - lavanguardia Rusia inaugura los primeros centros de emisi\u00f3n del Fan ID para el Mundial 2018\u2122 - rt New resistance to spatial transformation claims in City of Cape Town saga - mg - lavanguardia Most Popular (a week) \u00bfCu\u00e1ndo aprender mejor idiomas? - lavanguardia timeslive \u00a9 2014 Shafaqna.com All Rights Reserved.

December 2017 Imec analysis confirms benefit of 3-D heterogeneous integration \nImec has produced the first power-performance-area-cost (PPAC) analysis of different sequential 3D-integration variants using advanced 5nm and 3nm CMOS technology nodes. \nThe most significant benefit was found for a heterogeneous sequential-3D integration approach that uses different device layers (or tiers) for the non-scalable (analog and I/O) and scalable parts (logic and memory) of the system. \nThese results confirm the potential of heterogeneous sequential-3D integration as a possible route for heterogeneous scaling\u2014an emerging approach that integrates multiple transistor architectures in one system-on-chip. Sequential-3D integration (S3D) is widely viewed as a promising alternative to continue the benefits offered by semiconductor scaling. S3D involves the vertical integration of sequentially processed device layers (or tiers) with isolation and interconnect layers in between. \nThree levels of granularity can be defined, depending on where the partitioning and stacking takes place: at the transistor level (T-S3D), cell level (C-S3D) or IP block level, also called heterogeneous S3D (H-S3D). \nH-S3D is considered as a possible enabler for heterogeneous scaling. Compared with traditional through-Si-via (TSV)-based 3D-integration techniques, S3D in general offers a higher interconnect density and a more precise (lithography-defined) alignment of the stacked transistors, cells and IP blocks. For the first time ever, Imec has quantified the power-performance-area-cost (PPAC) benefits of the various S3D variants for 5nm and 3nm technology nodes. To meet the challenges for S3D fabrication, the imec team used advanced technologies in some of the most critical process steps. \nThe largest PPAC benefit was found for a heterogenous S3D use case, where the logic and memory part is scaled to iN5 technology, and the remaining non-scalable part (analog and I/O) is manufactured in N28 technology in the top tier. \nFor this use case, despite a high wafer cost, a die cost reduction of 33 percent was achieved with respect to a 2D-SoC implementation with 125mm2 die size. \u201cOur results demonstrate the potential of S3D technology which benefits the implementation of next-generation application hardware such as 5G and Artifical Intelligence,\u201d stated Imec\u2019s Nadine Collaert.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nadine collaert", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "imec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ppac", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:18.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1adb656fb83966a514c4d057a7c11888bcd6b53f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR5DHTqogzmAODP4WiiIU7Q81gA7OGwXqjao4HYcERw.XO6L7UZwwrZANkFifDg4ViKn.hwo_PY_g--", "site_full": "forums.nasioc.com", "site": "nasioc.com", "site_section": "https://forums.nasioc.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=68", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "General Community - NASIOC", "title": "CV joints?", "title_full": "CV joints? - NASIOC", "published": "2017-12-07T11:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 25014, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1adb656fb83966a514c4d057a7c11888bcd6b53f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR5DHTqogzmAODP4WiiIU7Q81gA7OGwXqjao4HYcERw.XO6L7UZwwrZANkFifDg4ViKn.hwo_PY_g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Surp", "published": "2017-12-07T11:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "CV joints?", "text": "Was driving to work and as I was pulling in the parking lot heard a lot of grinding.

PHOTO BY ANDREA VON HOHENLEITEN Lucas O\u2019Reilly didn\u2019t have to look \u2014 or smell \u2014 very far to find the subject for a letter to the editor published in his hometown newspaper last month. \nThe 16-year-old junior at North Kingstown High School is required to write a monthly letter to a newspaper for his class on current affairs. During the summer, he noticed a rise in the skunk population while riding his bicycle from work to his Clinton Avenue home. After his dog had a few fateful encounters with the pungent mammal, he decided to submit a letter to The Jamestown Press to raise awareness of their increased presence. \n\u201cIt was just kind of crazy to me that skunks were the animal I was seeing the most, out of squirrels or anything like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a couple close calls, and it was less of a nuisance until my dog started getting sprayed pretty frequently. I decided to address an issue that was prevalent to me and my life. Even though it was an assignment, it was something I wanted to do anyway.\u201d \nStudents in David Avedesian\u2019s class on current affairs Monday scour newspapers for articles that interest them. Once they identify an article, they write a letter to the editor of a newspaper. PHOTO BY ANDREA VON HOHENLEITEN His letter asked several questions. What steps could the town take to solve this problem? Was a cull necessary? He wanted his letter to be a catalyst for further discussion amongst his neighbors and the town councilors. \nDespite O\u2019Reilly\u2019s strong feelings, his teacher, David Avedesian, was skeptical. He believed the problems raised in the letter were overblown by his student. \n\u201cI kept telling him his letter stinks in more ways than one,\u201d Avedesian quipped. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t take the letter seriously at all.\u201d \nNonetheless, O\u2019Reilly chose to submit the letter as his assignment for the month. Indeed, it was published in the Nov. 9 edition. \n\u201cHe was so pumped up that it got published,\u201d Avedesian said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t wait to run in and stick it in my face.\u201d \nAvedesian said he was unaware about the skunk issue; he thought his student\u2019s concerns were solitary. O\u2019Reilly, however, said he simply followed Avedesian\u2019s advice to write a letter that would start a dialogue. He was certain other townspeople noticed the rise of skunk sightings on the island. \nNot alone in his concern \nDespite the publication of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s letter, Avedesian still was not completely convinced about the seriousness of the issue \u2014 until he noticed a letter in the Nov. 22 issue of the Press. The piece was written by Narragansett Avenue resident Chris Tanner, who corroborated O\u2019Reilly\u2019s story and described his own frequent sightings of skunks around town at all hours of the day. \n\u201cThat was the moment he realized that it wasn\u2019t just random,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said, \u201cfive minutes before class.\u201d \nThe class, a half-year elective course, requires students to write at least four letters before the winter break. When the class meets, they will typically read and discuss stories from three local papers \u2014 The Jamestown Press, The Independent and the Providence Journal \u2014 along with segments from that week\u2019s episode of \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d Because it is a history course, Avedesian also may include the historical context of a story during class discussions. \nThe class differs from the journalism course that North Kingstown offers. That class is an English course that publishes the school\u2019s newspaper and its classroom discussions center more on how a story is written. Avedesian\u2019s class, meanwhile, focuses on current issues. \nAvedesian, who has been a history teacher at North Kingstown for 15 years, has been teaching current affairs for the past decade. He introduced the monthly assignment shortly after he took over the class. It became particularly popular once the students started to be published. \n\u201cI decided to include it because it\u2019s an elective,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get a lot more flexibility with some of the assignments. You have to be a little more creative at times because they don\u2019t necessarily need the class to graduate.\u201d \nThe students select the topics for their letters based on whatever news stories catch their eyes that month. Or, in O\u2019Reilly\u2019s case, their personal experiences. They are required to submit a rough draft to Avedesian for edits before sending it off to a newspaper editor. \n\u201cSometimes they\u2019ll write something and I\u2019m like, \u2018You got no shot on getting published,\u2019 and they\u2019ll send it anyway,\u201d Avedesian said. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s properly formatted, it\u2019s factual and they\u2019re not personally attacking anyone, they get credit for it.\u201d \nThe students also get to choose which newspapers they will send their letter to. Although most students submit to the three papers they read in class, some have loftier goals and choose larger papers, such as the Boston Globe or USA Today. Avedesian has saved every letter by his students that have been published. They hang on his classroom wall. \n\u201cThere\u2019s hundreds hanging up in my room,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids always ask me, \u2018How do I write one and what should I include?\u2019 I just tell them to go read some.\u201d \nSparked more letters \nAvedesian said it\u2019s intriguing to see problems reappearing in the newspapers. Some concerns that were the topic of conversation eight years ago are now the topic of letters in this year\u2019s class. \n\u201cIt\u2019s always interesting to see how history repeats,\u201d he said. \nAs for O\u2019Reilly\u2019s letter, the teen said he was excited to open the newspaper and see his work. \n\u201cI\u2019d never been published before,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was something really cool to see my own writing and see my name in the paper. I think a lot of classmates who have done this assignment also feel similarly.\u201d \nFollowing the success of his skunk letter, O\u2019Reilly submitted two pieces to two different newspapers for his November assignment. \nThe first letter was another submission to The Jamestown Press about vandalism on the rocks and cliffs around Fort Wetherill State Park. O\u2019Reilly had regularly visited the park with his friends this summer and became concerned about the graffiti that shrouds the historic bunkers. \n\u201cIt\u2019s destroying the natural beauty of the rocks,\u201d he said. \u201cI just thought that was ridiculous. I know there\u2019s no solutions to idiotic people doing that kind of thing, but what\u2019s the possibility of getting it removed?\u201d \nHis second letter was sent to the Providence Journal and focused on media consumption through headlines seen on smartphone notifications. That letter was published in the Nov. 25 edition of the Journal. \nAvedesian has yet to see the final draft of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s letter about Fort Wetherill, which was sent to both him and the newspaper\u2019s editor last Thursday. However, he was not surprised that a Jamestown student had written another piece about life on the island. \n\u201cJamestown kids are usually pretty concerned about not letting Jamestown slip away,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want the peaceful island community to go the way of Newport or Narragansett. I always give them a hard time that there needs to be a Walmart on the island. They go nuts when I say that.\u201d \nDon\u2019t disrespect park with graffiti \nTo the editor: \nEvery day, I realize how blessed I am to live in a place with as much natural beauty as Jamestown. \nThe coastline surrounding the island always has new secluded inlets and beautiful beaches to discover. One of the more popular waterfront attractions is Fort Wetherill. \nI have lived in Jamestown for two years and visited the fort many times to explore and swim. When exploring the old battery defenses, it easily can be seen that there is lots of graffiti, ranging from beautiful and creative street art work to obscene images. The graffiti on the cement buildings is not ideal but does not pose as much of a shock as many state parks are vandalized. \nToward the end of the summer I started noticing more and more graffiti on the beautiful cliffs overlooking the water. Even though the illegality of the graffiti does not change with its location, it does greater damage to one of Jamestown\u2019s more beautiful areas when the graffiti is clearly marking up rocks and disrupting the view of the bay. It is sad to see such blatant disrespect of natural beauty. \nI think I speak for other Jamestowners when I say this. Fort Wetherill means a lot to the town, so I call on anyone who feels similarly to contact Rhode Island\u2019s Division of Parks and Recreation and share their thoughts and ideas on how we, as Jamestowners, can work to solve this issue. \nLucas O\u2019Reilly", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ryan gibbs  lucas o\u2019reilly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fort wetherill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o\u2019reilly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrea von hohenleiten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david avedesian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamestowners", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "avedesian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrea von hohenleiten lucas o\u2019reilly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris tanner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucas o\u2019reilly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "division of parks and recreation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walmart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston globe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north kingstown high school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the jamestown press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa today", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "providence journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamestown press", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "clinton avenue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rhode island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fort wetherill state park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fort wetherill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narragansett avenue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamestown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north kingstown", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:18.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "176b3b918aad0834a64527324228705a21320434", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTA34CnrGnjixjxdG7Msqqgb.qd4J2E.Y4U4uMgARD.qoneHoLfPRcxvZRsbarkVIJWDzuq5bdDO0NfBijQGx7fwEzs1TwXMc3V2kRh_7MKXQ--", "site_full": "sportsnaut.com", "site": "sportsnaut.com", "site_section": "http://www.yardbarker.com/rss/sport/5", "site_categories": ["football", "baseball", "pro_basketball", "sports"], "section_title": "Yardbarker: College Football", "title": "Report: Tennessee expected to name Jeremy Pruitt head coach", "title_full": "Report: Tennessee expected to name Jeremy Pruitt head coach", "published": "2017-12-07T05:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.yardbarker.com/media/8/5/852ba776f17eee55d49dd3312b1f2cfa273e89b6/thumb_16x9/9793638.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "176b3b918aad0834a64527324228705a21320434", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTA34CnrGnjixjxdG7Msqqgb.qd4J2E.Y4U4uMgARD.qoneHoLfPRcxvZRsbarkVIJWDzuq5bdDO0NfBijQGx7fwEzs1TwXMc3V2kRh_7MKXQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T05:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "Report: Tennessee expected to name Jeremy Pruitt head coach", "text": "Tweet John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports \nEarlier on Wednesday, it was reported that Alabama defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt emerged as a leading candidate for the Tennessee Volunteers\u2019 head coaching job. \nWe now have a follow-up on that report.

Ever since the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) moved to Goa in 2004, discussions have veered around the need for the country's biggest and most extravagant film festival to have more autonomy, a weightier focus on parallel cinema and less of Bollywood. Just a few weeks into her mid-July appointment to the post, Union minister for information and broadcasting (I&B) Smriti Irani demonstrated little inclination for these concerns. With the country caught up in the swirl of the engineered storms over Padmavati and I&B ministry's trenchant stand on excluding S Durga from the screening list at the Goa film festival -- despite the Kerala high court order -- Irani ironically used Bollywood to strike back at the growing outrage over censorship. The festival concluded last week on what would best be described as a deliberate ramp up of Bollywood glitz -- a response most likely to actor Shabana Azmi's call for a boycott of IFFI over Padmavati. From Shah Rukh Khan, who was at the opening event, to Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Salman Khan, Karan Johar, Katrina Kaif, Alia Bhatt -- the list goes endlessly on -- Bollywood's A-listers scorched the red carpet in Goa like never before and even sat for a few media conversations. \"They're here because of Smritiji,\" a member of the Entertainment Society of Goa committee told The Wire when asked how much they were costing the state government which had picked up 75% of the Rs 24 crore tab for IFFI 2016. A former television actor and producer, Irani was best known for her presence in soaps like Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi and the overwrought mythological series Ramayan on Zee TV. But it wasn't just the Bollywood deluge on the red carpet and the silence of its highest paid stars on Padmavati and the stonewalling of Sexy Durga -- Shah Rukh Khan's inaugural speech for instance sent reporters scurrying to the newsroom to figure out whether his rather innocuous comment: \"...and no matter what your ideology is, storytelling and listening should be a familiar experience, which binds us all together, makes relationships stronger even in the face of dissent and discussion?\" was actually a cryptic form of criticism of the controversies raging outside -- that stood out at this IFFI.

Credit: Twitter/Manohar Parrikar The incongruity of adhering to the national anthem mandate at an international film festival was never more apparent than when it played a record 37 times a day at the Goa fest. That many films a day -- 37 at the festival's peak -- meant that many times delegates (some of them confused foreigners) were expected to jump to their feet, for fear of being prodded from behind or the side. In a few of the shows I sat for, 'Bharat Mata ki jai' followed the anthem. When the Supreme Court ruled on November 30 last year that the national anthem would have to be played before screening of films to instil the feeling of \"committed patriotism and nationalism\", it had perhaps not considered the case of film festivals with an international audience. IFFI had its share of good films and bad this year, with the bad frankly outweighing the good which reflected on the rushed decision by Irani to hand over the reins of the festival to the National Film Development Corporation (NFDC) just two months before the curtain raiser. The Directorate of Film Festivals, also under the I&B ministry, that had handled the event for four decades was relegated to a supporting role. Also read: Unprecedented, Unconstitutional Action by I&B Ministry to Remove Two Films From IFFI List: 'S Durga' Director https://thewire.in/197958/s-durga-sanal-kumar-sasidharan/ A whole retrospective, considered the meatier section of the festival, was wasted on showing nine James Bond movies -- something one can catch every day on television -- at a hefty cost to the IFFI budget. Among the outstanding films were the Oscar and Bafta nominated British director Sally Porter's The Party, the Chilean film A Fantastic Woman directed by Sebastin Lelio and the Iranian Oscar entry for this year, Breath. Breathtaking in scope and the acting of its lead characters -- half of them children -- the film's director, Narges Abyar, who travelled all the way to the India festival, was stranded in translation -- the NFDC had made no effort to arrange an interpreter. The number of domestic film enthusiasts in the Goa IFFI have grown exponentially over the years -- probably something to do with easy mix of beer bars and films at the venue. But the vibe of the early years is clearly missing as foreign delegate participation thins out. Christian Jeune, deputy festival director of Cannes Film Festival told the Times of India he'd been left utterly unimpressed by politicians sharing the red carpet with the film fraternity at IFFI. Even though fully funded by their government, \"there was absolutely no political interference\" at Cannes, he said. The shoddy treatment of Malayalam filmmaker Sanal Kumar Sasidharan who made S Durga, and Ravi Jadhav who made Nude, shows who's calling the shots at IFFI, where political connections matter more than qualifications or an interest in films to get a pass for the opening and closing events and films.

CT and MRI findings were compared on the following imaging findings: the shape of the cystic lesions and the presence or absence of septum, calcification, and high-intensity fluid on T1- and diffusion-weighted images ( b factor\u2009=\u20091000). The degree of contact with the pancreatic tail was compared between the EDCs and six of the MCNs at the edge of the pancreatic tail.\nResults The EDCs were round ( n \u2009=\u20093) or oval ( n \u2009=\u20095), while the MCNs consisted of three round, five oval, six pear-like, and six multilobulated lesions ( P \u2009<\u20090.05). Septum was present in 4 of 8 (50%) EDCs and 19 of 20 (95%) MCNs ( P \u2009<\u20090.05). The presence of calcification (2 of 8 [25%] EDCs vs. 8 of 20 [40%] MCNs), high-intensity fluid on T1-weighted images (2 of 7 [29%] EDCs vs. 5 of 20 [25%] MCNs), and high-intensity fluid on diffusion-weighted images (5 of 7 [71%] EDCs vs. 5 of 20 [25%] MCNs) were not significantly different. The degree of contact with the pancreatic parenchyma was similar between the two types of lesions.\nConclusion Although the imaging findings for EDC without a solid component and MCN overlap, a pear-like or multilobulated shape may favor a diagnosis of MCN.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2B9CifE", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "edc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:19.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e41023aaa54fab55d2645e860c12e307ae3028b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQmvmo2jLDTH31uITM2Op2mCrTYUetuZQw3tzHRt.pmHxTZ3cGhoO6nNu9ockDXOCTzq6.K2sxb9FepvrciAp8nkkAg1m827xyoS14vEOdxGg--", "site_full": "wichita.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://wichita.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist wichita | for sale search", "title": "2011 Nissan armada platinum 4wd loaded (Wichita) $8495", "title_full": "2011 Nissan armada platinum 4wd loaded (Wichita) $8495", "published": "2017-12-07T10:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_dlxmwaq6nBU_600x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0e41023aaa54fab55d2645e860c12e307ae3028b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQmvmo2jLDTH31uITM2Op2mCrTYUetuZQw3tzHRt.pmHxTZ3cGhoO6nNu9ockDXOCTzq6.K2sxb9FepvrciAp8nkkAg1m827xyoS14vEOdxGg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "2011 Nissan armada platinum 4wd loaded (Wichita) $8495", "text": "type: SUV QR Code Link to This Post 2011 Nissan Armada platinum 4wd loaded leather interior sunroof DVD player power windows power locks tilt cruise AM/FM radio runs and drives great in excellent condition asking $8495 more info call show contact info do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers post id: 6415785209", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "nissan armada", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nissan", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "wichita", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:19.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "da8a7fe3044d0e5e03a9c65e758b2f144025edf1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9BcPFu_4VOJxXOPE7_XaSqQ7BhqHHMpbuZ1pILTRfEVb4V6vPoj6rsSvlALd.kfUGIFS0UkahyBG7cYMOBuED0BkNjFigUCetT7vjxE_u33C6lGujdYCJpRKbCmF1hmaUIrRJvZHx9RQ--", "site_full": "www.onenewspage.com.au", "site": "onenewspage.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.onenewspage.com.au/topnewsRSS.php", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Latest News on One News Page [Australia] -

At the same time, traditional chip design requires the use of debug tools to ensure the chip is ready for production. \nHowever, traditional hardware debug tools do nothing to spot nor to prevent changes or problems in the completed system in the field: these can significantly affect performance or power, impacting security and safety amongst other things. \nThrough this partnership, the Percepio and UltraSoC embedded debug tools are able to communicate and share essential information in real-time to ensure system-wide monitoring, effectively guaranteeing maximum performance and reliability. \n\u201cUltraSoC\u2019s universal semiconductor debug, monitoring and analytics platform is an ideal complement for our Tracealyzer visualizations,\u201d says Johan Kraft, CEO and founder of Percepio, \u201cby combining our tools and offering something the industry has never seen, there are significant opportunities available to both companies.\u201d \nPercepio is widely used by designers using FreeRTOS, RTLinux and VxWorks, amongst other environments. UltraSoC\u2019s analytics IP is designed to be used across any hardware platform, providing semiconductor designers with embedded analytics and intelligence in hardware debug. Bringing these two toolsets together ensures system designers benefit from an integrated embedded analytics solution. Synchronizing Percepio\u2019s Tracealyzer with UltraSoC\u2019s IP modules gives system designers an unparalleled insight into their embedded hardware and software. \nPercepio\u2019s Tracealyzer embedded software debug tool offers unprecedented levels of insight into the run-time behavior of complex multi-threaded RTOS (Real Time Operating systems) or Linux-based software systems, allowing for improved development productivity, reduced time-to-market and better software quality.

Kinnick boys basketball team that a season ago went 17-20 overall. Eight players have reached double figures in a game this season, with Davion Roberts averaging 14 points per game, Gage Henderson 12.8, Aaron Peterson 11 and Kedrick Stockman 10.8. The Red Devils are the first team to top 100 points in a game, doing so in a 102-40 victory last Tuesday over Christian Academy Japan. What has sparked the turnaround? \u201cThese boys have been together for a long time and their hard work is starting to show,\u201d coach Robert Stovall said of a group whose core players matriculated in youth activities ball during their elementary- and middle-school years and are now on the Kinnick varsity. They\u2019ve worked with outside adult coaching on the base, including Steve Horton, who took seven of the current Red Devils to Hawaii and won the Pacific Rim Championships as the Yoko Xpress Elite. \u201cWe have a group of adults who\u2019ve been working with these guys from middle school up and it\u2019s starting to show up on our team,\u201d said Stovall, in his eighth season at the Red Devils\u2019 helm. Despite the solid start, Stovall said the Red Devils still have much to work on, including rebounding and patience. \u201cWe have a lot of way to go to get better,\u201d he said. Their journey continues this weekend when they make their lone visit to Misawa Air Base for a DODEA-Japan weekend series against Robert D. Edgren. This is the last weekend prior to the start of DODEA-Pacific\u2019s two-week Christmas vacation. Other events of significance see Okinawa\u2019s, Korea\u2019s and Japan\u2019s wrestling teams venture off base for competition. DODEA-Korea\u2019s four high schools compete on Saturday at the Daejeon Physical Education School. On Okinawa, Kadena visits Urasoe Tech while Kubasaki travels to Haebaru. And DODEA-Japan\u2019s three Kanto Plain schools head to Christian Academy Japan for its annual invitational. On the hardwood, defending Far East Division II boys champion E.J. King makes its way to Kobe for one of two Western Japan Athletic Association tournaments this season. The Cobras girls travel to Osaka. In Korea, Daegu\u2019s boys and girls hit the road for a weekend swing through Seoul Foreign on Friday and Seoul American on Saturday. Humphreys entertains Yongsan on Friday as does Osan on Saturday. Kadena plays host to Zion Christian\u2019s boys and girls basketball teams.

NAZI OCCULT GROUPS \n\nErik Hanussen , born Hermann Steinschneider, was a Jewish occultist.\n\n'He instructed Adolf Hitler in performance and the achievement of dramatic effect.'\n\nHe enjoyed the company of Germany's  elite, becoming close with members of Ernst Rohm's Brownshirts ( SA ).  \n'He was a supporter of the Nazis despite his Jewish ancestry, which was an open secret.'\n\nHanussen was close to certain important Nazi officials, to whom he had lent money.\n\n...\n\nAccording to  Dr. Walter C. Langer , a psychoanalyst, who prepared a psychological profile of Hitler for the Office of Strategic Services in 1943: \n\n\"During the early 1920s Hitler took regular lessons in mass psychology from Hanussen] [5] who was  a practicing astrologer\"\n\nIn 1931 Hanussen began publishing an occult journal, Hanussen Magazin.

Giroux: Gangster Capitalism and Nostalgic Authoritarianism in Trump\u2019s America Ever since first seeing Henry Giroux interviewed by Bill Moyers many years ago, I have deeply respected and appreciated Henry and the wisdom and depth, integrity and courage, and truth and vision of his work. Henry Giroux is among those whose voices are most important for us to listen to, learn from, and act upon. Seeing the problem in all its darkness and depth also generates solutions visible that were once hidden. Another world is truly possible. Tag, we are all it! \u2015 Molly In one year, the Trump regime has wrought immense damage to democracy, culture and thought. But there\u2019s new hope By HENRY A. GIROUX Just one year into the Donald Trump presidency, not only have the failures of American democracy become clear, but many of the darkest elements of its history have been catapulted to the center of power. A dystopian ideology, a kind of nostalgic yearning for older authoritarian relations of power, now shapes and legitimates a mode of governance that generates obscene levels of inequality, expands the ranks of corrupt legislators, places white supremacists and zealous ideologues in positions of power, threatens to jail its opponents, and sanctions an expanding network of state violence both at home and abroad. Trump has accelerated a culture of cruelty, a machinery of terminal exclusion and social abandonment that wages a war on undocumented immigrants, poor minorities of color and young people. He uses the power of the presidency to peddle misinformation , erode any sense of shared citizenship, ridicule critical media and celebrate right-wing \"disimagination machines\" such as Fox News and Breitbart News. Under his \u201cbrand of reality TV politics,\u201d lying has become normalized, truthfulness is viewed as a liability, ignorance is propagated at the highest levels of government and the corporate controlled media, and fear-soaked cyclones of distraction and destruction immunize the American public to the cost of human suffering and misery. Under the Trump administration, culture has been weaponized and is used as a powerful tool of power, misinformation and indoctrination. James Baldwin, in a 1979 New York Times essay titled \u201cIf Black English Isn\u2019t a Language, Then Tell Me, What Is?\u201d wrote, \u201cPeople evolve a language ... in order not to be submerged by a reality that they cannot articulate.\u201d This is certainly true for Trump, who recognizes that the normalization of state-sanctioned lying kills democracy, and destroys the capacity to produce informed judgments. Trump\u2019s serial lying is daunting in that it normalizes discourses, \u201cactions, and policies exempt from moral evaluation [and] treated as beyond good and evil.\u201d As Hannah Arendt argues in \"The Origins of Totalitarianism ,\" the erasure of truth, facts and standards of reference furthers the collapse of democratic institutions because it is \u201ceasier to accept patently absurd propositions than the old truths which have become pious banalities. Vulgarity with its cynical dismissal of respected standards and accepted theories carried with it the worst ... and [is] easily mistaken for courage and a new style of life.\u201d As language is emptied of any meaning, an authoritarian populism is emboldened and fills the airways and the streets with sonic blasts of racism, anti-Semitism and violence. New York Times columnist (and former Salon reporter) Michelle Goldberg rightly observes that Trump makes it difficult to hold onto any sense of what is normal given his relentless attempts to upend the rule of law, justice, ethics and democracy itself. She writes: The country has changed in the past year, and many of us have grown numb after unrelenting shocks. What now passes for ordinary would have once been inconceivable. The government is under the control of an erratic racist who engages in nuclear brinkmanship on Twitter. \u2026 He publicly pressures the Justice Department to investigate his political opponents. He\u2019s called for reporters to be jailed, and his administration demanded that a sportscaster who criticized him be fired. Official government statements promote his hotels. You can\u2019t protest it all; you\u2019d never do anything else. After the election, many liberals pledged not to \u201cnormalize\u201d Trump. But one lesson of this year is that we don\u2019t get to decide what normal looks like. There is more at work here than the kind of crass entertainment that mimics celebratory culture. As Byung-Chul Han argues, \u201cevery age has its signature afflictions.\u201d Ours is an unprecedented corporate takeover of the U.S. government and the reemergence of elements of totalitarianism in new forms. At stake here is the power of an authoritarian ideology that fuels a hyperactive exploitative economic order, apocalyptic nationalism and feral appeals to racial cleansing that produce what Paul Street has called the nightmare of capitalism .

A storm of that magnitude would drop at least 9 inches of rain in a 24-hour period. Although that\u2019s unlikely, Gray said he\u2019s witnessed the waterline just an inch from the top of the dam, which was during the historic flooding of spring 2010. \nAccording to Gray, the work needs to be performed during the dry season, which is July through September. Permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the state coastal council, however, were approved later than expected. Because they weren\u2019t authorized until September, Gray didn\u2019t want to risk work being hampered by snow. \n\u201cIt is important that the dam reconstruction be in the dry (season),\u201d he said. \nAccording to Gray, workers will begin by excavating the current dike, which is 8 feet wide and 500 feet long. They then will rebuild the embankment using riprap, which is a mixture of stones and rubble, with concrete blocks topping the new dike. \nThe issue surfaced five years ago when the Department of Environmental Management ordered the town to clear-cut vegetation along the dike. Because it\u2019s considered a \u201chigh hazard dam,\u201d the state mandated a property inspection by civil engineers. A subsequent review found the spillway could only handle a 2-year storm, which has an annual probability of 50 percent and would drop 2 inches of rain in a 24-hour period. The state is now requiring an overhaul of the abutment. \nAfter receiving notice from the state, Gray initially planned to rebuild the dam and spillway, which would require heavy equipment and specialized labor. The preliminary cost was at least $750,000. To cut costs, however, Gray and the engineers determined a cheaper solution. The dam and spillway will remain intact, but workers will rebuild the earthwork dike and top it with concrete armor. \nBecause the dike will be about 18 inches lower than the dam, heavy rainfall will cause the reservoir to spill over the western edge into wetlands and eventually Dutch Harbor. Right now, water does top that side, but the dike embankment has become deteriorated because it\u2019s only soil and grass. \nAccording to Gray, equipment and workers from his department could provide the labor since the project doesn\u2019t include digging concrete. The project is expected to commence when the reservoir is at its lowest point, which is typically toward the end of summer.
