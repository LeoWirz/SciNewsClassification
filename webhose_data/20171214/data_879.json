On Friday, he travels to northeastern Greece to meet with members of the country's Muslim minority.\nSecurity was tight in the Greek capital, with roads shut down and demonstrations banned in the center of Athens.\nOn the eve of his arrival, Erdogan alarmed Greek officials by saying in an interview with Greece's Skai television that the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, which determined current Greek-Turkish borders among other issues, should be \"updated.\"\n\"In fact, all agreements (pacts) in the world should be updated with the passage of time,\" Erdogan said in the interview. \"Lausanne too, in the face of all these developments, is in need of an update. This update would be beneficial not only for Turkey but also for Greece.\"\nErdogan has made similar comments in the past about the peace treaty, which set the borders of modern Turkey, but his repetition on the day before his arrival in Athens came as an unwelcome surprise to his hosts.\nHis comments \"raises serious concerns and questions,\" Greek government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said in a statement.\n\"The Greek government and the prime minister want his visit to be a reason to build bridges, not to raise walls.\"\nA Greek Presidential Guard officer inspects the evzones prior to the official welcome ceremony for Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in Athens, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017. Erdogan is in Greece on atto-day official visit. (AP Photo/Thanassis Stavrakis) Tzanakopoulos said respecting the treaty is \"the exclusive and non-negotiable foundation on which the honest cooperation of the two countries can be built.\"\n\"Comments regarding its revision do not contribute to the climate we are trying to build in our relations and in the region,\" he said.\nThe refugee crisis will be high on the agenda of talks with Erdogan, as Greek islands have been the gateway into Europe for migrants crossing from the Turkish coast. Regional relations, energy and business ties, Turkey's stalled bid to join the European Union and longstanding disputes such as Turkey's territorial claims in the Greek Aegean will also be discussed.\nOne of the current thorny issues to be raised will be the case of eight Turkish servicemen who have requested asylum in Greece following last year's failed coup in Turkey. Ankara has demanded their extradition, a request rejected by Greek courts on the grounds they could not be guaranteed a fair trial in Turkey.\nThe move infuriated Erdogan, who said in his Wednesday interview that his country's judicial system is \"the best in Europe.\" He said Tsipras had promised to return the servicemen in \"15 to 20 days\" after they flew to Greece in a military helicopter.\n\"That is what he said. But unfortunately right now they are still in Greece,\" Erdogan said, adding that the servicemen should have been handed over before Greek courts became involved.\n\"If you leave it up to the judiciary there will be no result,\" he said. \"In order to facilitate the work of the judiciary you must first, as the government, take the necessary measures before you assign it to the judiciary.\"\nA worker cleans the red carpet as Greek Presidential Guards march to their positions for the official welcome ceremony for Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in Athens, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017. Erdogan is in Greece on a two-day official visit. (AP Photo/Thanassis Stavrakis) Erdogan's visit comes as his country finds itself increasingly isolated on the international stage, and his comments will be closely watched for signs he might try to improve some of Turkey's international relations, particularly with the EU.\nTurkey's ties with the EU, and with several European countries, deteriorated significantly following Erdogan's post-coup crackdown. Tens of thousands of Turks have been fired from their jobs, and tens of thousands more have been imprisoned on accusations of being linked, however tenuously, with Fethullah Gulen, the U.S.-based Islamic cleric that Erdogan blames for masterminding the coup.\nOther than Greece, Poland is the only other EU country to have invited Erdogan to visit since mid-2016.\nHistorical tensions between Greece and Turkey, which have brought the two countries to the brink of war on three occasions since the 1970s, remain.

The Catalan company, the first to install a new construction house in Spain financed entirely by crowdfunding - just a year ago - has acquired an office near the Camp Nou and the Real Club de Polo de Barcelona. With its ninth operation, Inveslar has achieved its own record of participants. A total of 144 people have made financial contributions to finance the purchase of the property for a total value of \u20ac152,100. With contributions from \u20ac100, each of the 144 people becomes part of an SL, owner of the property, not mortgaged. For each euro contributed, users receive a social participation. The apartment, which has been renovated, consists of 55 square meters, two bedrooms, and a bathroom. The estimated annual profitability of the property is 10.45%. Pioneers in Spain Inveslar started its activity in 2016. Last summer the company installed in l'Escala (Girona), the first new construction house in Spain fully financed by real estate crowdfunding. The participating investors (a total of 19) achieved a return of 12.56% in less than six months, time in which the property was sold. Since then, Inveslar has closed another eight operations: 2 houses in Girona and 6 floors in Barcelona, with investments from \u20ac117,000 to 261,000, and with minimum yields of 7.28%. Some of its operations have exceeded 20% profitability. Proptech, the technological industry applied to the real estate sector Inveslar selects properties that, after a deep and detailed analysis, are considered a strategic investment. Quality assets which enjoy added value and offer an interesting return. Once the project, costs, and future returns have been analyzed, the project is published on inveslar.com, offering the opportunity to participate in the investment based on a minimum contribution, which varies depending on the project (starting at \u20ac100). For each project, Inveslar creates a limited liability company (SL). Once 100% of the capital has been obtained to carry out the operation, a capital increase of this company is made, and each investor receives a social participation for each euro that he invests. In this way, the guarantees for the user increase, since he owns the part of social shares that corresponds to him based on his investment. Thus, users are partners with each other, as in any conventional limited society. And it is this society that buys and commercializes the real estate asset. When the financing and acquisition process is completed, which is done 100% online through Inveslar's technological platform, the asset is put to rent, and the dividends it generates are distributed monthly among the investors. If the sale price previously stipulated in the business plan published on the Inveslar website is reached, the property is sold, and investors recover their investment plus the capital gains obtained on the sale. The company formed to carry out this operation is liquidated and dissolved. The whole process, for the investor, is done without leaving the Internet, without banks, and without bureaucratic procedures. A new concept of savings (and a new saver profile) Carles Serradell, a founding partner of Inveslar, points to the fact that he is \"democratizing the sector\" as the main key to the success of real estate crowdfunding. For Serradell, \"real estate assets represent the safest type of investment; they are long-term savings operations.\" Inveslar, which has achieved 100% financing in 9 operations, is already running the tenth: a flat in Barcelona -Sagrada Fam\u00edlia zone- worth \u20ac 349,000.00, which provides a 9.69% annual return. Carles Serradell points out that the sector has passed \"from the speculator to the millennial; The urban savers who bet on the collaborative economy are young people, mostly from Barcelona, under 40 years of age and who already have their homes. But what may best define them as a collective is that they are people who have lost confidence in banks to manage their savings.\" Inveslar has more than 2,000 registered users. Nearly 60% have diversified their savings by participating in at least two of the projects financed through real estate crowdfunding. The company proposes a type of microinvestment that the user can carry out completely online with all the legal and corporate guarantees. \"The fact that the entire process is online provides convenience when carrying out operations and the tranquility of being able to compare the investment with other financial products. We have turned real estate investment into a savings product. And, unlike other financial products, this type of operation is simple, understandable and each person decides where they want to invest their money,\" Serradell points out.

Takaokaya Shizuoka Houji-Cha   - A repeat favorite, I can't believe I haven't had this since last year. It is an absolutely delicious and perfect iteration of well-made hoji tea. It has a nice caramel-like nutty toasty flavor while being really smooth and not overpowering. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes roasty flavors in their tea.  \n2.  Clinique Clinique Smart Night Custom-Repair Moisturizer   - In my original review of this I said that it feels like a wonderful moisture boost that wraps your skin in a cuddly blanket of moisture and that was not an exaggeration; the texture of this is absolutely sublime, it melts into the skin but gives tons and tons of moisture without feeling heavy. So good!\n\n3.  Clinique Turnaround Daytime Revitalizing Moisturizer in Rosy Glow   - Another moisturizer with a wonderful texture. It's super lightweight yet it feels really hydrating and refreshing when applied. I also love the subtle pink glow in this, my skin definitely looks fresher and brighter when I use this. \n4.  Nature Republic Real Squeeze Aloe Vera Emulsion   - A really beautiful very lightweight serum-y product. This adds a nice moisture boost to my skin which I really appreciate but because it's so lightweight I think it would be a great standalone moisturizer for anyone with oilier skin.\n\n5.  Juju Aquamoist Hyaluronic Acid Moisture Washing Foam   - Where has this cleanser been all my life?!? I remember reading an article a while back (like several years ago) where someone was talking about how you shouldn't invest in a special cleanser because it's all going down the sink and I completely disagree. There are cleansers that, although they spend a very brief amount of time on your skin compared to things like serums or moisturizers can be stripping or irritating. This is fairly inexpensive (I paid just about $13 for it) but leaves my skin feeling INCREDIBLE. It's mega hydrating and super foamy, it cleanses the skin really well but doesn't leave it feeling stripped, my skin feels like a baby's behind when I use this. 10/10 would buy again. You also don't need a lot at all for this to create crazy amounts of soft cuddly lather.\n\n6.  Anime/Shows :\nInuyashiki  -  I can't believe I failed to mention this last month! I don't want to spoil this anime for anyone by talking too much about its characters as explaining what's going on essentially spoils the plot but I love it! If you go into this anime thinking all anime is cute colorful characters and full of kawaii magic this isn't the anime for you. That said, it's very well written and psychologically griping. I'm very excited to see how its story unfolds.\nShokugeki no Soma aka Food Wars  - MAJOR PLOT TWIST ALERT; if anyone has been following this anime I feel like it was essentially some kind of honorific or the original Japanese Iron Chef meets foodgasm in the literal sense and it was kind of funny and lighthearted. This season is something else; it still has the charm of the cast of characters you know and love but there is such a plot twist going on and I will not talk about it. :P\nThe Last Kingdom  - It's really awkward when my mom is the person that recommended both this and Game of Thrones to me given the amount of  intimate scenes in both. That said, if you're a fan of Game of Thrones and don't mind there being no fantasy element here but you like the twisting plots, beautiful scenery, and historical fiction then this might fill a little bit of the gap in your heart waiting until 2019 for the next season.

In the study, 96 endophytic bacteria isolated from rhizome of ginger ( Zingiber officinale ) were screened for phosphate solubilisation, 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase activity, nitrogen fixation, ammonia and IAA production. Among these, sixteen endophytes with multiple plant growth-promoting activities were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing and all of them showed growth enhancement in Vigna unguiculata var Lola which make the study remarkably significant. The result was a clear indication of consistent, reliable and broad spectrum plant probiotic features of all the selected isolates. However, strain-specific effects on soil parameters represent the unique and distinguishable role of each of the selected isolates in the chemobiology of ginger rhizome.

U.S. health of...   \nBy LAURAN NEERGAARDAP Medical Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. \nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening. \n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens. \n___ \nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

If passed as drafted, the legislation will hurt Philippine competitiveness at a time when other countries in ASEAN are stepping up their competitiveness for foreign direct investment,\u201d they said.\n\u201cThus, this discriminatory SSB tax provision sends the wrong message at exactly the wrong moment. If passed, the law will draw complaints in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and have a substantial chilling effect on foreign direct investment (FDI),\u201d they added.\nThey echoed the sentiments of local business groups that opposed the SSB tax because of its impact on consumers, as well as the possible backlash on jobs, consumer choice, and investments.\nHB 5636 wants to slap P10 per liter for SSBs using local sugar and P20 for those using imported sugar. This, experts said, would violate a rule in the World Trade Organization that prevents taxing imported products at higher rates to favor domestic ones.\nOn the other hand, Senate Bill No. 1592 exempts some beverages, including all forms of milk and some forms of coffee (particularly ground and 3-in-1) because of their nutritional value and patronage among the masses, respectively.\nFurthermore, the Senate bill lowers the rate to P4.50 per liter for beverages using caloric and non-caloric sweeteners, and imposed a tax of P9 per liter for beverages using high fructose corn syrup. The bill did not distinguish local sugar from its imported counterpart.

Asked for comment, a representative of the company has not clarified on this as of press time. ADVERTISEMENT\nNevertheless, after the P850 million expansion of its Bacolod bottling facility, KOF PH said the resulting increase in the plant\u2019s production output \u201chas ensured a corresponding increase of the sugar that the company purchases directly from the local industry.\u201d\n\u201cDemonstrating its commitment to contribute to the growth and robustness of homegrown industries, Coca-Cola FEMSA Philippines (KOF) will be buying more locally-sourced sugar to use in its products,\u201d the company said.\nHow its sales would be affected is yet to be seen, especially given that both chambers of Congress are still ironing out their different SSB tax provisions indicated in the respective versions of the first tax reform package under the Duterte administration.\nIn late August, Juan Lorenzo Ta\u00f1ada, company director for legal and corporate affairs, said they may have to \u201crevisit\u201d its plan to invest an additional $1 billion in the country up to 2022, since the proposed SSB tax is expected to hurt consumer demand.\nHouse Bill No. 5636 wants to slap P10 per liter for SSBs using local sugar and P20 for those using imported sugar, the latter becoming a cause of concern since it would violate a rule in the World Trade Organization.\nIn this case, Coca-cola products would be slapped with the P10-per liter tax given that it uses local sugar for its production.\nOn the other hand, Senate Bill No. 1592 lowers the rate to P4.50 per liter for beverages using caloric and non-caloric sweeteners, and imposed a tax of P9 per liter for beverages using high fructose corn syrup.

set to buy over one-third stake in BigBasket for close to $300 mn Alibaba's move comes as the online grocery segment in the country has hotted up, with Amazon India seeing 150% growth in its grocery segment during 2016   13:43   \nhttp://mybs.in/2Ub5Rss An employee weighs tomatoes after packing at a Big Basket warehouse on the outskirts of Mumbai. Photo: Reuters ALSO READ Paytm merges start-ups Nearbuy, Little Internet Paytm Mall likely to invest $200 mn in Bigbasket in October Microsoft sees Alibaba as third rival in Indian cloud market Flipkart looking to 'Chinese' model of e-commerce growth via acquisitions Future Supply Chain IPO opens today: Here's what brokerages recommend Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba could soon announce a $300-million deal for purchasing over one-third stake in online grocer BigBasket, after close to six months of negotiations. Citing three unnamed sources with direct knowledge of the deal, the Economic Times reported on Thursday that Alibaba would soon add BigBasket stake purchase to its portfolio of strategic investments in India. \"The deal is expected to be announced soon. The final contours of the secondary transaction are still being chalked out,\" one of the aforementioned sources told the financial daily. As reported earlier, Alibaba-backed online retailer Paytm Mall, too, is likely to invest in BigBasket as part of the deal. Its participation would, however, depend on the deal's final structure. The Bengaluru-based online grocery platform, for its part, is expected to have a post-money valuation of about $850 million if the deal goes through. If the deal is successfully closed, Alibaba and Paytm Mall, together, are likely to own between 35 per cent and 40 per cent stake in BigBasket, the report said. Further, according to the financial daily, the transaction would likely comprise a primary investment of close to $220 million and an amount of $80 million that would be used to buy the existing investors' shares. Entrepreneur K Ganesh and Meena Ganesh's GrowthStory, along with investment firms Ascent Capital, Zodius Capital, and Helion Venture Partners, are expected to make a partial exist as part of the deal, the report said while citing sources. Further, BigBasket co-founders Hari Menon, Vipul Parekh, Abhinay Chaudhary, and VS Sudhakar are also expected to sell part of their shares in the company, the report added. The deal has been in the news for some time now. As reported in November this year, the Chinese e-commerce major had sought the approval of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) for acquiring a stake in BigBasket. \"The proposed combination relates to the acquisition and purchase of shares of Supermarket Grocery Supplies (SGS - the entity that runs BigBasket) by Alibaba Singapore,\" a CCI notice said. The notice, however, did not spell out the details of the proposed investment, including the quantum of stake and the financial value of the deal. Earlier this year, there were reports citing sources that Alibaba, along with Paytm Mall, were in discussions with BigBasket to pick up a minority stake for about $200 million. Investing in BigBasket would help Alibaba add more muscle to take on US-based rival Amazon, while for Paytm, the move would further strengthen its play in the Indian e-commerce space. BigBasket has operations in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi-NCR, Ahmedabad, Patna, Kolkata, Jaipur, Vijayawada, Indore, Punjab, and Lucknow. Further, the company has raised over $200 million from investors, including Abraaj Group, Bessemer Venture Partners, Growthstory, Helion Venture Partners, IFC, and Sands Capital. Alibaba's move comes as the online grocery segment in the country has hotted up. As reported in May this year, online marketplace major Amazon India saw a 150 per cent growth during 2016 in its grocery segment, on the back of repeat customers and Prime membership. Groceries and entertainment are the two key segments for Amazon, which it believes are helping it to make e-commerce a habit among its customers in India and score over Flipkart. Amazon has been working hard on making its FMCG and groceries category strong. \"We have added 1.9 million products into the category and have the largest selection in India,\" Saurabh Srivastava, director, category management, Amazon India had told Business Standard back then. To bolster its grocery segment, the company has been selling it in four different formats: Amazon Pantry, which is their grocery vertical; Amazon Now, the company's two-hour delivery service; Subscribe and Save, where customers can get items delivered periodically; and Super Value Day. As of May this year, Flipkart, which earlier tried to sell groceries but failed to make much headway, is again refocusing on the segment after its last funding round. Sources said the renewed push is being made at the behest of investors who have seen Amazon make major headway in the category. The Chinese interent giant is also focusing on the groceries segment in its own country . As reported in November this year, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd said it would invest HK$22.4 billion ($2.87 billion) for a major stake in China's top hypermart operator, Sun Art Retail Group Ltd, as part of a wider push into offline retail. As part of an alliance with Auchan Retail SA and Ruentex Group, Alibaba would buy the stake from Ruentex while Auchan Retail would boost its stake, the three companies said in a joint statement.   13:43 IST", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "meena ganesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abhinay chaudhary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hari menon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vipul parekh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alibaba singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vijayawada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sudhakar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bigbasket", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "k ganesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saurabh srivastava", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bigbasket", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alibaba", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "business standard alibaba", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alibaba group holding ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ifc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "economic times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ascent capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sun art retail group ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auchan retail sa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "competition commission of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "business standard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon now", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helion venture partners", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abraaj group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sands capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zodius capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruentex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruentex group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auchan retail", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "future supply chain ipo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bessemer venture partners", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sgs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ahmedabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucknow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "growthstory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bengaluru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kolkata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "punjab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyderabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bigbasket", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chennai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaipur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paytm mall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pune", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:33.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "56fa525af4297c9b08696a330fca9b2ca8b3fd9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2BZJIr0xmh7Muj7_1nnrvbD1EIejEUTfyBWis2aN0J_oD_nC5yYl81f77Ry.mb6ahFzoPAuZ7aai8tL6eDpiG9vHT.Z9xigc.EzMRPGuBu.YmK4AuJ8wwwJw2Apx8VFEnamCizIFxQA--", "site_full": "www.flipkart.com", "site": "flipkart.com", "site_section": "https://www.flipkart.com/mens-clothing/ethnic-wear/sets/pathani-suit-set~type/pr?sid=2oq,s9b,3a0,6b6&otracker=categorytree&p[]=sort=recency_desc", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Flipkart.com | Buy Pathani Suit Set Sets Online at Best Prices In India", "title": "Vastramay Kurta Pyjama Vastramay Kurta Pyjama", "title_full": "Reviews Vastramay Men S Kurta Pyjama Set - Latest Review of Vastramay Men S Kurta Pyjama Set, India | Flipkart.com", "published": "2017-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.967, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 103, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6cbc269b47fc7a055b45e225f0f210ce446250b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2BZJIr0xmh7Muj7_1nnrvbD1EIejEUTfyBWis2aN0J_oD_nC5yYl81f77Ry.mb6ahFzoPAuZ7aai8tL6eDpiG9vHT.Z9xigc.EzMRPGuBu.YmK4AuJ8wwwJw2Apx8VFE1KTWmaHRxY4NgrrtCvTCsBKAyq2etR44zdGglwy3R3Kdel8RV.48yOnPUdWez.mA-", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "Gautam Das", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "It's really looks as I seen while ordering!

Kamalomyces bambusicola and K. thailandicus spp. nov. are typical of the genus Kamalomyces (Tubeufiaceae, Tubeufiales) and are morphologically distinct from known species with respect to their size of ascomata, asci and ascospores, ascospore septation and peridium structure, including the subiculum comprising hyphae on the host surface. Morphological examination reveals that the asexual morph of K. bambusicola is associated with its sexual morph in a subiculum forming dictyochlamydosporous conidia, which are similar to the asexual morph of Chlamydotubeufia . Phylogenetic analyses of combined LSU, ITS and TEF1-\u03b1 sequence data also support these two species as distinct and confirm their phylogenetic affinities within the Tubeufiaceae. In particular, Kamalomyces shares a close phylogenetic relationship to Helicoma .\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2jmoFzk", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "kamalomyces", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lsu", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "helicoma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thailand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tubeufiales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chlamydotubeufia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:33.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cbb18637b8a6572461f30754ca72fcc97717e967", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pW1expy2hbMqU__C3Eobks4jZKWt67dmH", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/r/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/r/ -
