ADVFN said that from today it was able to offer all its customers and members a PlusOneCoin wallet. PlusOneCoin is designed as a social media cryptocurrency which will allow social media users to interact and \"up vote\" content of other social media. The addition of the PlusOneCoin wallet to the ADVFN platform allows customers to deposit PlusOneCoin at ADVFN from the relevant blockchain. Customers will then, in due course, be able to exchange PlusOneCoin for social media items and products on the ADVFN site using PlusOneCoin wallet. Chief executive Clem Chambers said: 'PlusOneCoin has been quickly accepted by the ADVFN community during testing. With the integration of a PlusOneCoin wallet we now have a platform to roll out new functionality and products to the user base while giving ourselves, content creators and our users, powerful tools and new channels of monitisation.'

EU tells Britain it must come up with a solution to the Irish border in 48 hours. May to hold talks with Irish government and DUP in an attempt to achieve \"sufficient progress.\"\nLONDON \u2014 Michel Barnier has informed EU member states that Britain has just 48 hours to agree on a potential deal on the first phase of Brexit talks for talks to move onto trade and transition before 2018.\nThe EU's chief Brexit negotiator has told European ambassadors that the UK government is trying to come up with a proposal on the Irish border that will satisfy both the DUP and the Irish government, the Guardian reports .\nA last-minute meeting between representatives of the EU27 has been scheduled for Friday in case Theresa May is able to get both the DUP and Irish government on side with her plans.\nBoth parties have said that the prime minister must make key changes to what she is proposing on the Irish border before they can give their approval to a deal on the first phase of negotiations.\nIrish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said yesterday that he expects May to offer him a new deal on the Irish border today.\n\"Having consulted with people in London, [May] wants to come back to us with text tonight and tomorrow. And I expect to move forward as well \u2014 I want us to move forward if it\u2019s possible next week,\" he said.\nIf Britain is unable to produce a potential agreement by Friday, then the EU will rule that \"insufficient progress\" has been made on the issues of citizens' rights, Britain's financial settlement, and the Irish border.\nThis would mean talks on future trade arrangements and any transition deal could not begin until 2018, something the UK government is determined to avoid given the increased uncertainty it would mean for British business.\nA CBI survey conducted in last month found that 60% of firms based in Britain will trigger Brexit contingency plans in March if a transition deal isn't agreed. These plans would include moving staff abroad and slowing recruitment.\nThe EU has hinted that it might be prepared to hold an emergency summit in January or February of next year in order to speed up negotiations. However, this is not a chance the British side will want to take.\nThe Irish border issue turned from a headache into a crisis for May this past week after DUP leader Arlene Foster blocked the UK government's proposal for \"regulatory alignment\" between Northern Ireland and the EU after Brexit.\nIn practice, this would have major implications for Northern Ireland, as it would require it to stay as close as possible to EU rules in order to maintain seamless, free movement of goods and people across the border.\nThe DUP is adamant that it will not accept any deal that ties Northern Ireland to EU regulations and subsequently creates new trade barriers between Belfast and the rest of the UK.\nThe Republic insists that keeping the UK in the single market and customs union is the best way to avoid the return of a hard border. However, the UK government has pledged to remove Britain from both organisations.\nNOW WATCH: Everything we know about Trump's unhealthy diet More: Theresa May Michel Barnier Brexit", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&impl=s&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fthe-eu-has-given-theresa-may-48-hours-to-save-her-brexit-deal-2017-12&correlator=TIME_STAMP&cust_params=vp_abl%3D1%26tag%3DTheresa-May%2CMichel-Barnier%2CBrexit%26authors%3DAdam-Payne%26mpt%3DJWPlayer&cmsid=642&vpos=preroll&vid=1A0PrS3d&pagetype=post&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fthe-eu-has-given-theresa-may-48-hours-to-save-her-brexit-deal-2017", "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/06/uk-has-48-hours-to-agree-potential-deal-or-brexit-talks-cannot-progress?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=0da7e11ba4-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_12_07&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-0da7e11ba4-190049901"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reuters/hannah mckay theresa may", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "arlene foster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taoiseach leo varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michel barnier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may michel barnier brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dup", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belfast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:58.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5be8eabc94c0dd0060c7d2a27d58803ddd2f6e80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2HT48I_PlzDc", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/co/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/co/ - Comics &amp; Cartoons - 4chan", "title": "/swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics", "title_full": "/co/ - /swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics & Cartoons - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T05:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 493, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "07729a665dfdae1846cb72d0d3b86f8654401719", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2O8Y28vcGd_1NIxbULIpiS4-", "ord_in_thread": 442, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>97324846\nJust had Maul, Vader, and Kylo Ren camp the door outside a spawn point where there's stairs.

We look forward to welcoming Malaysian students and students of all nationalities from the region as well as the Canadian University\u2019s faculty members and researchers.\" \nScheduled to open September 2018, enrollment should begin with two of its Bachelor programs in Business Administration, with other programs slated to be introduced in the near future.

It also portrays successful employment stories and models. \nCDA\u2019s Director General His Excellency Ahmed Julfar said: \u201cThe list of influential and renowned scientists, researchers and academics that have come forward to take part in the first-ever International Conference on Inclusive Employment and Occupational Learning reflects the global momentum building up to empower people of determination to play their role in society. Dubai has proven to be a trailblazer in this regard with the ambitious Dubai Strategy for People of Determination 2020, launched by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crowne Prince of Dubai. \n\u201cThe conference will set out to develop the necessary strategies to promote the role of rehabilitation and training for this high-potential segment of society,\u201d H.E. Julfar explained, adding: \u201cIt identifies the challenges associated with achieving an inclusive working environment for people of determination, all the while outlining the Community Development Authority\u2019s leading role in awareness and advocacy on right of people of determination to work and participate actively in the economic development of the UAE\u201d \nMeanwhile, Dr Hisham Al Saghbini, Group CEO at Qualifications House UK, will deliver a keynote speech at the session titled \u201cProspects of Employment Inclusion in the UAE\u201d. Specialising in quantitative and qualitative research in education, Dr Al Saghbini brings more than 15 years of international experience in the sector, where he Created the WPPD \u2013 Work Passport for People with Determination. \nCommenting on the launch of the inaugural ICIEOL 2017, Dr Al Saghbini noted: \u201cThe conference offers the ideal platform for experts to come together and identify the biggest challenges surrounding vocational training and rehabilitation for people of determination, as well as to plan for a prosperous and inclusive future for the employment market. Furthermore, the research papers that will be presented and discussed at length here at the event will be published through the international digital library EBSCO.\u201d \nMoreover, Dr Naji Al Mahdi, Chief of Qualifications and Awards in Dubai at the Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA), will join a panel discussing the \u201cTransition from Inclusive Education to Inclusive Employment\u201d, along with CDA\u2019s Social Inclusion Specialist Dr Hussain Ali Maseeh. \nDr Muna Al Hamadi, Professor at Zayed University who has also worked as a Disability Social Care Specialist at CDA will address \u201cChallenges to Inclusive Employment\u201d in a panel discussion at the conference, while Dr David Holliman, Global CEO of UK-based Specialist Education Consultants Global (SECGLO), explores in his session the \u201cChallenges for People of Determination in the UAE\u201d. SECGLO offers a wide variety of courses, corporate training and consultancy services to educational institutions in both the private and public sectors. \nOn a similar note, Harry Bundered, Director of the Institute of Training and Occupational Learning (IOTL), is set to lead a discussion in a panel titled \u201cOccupational Learning Model for People with Determination\u201d. Bundered specialises in occupational learning and how to empower people from different groups in the workplace. \nThe International Conference on Inclusive Employment and Occupational Learning 2017 is the first-of-its-kind in the region. It consolidates efforts of human capital development in the UAE, chiefly related to the people of determination, by promoting the role of scientific research and employing its outputs to increase inclusive employment. \nThe initiatives emanating from the conference will spring to action the strategies needed to sustain human resource development by capitalising on academic research and practical experience in the process of inclusive employment, and activating the role of smart technology in planning, implementing and evaluating its processes.", "highlightText": "",

Before decking it out in baubles and lights, here are a few ways to help keep a cut tree looking good for longer this holiday season. \nLet it breathe \nOnce you\u2019ve bought your tree, remove the net that bundles up its branches as soon as possible. The branches need to spread out and settle into place. This will also help prevent the tree from overheating. \nEase it in \nTry not to expose the tree to quick changes in temperature. Get it used to indoor warmth progressively by standing it in a cool room on on a balcony for 24-48 hours. \nGive it a drink \nIt is recommended to saw a little bit off the base of the tree and stand it in water for a few hours. \nKeep away from heat sources \nA tree next to an open fire is a beautiful sight, but it\u2019s not so good for the tree. Any source of heat \u2014 like a radiator, an open fire, a bright light, a TV or a sunny window \u2014 will dry out the tree, causing it to lose its color and its needles. \nStay sheltered \nA tree won\u2019t appreciate being in a drafty place or somewhere where there\u2019s a lot of coming and going. Drafts will dry out the tree and people brushing past will make it lose its needles. \nSpritz before decorating \nIt is advisable to spray the tree with water at room temperature before decorating. \nKeep it quenched \nKeep the foot of the tree moist in a bucket filled with sand or by pouring a cup of water onto the base. \nNo artificial snow \nGo easy or pass completely on fake snow, like snow spray, which tends to dry out tree branches.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:01.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4cf092488151bed9f85112cb1dfab0bc679ac45f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJ_VMWg0d80JRCjBwQlIyTUb0IwqfhH3hVa_1yQETAaeaRMEwURiRuHhgMxl5mMibHXjjTqo6VBgvA7EuPb9WHFpxYLt.utusYDGx827xd.4mGbxhdMLPpdpi3wHeAtKuBPZe5NfgXqWStdXBoS9Eh6z0eFmp57xVl", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Appliances-Refrigerators-Bottom-Freezer-Refrigerators/N-5yc1vZc3p6/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "Whirlpool 30 in.

The CMA said: 'Heat networks - systems that heat multiple homes from one central source - currently supply about half a million UK homes through about 17,000 networks. 'They can also be more environmentally friendly than some other sources of heat, delivering lower carbon emissions and resulting in cost benefits to households. 'As a result, heat networks form an important part of Government strategy to reduce carbon and cut heating bills. 'The number of customers using heat networks is expected to grow significantly to around 20% of all households by 2030.'
