With the acquisition, the 71st annual Newport to Ensenada International Yacht Race will offer three courses for sailors to race on April 27, 2018. The primary N2E course to Ensenada and the Border Run course to San Diego are unchanged. \nThe third course, offered to attract high school and collegiate participants sailing Beach Cats, CFJ\u2019s, 420\u2019s, Moths, 29ers and Lasers, will run to Dana Point. \nNOSA officials said the acquisition and addition will bring back racers who have not participated in recent years, provide an opportunity to expose the next generation of sailors to the fun and challenge of a large race, and potentially help grow the future of the sailboat racing. \nLongtime friends and racing enthusiasts Daniel Hodge, NOSA\u2019s commodore, and Border Run proprietor Randy Reynolds, began talking this summer in hopes of resolving a potential date conflict. With NOSA\u2019s acquisition, both men believe they\u2019ve helped resolve a larger issue: overall participation. \n\u201cThe coming together of participants, all starting on the same day, provides an exceptional opportunity for racers to be a part of something big, not only being a part of the race\u2019s history, but to experience the unparalleled excitement of starting a race with 500 other boats,\u201d said Hodge. \nNOSA\u2019s board approved the motion at its November meeting. \n\u201cIt\u2019s really for the good of the sport; it\u2019s all about how to get boats out on the water, to make it the biggest event on the West Coast \u2013 like it used to be,\u201d said Reynolds. \u201cBoating has changed a lot in the last 10 years, people are busier than ever. Some people will always want to go to Ensenada while others prefer the simplicity to stay in U.S. waters.\u201d \nHodge echoed the sentiment. \u201cThis is an excellent option for racers who want to sail N2E but are less confident when it comes to the logistics of sailing to Ensenada then returning home.\u201d \nBoth men report that initial feedback has been great. \u201cRandy and I are passionate sailors first,\u201d said Hodge. \u201cWe were able to complete the acquisition because as sailors, we have a shared aspiration of creating energy that motivates others to get out on the water.\u201d \nReynolds, who is primarily a boat designer, builder and sailor, has run the Border Run with his longtime partner Bob Long, for almost 10 years. For many reasons, his race, like many others, has seen a decline in participation. \nWhen the option came from NOSA to bring the two powerhouses together, it made sense. Reynolds said, \u201cWith the two races joining forces we have a better chance of bringing back the glory days of 400+ boats racing down the coast to the border.\u201d \nAlthough Reynolds will stay involved as an outside advisor, he is planning to be on the course this April.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "newpo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "randy reynolds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hodge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dana point", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob long", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "randy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reynolds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel hodge", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nosa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ensenada international yacht race", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cfj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ocean sailing association", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "newport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ensenada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newport beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san diego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beach cats", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:10:31.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f372442c6d704fcb6d713bf86b351800f08de89b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8COxp2O3oROtGxek_wqLDnIvQ11lH9SeN.G3HlDpDDs.OKNjXH1go8Mg5a.08dz2Po26FmPFtnZzqiHCy417uY8emVN8oug.Q-", "site_full": "weku.fm", "site": "weku.fm", "site_section": "http://weku.fm/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "House Passes Bill To Allow 'Concealed Carry' Across State Lines", "title_full": "House Passes Bill To Allow 'Concealed Carry' Across State Lines", "published": "2017-12-07T09:43:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "FM", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201712/569026607.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f372442c6d704fcb6d713bf86b351800f08de89b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8COxp2O3oROtGxek_wqLDnIvQ11lH9SeN.G3HlDpDDs.OKNjXH1go8Mg5a.08dz2Po26FmPFtnZzqiHCy417uY8emVN8oug.Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Neuman", "published": "2017-12-07T09:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "House Passes Bill To Allow 'Concealed Carry' Across State Lines", "text": "By Scott Neuman \u2022 10 hours ago House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., speaks after House Republicans held a closed-door strategy session on Capitol Hill in Washington. The Republican-led House passed a bill to make it easier for gun owners to legally carry concealed weapons across state lines. J. Scott Applewhite / AP \nThe House approved a bill on Wednesday that would ease legal restrictions for carrying concealed firearms across state lines \u2013 a move pushed by the National Rifle Association that comes just weeks after mass shootings in Las Vegas and Texas. \nOn a mostly party-line vote, the measure easily passed, 231-198, although 14 Republicans voted no. Six Democrats voted for the so-called reciprocity measure, which would allow a gun owner with the proper permit in any state to carry a concealed firearm to another state where it is also legal. \nThe bill now goes to the Senate, where it is likely to encounter a much tougher battle. \nIn the House version, GOP lawmakers added a measure aimed at strengthening tracking in the national background-check database of legal and mental health records that might prevent some gun purchases. Just last month it was revealed that Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman who killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., legally purchase firearms used in the attack despite a record of domestic assault in the Air Force that should have disqualified him. \nHowever, as The New York Times reports: \"... the background check measure was not enough to win over most Democrats, nor did it persuade law enforcement officials in some of the largest cities, including New York, who say the legislation would force locales with strict gun laws to bow to places with few or no gun restrictions.\" \nThe bill angered many Democrats who argued that following mass shootings that have killed 80 people, the times called for stricter, not looser gun measures. \nConnecticut Democrat Rep. Elizabeth Esty \u2014 who represents Newtown, Conn., where 20 first-graders and six teachers and staff were killed in a 2012 mass shooting \u2013 said the bill would undermine states' rights, \"hamstring law enforcement and allow dangerous criminals to walk around with hidden guns anywhere and at any time. It's unspeakable that this is Congress' response to the worst gun tragedies in American history,\" according to The Associated Press. \nThe NRA's executive director, Chris Cox, is quoted in the Times as saying Thursday's vote is a \"watershed\" for Second Amendment rights and that the bill would ensure \"all law-abiding citizens in our great country can protect themselves in the manner they see fit without accidentally running afoul of the law.\" \nIn the Senate, supporters would likely need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster by Democrats.

unusually I was unable to sleep this morning so was at my pc a little before this horrible time. I attribute my insomnia to devoting more time than I should have yesterday to wading through the copious detail of the crimes committed by the egregious David Davis in his abject and wilful failure to do the job for which he is being paid.\nWhich turned out to be very fortunate for me because it meant that, when I had finished reading \u201cThe Guardian view on the Brexit crisis: time to stop the fanatics\u201d, the first (eminently) sane comment I was presented with was that of \u2018richardbunning\u2019. Normally this piece, I guess written around 05:00, would have been pushed far from my screen (usually opened around 08:00) by subsequent comments. Today I was lucky. The comment read extremely well and chimed closely with my own views, except that I had paused at Brexit as the desired objective of Tory right and have never made the extrapolation to the even more sinister plot of, \u201c\u2026an inner cabal of neoliberal fanatics hell bent on using brexit to completely reshape Britain.\u201d Blimey!\nReading further I was torn between the very persuasiveness of the comment and, I regret to admit, a diffident fear that the writer might have lost the plot just a little. After all, obese twerp Boris leading a coup d'\u00e9tat, assisted by the dopey Fox & bumbling Davis, Come on!\nHowever, apart from the drama of the coup and the charge of treason, the comment was reasoned & convincing, certainly sufficient to justify checking out richardbunning\u2019s other comments. Which I did. And which I warmly commend to others. And I am very impressed and apologise for the doubt I expressed. Which leaves me in the uncomfortable position of believing that richardbunning is a very intelligent & articulate person and so is probably right in his conclusions.\nSo where, Richard (if I may presume & call you that) do we go from here?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:10:31.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "59d58df927ba326f11906f1705d02cc2301e4499", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrrRORleMxMhchsa62jNi555j1rK2EEQGI40o2AvQAgGhX1WGlFIs7O", "site_full": "southafrica.shafaqna.com", "site": "shafaqna.com", "site_section": "http://southafrica.shafaqna.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "South Africa News (News Reader) |", "title": "KZN\u2019s Zethe wins Vodacom NXT Level", "title_full": "KZN\u2019s Zethe wins Vodacom NXT Level", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5727, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "59d58df927ba326f11906f1705d02cc2301e4499", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrrRORleMxMhchsa62jNi555j1rK2EEQGI40o2AvQAgGhX1WGlFIs7O", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "KZN\u2019s Zethe wins Vodacom NXT Level", "text": "KZN\u2019s Zethe wins Vodacom NXT Level Zethembiso Perfect Mdletshe, affectionately known as \u2018Zethe\u2019, is a 24-year-old singer from Ngwelezane in KwaZulu-Natal.

Wochit Dwayne Walker (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO BY BREVARD COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE) CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE A shopper fought back against a felon who attempted to steal her vehicle and steal her purse at Hammock Landing Tuesday night, West Melbourne police said. Dwayne Jermaine Walker, 28, of the 1800 block of Tamworth Street, Palm Bay was charged with carjacking without a firearm, robbery by sudden snatching, battery, resisting an officer without violence, possession of drug paraphernalia and a probation violation. Police said Walker was in front of Kohl's at the shopping center location in the 200 block of Palm Bay Road, when a woman parked outside the store about 7:45 p.m. The woman stepped out and walked to the passenger side of her car when Walker hopped into the driver's seat and acted as if he was trying to start the car, she told police. The keys were not in the ignition. The woman screamed at Walker to get out of the car. He did so, but police said he opened the back door and grabbed her purse. The pair struggled outside the car and Walker shoved her to the ground, the affidavit states. Several people heard and saw the commotion. Walker fled into Kohl's and locked himself in the mens' restroom, police said. Officers, aided by a K-9 police dog, entered the restroom to confront Walker, who was inside a stall. They said Walker tried to flee the dog by scaling the top of the stall, but one of the officers shot Walker with a Taser stun gun. Walker, who has four battery convictions, was taken to the Brevard County Detention Center in Sharpes. He was being held Wednesday without bail. Tuesday's carjacking attempt at Hammock Landing follows Friday's attempted robber at the shopping center. A Dollar Tree clerk rebuffed an man's effort to rob her, police said. The suspect remained at large as of Wednesday. West Melbourne police Capt. Rich Cordeau said they do not suspect Walker in the robbery.

Tauseef Mustafa / AFP/Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 10:34 am \nMonths after a tense standoff between China and India along their Himalayan border, Beijing on Thursday expressed anger over what it says was an Indian drone that crashed inside its territory. \n\"This action by India violated China's territorial sovereignty. We express strong dissatisfaction and opposition,\" Xinhua cited Zhang Shuili, a senior military official in China's western battle zone command, as saying. \nChina said the drone crashed in \"recent days\" but didn't say where. Zhang said his country would defend its national sovereignty against such intrusions. \nHe said China's border defense forces conducted \"an inspection of the device,\" but didn't elaborate. \nIndia has not responded to the charge. \nAlthough the two countries have made moves toward warmer relations in recent years, they also have a long history of border tensions. In 1962, they fought a brief, but inconclusive border conflict. They have also had ongoing disputes over sovereignty in other border areas, notably Aksai Chin, a Himalayan region that straddles their territorial demarcation in the west. \nThe two countries have also long been at odds over India's hosting of Tibet's government-in-exile and their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, considered by China to be subversive because of his calls for Tibetan independence. \nStarting in June this year, tensions flared again over a disputed region called the Doklam Plateau that borders China, Bhutan and the Indian state of Sikkim. \nAs NPR's Julie McCarthy reported from New Delhi in July , the problems stemmed from China's construction of a road in Doklam Plateau. \"Not far from the plateau lies the narrow passage that connects India's northeast states with the rest of the country \u2014 a strategic link called the Siliguri Corridor but more commonly known as the \"Chicken's Neck. \" Any possibility of China being able to sever that \"neck\" unnerves India. \nAs late as August, India had rushed troops to Doklam Plateau and although an immediate conflict was avoided, heated rhetoric on both sides has soured relations. \nIn September, India's army chief said that his country \"could not afford to be complacent and must be prepared for war,\" according to The Hindustan Times. \nAnd in November, China took umbrage at Indian President Ram Nath Kovind's visit to the remote state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China also claims, Reuters reports.

FTSE MIB (Milano Italia Borsa) Index: Driving Italy Economy \nFTSE MIB Index is the equity index of 40 largest, most active and most liquid stocks on Italy\u2019s stock market. And Mediaset S.p.A. works with them as well. The index is market capitalization-weighted and free-floated adjusted. \nFTSE MIB replaced MIB-30 in 2004. The Standard & Poor\u2019s operated the index until June 2009 when it relinquished the administration of the benchmark index to FTSE Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of London Stock Exchange Group, which is also the parent company of Borsa Italiana, the nation stock exchange in Italy. Mediaset S.p.A. prefer to appear at both markets. \nFTSE MIB index hit a record high of 50108.56 points in March 2000.

The index accounts for 80% of the total market cap of Italia Borsa stock exchange. \nFTSE MIB is reshuffled quarterly where components that have fallen short of inclusion requirements are dropped and newly qualified stocks added. But companies must meet certain stringent eligibility requirements before their stocks can be added in the index. \nRebalancing of FTSE MIB is also done to reflect the changes in the market cap of its constituents, which may come as a result of new shares being issued or debt being converted to stock. The stock market \nItalia Borsa is Italy\u2019s main stock of Italian companies and it\u2019s fondly known to as Piazza Affari, referring to its Milan headquarters building called Palazzo Mezzanotte. \nItalia Borsa was established in February 1808. Until 1998 when the exchange was sold to a group of banks, it operated as a public entity from its inception. The exchange was acquired by London Stock Exchange group in an all-stock deal in 2007. Following the acquisition, Italia Borsa was merged with the London Stock Exchange. Other than stocks, Italia Borsa is also a platform for trading other securities such as bonds, including Eurobonds.

Interest building up for Italian stocks \nItalian stocks are heating up lately as investors take notice of the country\u2019s improving growth prospects.

Making it fit on my own is easy enough (as Baldy recommended simply drill the fender), however I am curious as to how the factory did it in case I am missing something simple. I picked up a later rear fender, as well as a rear fender support (06-2169). My bike used a curved plate mounted to the frame to connect to the fender, and I am wondering if there was something similar for the later bikes, or if the fender support (06-2169) was mounted directly to the frame. If the latter, I will do as Baldy mentioned, and drill into the fender rather than have to drill mounting holes in the frame. I have included a picture of the original bracket.\nThanks again,\nErich\n-1970 Norton Commando\n-1974 BMW R90/6\n-1980 Moto Guzzi V50 #713254 - 10/30/17 10:11 pm Re: Mounting a Commando rear fender [ Re: erich ] Joined: Mar 2006\nPosts: 3,472 L.A.B.\nBritBike Forum member L.A.B.\nBritBike Forum member\nJoined: Mar 2006\nPosts: 3,472\nNorfolk, UK Originally Posted by erich I picked up a later rear fender, as well as a rear fender support (06-2169).

Out of interest (whilst your rear mudguard is off) does your rear wheel sit central within the seat loop and in line with the spine tube?\nLast edited by Simon Ratcliff; 10/31/17 7:21 am .

It does look like it's veering slightly to the left though and is offset to the right, do you use a string line to check for front to rear wheel alignment?

Thanks for the reply.\nNot a string line, I had a long straight edge that I used. Unfortunately, I left it back on the East coast when I moved to California this summer, so will have to replace it.\n-1970 Norton Commando\n-1974 BMW R90/6\n-1980 Moto Guzzi V50 #713550 - 11/02/17 7:55 am Re: Mounting a Commando rear fender [ Re: erich ] Joined: Apr 2015\nPosts: 97 Simon Ratcliff\nBritBike Forum member Simon Ratcliff\nBritBike Forum member\nJoined: Apr 2015\nPosts: 97\nWolverhampton, U.K An engineer's straight edge is preferable to a string line. But then again a straight edge, string line or laser are only of any use to get the rear wheel parallel to the frame centre line when you know for sure that the rear (and front) wheel is centred on the frame centre line in the first place and that the wheels are set in the vertical plane too.\nIt looks like your rear wheel could be set closer to parallel to the frame tube and then pull the rim across by adjusting the spokes to get it closer to the frame centre. At least this would improve matters in the vertical plane. Checking the swinging arm axis in the horizontal plane requires a surface table.\nOf course I'm only going off the photos and pointing out a manufacturing error which possibly doesn't bother you. Sorry, I don't mean to be unconstructive, the opposite in fact. All the best.\nLast edited by Simon Ratcliff; 11/02/17 8:00 am .

She lived in Adelaide and he lived in Melbourne, so their relationship developed over the internet. They chatted intensely online for 18 months - always under the watchful eyes of both Carly's mother Sonya, and Brandon's stepfather, Shane. When Brandon couldn't come to her 15th birthday party, Carly was delighted that Shane said he would come instead. Being so far from home, Shane stayed the night but the following morning Sonya was horrified to discover Shane not in the guest room, but in Carly's room, sleeping on top of her bed. She threw him out of the house immediately. After begging and pleading, Sonya allowed Carly to continue chatting to Brandon online, and life continued as normal. Or so it seemed. On 19th February 2007, Carly went to stay the night with friends. When Sonya called Carly the next morning, Carly didn't answer and her mother was instantly worried. She then got a call from a man saying he'd found Carly's purse on the side of the road. Carly's body was discovered at a beach 80km south of Adelaide and the terrifying truth was revealed. Carly had kept a secret from her mother - she wasn't seeing friends. Carly had planned to meet Brandon. What neither Carly nor Sonia knew was that Brandon and Shane didn't exist. They were just two of more than 200 online personas created by 50-year-old Garry Newman.

Of them, Valeant Pharmaceuticals accounts for a leading share in the HPV therapeutics market and Roche AG accounts for a dominant share in the CMV therapeutics market. \nA report by Transparency Market Research forecasts the global human papillomavirus (HPV) therapeutics market to rise at a CAGR of 7.7% during the period between 2014 and 2020 to become worth US$2.34 bn by 2020 from US$1.40 bn in 2012. According to the report, the global cytomegalovirus (CMV) market will rise at a 1.49 % CAGR from 2014 to 2020 to attain a value of US$922.8 mn by 2020 from US$870.1 mn in 2012. \nRead Report overview @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/hpv-cmv-therapeutics-m\u2026 \nFast Developing Healthcare Infrastructure Makes Asia Pacific Attractive Market \nDepending upon the types of drugs, the global human papillomavirus (HPV) therapeutics market can be segmented into the following drug classes \u2013 anti-neoplastic agents, immunomodulators, sinecatechins, and keratolytic agents. Among them, the immunomodulators leads the market with maximum share. In terms of growth rate, however, the sinecatechins segment will surpass all. \nThe cytomegalovirus (CMV) therapeutics market, again, can be divided on the basis of antiviral drugs into foscarnet, ganciclovir/valganciclovir (first line drugs), and cidofovir. Of them, ganciclovir and valganciclovir together contribute a lion\u2019s share in the revenue in the overall CMV therapeutics market. \nGeographically, the key segments of the global human papillomavirus (HPV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) therapeutics market are North America, South America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and the Rest of the World. At present, South America and Asia Pacific are considered the most lucrative markets on account of the fast developing healthcare infrastructure, increasing affluence of the people, cultural shifts, and a booming tourism industry leading to high instances of STDs. \nRising Prevalence of HPV Stoking Demand in Market \nThe alarming rise of human papillomavirus (HPV) in people of both developed and developing nations has been the primary growth driver of the HPV therapeutics market. The lead analyst of the TMR report elaborates, \u201cOver a 100 strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) have been identified so far. Of them, certain types are known to cause warts or papillomas that progress to malignant or benign cancers. HPV infections are common in adolescents and younget adults and is known to affect adolescent females the most. According to Centre for Disease Control (CDC), about 20 million persons were infected in 2012 in the U.S., and an estimated 6.2 million new HPV infections were occurring every year. All these have majorly fuelled the global HPV therapeutics market.\u201d \nRequest Sample Report@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag\u2026 \nThe cytomegalovirus (CMV) therapeutics market, on the other hand, has received a boost from the launch of brincidofovir in 2016. The launch of letermovir in 2018 will also boost the market. \nServing to deal a blow to the growth in the global human papillomavirus (HPV) market is the relatively dry pipeline of drugs and the availability of different substitute treatments such as laser therapy and cryotherapy. \nThis review is based on the findings of a TMR report, titled, \u201cHuman Papillomavirus (HPV) and Cytomegalovirus (CPV) Therapeutics Market (HPV Drug Class \u2013 Immunomodulators, Keratolytic Agents, Anti-neoplastic Agents, and Sinecatechins; HPV Application \u2013 Genital Warts, Genital Cancer, Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis, and Oral Papillomas; CMV Antiviral Drugs \u2013 Ganciclovir/Valganciclovir, Foscarnet, and Cidofovir; CMV Application \u2013 CMV Retinitis, Pneumonia, Gastrointestinal Ulcers, and Encephalitis) \u2013 Global Industry Analysis, Pipeline Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2014 \u2013 2020.\u201d \nAbout TMR \nTransparency Market Research (TMR) is a global market intelligence company providing business information reports and services.

Furthermore, this report helps to understand the current clinical and commercial landscape by considering disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, prognosis, and the treatment options available at each stage of diagnosis, including a clinical comparison of marketed therapies. \nChina has the most newly diagnosed CRC cases in Asia-Pacific (APAC). In 2011, there were 310,200 incident cases in the country and this rose to 376,300 in 2015. CRC is the most common malignancy among Chinese males, with an estimated incidence of 215,700 men and 160,600 women in 2015. Mortality in 2011 stood at 149,700, and in 2015 rose to 191,000 (Chen et al., 2016). In Japan, the incidence and mortality of CRC have substantially increased. In 2012, the incidence of colon and rectum cancer in Japan was 87,800 and 46,800 cases respectively, and mortality was 32,200 and 15,100 cases (NCC, 2016a). CRC is a major cause of death in Japan, where it accounts for the largest number of deaths from malignant neoplasms among women, and the third largest among men (Watanabe et al., 2015). In 2016, there were an estimated 147,200 new CRC cases and 51,600 deaths in the country (NCC, 2016b). In Australia, the five-year survival rate increased from 50% between 1984 and 1988 to 69% between 2009 and 2013. Improvement in survival from CRC may be due to earlier diagnosis and the availability of better treatment options (AGCA, 2017). The incidence of CRC is still several folds lower in India than in most developing and developed countries (Mallath, 2014). However, the country has witnessed a steady increase in numbers in line with its increasing urbanization.
