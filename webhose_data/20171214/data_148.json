Since their beliefs lie mostly on fortune, luck and faith, it excites men and women alike. Today, there are thousands of homes and commercial buildings which are filled with lucky charms and tools which are believed to deliver good luck.\n\nWearing charms and pendants symbolize something depending on the colors or the type of materials used. This is why Chinese zodiac pendants silver gained attention from men and women alike. Every person falls on a certain zodiac which depicts a meaning or explains our behaviors or traits. Wearing a pendant is one thing. Buying one is another. To make sure that you would not end up with a counterfeited item, here are some top tips worth knowing for.\n\nResearch. It goes without saying that research will definitely prove useful on helping you identify counterfeited from real ones. But you need to pay a visit to trustworthy sites and pages to absorb effective information, not the other way around. After all, the very last thing that you desire to take place is to explore websites that give you false information and details, thereby causing confusion and wrong decisions eventually.\n\nWhen the first part does not work, try asking questions from people whom you could trust their words. Some relatives and friends might be able to offer sound advice and opinions which weigh importance on making your decisions. You will only know something when you established communication and start asking important questions to the people who might know something.\n\nFind legit stores, be it locally or through online. Wherever you prefer to do your pendant shopping, keep the legitimacy in mind. Otherwise, you would end paying for a fake item. Its invariably important to assess the trustworthiness of a store prior to make visits and make orders. Find some sources in which people can attest the reliability of a shop to have your peace of mind.\n\nWork and consult with proficient and reliable sellers. Obviously, you deserve a seller who has integrity, solid background and excellent reputation. A lot of us can easily fall and be tricked by sugar coated words without doing an investigation on a person. To prevent frustration and problems, do not make commitments unless you have confirmed the sellers identity and reliability.\n\nWatch out for some promising deals. Its strongly advisable to be leery of some offers that are so affordable and commendable. Bad people often used such strategy to lure buyers to spend investments, especially those who are on a tight budget. Prior to make the final commitment, find out whether the chosen product is something that is worth of your attention or not. Be very meticulous as well.\n\nVisually examine the material. This one is a no brainer. There are many signs which will tell whether the chosen product is a fake one or not. You only have to use your senses and see through everything to land into a pendant which you truly deserved to have.\n\nIn spite of several notices and warnings, always find time to increase your awareness. It makes sense to discover everything. By doing so, scams can be prevented.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nGet a summary of the factors to consider when purchasing jewelry and view our selection of Chinese zodiac pendants silver variety at http://www.redpocketworld.com now. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "debra reynolds", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:40.054+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6ea3b8c802f816b0ff1616bbee8cb782cf3bd361", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB4VSHlHmdheeMzqJvxA6bHCFbSQgJWAz8WgzGNpkq0LYh__BDA1CffHeH0hQr7y0t4-", "site_full": "forums.stevehoffman.tv", "site": "stevehoffman.tv", "site_section": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/forums/music-corner.2/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Music Corner | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "title": "Katy Perry's Signature Song", "title_full": "Katy Perry's Signature Song | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "published": "2017-12-05T17:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/data/avatars/m/0/633.jpg?1497275142", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19660, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4498db40c329f772b92e243665318adec5b2cf7c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB4VSHlHmdheeMzqJvxA6bHCFbSQgJWAz8WgzGNpkq0LYh__BDA1CffH0RHWXh2ymVdYC10ZjE1SIg--", "ord_in_thread": 14, "author": "Oatsdad", "published": "2017-12-05T17:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Bobby Morrow said: \u2191 I suppose she does have a few, but I Kissed A Girl is so brilliantly simple and hooky and brings in all the pervs hoping the video has Katy doing just what the title says.\nRoar would also stand.

The internet is a very powerful tool. It is powerful enough to connect billions of people all over the world. Regardless of their races, religions, and status, everyone could use it.\n\nNow, for the producers and musicians who love to promote their talents, hiring a third party company for your music video might be ideal. They have all the essential resources you will need for the shoot. You can say that these people are very experienced. Speaking of that, think of contacting some commercial firms for your Music Videography Texas . Do not worry. In terms of quality of works and performance, the city can provide you a few of credible candidates. Now, pick which of these candidates highly deserved your attention and trust. Do not give your trust as though they are a cheap commodity. Have some pride. Keep your honor. You know how big this project could be.\n\nAt your end, it is going to be your big break. That is why better not mess things up. More than this, though, as someone who bought and paid the service, it will be unfair on your side to receive a poor quality support. You did not sign the contract just to obtain a junk piece of work. This is the entertainment industry.\n\nYou got endless lines of competitors. Newbies or not, the market does not label you that way. No matter how renown you were, all of it are just in the past now. Your past has nothing to do with it. It is like starting all over again. You better not get tired of this endless loop.\n\nJust like other candidates, though, various measures should be conducted to prevent their debut from going down.

Acquire some references, primarily, about their previous works. Know their current reputation too. You have the internet. Furthermore, you also have the resources. Do not forget your connections too.\n\nIf possible, review various prospects. Consider the terms of the contract too. You need to protect your rights. You are a client, someone who paid the firm for the purpose of creating a wonderful material. It will be pretty unfair on your part to get an unreliable service. Knowing that, perform some relevant assessments.\n\nThat is why stop deciding things immediately. Compare and assess your options. Perform some rational observation. It does not mean that a specific firm has an attractive advertisement or promotion, you are going to choose them immediately. Life does not work that way. Therefore, despite how hectic your schedule could be, stay rational.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nYou can find a list of the advantages you get when you use music videography Texas services at http://www.fbgdv.com/services right now. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joseph richardson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:41.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f6b63174ec608845a5248ea09ff839cfc8466697", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Qb6m4ieU933VNDrmxMoS4tsDeTwaCZQWkJGHTfpKGxkmTm_W9UGLgDn9NHwxbjN_JeLWjz2klE46Y2Iq85PxTxjugjAq.ruJJxavE2FiZVkpm9nhn1G9fRc4bZC9WLF1KaEMc_10AYBtW64AnTWaH", "site_full": "www.deccanchronicle.com", "site": "deccanchronicle.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Here\u2019s how you can make social media a happy place", "title_full": "Here\u2019s how you can make social media a happy place", "published": "2017-12-07T14:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.215, "main_image": "https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images.deccanchronicle.com/dc-Cover-gruraq0mea76gc78mcpm1147h1-20171207135036.Medi.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4381, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5, "comments": 0, "shares": 5}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f6b63174ec608845a5248ea09ff839cfc8466697", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Qb6m4ieU933VNDrmxMoS4tsDeTwaCZQWkJGHTfpKGxkmTm_W9UGLgDn9NHwxbjN_JeLWjz2klE46Y2Iq85PxTxjugjAq.ruJJxavE2FiZVkpm9nhn1G9fRc4bZC9WLF1KaEMc_10AYBtW64AnTWaH", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T14:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "Here\u2019s how you can make social media a happy place", "text": "In social media, you are your own brand, hence, it\u2019s all about expressing yourself in a way where you are letting people know who you are and what you stand for. Social media has become a way of life for most of us. People can post anything on them \u2014 from sweet compliments, adventurous experiences to snarky one-liners. But in all those innocent posts, social media has been held responsible for a lot of negativity to the point that most find it difficult to find ourselves in this chaotic mess. What if you wanted a place to just celebrate and share the small moments of happiness in life? A place where no happy moment is too small and no-kind of negativity are allowed. Orkut Buyukkokten, founder of Orkut and Hello, suggests a few ways that one can adapt to make social media a happy place for everyone.\nFind your passion\nSocial media is like a vast playground where there are many players trying to woo you to join them in their quest through their offerings. The process of experimenting can be overwhelming but let your passion be your guide. Find a platform where you can talk and meet people who share the same passions as you do. In the process, you might end up exploring new opportunities, finding new interests, and even making new friends.\nFeed on the positivity\nTrolls and memes have taken the better of the social media that we consume every day which mostly leads to negativity. Rather than adding fuel to the fire and spreading negativity, we can always choose to focus on content that is positive or stand for a cause that makes the world a better place.\nRelevance\nThere is an amazing amount of content circulating on social media every day. Some you consume and some you don\u2019t but don\u2019t you feel like in the process of ignoring irrelevant content you\u2019re wasting your time or sometimes you miss out on something really interesting just because you first thought it is not of your concern? There are various social media platforms where news feeds have content relevant to you and will help you save time and save you from #FOMO.\nHuman connections\nThe foundation of social media is to bridge time and space, allowing you to connect with people globally as well as in your own neighbourhood. Hence, we must take this platform as a way to form new connections while sustaining the old ones. So if you have not been touch with an old friend for a long time, go ahead and drop him/her a message or just send an old picture of yours. It can lead to a fresh start.\nEducate yourself\nApart from conversations around people\u2019s photos, social media is a colossal mine with exceptional insights. While you are socializing and meeting people from all walks of life, it is also helpful for your own overall development to use social media to sift through content that you find insightful.\nA sense of belonging\nEvery one of us wants to feel a sense of belonging and on social media, it is no exception. Communities and pages on social media are meant to solve the purpose of getting people with similar passions and interests together on one platform. For eg: a community made for tea lovers where people from different walks of life discuss how the tea is made at their respective areas or suggestions of places where you get tea which others have never heard can be interesting and more participative by others who have joined the group.\nBe yourself\nLast but not the least, social media should be the place where you can be yourself. It should be a place to express yourself without the sense of feeling judged. Share a joke which you think is funny, share your experiences that you think your friends would be interested in, let your friends know if you need some kind of help. In social media, you are your own brand, hence, it\u2019s all about expressing yourself in a way where you are letting people know who you are and what you stand for.\nProtect yourself\nWhile you are enjoying everything social media has to offer, you have to make sure that you are protecting yourself. There have been many cases of cyberbullying and plagiarism in the recent past where being cautious on your part is very important. Since it\u2019s your life that you\u2019re sharing and you\u2019re representing yourself please make sure that you always check your privacy settings to ensure your safety in the online space.\nInspire and be inspired\nJust a simple thing as sharing an inspirational Quote: can bring a change of attitude in someone\u2019s life. If nothing else, then just take a day and thank someone for making a difference in your life, however big or small and who knows you might be their reason to smile and lift their spirits.\nSay Hello\nIt starts with hello. We all are social beings but making connections is not easy for everyone. Hence, taking advantage of the online platform where there is no real facetime, you can come across really interesting people just by taking the first step. A simple and friendly gesture like saying hello or sharing something that you love can be the start of something new and beautiful.\nAt the end of the day, it is all about the choices we make. Social media has a plethora of possibilities and opportunities and if we consciously use it, we can really make it a happy place for ourselves and make it a safe haven for others too.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:41.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6ea3b8c802f816b0ff1616bbee8cb782cf3bd361", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB4VSHlHmdheeMzqJvxA6bHCFbSQgJWAz8WgzGNpkq0LYh__BDA1CffHeH0hQr7y0t4-", "site_full": "forums.stevehoffman.tv", "site": "stevehoffman.tv", "site_section": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/forums/music-corner.2/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Music Corner | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "title": "Katy Perry's Signature Song", "title_full": "Katy Perry's Signature Song | Steve Hoffman Music Forums", "published": "2017-12-05T17:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/data/avatars/m/0/633.jpg?1497275142", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19660, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f795069be27091654e0784ab89f78eff7579af37", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxaXysVsz_U0qHyJtYUlzdAvDU8CRmxCB4VSHlHmdheeMzqJvxA6bHCFbSQgJWAz8WgzGNpkq0LYh__BDA1CffHopRTAYH_lIAh_VXJcZdBkg--", "ord_in_thread": 23, "author": "Oatsdad", "published": "2017-12-05T17:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Bobby Morrow said: \u2191 I\u2019m not sure why Chained To The Rhythm is even included.

Mary said: \u201cMy husband had started coming up and it was a good laugh. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit different. My husband has always followed the Rovers and it basically keeps the club running. \n\u201cI came along just to talk about the club and got hooked on it!\u201d \nMary\u2019s husband Peter is cleaning the pitch on a cold winter\u2019s day ahead of the next home game against Arbroath. \nHe started supporting as a child, and has been delighted to see Coatbridge get behind his beloved team. John cleans up the stands and pitch (Image: Airdrie & Coatbridge Advertiser) \nHe said: \u201cOne of the players, Sean Higgins, comes in and helps out with the disability group. \n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see so many different groups of people get behind the club.\u201d \nHe laughs: \u201cIt\u2019s not the best weather but a lot of us are retired \u2013 and this gives us something to do.\u201d \nChairman Ronnie Boyd was full of praise for everyone who helps out, calling them the \u201cbeating heart of the club\u201d. \nHe added: \u201cThe volunteers are invaluable for us. We work on a tight budget as it is, but it shows the love for the club that there is in the community. \n\u201cThe Thursday Club aren\u2019t the only group that helps out, but we all come in and do some minor repairs, empty the bins and do all the not very attractive things that keep the club going. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not the warmest time of the year, but the volunteers always come out and help, they are very loyal.

But Gowther is the one who sacrificed himself in to sealing both clans himself and stopping the holy war. He used so much magic power that he died using it just to stop the holy war. He knew he would die because of it.\nBefore Meliodas\u2019s betrayal all the clans were fighting for themselves for magic power Nanatsu no Taizai 246 Chapter, the two most powerful clans were at the top. Meliodas was the biggest threat to the Goddess Clan and when he left the Goddesses chose to make alliances with the others in order to win. Stated it himself in the flashback. My question is how did the first fairy kings forest end up under liones and Gowther Sr. dead there no one has really theorized about how fkf ended up under liones. The Goddess Clan had four Archangels while the Demon Clan had Zeldris, Estarossa, Derrierie, Monspiet, Merascylla, Gray Lord, Fraudrin, Gloxinia, Dolor, Galan only Karmadios died, and that\u2019s only the Commandments. They had allies like the Vampire Clan too, the Six Black Knights whose strength is unknown, Cusack and Chandler.

Considered a pioneer of modernism, one of the most influential sculptors of the 20th century, Brancusi is called the patriarch of modern sculpture. As a child he displayed an aptitude for carving wooden farm tools. Formal studies took him first to Bucharest, then to Munich, then to the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris from 1905 to 1907. His art emphasizes clean geometrical lines that balance forms inherent in his materials with the symbolic allusions of representational art.

And, mission more or less accomplished, they\u2019ve now fired Lydia McLaughlin. Make of that what you will. \nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that Tamra is headed for a drama-free life. Because it looks like Gretchen Rossi is going to make an epic return to The Real Housewives of Orange County . \nTamra Judge and Gretchen Rossi aren\u2019t exactly what you\u2019d call friends . \nYou might think that, with Gretchen no longer on The Real Housewives of Orange County , the ongoing dislike between the two of them might have cooled off during the past season. \nOut of sight, out of mind, you know? \nInstead, things actually reached a boiling point \u2014 no, they more or less exploded \u2014 between Gretchen and Tamra. \nSee, back in August, Sidney Barney slammed Tamra Judge as a bad mother, accusing neglect and emotional abuse. \nSidney, not an adult, alleged that her estranged mother continued to use her as a storyline despite her repeated requests to not be mentioned, that Tamra misrepresented her relationship with Sidney to gain sympathy from followers, and that Tamra basically just sucks. \nSidney said that a little more eloquently, but you get the idea. \nHow did Gretchen respond to Sidney\u2019s post? \nWith sympathy and support. Gretchen wrote in a publicly visible reply to Sidney\u2019s post: \n\u201cYou have no idea how your brave words are helping so many who have been wronged by your mother\u2019s manipulation and lies as well \u2026\u201c \nWe honestly doubt that this was Sidney\u2019s intention, but Gretchen was clearly making this about her. \n\u201cSo thank you for being brave enough to speak the truth.\u201d \n\u201cI am so sorry your mother and your family is going through any of this, especially publicly, but continue to stay strong.\u201d \n\u201cYour morals and strength are commendable and inspiring.\u201d \nThat is classic the enemy of my enemy is my friend , right there. \nWell, it looks like Tamra\u2019s life is about to get a whole lot more stressful. \nRadarOnline reports that Gretchen Rossi is being courted to return to The Real Housewives of Orange County . \nFor a price. \n\u201cGretchen is willing to return, but producers know she will only sign if they offer the kind of money she can\u2019t refuse.\u201d \nAccording to their source, Gretchen wants the kind of salary that Vicki Gunvalson is making. \nReportedly, Vicki is pulling in about $ 750,000 a year. But apparently producers think that Gretchen might be worth it. \n\u201cProducers for RHOC know that they need someone who is going to bring the drama, and Gretchen will certainly do just that.\u201d \nShe\u2019ll certainly do that. \nAfter Vicki and Tamra ever-so-slightly mended fences in Iceland, producers will want new, fresh drama that doesn\u2019t threaten to derail the entire series. \nThey\u2019ll also need it to be a source of reliable drama, too. \n\u201cGretchen will never, ever make up with Tamra.\u201d \nThat sounds much better than the random fights that the now-fired Peggy Sulahian used to engage in for no reason other than the fact that cameras were rolling. \n\u201cThe two hate each other so much and it does not matter to Gretchen whether or not Vicki let it go because she will not.\u201d \nGretchen and Vicki, of course, are still friends. But it sounds like Gretchen won\u2019t hold back. \nYou know that Vine (who else is excited about Vine 2?!) where the kid does his impression of Real Housewives by stuffing his shirt hilariously and then saying \u201cI won\u2019t hesitate, bitch\u201d while pointing a toy gun? \nThat, it sounds like, is what we can look forward to from the next season of The Real Housewvies of Orange County . \nAssuming that producers cough up the requisite dough, that is. \nWith Meghan King Edmonds remaining on the show because she\u2019s pregnant and Gretchen a likely castmate, we\u2019re reportedly still looking at at least three new castmates being added to the roster for next season. \nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see what sort of dynamic the producers cook up.

When Rob Grow conducted his annual Potbelly's Rockaway River Fall Cleanup early last month, he knew exactly where he wanted to start. \nSeveral large tree trunks and assorted branches had lodged in the rocks at the foot of the Jackson Avenue falls and other debris had piled up behind them in the water and on the bank of the river. \n\"It seemed as if the pile was getting bigger and bigger each day,\" said Grow, the owner of Potbelly's Riverside Cafe, who has been organizing spring and fall river cleanups in the borough for the past nine years. \nBut when the 30 volunteers who braved the cold and raw weather started to work on the logjam, Grow quickly discovered the job was too big for them. \n\"There was no way we were going to dislodge those massive tree trunks,\" Grow said. \"So we picked up as much of the garbage as we could and then moved to other spots along the river.\" \nGrow sought advice from a couple of workers from the Rockaway Department of Public Works and his message was then relayed to the Morris County Mosquito Commission, which is responsible for performing this type of de-snagging operation in rivers in the county. \n\"They brought their heavy equipment and enough men to clear up the logjam in no time,\" Grow said. \"Once they got all the wood and branches cut, it completely filled a 40-cubic-yard dumpster. They did a great job. \n\"It's heartening to get all the volunteers to come out and work to keep the river and its banks clean twice a year.

That page, which discusses both environmental considerations and wild animal interactions, further links to TRAFFIC, the World Wildlife Fund, and World Animal Protection agencies. \nIn addition to encouraging its users not to damage the environment in order to get the perfect shot, Instagram says: We also encourage you to be mindful of your interactions with wild animals, and consider whether an animal has been smuggled, poached or abused for the sake of tourism. For example, be wary when paying for photo opportunities with exotic animals, as these photos and videos may put endangered animals at risk. \nUsers who come across a video or photo they believe to be violating Instagram's guidelines on this matter are urged to report it. The company explicitly states that it does not allow endangered animals to be sold via its platform, nor does it allow content featuring animal abuse.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

It doesn\u2019t matter if you are a freelancer or are looking for a permanent office position -either way, you can make your profile more impressive as well as build your influence with the help of LinkedIn.\n\nHow can you do that? By writing interesting and compelling blog posts that would be valuable to your audience. Here are eight tips to help you do just that.\n\n1. Know the message you want to deliver.\nBefore you start writing, you need to know what you plan to achieve with the help of your blog posts. Maybe you want to become a niche expert, to grow your network, to share your experience with the others, or to build up your professional value.\nAfter you decide, focus on the message that would help you achieve your desired result. Maybe you could give valuable financing tips, or create amazing infographics to illustrate your posts or give some insights on working for a certain company, etc. Make sure that your content is focused on this type of message; this way you\u2019ll become well-known for something specific and attract the attention of the people that you\u2019re interested in.\n\n2. Keep your network in mind.\nMaybe you already have a network you want to expand, or maybe you want to build one. Either way, you should keep this network in mind while coming up with the ideas of a blog post.\nAsk yourself: who are the people you want to attract and what things interest them? The answers could differ a lot, depending on the niche you\u2019re working in. However, it\u2019s important to stick to the related topics and to cover issues that are of current interest to your network.\n\n3. Cover the trending topics.\nJust as it\u2019s important to the stick to the topics that seem interesting to your audience, it\u2019s important to cover the latest trends in your niche. The reason behind this is very simple: it\u2019s the latest trends that go viral and drive more traffic.\nLinkedIn\u2019s editors themselves look for posts that cover the latest trends \u2014 and if the posts are good, they promote them via Pulse channels, driving even more traffic to your page.\n\n4. Don\u2019t make them too long.\nWhen it comes to ordinary blog posts, the principle \u2018the longer, the better\u2019 often works well (when the posts are informative and well-written, of course). However, when it comes to LinkedIn posts, you should stick to short ones (300-800 words) instead of long ones.\nLinkedIn is a professional network mostly \u2014 and not all professionals have enough time to read long articles. That\u2019s why, when it comes to LinkedIn promotion, it\u2019s better to craft short and very informative articles instead of long and unclear ones.\n\n5. Add a bit of personal information.\nWhile your goal is to deliver informative content, this doesn\u2019t mean that you have to strip it of your personality completely. After all, people can get similar advice in other places \u2014 it\u2019s the personality that often makes them stay and continue reading the posts of a specific person.\nSharing something personal doesn\u2019t mean telling the readers all about your life. Even adding some personal examples and coming up with your own advice counts as personal experience the readers would be interested in. For example, if you\u2019re writing about essay topics , share some stories on how you came up with such topics during college years.\n\n6. Polish your posts.\nOnce you are finished writing, found (or created) an image to illustrate your article, and crafted a proper headline, you can move on to polishing your article.\nOf course, there are plenty of online services that can help you with the proofreading part, but polishing is not only about that. Proofreading is a must, yes, but it\u2019s also important to check the formatting, to ensure that all links are clickable and lead to the right sites, that all the tags you want to use are included and all the images open.\nOnce that is done, proofread it manually one more time, paying special attention to grammar and spelling. While online proofreaders are good for an initial check, they still aren\u2019t as effective as a manual check.\n\n7. Don\u2019t forget to be social.\nPromotion is just as important as writing high-quality posts. However, promotion is not only sharing your post on other social media, it\u2019s also about making the most of LinkedIn itself. Remember that it\u2019s a social network \u2014 you can drive more traffic to your page simply by talking with people there.\nDon\u2019t settle for responding to comments only. Comment on other articles as well. Join some groups that are related to your niche and join the discussions there. This could help you become noticed by others, build your authority, and gain more followers.\n\n8. Know your limits.\nWhen it comes to any blog writing, consistency is definitely the key. You should post regularly, preferably at the same time to build an audience and to look professional. However, what exactly does \u2018regularly\u2019 mean? Should you do this every day? Twice a week? Once every two weeks?\nIt\u2019s always better to start with small goals. For example, you can try posting once a month for a start, making sure that your posts are indeed valuable, informative, and fresh. Once you do this for a few months, consider increasing the frequency to twice a month. Once this becomes easy, you can move on to posting once a week if you have the time to do so.\nRemember that quality is always better than the quantity and while the frequency is important, not overdoing it is even more important. Not everyone is able to dedicate themselves to the blogging only (at least, when they start). Most of us often need to combine writing with a full-time job. So when you decide to take it slow, you\u2019ll ensure that you are able to produce high-quality content and monitor the results effectively without straining yourself too much.\n\n20% Off All Business Cards \nVIEW ALL CARDS \n\nWhite Linen Business Cards $60.05 \nFrench Linen Business Card Template (White) $60.05 \nFrench Linen Business Card Template (Sky)) 2 $60.05 \nLight Sage Business Card (Linen) $62.55 \nTextured Linen Business Card Template $60.05 \nWhite Linen Business Card $60.05 \nLinen Business Card w/Logo $60.05 Light Grey Linen Business Card $60.05 \nLight Blue Business Card Template $52.55 \nWhite Business Card Template $52.55 \nWhite Linen Business Card $60.05 \nPhoto Business Cards (White Linen) $60.05 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "linkedin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "light sage business card", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linen business card template", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linen business card", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:43.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0163813d6a9ac07bb91f035d4800bbc451ee46bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRnCI1QyrxhrYeh0El_gA6JTVTuKYiHWi6mxfK5Viba7RXbTK70IVbJRgLTs3cZa9n0shu8trk40chUVQ8JbJrVmZLsP494TLToz3xIXJVyQUGct3b9GHhz", "site_full": "trollheaven.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://trollheaven.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Fedora as the new standard-operating system \u2013 trollheaven", "title": "Fedora as the new standard-operating system", "title_full": "Fedora as the new standard-operating system", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0163813d6a9ac07bb91f035d4800bbc451ee46bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRnCI1QyrxhrYeh0El_gA6JTVTuKYiHWi6mxfK5Viba7RXbTK70IVbJRgLTs3cZa9n0shu8trk40chUVQ8JbJrVmZLsP494TLToz3xIXJVyQUGct3b9GHhz", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Manuel Rodriguez", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "Fedora as the new standard-operating system", "text": "Traditional, the Linux community has the problem that they is divided into many different distributions. The user base and the programming power is not concentrated on one system but is spread out in many directions. That is major disadvantage for establishing Linux on the desktop. The solution is simple: all hobby-nerds must change to Fedora Linux and the Problem is solved. Fedora is the free version of the Red Hat operating system which is used by major companies. So it is possible to advocate private and commercial usage at the same time. Fedora for Gamers, amateur programmers, creative artists and end-customers, while Red Hat Enterprise Linux for big companies, small companies and universities.\nLike all Linux distributions, Fedora has also many problems. For example the Lyx software which i have installed from the repository isn\u2019t stable. Other software like kdenlive is not available under Fedora. But, as a base-system Fedora is good enough. There is a nice Webbrowser out of the box, which gets security patches regularly and many additonal programs like Office tools, games and C++ compilers are also available. So in my opinion Fedora is the best system for increasing the market share of Linux on the desktop. According to the last survey https://www.netmarketshare.com currently Linux have only a portion of 2,3%, while MS-Windows have 89%. Technical both systems are equal, perhaps Windows is using Linux code in the backend too.

Other people are not naturally good at this and yet these people (whether kids or adults) can be taught. Here are some ways of getting good at this, from someone who was not born with this skill but has learned it. \nFirst of all, one word needs to be forbidden: \u201cought.\u201d When we start thinking of what someone \u201cought\u201d to do, we are opening the door to judgment about that person, often without thinking about the context that is making something difficult. Yes, an eight year old \u201cought\u201d to be able to do a math worksheet independently. But that fact does not help a particular eight year old who is struggling. It is far more effective to find out what is going on. Here are some possibilities: The student does not understand what to do. The worksheet seems incomprehensible. The student has some kind of conflict with the teacher. The student has a fear of doing things wrong and won\u2019t even get started. The student has a hard time sitting down for the length of time the worksheet will take. The student has had a lot of negative learning experiences with the topic and does not want to engage with it. The student would much rather do something different (e.g., watch television, etc.). \nAs you can see, the remedies for each one of these circumstances would be different, so in order to come up with an effective strategy, it is important to understand what is happening in the mind of the student. Here are some possible remedies to try: Tutoring \nMany school subjects are cumulative and math is especially so. If you don\u2019t understand the principles of multiplication and division, fractions and decimals are going to be almost impossible. The earlier tutoring can be obtained, the better, so that the student can develop a strong foundation for future learning. \nSchool systems sometimes have tutoring services available and they may be free of charge. There are also educational corporations that provide tutoring, although this may be expensive. Alternatively, you may be able to find a college student (preferably one majoring in education) who can provide tutoring at a reasonable rate of pay or even a high school student who seems to be good with kids. While parents can also tutor, sometimes kids have a hard time learning from parents, so finding someone else for the job may be more effective. There are also web resources for many subjects that may help. Parent-Teacher Communication \nThere\u2019s an old joke about the teacher who says to the parent, \u201cif you promise not to believe half of what you are told about school, I promise not to believe half of what I\u2019m told about your home.\u201d For many reasons, kids may not be representing what is really going on in their classrooms. Students will go to great lengths to get away with watching TV instead of doing their homework . Sometimes they are trying to avoid trouble for themselves and sometimes they simply don\u2019t understand what the teacher wants. Communicating with the teacher on a regular basis will help you to be able to solve problems between the student and the teacher. Perfectionism \nThe perfectionistic kid is the one who erases holes in the paper because the letters weren\u2019t formed exactly right. This is also known as the \u201chelocopter parent\u201d approach, which, while well-intentioned, can cause more harm than good . While we want children to develop high standards for themselves, part of wisdom is learning when to apply those high standards. Perfectionism is counterproductive, for example, when writing a rough draft. \nWhen kids have a hard time getting started on their work because they are concerned they cannot do the work well enough, they need permission (or even a requirement) to do something badly. Most work can be revised towards quality but even a bad start or highly imperfect one is much better than no start at all. Telling a student to write something as badly as possible can lend some humor to a situation and remove some of the psychological pressure. Ironically, when people set out to write as badly as possible, they often end up writing well. Breaking it down \nFor some kids, twenty problems on a worksheet is totally overwhelming. Teach them to break it down. Ask them to see how quickly they could do one line of problems; having a timer will help them to get into the spirit of finding out their capabilities. After the child has done one line, allow a small break and then come back to the next one of problems. It may only take three or four sessions of breaking a worksheet down this way for the student to begin to use the strategy on his or her own. Being able to break down a big task into smaller, more doable pieces is a wonderful skill for kids to learn; it applies in so many areas of life. Learned Helplessness \nWhen students have had a traumatic experience in learning, they may, naturally, want to avoid that situation again. They may develop a sense that they are incapable of learning and therefore they will not even try. Learned helplessness is a psychological phenomenon identified by Martin Seligman in both animals and people-it is a response to the situation of having no control over negative events one is experiencing. Both people and animals give up. \nIn order to counter learned helplessness, it is important to set the student up for a series of small but significant successes and also to begin by taking most responsibility for the activity but then slowly give the student responsibility until the student is independent. Premack Principle \nThe idea behind the Premack Principle is to reward the completion of one activity with the possibility of doing a preferred activity. It goes like this: \u201cYou can watch your favorite television show when this homework is done.\u201d If you phrase it so that the first thing you say is what the child wants to hear (\u201cyou can watch television\u201d) then that will help the child make the decision to meet the requirements. If you focus on the requirements first (\u201cyou can\u2019t watch television until your homework is done\u201d or \u201cyour homework has to be done before you watch television\u201d), then that leads the child to focus on something that feels negative. Keep it positive (but also follow through-if the homework is not finished, the television show does not get watched). Choose the Remedy \nBe sure to find out what is going on when a child is having a hard time completing work. If you know what the deal is, you will be more likely to find ways to solve the problem. It is important for children to learn how to work independently and these skills can be learned. \nStaff Writer; Carla Day", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "premack", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin seligman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carla day", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "premack principle", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:43.034+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dab82696975d9402ce7f216cd8e9c1ec7b17e47c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYf9pA8cmVYgIfn4UyoGA5PKzJSaPDas.csOcwS03ibPEOhZ.gdPAlVWjOdtY6A_o7Lczi1apKtdq9vKskqngiAJ4j4RPoSa2LUvFDhgbqHQ74RnwDwAFA8Q--", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com.my", "site": "tripadvisor.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com.my/ShowForum-g311304-i9623-Sapa_Lao_Cai_Province.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Sapa Forum, Travel Discussion for Sapa, Vietnam - TripAdvisor", "title": "Sapa in early April - Sapa", "title_full": "Sapa in early April - Sapa Message Board - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-04T04:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.991, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13431, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "16b55ea190f87aab98f94ce85b01a3da18c953b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYf9pA8cmVYgIfn4UyoGA5PKzJSaPDas.csOcwS03ibPEOhZ.gdPAlVWjOdtY6A_o7Lczi1apKtdq9vKskqngiAJ4j4RPoSa2LUvFDhgbqHQ78csUdfTws.yl7NWq_SmkB", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Kaylee05", "published": "2017-12-04T12:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hi I and my friends choose Chapa cabin, so comfortable and easy to get to sleep.

Now, Australia has made history by becoming the latest country to legalise same-sex marriage. \nAs The Herald Sun reports , just after 6pm this evening, MPs made the decision to decline a series of last-minute amendments to the legislation, with the long-awaited decision being announced soon after. News of the legislation\u2019s passing was met with cheers, tears, applause, and a rousing rendition of the national anthem by those in attendance. \nAs Sky News reports, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull greeted the news by simply stating \u201cAustralia has done it\u201d. \n\u201cEvery Australian had their say and they said it is fair, get on with it,\u201d Mr Turnbull said. \u201cAnd the Parliament has got on with it and we have voted today for a quality, for love, it is time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect, and we respect every Australian who was voted, those who voted yes, and those who voted no, this belongs to us all.\u201d \nSo what\u2019s next? Well, now the legislation has to be sent to Governor-General Peter Cosgrove for royal assent, but according to a number of media outlets, that could be as soon as the end of the week. \nWhatever the case, this has been a long time coming for all Australians, and we can only urge that you don\u2019t party too hard tonight as you celebrate this news.

The client comes very first so their satisfaction need to generally be a priority for any handyman.\n\nAdequate instruction\n\nAbilities must be acquired by vigorous education on the whole staff in their individual function categories.

Tuesday night stormed a popular viewing centre, Kaneworld Resort in Uyo, Akwa Ibom, and shot dead a final year student of the University of Uyo (UNIUYO) while watching the UEFA Champions League matches, TheNation reports. \n\nIt was gathered that a three-man gang, stormed the viewing centre located at 17, Idak Okpo lane, few minutes to the end of the matches involving Manchester United, Chelsea and Bayern Munich and shot the victim. \nThe heavily armed gunmen reportedly ordered viewers to lie face down. \u201cWhen they (the criminals) ordered everyone to lie down, the deceased struggled with his Infinix phone and was shot at close range,\" Effiong Akpan, a Manchester United fan told TheNation. \nAccording to him, the deceased, Dominic Ubiat, a final year Microbiology student was shot on his groin at close range. \u201cHe ran with patches of blood from the viewing centre and was chased by the hoodlums to his house and died before help could reach him,\u201d another fan added. \nThe Nation gathered that youths from the area arrived a little too late to take him to the hospital where medics confirmed he died from excessive loss of blood. \nHis parents, Mr. and Mrs. Ubiat, who visited the scene of the incident on Wednesday, lamented that all the years of their son in the university was in vain and vowed to go the extra mile to avenge his death. \nConfirming the incident, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Elkana Bala, described the incident as \u201ca pure robbery attack.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

The scenario looks like the voting between Donald and Hilary, whos the lesser evil. I mean DC is the lesser evil compared to GC, I suppose, which makes the former the protagonist and the latter the antagonist. And surprisingly Estarossa wasnt a fail hype after all revealing hes one of the top 3 strongest demon.\nOne top tier can destroy a bunch of low tiers with ease so if the goddess only has more low tiers ( if true), it does not make the balance with demon Nanatsu no Taizai 246 Chapter. I think there are more top tiers in goddess clan. The goddess has been introduced quite late so it needs time to reveal other strong members. I mean the guy just literally peed against Escanor.haha. I\u2019ll keep an eye of Estarossa\u2019s progress because I think hes the most interesting character as of now. Neither are more evil or more moral than the other because in the end they both are just yin and yang(obvious parallels here).
