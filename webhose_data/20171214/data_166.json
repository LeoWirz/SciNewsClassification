A new New York Times piece investigates the powerful relationship that the producer had that helped maintain his reputation. Hillary and Bill Clinton were among the names featured in the article, with Weinstein having hosted fundraisers in their honour and having donated money to their campaigns. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below In March last year, Dunham claims that she informed Kristina Schake, the campaign's deputy communications director, about \"disturbing\" reports she had heard both directly and secondhand from other actresses about Weinstein. \"I just want you to let you know that Harvey's a rapist and this is going to come out at some point,\" Dunham said she told Schake. She recalled adding, \"I think it's a really bad idea for him to host fund-raisers and be involved because it's an open secret in Hollywood that he has a problem with sexual assault.\" Harvey Weinstein with Hillary Clinton in 2004 Most Popular Schake was apparently been surprised by Dunham's admission, and said she would tell Robby Mook, the campaign manager. The actress also told Adrienne Elrod, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton who was leading efforts with celebrity campaigners. Both Schake and Elrod deny that Dunham used the term 'rape'. Dunham does not believe her warning ever reached Clinton, who said in a statement last October that she was \"shocked and appalled by the revelations\". Clinton's communications director, Nick Merrill, denied knowledge of the Weinstein claims. \"We were shocked when we learned what he'd done. It's despicable behaviour, and the women that have come forward have shown enormous courage. As to claims about a warning, that's something staff wouldn't forget,\" he said in a statement. \"Only [Dunham] can answer why she would tell them instead of those who could stop him.\" Weinstein has denied all non-consensual sex claims made against him. \"Mr Weinstein denies allegations of non-consensual sex,\" his representative said. \"Mr Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "harvey weinstein text lena dunham", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lena dunham", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "harvey weinstein", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "adrienne elrod", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robby mook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristina schake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dunham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick merrill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elrod", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:38.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "007e0ba792a36e0c6d04103351ab178337b7405d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSf4JPFetzu_4Q0WapoehpKCKjCus7FKyu80uaVqUNThrFIpTin6LBV8GJbYsKC7_nqfKJTu7Lvsh7esJuUSm0NdrkR555uO6sSlPHza87BU8-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Stocks - Investing and trading for all", "title": "23 Years Old.

A few thoughts:\n- The podcast app needs some better cover art. It looks like it's made in MS Paint.\n- I kinda like an opening song or some sort of quick musical intro.\n- Knudson and atursky have some great golf talk and banter. Solid golf talk commentary.\n- Knudson mentioned the thread about what to do about the golf ball going so far. He brought up Merion being destroyed by the modern player. Merion might not have been the best example. Rose won at Merion at +1 (6,996 yards) with the cut at +8 the while Koepka won at Erin Hills (7,741 yards) with -16 and the cut was +1. Webb Simpson won with a +1 the Olympic Club (7,170) and the cut was +8 . Graeme McDowell won at Pebble Beach (7,040 yards) with even par and the cut was +7. Spieth won at Chambers Bay (7,500 yards) with -5 and the cut was +5. At least as far as the US Open goes, the shorter the course, the harder the track. The pros are hitting the ball further than ever and courses are having to keep up, but Merion wasn't the best example.\n- Continue to reference the forums.

Bots snap up popular Christmas toys for resale \nHot holiday toys have always been hard to find. But the proliferation of online shopping makes it even tougher to purchase coveted items because of software that snaps them up as soon as they are offered for sale. \nFingerlings, those colorful chirping monkeys (and sloths and unicorns) that wrap around your finger, have become one of the most desired toys on holiday shopping lists. \nUnfortunately, the $15 creatures are sold out online almost everywhere. Toys R Us? Gone. Walmart? None left in stock. Target? Nope. \nBut check eBay or Amazon, and sellers are offering them for double, triple and quadruple their original price. There is even one being advertised for $5,000. \nHot holiday toys have always been hard to find. The long list of heartbreakers includes Cabbage Patch Kids dolls, which caused parents to mob stores in the 1980s, Tickle Me Elmo in 1996, and a toy version of the \u201cStar Wars\u201d droid BB-8, which quickly sold out in 2015.

That allows scalpers to buy products before an official sale becomes public. Bots can also subscribe to online notifications of sales and bypass purchasing limits set by retailers by using multiple internet addresses. \nLaura Oliver, who blogs about deals on her website, A Frugal Chick, has been keeping tabs on Fingerlings, the brainchild of the company WowWee, for months, and notified her readers on Facebook whenever she found a retailer that had them in stock. \nIt was an all-consuming job. \n\u201cI have had dreams about Fingerlings,\u201d she said. \nOn Amazon, Fingerlings priced at $15 will sometimes last as long as 25\u2026 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laura oliver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "omri iluz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iluz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "walmart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wowwee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ebay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tickle me elmo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:39.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d8f11a32a2352711919d8484dc7f9582ed2b3cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.wpr1ZZ_oMRyPceWp5SgfOX.G0A0CeE3sVfN7gxrJkr53ELpjAizy3IV8JgsrQWu.noLmDpjGHI9UA2qhR3bA98PRiNnm1Rj7RbOM0GuD6dA--", "site_full": "www.wsmv.com", "site": "wsmv.com", "site_section": "http://wsmv.com/category/162901/ap-news-center?clienttype=rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WSMV Nashville - U.S. & World - Top Story", "title": "Franken faces new allegations, weighing future", "title_full": "Franken faces new allegations, weighing future", "published": "2017-12-07T11:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://images.worldnow.com/AP/images/15576338_G.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 42369, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5d8f11a32a2352711919d8484dc7f9582ed2b3cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.wpr1ZZ_oMRyPceWp5SgfOX.G0A0CeE3sVfN7gxrJkr53ELpjAizy3IV8JgsrQWu.noLmDpjGHI9UA2qhR3bA98PRiNnm1Rj7RbOM0GuD6dA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "Franken faces new allegations, weighing future", "text": "Franken faces new allegations, weighing future Posted: Updated: (AP Photo/Alex Brandon).

Hours later, another woman said Franken inappropriately squeezed \"a handful of flesh\" on her waist while posing for a photo with her in 2009. \nThat brought the number of women alleging misconduct by Franken to at least eight.

But what if that story is wrong? What if the former Penn State football coach and founder of the Second Mile is an innocent man convicted in the midst of a moral panic fed by the sensationalistic media, police trawling, and memory-warping psychotherapy? \nDespite my being a relatively well-known, well-reviewed nonfiction author, I could not secure a contract for a book raising these questions from a major publisher or academic press. Why? Because the case is so toxic that no one would touch it. \nI finally found Sunbury, a small Pennsylvania press, which was brave enough to publish it. The book is a kind of sister publication to Memory Warp: How the Myth of Repressed Memory Arose and Refuses to Die . \nMark Pendergrast, photo by Betty Molnar \nThe background: In 2013, I got an email out of the blue from Glenna Kerker, an Oregon woman, asking me to look into the Sandusky case because it involved repressed memory therapy, about which I have written. I had heard about Mike Macquarie, the eyewitness who supposedly saw Sandusky sodomizing a boy in a Penn State shower, so I assumed Sandusky was guilty. But when I looked into the case, I found that Macquarie had not witnessed anything but had only heard slapping sounds. And the case was indeed replete with repressed memory and other issues. \nI became fascinated and could not stop researching it, even though I was under contract for another book at the time. I ended up visiting Sandusky twice in prison and interviewing dozens of people, including all of his children, an alleged victim, lawyers, Sandusky acquaintances, and others. \nThe result is this hefty book, which I fear may make me \u201cthe most hated writer in America\u201d for many people who think they know about the case and have accepted the standard abuse narrative. My mantra for this book will be RTB: Read the Book. Then form your own conclusions. \nContact info: \nMark Pendergrast, 802-497-1570, 802-310-9246 (cell), markp508@gmail.com , www.markpendergrast.com Publisher: Lawrence Knorr, 855-338-8359, lknorr@sunburypress.com \nBuy this book now in the ScienceWriters bookstore .

However, the only drawback is that its expensive. Its nearly impossible for a regular wage earner to buy a brand new car. This is one reason why they resort to secondhand or used cars which are deemed slightly affordable.\n\nTo get the promising offers without being part of scam, its smart to spend some of your precious time chatting a trustworthy and effective professional. Good used Honda dealer Sacramento can offer advice and tips regarding your concerns. But since there are thousands of professionals out there, opting the one who deserves your attention really matters. Here, in the following, are some ways which could help you found the right dealer for a job.\n\nCommunication Ability. Promising and great kinds of dealers would always find ways to communicate and even to fulfill the necessary request of customers. Their communication lines need to be open twenty four seven and they should also present suggestions and recommendations to the customers. When your dealer is not helping you at all, consider selecting for impressive candidates instead.\n\nExperience. Needless to say, you deserve a dealer who has all kinds of experience on car management, including making connections with some clients. When you cooperate and work with someone who is new, his or her ideas might not be sufficient. Select someone who has accomplished successful and great deals with customers to ensure a commendable and impressive outcome.\n\nReliability. Unreliable professionals are most likely to cause either fear or even panic. There is no easy way of predicting what they should do with your spent investment. Worse case is, the chances of getting the ideal type of used cars might significantly drop as well. Even if the offers are impressive and ideal, always seek for some credentials to prevent getting involve on a wrong kind of service.\n\nClient Reputation. You should hear out the advice of their clients before you make the final commitments. Besides, satisfied clients would be more than willing to attest the effectiveness of a service. Heed to their opinions, so you will know who to consider and who to avoid. The most important thing of all is to make your own decision you would unlikely feel rue about.\n\nPunctual. A good and efficient dealer would be present early, especially if you agreed on having some meetings. The earlier matters are properly discussed, the higher is the chance of achieving the ideal outcome that you wanted most. When you are not prioritized, consider selecting for another impressive candidates who can manifest impressive and positive service which you always wanted right from the start.\n\nHonest and Transparent Service. This is definitely one important thing which you must found on your chosen candidates. When they are an utter failure on presenting an exceptional service, this could be an indication to start looking for another professionals who could perform better.\n\nKnowledge. Its wise that dealers learn the corresponding solutions and answers to every concern. Otherwise, you would need to select another professionals who are impressive on doing the activities better than the initial choice.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nYou can get a summary of the things to keep in mind when picking a used Honda dealer Sacramento area at http://www.bossautosales.org/what-we-do right now. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "betty kelly   cars", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "honda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "transparent service", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sacramento", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:41.112+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a39457cfc19930bc60d6f36d82145f6de1d616ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU47JUv.UmwuDIgH55hCRY8edhG5Lp3QF3rkF35xsQYQ7TDOA9Y4dvm7X5CL9LzdHBr1b.FB6YkDjQsKOjNJPnVy9sUmahYfEn33DipgnhGhtVrTDq2nlbANiOimN4lQhYfo-", "site_full": "live2sport.com", "site": "live2sport.com", "site_section": "http://live2sport.com", "site_categories": ["world_soccer", "hobbies_and_interests", "games", "sports"], "section_title": "Live 2 Sport \u2013 Watch Live Sport, Prediction and Sport Statistics", "title": "Olympique Khouribga vs Moghreb T\u0102\u0160touan, Dec 08, 2017 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Preview, Watch and Bet, Score", "title_full": "Olympique Khouribga vs Moghreb T\u0102\u0160touan, Dec 08, 2017 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Preview, Watch and Bet, Score", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "UA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a39457cfc19930bc60d6f36d82145f6de1d616ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU47JUv.UmwuDIgH55hCRY8edhG5Lp3QF3rkF35xsQYQ7TDOA9Y4dvm7X5CL9LzdHBr1b.FB6YkDjQsKOjNJPnVy9sUmahYfEn33DipgnhGhtVrTDq2nlbANiOimN4lQhYfo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "Olympique Khouribga vs Moghreb T\u0102\u0160touan, Dec 08, 2017 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Preview, Watch and Bet, Score", "text": "\u0158\u0141\u016e\u02c6\u016e\u201e\u016e\u2026\u0158\u00a8\u016e\u0160\u016e\u0192 \u0158\u017d\u0158\u0105\u016e\u0160\u0158\u00a8\u016e\u0192\u0158\u0160 \u2013 \u0158\u00a7\u016e\u201e\u016e\u2026\u0158\u015f\u0158\u0105\u0158\u00a8 \u0158\u00a7\u016e\u201e\u0158\u015e\u0158\u02c7\u016e\u02c6\u0158\u00a7\u016e\u2020\u016e\u0160 (local team names)\nMoroccan Botola , Olympique Khouribga \u2013 Moghreb T\u0102\u0160touan , Friday, 1:00 pm ET \nInformation about video stream is absent for now \nBetting Odds Olympique Khouribga \u2013 Moghreb T\u0102\u0160touan 1 X 2 2.2 3.16 3.55 \nShort Preview Recent matches Olympique Khouribga is playing unstable (in the last 5 games wins \u2013 2 ).

PTI Singapore top destination for Chinese investment, India 37th According to the latest EIU's China Going Global Investment Index, Singapore overtook the US as the most attractive destination for Chinese overseas direct investment. PTI @moneycontrolcom \nIndia has slipped six notches to 37th position among 60 major economies in the world in terms of their attractiveness to Chinese firms, while Singapore topped the list compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit. \nAccording to the latest EIU's China Going Global Investment Index, Singapore overtook the US as the most attractive destination for Chinese overseas direct investment. \nHong Kong, Malaysia and Australia rounded the top five. \nAmong BRIC economies, Russia's index rank moved up by six places to 11th, with its economic prospects having improved owing to higher commodity prices, while South Africa's rank has risen by six places to 44th. related news Need to develop agriculture sector to meet future food demand: Govt \nHowever, Brazil dropped by 19 places to 53rd place and India is down by six positions to 37th amid \"tenser political relations with China\", it said. \n\"Despite challenges for Chinese investors in India, the country's growth prospects are the brightest across major economies and several Chinese companies, such as Huawei (a telecommunications firm) and Xiaomi (a consumer electronics company), have built successful businesses there,\" the EIU report said. \nE-commerce could be a particular strength for Chinese firms in the global consumer sector in future, the report said and added that Alibaba, is amplifying its e-commerce footprint in South-east Asia and India through investments in Lazada and Paytm, respectively. \nAlthough developed economies still dominate the upper ranks of the index, emerging markets have improved their positions and notable climbers include Malaysia (4th) and Kazakhstan (13th). \nSeveral developed economies have tumbled down the index: the UK slipped the most, by 29 places to 41st, owing to the worsened outlook for economic growth following its decision to leave the EU. \nCountries that rank consistently highly across the six industry indices include the US, Japan, India and Iran. \n\"While the US and Japan owe their positions mainly to the opportunities they offer Chinese firms to obtain technology and brands through mergers and acquisitions (M&A), India and Iran are fast-growing markets in which companies from China are likely to be competitive,\" the report noted. The index ranks 60 major economies in terms of their attractiveness to Chinese firms, drawing on 57 indicators spread across \u201copportunity\u201d and \u201crisk\u201d pillars. tags #Economy #India #investment #Singapore most popular", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "xiaomi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pti", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eiu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alibaba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "economist intelligence unit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huawei", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kazakhstan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paytm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lazada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south-east asia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:42.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "623527e365b068f1d24bae89ea52b03b47bc74f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRpAOnBf60O5BROrfuD9ZZRS9ZClHNi83ko.7NiAODhdRGulYpobRANJZnFaVoHbsdqAbPlZelje2gVoFKIlONLtkmtB6iqmzDIQCrqmQNTK5_ru66jwjt5WjoqXrlH7U0-", "site_full": "www.360news.co.za", "site": "360news.co.za", "site_section": "http://www.360news.co.za/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "360News", "title": "More money needed to save Limpopo crumbling health system", "title_full": "More money needed to save Limpopo crumbling health system", "published": "2017-12-07T10:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "623527e365b068f1d24bae89ea52b03b47bc74f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRpAOnBf60O5BROrfuD9ZZRS9ZClHNi83ko.7NiAODhdRGulYpobRANJZnFaVoHbsdqAbPlZelje2gVoFKIlONLtkmtB6iqmzDIQCrqmQNTK5_ru66jwjt5WjoqXrlH7U0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "More money needed to save Limpopo crumbling health system", "text": "More money needed to save Limpopo crumbling health system Via Health24 | 07 Dec 2017 - 10:30:03 The dysfunctional health system in Limpopo is claiming lives and leading to widespread suffering.

Study - Aspirin - Cancer - Drug - Group Another study discovered adding aspirin to a cancer drug could make it more powerful in combating a group of tumors that are highly resistant to therapies.These include some pancreatic, lung and colorectal cancers, as well as a small percentage of melanomas. Findings - Hope - People - Forms - Disease Together, the findings offer hope for people with certain difficult-to-treat forms of the disease.Canadian scientists found that metformin, used to treat type 2 diabetes, reduced the rapid reproduction of tumor cells in the laboratory. Resistance - Drug - Doxorubicin It also prevented or delayed resistance to the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin.Other laboratory experiments and tests on mice showed that metformin reversed protein markers associated with multiple drug resistance (MDR). Drug - Breast - Cancers - Treatment - Researchers This meant the drug might help resistant breast cancers to start responding to treatment again, said the researchers.Previous work has shown that metformin has an anti-proliferative effect on many kinds of cancer cell, they added. Analyses - Cancer - Patients - Metformin - Drug Multiple-study analyses of diabetic cancer patients treated with metformin have hinted at the drug boosting survival and preventing new tumours.The team led by Dr Terra Arnason, from the University of Saskatchewan, wrote in the journal Public Library of Science One: 'Our demonstration that metformin can prevent MDR development and resensitise MDR cells to chemotherapy in vitro (in the laboratory) provides important medical relevance towards metformin's potential clinical use against MDR cancers.

(AP) \u2014 The little blue pill that's helped millions of men in the bedroom is turning white. Drugmaker Pfizer is launching its own cheaper generic version of Viagra rather than lose most sales when the impotence pill gets its first generic competition next week. \nPfizer Inc. will begin selling the white pill at half the $65-a-pill retail price on Monday, when its patent-protected monopoly ends. Generic maker Teva Pharmaceuticals can start selling its version then, but isn't disclosing the price. \nMany more generics go on sale next summer, which will steadily slash the price of generics, possibly by 90 percent. \n\"Patients are paying fortunes. When generic Viagra comes out, they will be very happy,\" said Dr. Nachum Katlowitz, a urologist at New York's Staten Island University Hospital. \nLaunched in 1998, Viagra was the first pill for impotence. It transformed a private frustration for many aging men into a publicly discussed medical condition with an easy treatment, far more appealing than options like penile injections and implants. Pfizer's early TV ads for the little blue pill even coined the term erectile dysfunction, ED for short. \nEli Lilly's Cialis came out in 2003 and now dominates the U.S. market with on-demand pills and daily, low-dose ones. Viagra is a close second. \nPfizer says its market research shows 20 percent of customers are loyal to Viagra. So rather than give up sales to generic makers as brand-name drugmakers once routinely did, the company is selling its own generic and also fighting to keep men on its blue pills. \n\"We believe that the story for Viagra isn't done. It's just going to be a new chapter,\" said Jim Sage, president of U.S. brands for Pfizer Essential Health, which sells its older medicines. \nIn January, the drugmaker will offer two new discount programs and increase its copayment card discounts. Uninsured men can get brand-name Viagra half off through an innovative online home delivery program, Pfizer Direct. Many insured patients will be able to get a month's prescription \u2014 typically six to 10 pills, depending on plan limits \u2014 for as little as a $20 copayment. \n\"This is the most comprehensive pricing and marketing response I've seen to a generic,\" said Erik Gordon, a pharmaceuticals analyst at the University of Michigan's business school. \"It's unprecedented.\" \nGordon thinks Pfizer's reduced prices will retain some patients and attract others who buy pills, often counterfeits, from the internet. \nDr. Matthias Hofer, a urologist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, said some of his insured patients who take Viagra wouldn't want a generic. \"They will be ecstatic if they can save money and get the brand product from Pfizer,\" he said. \nLast year, more than 12 million prescriptions for Viagra and Cialis were filled in the U.S., generating a combined $3 billion in sales, according to health data and clinical research company IQVIA. However, prescriptions have dropped more than 20 percent since 2012, as repeated price hikes put the pills out of reach for many men lacking good insurance. \nAccording to health information analytics firm Elsevier, over just the past decade, retail prices jumped from about $10 to $62 per pill for Viagra and from $11 to $61 for Cialis. Pharmacies and other middlemen add a few dollars more per pill. \nGeneric Viagra, called sildenafil, will become even more affordable starting June 11, when more versions go on sale. \n\"Many patients already know it's going generic and they want it,\" said Aracely Pena, a medical assistant at San Diego Sexual Medicine. \nCialis and Levitra, another pill launched in 2003, get their own generic competition next fall. \nIn the meantime, some doctors specializing in sexual dysfunction have found other options. Some prescribe generic Revatio, the blood pressure pill Pfizer was testing when older patients reported stronger erections as a side effect. It contains one-fifth the sildenafil dose in Viagra and costs as little as $1 per pill. \nNorthwestern's Hofer arranges for his patients to receive made-to-order pills from a couple of specialty pharmacies. \nDaniel Lobello, 60, is satisfied with those pills but thinks a lot of men probably would use cheaper generic or brand-name Viagra. \n\"It's great\" that the prices are getting cut, said the West Chester, Illinois, electrical inspector, \"because it's something men need.\" \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

We are using a Sony DSC RX100 III camera. During calibration, I am trying to get dark current RGB values by taking an image with the lens cap ON in a dark room. However, when I do this I am getting much higher values than expected (R~20,000, G~6,000, B~15,000). I am shooting in manual exposure mode and have turned Auto White Balance and Auto ISO off. I am using set values (White Balance = daylight, ISO = 200), and short shutter speeds (1/5000 - 1/1000). Aperture is also set to fully open (2.4). I am wondering if there is some other setting that could be set to auto that I am not considering? I tried running through the menu and turning all \"auto\" settings off but to no avail. I thought maybe could have something to do with the focus area but I am not sure. When I take an image of a white piece of paper next to a black piece of paper I get lower RGB values than when I block out all light, so there must be something adjusting for the lack of light, right?
