\nMobile phones can do a lot today, but here is one more smart thing your smart phone can do. Now your smart phone can tell you if your weed control herbicide is likely to work. Daniel Waldstein, technical Market Manager with BASF, says that now a grower can check on his phone if there has been enough rain to activate his herbicide, \u201cGrowers can now get information on the probability of the success of their herbicide application.\u201d \nThe system is very site specific. You can check field by field. \u201cIt is sort of like Google Maps,\u201d Waldstein said. \u201cIt can be very site specific and pull data from the nearest weather station and use an algorithm to extrapolate the odds your chemical is working.\u201d Different chemicals require different levels of moisture to become active, so this tool will take the guesswork out of calculations. Waldstein stated, \u201cFor example, Outlook Herbicide only takes \u00bd inch of moisture to activate, while some other products take over an inch of rain before they start to work.\u201d \nIt is a free service, so plug it into your bookmarks: reliableactivation.com.

Seth Williams, Philadelphia\u2019s former top prosecutor, has been moved to a federal prison in Oklahoma to begin serving a five-year sentence for accepting a bribe. The two-term Democrat became the city\u2019s first black DA when he won office in 2009, after serving as Philadelphia\u2019s inspector general \u2013 a role that required him to oversee municipal anti-corruption efforts. \nHe is slated for release in November 2021. \nAt his Oct. 24 sentencing, U.S. District Judge Paul Diamond said Williams, 50, sold his office to \u201cparasites.\u201d \n\u201cYour profound dishonesty has to be deterred,\u201d Diamond told Williams, before ordering him jailed immediately. \nA nearly two-year investigation into Williams\u2019 financial affairs resulted in a wide-ranging indictment in which he was charged with accepting cash and gifts, fraudulently using thousands of dollars from his campaign fund for personal expenses, misusing city vehicles and misappropriating money intended to fund his mother\u2019s nursing home care. \nTwo weeks into his June trial, amid damaging testimony about how he accepted perks such as a lavish Caribbean vacation and a Jaguar convertible, Williams pleaded guilty to a single count of accepting a bribe from a businessman who admitted giving him a $3,000 sofa and thousands of dollars in cash payments. \nHe had been charged with 29 counts of bribery, extortion and fraud. Although 28 counts were dismissed, prosecutors said Williams admitted he committed all the conduct. \nOn Monday, his lawyers say he was moved from Philadelphia to the federal lockup in Oklahoma City. \nHis defense team believes he\u2019ll eventually be moved to Morgantown, W.Va., to finish his term. Morgantown\u2019s minimum-security prison is about a five-hour drive from Philadelphia. \nWilliams\u2019 sentencing came just a year after former state Attorney General Kathleen Kane, the first woman and first Democrat elected as the state\u2019s top prosecutor, was sentenced to 10 to 23 months in prison. \nShe was convicted on two felony counts of perjury and seven misdemeanor charges for unlawfully leaking grand jury materials in a political payback scheme and lying about it under oath. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "seth williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kathleen kane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul diamond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diamond", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaguar", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oklahoma city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morgantown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oklahoma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "w.va.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:14.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d02af4b9b733b81dedb3770d6c8a47230897d017", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKOlPvBjFDQ95sRoSYpOQshhIG2oH9Om_5vXtZXXRe0w9iIYjn32NbfFwAYeQWbbDJHcXuHqfQKCzyCci0cWXGjS_tPYgnjIzToyLh_JFndgMjij4jl61sg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "popular links", "title": "Same Sex Marriage is now legal in Australia : worldnews", "title_full": "Same Sex Marriage is now legal in Australia : worldnews", "published": "2017-12-07T08:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 168, "participants_count": 115, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "49993877944edd799ea08ea359cb8f9bb8a7612e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKOlPvBjFDQ95sRoSYpOQshhIG2oH9Om_5vXtZXXRe0w9iIYjn32NbfFwAYeQWbbDJHcXuHqfQKCzyCci0cWXGjS_tPYgnjIzToyLh_JFndhj5rWxCu52kQaECZ2ReBqyg6sPwBTpkAc-", "ord_in_thread": 53, "author": "Moebius702", "published": "2017-12-07T11:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "No government should be able to tell you who you love.

The U.S. signed free-trade agreements with Colombia and Panama in 2012 and trade has flourished since then. \nThe intention of these trips is also to grow trade both ways, with McKinney saying the U.S. benefits from imports too, especially of products the country does not produce itself. \nSource: NAFB News Service", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mckinney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ted mckinney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sonny perdue", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "usda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of agriculture", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nafb news service", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "colombia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "panama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "panama city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:14.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4c816b4cdb9c4fdc74d774b1526c8987b6220d5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mQAyyZsJLbKtN.JUovqAhwh9Qhx1rO0UV4g2v_nIgY_blvEw_9_klXvNtPt_P7DEPnmc_Gh9dXcYw--", "site_full": "1010wcsi.com", "site": "1010wcsi.com", "site_section": "http://1010wcsi.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "1010 WCSI", "title": "Long Awaited Tax Reform Nearing Reality", "title_full": "Long Awaited Tax Reform Nearing Reality", "published": "2017-12-07T07:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://1010wcsi.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WCSI-News-Updates.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4c816b4cdb9c4fdc74d774b1526c8987b6220d5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mQAyyZsJLbKtN.JUovqAhwh9Qhx1rO0UV4g2v_nIgY_blvEw_9_klXvNtPt_P7DEPnmc_Gh9dXcYw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "WCSI", "published": "2017-12-07T07:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "Long Awaited Tax Reform Nearing Reality", "text": "Tax-reform-near-reality \nWith the House and Senate both passing their own versions of tax reform bills, comprehensive tax reform could soon cross the finish line. That legislative feat has the support of the American Farm Bureau Federation. For agriculture, AFBF senior congressional relations director Pat Wolff says the biggest difference in the bills is how pass-through business income will be treated. That\u2019s income reported by farmers and ranchers who file under sole proprietorships, partnerships and S-corporations. \n\u201cThe Senate bill provides a big deduction for business profits. The House takes a completely different version and only provides a lower rate for a third of farm and ranch profits. How they work that out matters a lot to the taxes that farmers and ranchers will pay.\u201d \nBoth bills continue provisions important to agriculture like business interest deduction and like-kind exchanges. Farmers can also expect relief from the burden of estate tax. \n\u201cBoth bills double the estate tax exemption. So, that\u2019s good news for most farmers and ranchers. Most farmers and ranchers will be under that exemption level of $11 million a person. The House bill does repeal estate taxes, but unfortunately that doesn\u2019t look like it will make it into the final bill.\u201d \nThe House and Senate are expected to work quickly to finish the bill and be ready for a final vote within the next few weeks. \n\u201cThe next step is for a conference committee to be formed to work out the differences between the House and Senate bill,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cThat conference committee will be made up of members of the House and Senate who helped write their respective bills. And, because so many things are the same, there is an expectation that they\u2019ll finish up in the next week or so.\u201d \nThat would get the bill to the floor for final passage before Christmas. \nFarm Bureau has praised both bills for bringing Congress one step closer to a tax code that works for everyone in agriculture. \n\u201cFarm Bureau looks forward to the Senate and House reconciling the differences between their respective versions in conference to achieve a final tax reform package that addresses the needs and concerns of farmers and ranchers and boosts economic growth in rural America,\u201d American Farm Bureau President Zippy Duvall said in a statement. \nSource: AFBF", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities":

He is taking a controversial step but not going all the way\u2014taking a kind of halfway measure that fulfills a campaign promise but doesn\u2019t necessarily have immediate consequences. \nHe has become the first president since Israel\u2019s founding in 1948 to recognize Jerusalem as the capital, although other presidential candidates have talked about doing so. At the same time, he is signing a waiver to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv for another six months, and officials say it could take years to build an embassy in Jerusalem. \nTrump said this was just a recognition of reality and rightly noted that Congress voted to authorize moving the embassy during the Clinton administration, but it never happened. \nMuch of this is about the politics of symbolism, but the negative reaction in the Arab world, given Jerusalem\u2019s divided status, is all too real. Some people in Gaza City and Rafah yesterday took to the streets chanting \u201cDeath to America,\u201d\u201cDeath to Israel\u201d and \u201cDown with Trump.\u201d \nThe New York Times says Trump is \u201cupending nearly seven decades of American foreign policy and potentially destroying his efforts to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians.\u201d \nBut the president, perhaps out of diplomatic sensitivity, didn\u2019t immediately move the embassy. He could have ordered a sign placed on the existing U.S. consulate in Jerusalem, declaring it the new embassy. Instead, he gets to declare victory on an issue important to some American Jews and evangelical voters. \nThis split-the-difference approach is almost a replay of what Trump did with the Dreamers program. He had Jeff Sessions announce that the administration is ending the Obama-era decision to shield immigrants who were under 18 when their families brought them here illegally, but then granted a six-month extension. The move pleased immigration hard-liners, but Trump also said he wants to negotiate a new law with congressional Democrats that would permanently protect the dreamers. \nIn October, the president disavowed the Iran nuclear deal, but stopped short of killing the Obama agreement.

Everything. We don\u2019t have a place to live. We lost stuff we can\u2019t get back. Baby pictures. They were on a hard drive.\u201d \nShe said her husband, Hugo Romero-Rodriguez, was racked with guilt that he couldn\u2019t get inside the modest RV his family called home to rescue anything \u2014 including their beloved little dog, Coqueta. She was trapped in a crate inside when the vehicle erupted in flames. Romero-Rodriguez suffered cuts on his leg and hand and a burn on his arm trying to get to inside to save Coqueta. \n\u201cHe was sitting there in the driver\u2019s seat and he couldn\u2019t move,\u201d Romero-Sim said, recalling how she, her husband and their 9-year-old daughter, Milagros, sat in their truck, watching the RV burn before finally realizing they had to flee. \n\u201cHe just kept watching and he feels so guilty that he couldn\u2019t save it,\u201d she continued. \u201cI told him he did everything he could and he did what he had to save our lives.\u201d \nLisa Kermode and her family were immersed in similar anguish after returning to their home in the hills above Ventura on Tuesday to discover it had burned to the ground. They had barely escaped the flames the night before, leaving so quickly that Kermode\u2019s children had no time to change out of their pajamas. \n\u201cI was telling the boys, at the time the decision we made was to get out of here as fast as possible to keep ourselves safe,\u201d Kermode said. \u201cNow that we\u2019re back here, maybe we\u2019re thinking about some of the stuff we\u2019ve lost. \u2026 It really changes your perspective.\u201d \nFor Romer-Sim and her family the loss was particularly devastating. They lived in the RV they parked near Ventura\u2019s water purification plant in the hills just north of downtown. They couldn\u2019t move it because the starter had died and her husband had planned to replace it that day. \nRomero-Rodriguez makes a modest living as a jewelry salesman and he lost the pearls, earrings, bracelets and watches that made up his inventory. \nBut losing the 1-year-old snow-white teacup poodle the family called Coqueta (Spanish for flirt) was particularly painful. \n\u201cWe spoiled her. She had a slipper as a bed. It was a big pink slipper and it said \u2018Princess\u2019 and it had a crown in gold. And inside it was fuzzy. We would buy little baby clothes for her,\u201d Romer-Sim said while her husband visited with a counselor. \nFour major fires stretching from the edge of Los Angeles to the beachfront city of Ventura 60 miles (97 kilometers) north have prompted the evacuation of about 200,000 people and destroyed more than 150 homes. \nThe flames also prompted the evacuation of literally thousands of pets, not only dogs and cats but horses, goats, alpacas and other large livestock. \nThe edges of both Los Angeles and Ventura are dotted with horse-keeping properties, and when flames roared in people barely had time to get their animals to their own evacuation centers. \n\u201cWe\u2019re full, we\u2019ve taken in over 450 horses and four goats,\u201d Heidi Allyn, a stable assistant at the sprawling Los Angeles Equestrian Center, said Wednesday. \nSome people fled so quickly that they led their frightened horses down smoke-filled, traffic-choked streets. Allyn said a few horses suffered burns and were taken to a veterinary facility at the Ventura County Fairgrounds for treatment. \nNearly 30 horses didn\u2019t make it out of a ranch in Los Angeles\u2019 semi-rural Sunland-Tujunga area and died there. \nFirefighters will do what they can to help any animals separated from their owners, said Chris Harvey, a spokesman for the crews fighting the Ventura blaze. \nThey\u2019ll leave food out for dogs and cats that flee the flames on their own, hoping they\u2019ll return later looking for their owners. They also help large animals like horses when they can. \n\u201cSometimes they\u2019re able to feed livestock or try and call in to get them evacuated if they can do so without having to suspend their firefighting operations,\u201d he said. \n___", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "allyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lisa kermode", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heidi allyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milagros", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kermode", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "romer-sim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marolyn romero-sim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "romero-rodriguez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "romero-sim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hugo romero-rodriguez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "ventura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sunland-tujunga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles equestrian center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura county fairgrounds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:14.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d02af4b9b733b81dedb3770d6c8a47230897d017", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKOlPvBjFDQ95sRoSYpOQshhIG2oH9Om_5vXtZXXRe0w9iIYjn32NbfFwAYeQWbbDJHcXuHqfQKCzyCci0cWXGjS_tPYgnjIzToyLh_JFndgMjij4jl61sg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "popular links", "title": "Same Sex Marriage is now legal in Australia : worldnews", "title_full": "Same Sex Marriage is now legal in Australia : worldnews", "published": "2017-12-07T08:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 168, "participants_count": 115, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "57d778a3fd881cc6c6252a87d222069eac831469", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKOlPvBjFDQ95sRoSYpOQshhIG2oH9Om_5vXtZXXRe0w9iIYjn32NbfFwAYeQWbbDJHcXuHqfQKCzyCci0cWXGjS_tPYgnjIzToyLh_JFndhj5rWxCu52kTibsTuQSWYM80Z_0XUA.W0-", "ord_in_thread": 58, "author": "2tr7cc", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Congrats on LGBT .

Myles Turner had 11 points and blocked four shots, and Thaddeus Young finished with 10 points and nine rebounds. \nThe Pacers outscored the Bulls 29-13 in the fourth quarter. \n\u201cI was going out there and playing as hard as I could on both ends of the floor and trying to help us pull it out,\u201d Oladipo said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to learn to not put ourselves in that hole in the first place and try to make sure we avoid that. At the end of the day it was a big win for us and we can build on it.\u201d \nThe lowly Bulls led by as many as 17, but couldn\u2019t hold off the Pacers in the final moments. Oladipo\u2019s 3 gave Indiana its first lead at 97-96, and he tacked on a free throw with 12.8 seconds left. \nLauri Markkanen missed a potential game-winning 3-pointer in the final seconds of Chicago\u2019s 10th straight loss. \n\u201cThis one, it stings a lot,\u201d coach Fred Hoiberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really, really hard (loss) because we had control for the majority of it and played really good and hard unselfish basketball. The big message to our team is if we continue to play with that type of effort, if we continue to play the right way, and unselfish, we\u2019re going to start winning games.\u201d \nKris Dunn had 18 points, six rebounds and six assists for the Bulls (3-20), and Robin Lopez scored 16 points. Denzel Valentine finished with 15 points and eight boards. \nChicago looked pretty good for about 3 1/2 quarters. The Bulls went 7 for 15 from beyond the arc on their way to a 55-39 halftime lead. \nTurner said the Pacers didn\u2019t take the Bulls lightly. Instead, Indiana just got going late. \n\u201cWe just didn\u2019t come out as sharp as we\u2019ve been all season,\u201d Turner said. \u201cDefensively we had some lapses, offensive end we weren\u2019t hitting shots, I think we started settling. It was a flat start, but we recovered, thankfully.\u201d \nTIP-INS \nBulls: All three of Chicago\u2019s wins have come on Friday. \u2026 The Bulls went 8 for 16 at the free-throw line. \u2026 Chicago has lost nine of its last 11 games against the Pacers. \nPacers: Indiana\u2019s 39 points at halftime was a season low. \u2026 The Pacers improved to 4-8 this season when they are outrebounded. \nINSIDE THE NUMBERS \nThe Bulls, averaging a league-low 95.6 points entering Wednesday, held the Pacers to their second-lowest scoring total of the season. Indiana was averaging 108.9 points per game coming into the night, fourth-best in the NBA. \nOH, TO BE YOUNG \nYoung has scored in double figures in 20 of Indiana\u2019s 25 games this season, scoring 20 or more in two of those contests. The 10-year veteran is averaging nearly 33 minutes and 13.4 points per game. \nUP NEXT \nBulls: Play at Charlotte on Friday. \nPacers: Host Cleveland on Friday.

His decisive 3-pointer in the final minute over JaKarr Sampson came after James went to the bench during a timeout and told coach Tyronn Lue to run a play for him. \n\u201cWas going to run a different play and then Bron said, \u2018I want Chicago.\u2019 So I said, \u2018OK,'\u201d Lue said. \u201cWe got it to him and he made a big shot.\u201d \nAfter catching the inbounds pass, James took a dribble to his left and then stepped behind the line and knocked down his fifth 3-pointer. \n\u201cIt felt good,\u201d said James, who finished 12 of 18 from the floor. \u201cI was able to get the laces where I wanted them and I got enough space, I created enough space with the step-back away from JaKarr and I was able to let it go. It felt good the whole time.\u201d \nCleveland, which also won 13 straight in the 2008-09 and 2009-10 seasons, will try to break the team record Friday at Indiana. \nThis one wasn\u2019t easy. The Kings gave the Cavs everything they had, but couldn\u2019t contain James in the clutch. That\u2019s been the case for nearly every team that has faced the three-time champion, who is shooting with a confidence rarely seen in his career. \n\u201cHe\u2019s amazing,\u201d said Kyle Korver, who opened the fourth quarter with three straight 3-pointers to give Cleveland the lead. \u201cHe\u2019s just demanding the ball. He\u2019s like, \u2018Give me the ball, we\u2019re about to win.\u2019 And, I\u2019ve been around some guys who\u2019ve had amazing years. I\u2019ve been playing with him and Derrick (Rose) when he was MVP. Allen Iverson when I was young. \n\u201cBut he\u2019s taken this to a whole new level. It\u2019s amazing to have a better than a front-row seat, because I\u2019m usually on the court next to him somewhere. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s on my team.\u201d \nZach Randolph had 18 points and 10 rebounds and Buddy Hield added 17 points for the Kings. Sampson grabbed 16 rebounds in his first start this season. \nWhile Cleveland\u2019s win streak is impressive, James said he won\u2019t consider anything special until the Cavs nearly double it. \n\u201cTwenty-five,\u201d he said when asked where the streak needs to get to before becoming significant. \u201cBecause you\u2019re getting close to 33 (Lakers 1971-72), that\u2019s the all-time record. We ain\u2019t nowhere near close. We got close in Miami. We got to 27 and lost to Chicago.\u201d \nThanks to James and another Chicago, the Cavs roll on. \nROSE REFLECTS \nCavs guard Derrick Rose spoke to his teammates before the morning shootaround, two days after returning to the team from a self-imposed hiatus. Rose has been dealing with a sprained ankle and the 2011 NBA MVP\u2019s latest injury had him re-considering his future. \nLue didn\u2019t provide any specifics about Rose\u2019s comments, but said his teammates were glad to have him around again. \n\u201cIt was just good to have him back and hear him talk because he\u2019s not a big talker,\u201d Lue said. \u201cHe\u2019s a quiet guy. But just hearing what he had to say and then just seeing how everyone was welcoming him back and was happy he\u2019s here.\u201d \nSAMPSON START \nSampson, who was born in Cleveland and went to the same high school as James, didn\u2019t know he was starting until he arrived at the arena. Then he learned he was guarding James. \n\u201cI knew it was going to be a challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cI look at moments like this, it was fun. You want to make as few mistakes as possible, and make that guy work. LeBron\u2019s one of the best players in the league so you\u2019ve got to make everything tough on him. That\u2019s what I tried to do, but we came up short.\u201d \nTIP-INS \nKings: G Frank Mason scored a season-high 15. \u2026 C Willie Cauley-Stein (strained lower back) didn\u2019t play after getting hurt on Saturday against Milwaukee. Cauley-Stein is also expected to sit out Friday\u2019s game at New Orleans. \nCavaliers: F Tristan Thompson scrimmaged along with G Isaiah Thomas, who is nearing his debut with Cleveland after being sidelined with a hip injury. While it\u2019s still not clear when Thomas will play, Thompson, who has missed 17 games since Nov. 1 with a strained left calf, could be back in the floor in days. \u201cI\u2019ll be ready to return when the front office and them (the medical team) say I\u2019m ready to return,\u201d Thompson said, purposely being vague. \u201cI gotta stay in my lane like LaVar Ball said.\u201d\u2026 Cleveland has made at least 10 3-pointers in 13 straight games and scored at least 100 in 18 in a row. \nUP NEXT \nKings: Wrap up four-game trip at New Orleans on Friday. \nCavaliers: At Indiana on Friday.

He has worked briskly for domestic or overseas art fairs and collaborations with diverse companies including total 33 times private exhibitions. When we look close to his works, we can find the texture of wood and the shadow under the image of various colors. It's because works are not simply expressed on the flat canvas but created with stacked pieces of birch cut out delicately and deliberately just like putting the pieces of a puzzle together. In the continuous process of piling and painting the wood, he takes the memory to shelter the present and dream a future. \u200b\nGMADE KOREA INC\nwww.gmade.net\nPark Hyun Woong\n+\ngmade

Hence, their reliance on lies and propaganda. But people of Gujarat have made up their mind this time,\" Patel tweeted.\"Putting up fake posters and orchestrating a rumour campaign shows the utter desperation of the BJP. Fearing defeat, do they have to rely on such dirty tricks? I have never ever been a candidate for the CM and will never, ever be.\"He said the \"misinformation campaign by the BJP\" showed that they know they were going to lose Gujarat elections.Gujarat is considered to be the BJP's Hindutva lab where other parties are chary of projecting Muslim issues.

Las condiciones de vida n\u00f3mada de la poblaci\u00f3n Turkana, hacen que las ni\u00f1as sean especialmente sensibles al trueque por animales o al casamiento pactado de ni\u00f1as de no m\u00e1s de 12 a\u00f1os con hombres mayores a cambio de una dote en especie. Por ello, formar a las ni\u00f1as Turkanas para que sean mujeres independientes y acoger a aquellas que est\u00e1n en estado de abandono y educarlas, es una labor de futuro para mejorar el horizonte y la esperanza de vida de esta poblaci\u00f3n. \nTurkana is a district in the Northwest of Kenya, a semi-desert area, one of the poorest of the world. The population is mostly nomadic, and around half of it is under 18 years of age. The conditions of the nomadic life of the Turkanas, make the girl s  particularly sensitive to be traded for cattle or to arranged marriages as young as 12 years old to older men for a dowry. Therefore, educating the Turkana girls to be independent women, and to give shelter to those who have been abandoned and to educate them, is an investment in the future of this group. \n\nHace m\u00e1s de una d\u00e9cada, el Aula de Cooperaci\u00f3n de la Fundaci\u00f3n San Patricio empez\u00f3 a colaborar con la ONG Nuevos Caminos y los misioneros que trabajan en la zona para la construcci\u00f3n de un centro donde acoger y escolarizar a ni\u00f1as n\u00f3madas y hu\u00e9rfanas. \n\nFor over more than a decade, the San Patricio Foundation has been collaborating with the NGO Nuevos Caminos and the missionaries that work in the area to build a centre where they can take in and educate nomadic and orphan girls.  \n\nEste a\u00f1o, el Centro St. Patrick\u2019s est\u00e1 en una situaci\u00f3n apurada; debido a la gran sequ\u00eda que est\u00e1 padeciendo toda la regi\u00f3n, el pozo de agua del centro se ha secado, por lo que es urgente obtener fondos para la perforaci\u00f3n e instalaci\u00f3n de uno nuevo. \n\nThis year, St. Patrick in Turkana is in a difficult situation; due to the huge draught that is devastating the region, their well has dried up. They urgently need the funds to drill and build a new well. \n\nOs dejamos aqu\u00ed el enlace al v\u00eddeo de la Fundaci\u00f3n San Patricio donde pod\u00e9is conocer un poco m\u00e1s el pr oyecto y el centro. \n\nYou can see here the video (in Spanish) that the San Patricio Fundation has filmed to make the situation known, and where you can learn a bit more about the project and the centre. \n\nAs\u00ed que ya sab\u00e9is, os esperamos el d\u00eda 16 de 10:00 a 14:00 en la calle Jazm\u00edn 148 (El Soto de la Moraleja, Alcobendas). Puedes hacer de tus compras de Navidad algo m\u00e1s.

It's a 2-star hotel, but it's very clean. The staff is excellent, but not Velas Vallarta level. It's in a very noisy location just off the Malecon , but that didn't bother us much. Would we stay at Hotel Rio again? No, we'd rather pay more and stay at Garlands del Rio.\nAfter checking into our room, we went downstairs to Coexist Bistro. The service was wonderful, so we decided to have dinner there. Very good food and inexpensive. My salad and soup were tasty! After dinner, we went to Que?Pasa to hear Tequila Rush. They're a really great cover band.\nAfter a week with family, I was missing my girlfriends. I met up with a few of them for Sunday breakfast at River Caf\u00e9. In spite of feeling like I was cheating on Daiquiri Dick's , breakfast was delicious. I spent the afternoon reading, then we headed to Ambrosia Grill for dinner with friends. This located where Teatro Limon used to be. As we expected, the food was superb. My husband had prime rib and I had salmon, both excellent.\nOn our last day, we met up with a friend at Hacienda de la Carlota. This place is fabulous! I had crab enchiladas, he had a Molcajete Ranchero. Yum! For those of us who loved Nacho at Langostino's, he's here during the day and Casa Isabel at night. We had a few hours to kill, so decided to go to Incanto . We've come to love sitting on the river.\nOur flight home on Volaris was uneventful. Customs and Immigration couldn't have been easier. We'll be flying with them in May.\n2 attractions mentioned in this post 1 Malecon Ranked #8 of 164 things to do in Puerto Vallarta 422 Reviews 2 Incanto Ranked #5 of 14 Concerts & Shows in Puerto Vallarta 45 Reviews See all 2", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:17.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9f45a8e088972da035aa3e4f38b5e25c6dae0d18", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYNtGt1pOaY6WrUwIiGs2t4mjUkCJuFjZ.cUoq2jEnGWxZbHYIxqhsM__lD.nSdQCoAzhdiLQ9_3030xPXcHTIaw52gEAjwpKbmeF56B2VOGv4yjles0G0bA--", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.co.uk", "site": "tripadvisor.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowForum-g150768-i6-o20-Mexico.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Mexico Forum, Travel Discussion for Mexico - TripAdvisor", "title": "Trip report part four - Puerto Vallarta", "title_full": "Trip report part four - Puerto Vallarta Message Board - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-06T05:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1071, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "08d3ce684b8f9b5e89b5bffed470570e3be958d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYNtGt1pOaY6WrUwIiGs2t4mjUkCJuFjZ.cUoq2jEnGWxZbHYIxqhsM__lD.nSdQCoAzhdiLQ9_3030xPXcHTIaw52gEAjwpKbmeF56B2VOGvuxxMZgUL7uA--", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "Barry K", "published": "2017-12-07T08:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Spotcat, Thanks for the update!

I've never posted here before, mostly because I feel weird saying lo was a preemie when he was born at 36 weeks and not very early. But now I'm worried about his speech and wondering if maybe it's normal for babies born a month early.\nSo lo had a rough start with eating and weight gain. Once we got him on formula and he started gaining weight he started hitting his milestones mostly on schedule for his actual age. I don't think his ped has ever even used an adjusted age for him. We had his 12 month appointment earlier this week and she was concerned with his talking and said he's still barely in the normal range but right now he's \"at risk\". He babbles, mostly saying dadada all day but occasionally throws in a baba or random noise. When he's upset his babbling sometimes turns into mama but he doesn't seem to realize that we're mama and dada, they're just noises to him. He seems to have one word, the dogs name, and that's it. He sometimes will wave bye if we wave at him but it's very hit and miss. He doesn't point, but I think that's because when he wants something he gets up and gets it himself so he has no reason to point. The only words he seems to recognize are kitty and the dog's name.\nHe understands a lot of things. He knows that the remote controls the tv, he knows the tennis ball belongs to the dog, he knows when the dog barks it means daddy is home. He understands no and come here and his name. But he's not talking, he doesn't have names for us, he's not really communicating the way the ped said he should be at this age. I read to him every day, talk to him all day, point at things and call them by name. Is it normal for late preemies to be a little behind in their speech even if they're meeting everything on time? Is there something else I should be doing? I just worry that we're not doing what we should be doing for him.\nOh and I don't know if it matters, but my husband and I both had speech issues as children and were in speech therapy in elementary school. Thank you for reading all of this, I know it's long.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:17.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a952faf5f358d5ae6c0eb07eff660c1584089221", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6_8ATcbWgqoFEoFP0QO28OnjEntiYOUhnpeqRvQRChc7FZx_vZuEVERCR5njgC5QgJHhx0VjkAhL", "site_full": "community.babycenter.com", "site": "babycenter.com", "site_section": "http://community.babycenter.com/groups/a3605/preemie-parenting?scid=Android_MPBT_Referral&pg=2", "site_categories": ["pregnancy", "family_and_parenting"], "section_title": "Preemie Parenting - Page 2 - BabyCenter", "title": "36 weeker and speech?", "title_full": "36 weeker and speech? - BabyCenter", "published": "2017-11-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://imageserve.babycenter.com/8/000/149/fU9AD5hivDBpnOL46QkMk5DMYAtf4zh0_sm.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 891, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f4a416e476a3e533c4c174136db88ade8909a0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6_8ATcbWgqoFEoFP0QO28OnjEntiYOUhnpeqRvQRChc7FZx_vZuEVERCR5njgC5QgCYioOxyWctdTG1iXNlpP2k-", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "LacerSpacer", "published": "2017-11-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "He sounds like he's doing great to me. Kids really do all do things in their own time. If one aspect of development is lagging a little but all else is typical it really can be okay to wait and see. It's common for toddlers to focus on language OR motor skills and then swap. That said, there's absolutely no harm in contacting EI for a free eval if you're concerned. As PP (previous poster) said above, the wait can be months long.\nOne of my termies didn't have any words when he turned 18mo. He understood *everything* we said and signed a lot though, so we weren't concerned. He hit his language explosion between 18 and 19mo, and by the time he was 2 he talked in complete sentences with a vocabulary beyond counting. The wait-and-see approach worked fine for him.\nOTOH, my \"barely-preemie\" (35+6 weeker) also had 0 words at 18mo; however, he had already started speech therapy with EI at 16mo, when he had no words or signs, didn't wave, point, or clap, had stopped babbling, and seemed to understand almost nothing that was said to or around him. He was also behind in gross and fine motor and most other developmental categories. We were very concerned.

NBC News \nA few evenings ago I had a wonderful time as Rhonda. I have mentioned the Thursday evening gathering at the Colony\u2019s Polo Lounge before.  I have fallen into a regular group and am welcomed.  It is a fun evening.   \n\nHarvey provides an impromptu piano serenade, Charlie always has a big hug and many \"Islanders\", as the Palm Beach crowd refers to it self, welcome me with air kissed.     \nI always notice after being there, a calmness and sense or peace occurs. It carries over into the next day and always provided a smile and sense of satisfaction. I have referred to these escapes previously as my visits to the land of femininity. A place I enjoy and return to frequently. \nAccording to a study there are good reasons to smile and be happy. Science has shown that the mere act of smiling can lift your mood, lower stress, boost your immune system and possibly even prolong your life. \nHappiness is what makes us smile. The fact is, as Dr. Isha Gupta a neurologist from IGEA Brain and Spine explains, a smile spurs a chemical reaction in the brain, releasing certain hormones including dopamine and serotonin. \u201cDopamine increases our feelings of happiness. Serotonin release is associated with reduced stress. Low levels of serotonin are associated with (a lessening in) depression and aggression,\u201d says Dr. Gupta.  \n  \nYes, on these evenings I smiled a lot. I shared my happiness and hope I also engendered happiness; Happiness is intoxicating. Escapes are good for you and absolutely add to your sense of well-being. Just what the doctor ordered.     \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gupta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isha gupta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rhonda", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nbc news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "better health   a smile spurs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colony", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "palm beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "polo lounge", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:17.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a952faf5f358d5ae6c0eb07eff660c1584089221", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6_8ATcbWgqoFEoFP0QO28OnjEntiYOUhnpeqRvQRChc7FZx_vZuEVERCR5njgC5QgJHhx0VjkAhL", "site_full": "community.babycenter.com", "site": "babycenter.com", "site_section": "http://community.babycenter.com/groups/a3605/preemie-parenting?scid=Android_MPBT_Referral&pg=2", "site_categories": ["pregnancy", "family_and_parenting"], "section_title": "Preemie Parenting - Page 2 - BabyCenter", "title": "36 weeker and speech?", "title_full": "36 weeker and speech? - BabyCenter", "published": "2017-11-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://imageserve.babycenter.com/8/000/149/fU9AD5hivDBpnOL46QkMk5DMYAtf4zh0_sm.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 891, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e278f17a95078fbc2cf7642aafcbdba4b2dae9e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6_8ATcbWgqoFEoFP0QO28OnjEntiYOUhnpeqRvQRChc7FZx_vZuEVERCR5njgC5QgCYioOxyWctdxwWQu.5yKiU-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "AlisonAnnie", "published": "2017-11-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I would still see if you can access speech therapy through an intervention program- if you have any in your area.

You would think after 4 times the critiques would change knowing so much about the resort but I'm running out of words to use how wonderful it was and is. As I have said and others, the employees are a true asset to your enjoyment. rnrnCarolina, Guest Services Manager, was right out front in the lobby when we arrived to great us and also had a bottle of wine and canapes delivered to our room as return visitors. Freddy in the Lobster House/Grill at breakfast and lunch always gives us a big hug and welcome back. This is the first time in 3 years we came without friends and Lisbeth at the breakfast buffet on our very first morning, after giving her our room # and name, asked where our friends were. I was shocked that she would remember this after one year! Amazing for the amount of people she sees in 52 weeks. Enjoy all the food but Chez Isabelle is outstanding and so are the waiters, Antonio and Gustavo in particular (5 stars) and the Maitre 'd, all so friendly and classy. We ate there 5 times so tried just about everything on the menu and never left disappointed. Beach/pool waiter Floricel has changed his \"office\" 3 times in 3 years, 2 sections on the beach and now at the main pool, gave us a big smile, hola, and took the time from his busy day to ask how we have been. Our beach waitress, Rubi, couldn't have ran any faster to get us and everyone else whatever drinks were desired or info needed. Gwendolyn, concierge in Building 7, another big hug and made sure she knew what room we had in case we needed anything. Everyone smiles and greets you morning, noon and night. I think if the gardeners, painters, setup/take-down people had any time to run and give you a hug they would!rnrnSomething new this year from last is movies on the beach which is a very nice casual activity and touch. I haven't seen this except on a cruise ship by the pool. Entertainment every evening, inside or out and something for everyone (Michael Jackson, Jersey Boys, Broadway night, etc.) and White night, Mexican night (dining outdoors) that are incredibly beautiful and entertaining.rnrnOur rooms have been nothing but spotless and kudos to the housekeeping staff. On our last day, we received another bottle of champagne and chocolates in our room, one edible piece that said \"Come back soon\".
