Then we had so many ideas about what to wear and how to wear and what to do in the entire song. I\u2019m really looking forward to it,\u201d she added. \nShe is confident it will be exciting. \n\u201cI\u2019ve heard the song and it is fantastic. Plus, I feel garba is a great way to tone up and lose weight, so it is all working out for me. I have no complaints,\u201d said the actress, whose latest release was \u201cShaadi Mein Zaroor Aana\u201d. \nThe third instalment of the \u201cYamla Pagla Deewana\u201d franchise also features Dharmendra, Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol. \nIANS", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yamla pagla deewana", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kriti", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kharbanda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dharmendra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bobby deol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deol", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ians", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "navratri", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:46.037+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c4b699079a467633ca902272088f2378b8f524e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfN_foHjROD5Z9G9dDXhPGIzdcWRLyXYPZD35IAz00NJZMBMTsYhvqgAERDTETM_cr.hx4soP8hWMa_zkIVKnAWuKJxKbi0_d4k9k4gbwrIXlelcSoHFqRfNBPQEh1hCaJQ--", "site_full": "www.financialbuzz.com", "site": "financialbuzz.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "New Zealand Police Partner with SceneDoc for eNotes Proof-of-Concept - Financial Buzz", "title_full": "New Zealand Police Partner with SceneDoc for eNotes Proof-of-Concept - Financial Buzz", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.549, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c4b699079a467633ca902272088f2378b8f524e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfN_foHjROD5Z9G9dDXhPGIzdcWRLyXYPZD35IAz00NJZMBMTsYhvqgAERDTETM_cr.hx4soP8hWMa_zkIVKnAWuKJxKbi0_d4k9k4gbwrIXlelcSoHFqRfNBPQEh1hCaJQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nasdaq Live Feed", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "New Zealand Police Partner with SceneDoc for eNotes Proof-of-Concept - Financial Buzz", "text": "Tweet \nWellington, NZ, Dec. 07, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SceneDoc , public safety's trusted data collection platform, announces today a partnership with New Zealand Police to undertake a Proof of Concept (PoC) leveraging their commerical-off-the-shelf (COTS) eNotes application. \n\u201cNZ Police are exploring how we can use our current Police-issued iPhones to allow officers to collect and share their notes digitally,\u201d says Superintendent Rob Cochrane , Director of Mobility and Innovation. The Proof of Concept will run for a six-week period with a focus on learning and understanding what Police need from a notes application. The findings will inform future decisions for a digital notebook capability in an operational environment. \n\u201cIn an increasingly digital environment, Police mobility services are critical to the efficient and effective delivery of Police operational activities. The ability to capture and share notes digitally will extend the current functionality, as it will facilitate an electronic and centralized database of notebook entries to continue to support staff being \u2018more street than station\u2019,\u201d says Superintendent Cochrane. \nSceneDoc\u2019s mission is to redefine the role of mobile technology in public safety. \n\u201cWe are thrilled to be working with NZ Police on this initiative. NZ Police is regarded as one of the earliest adopters of mobile devices at enterprise scale, integrating mobile hardware and software as part of core police operations. It\u2019s a real honour to have the opportunity to collaborate with such pioneers,\u201d says company CEO, Alex Kottoor . \nSceneDoc was recently awarded the coveted \u201cMotorola Solutions Award for Public Safety Technology,\u201d named as a leading innovator of public safety solutions that helps build safer cities and thriving communities. \nAbout SceneDoc \nSceneDoc is public safety\u2019s trusted data collection platform. By modernizing with the SceneDoc Platform, agencies operate with higher levels of clarity and control, with fewer moving parts, capturing data and reporting at the point of need.

Here's salient part of pg 1. Investment Highlights Kerr Mines Inc. (company, Kerr) is advancing the fully permitted Copperstone project in Western Arizona, U.S. The project is a historic producer having produced 514 Koz of gold between 1987 and 1993. (Koz - thousand ounces) A feasibility study (FS) was completed in 2010, on a high-grade resource totaling 0.31 Moz (10.3 gpt) in the measured and indicated categories, and 0.13 Moz (12.2 gpt) in the inferred category. (Moz million ounces) Kerr has a brand-new management team and board. The Chairman and the CEO own 34.4% of the outstanding shares. The company commenced an aggressive drill program in August 2017 to upgrade and expand the 2010 resource estimate. Initial results (announced in October 2017), combined with historic drill results, resulted in a discovery of a zone parallel to the main Copperstone zone hosting the resource estimate. The company is also planning to acquire another 541 hectares of exploration permits located 1,200 m north east of the Copperstone zone. A preliminary feasibility study (PFS) is expected in Q1 2018. We expect a significantly robust PFS versus the 2010 FS primarily because of the potential for a significant increase in the resource estimate. Kerr is completing a $5 million financing by issuing 16.67 million shares at $0.30 per share. The company can also raise up to $7.56 million as all outstanding options and warrants are in the money.

Established in 2003, CPT has served as a hub for container shipping in the Southeast Asia region.\nThe launch of the third berth follows the CSP supplemental agreement signed with PSA on 18 March 2016, which replaced the original two berths in CPT located at Pasir Panjang Terminal 1 with three new and larger berths at Pasir Panjang Terminal 5. These agreements are timely as the importance of Singapore as a pivotal regional maritime hub grows in tandem with the advent of mega vessels and new alliances in the shipping industry.\nThe first two berths had earlier commenced operations on 1 January 2017, with an annual handling capacity of 2,000,000 TEU.\nOCEAN Alliance, of which COSCO Shipping is a major member, commenced operations on 1 April 2017. With the strategic reshuffle of shipping routes by OCEAN Alliance, throughput will continue to grow at Singapore\u2019s Port. With a view to meet the new requirements from shipping alliances and mega-vessels, as well as maximize the utilization rate of the berths, COSCO SHIPPING Ports has decided to commence operations at the third berth on 1 January 2018. This will subsequently increase the handling capacity of CPT to 3,000,000 TEU annually. The new berth, like the first two berths, will be supported by an automated yard, allowing for more efficient berthing arrangements, enabling the terminal to increase productivity and greatly enhance its service capability and quality.\nThe cooperation will further deepen the collaboration between CSP and PSA, enabling the two companies to seize the opportunities of globalization and further strengthen the role of the Singapore Port as a global container transshipment hub, reinforcing the shipping links between China and countries in Southeast Asia.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cpt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cosco shipping ports", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "psa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "psa corporation limited", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cosco shipping", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "csp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cosco shipping ports limited", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ocean alliance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pasir panjang terminal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "southeast asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore port", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:48.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fac124cd39fedbffab220eddfe5d31d9d734e941", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS.QoosTPRCPD.W1Hj8i6AZI-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fac124cd39fedbffab220eddfe5d31d9d734e941", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS.QoosTPRCPD.W1Hj8i6AZI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": " Checkout.configure({\r\n                merchant: 'TESTE12834950',\r\n                order: {\r\n                    amount: function() {\r\n                        //Dynamic calculation of amount\r\n                        return 80 + 20;\r\n                    },\r\n                    currency: 'BHD',\r\n                    description: 'Ordered goods',\r\n                   id: '22'\r\n                },\r\n                interaction: {\r\n                    merchant: {\r\n                        name: 'Gifted',\r\n                        address: {\r\n                            line1: 'Manama',\r\n                            line2: 'MAnama'            \r\n                        }    \r\n                    }\r\n                                                                }\r\n            });", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "manama", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:48.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "652f7988714b1b8db9259e77a2af061e96608c12", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTTmvX9ao5UiBnCQSONSgKO8WtXfzJGJqDony9L2367.V8zxvHG_dC.a_kGg0wPFsBNFyw5v1zcRumpc5LK.NBeG7G0wZZHg4Jju.UItVRAGQ--", "site_full": "pittsburgh.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "", "title": "Large Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle 4ft tall - toys & games - by owner - sale", "title_full": "Large Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle 4ft tall - toys & games - by owner - sale", "published": "2017-12-07T10:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.669, "main_image": "https://images.craigslist.org/00202_hOYdg7WTm0m_600x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "652f7988714b1b8db9259e77a2af061e96608c12", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTTmvX9ao5UiBnCQSONSgKO8WtXfzJGJqDony9L2367.V8zxvHG_dC.a_kGg0wPFsBNFyw5v1zcRumpc5LK.NBeG7G0wZZHg4Jju.UItVRAGQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "Large Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle 4ft tall - toys & games - by owner - sale", "text": "size / dimensions: 4ft tall QR Code Link to This Post Large mutant turtle, stands 4ft tall , has lighted blinking eyes with a flick of a switch.

We have been here for over 22 years. The three R&D centres in India work on several cutting-edge technologies,\u201d Samsung Global SVP and MD of Samsung R&D Institute India, Bengaluru Dipesh Shah told. \nHe added that the India centres not only work on innovation for Indian consumers but also contribute to global products. \nSome of the India-centric features developed by the local teams include S-bike mode and Ultra Data Saving mode for smartphones and ActivWash+ for washing machines. \n\u201cSamsung R&D centres in India have worked on several global products of Samsung, including the high-end camera modules for flagship smartphones, intelligent interface Bixby that was launched with Galaxy S8 and Samsung Pay,\u201d Shah said. \nLast year, the Korean company had hired 800 engineers for its R&D facilities, out of which 300 were from IITs. \nSamsung has three R&D centres in India at Bengaluru (largest outside Korea), Noida and Delhi. Globally, it has a total of 32 R&D centres. \nWhile the Bengaluru centre has expertise in areas like AI, ML and IoT, the Noida facility plays key role in development of biometrics, mobile software development, multimedia and data security. \nThe Delhi centre works primarily on research related to high-end televisions, other consumer electronics products as well as Samsungs operating system, Tizen. \n(PTI)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "samsu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bengaluru dipesh shah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bixby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tizen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "delhi college of engineering", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung r&d institute india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manipal institute of technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ultra data saving", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung global svp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bengaluru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:48.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "225232edefeb6f4860476f89dc3f17ce7702023d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbf3W9BeZb3QvyDblK6bY1hOY2dW.N4SJpdnFtkAiUp.QKbVu9q.3qbD5ICRJmU_kaoA0lQfRXw_NoBiLdIewHEW.wcZsZRQXX6fo2HaZvbqA", "site_full": "www.expedia.ca", "site": "expedia.ca", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.ca/Lysa-Nad-Labem-Hotels.d6198195.Travel-Guide-Hotels", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Top 10 Lysa nad Labem Hotels: Cheap Hotel Deals from C$36 | Expedia.ca", "title": "Art Deco Imperial Hotel:", "title_full": "Art Deco Imperial Hotel: 2017 Pictures, Reviews, Prices & Deals | Expedia.ca", "published": "2017-09-06T00:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.442, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6618, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0bb2cbc809241bf579441f37d2918603fef4f243", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbf3W9BeZb3QvyDblK6bY1hOY2dW.N4SJpdnFtkAiUp.QKbVu9q.3qbD5ICRJmU_kaoA0lQfRXw_NoBiLdIewHEW.wcZsZRQXXwVgj7ajxkRWbHdQnxRAYQwpTiKkbRTuCxuWWR2fqRG1LCyoRriUgDU-", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-04T14:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Flott hotell i n\u00e6rhet til det meste av severdigheter!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 5.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:48.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "131e2d3e143f1eda6c340d1ea70f1f7c49eabe2b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/FYJ2xGwtw8FKI7xLIyH0ldK9tvUFe8BjDRdcgituov3SJhn0q_aupJbeGCUuti41aFJ1YEZlPreS7EPd09zcqvf1qiXggHXPoYG81eJymL0-", "site_full": "ytdailyupload.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://ytdailyupload.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Youtube daily", "title": "Youtube daily Dec 7 2017", "title_full": "Youtube daily Dec 7 2017", "published": "2017-12-07T12:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "131e2d3e143f1eda6c340d1ea70f1f7c49eabe2b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/FYJ2xGwtw8FKI7xLIyH0ldK9tvUFe8BjDRdcgituov3SJhn0q_aupJbeGCUuti41aFJ1YEZlPreS7EPd09zcqvf1qiXggHXPoYG81eJymL0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anh \u0110\u1ee9c Ph\u1ea1m (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "Youtube daily Dec 7 2017", "text": "Curious about the red flavor, honey\nThe strawberry flavor that melts more as you bite\nLook for it at your corner candy shop, baby\nMy favorite is the summer flavor\nWhere are you?

found in the minds of racing drivers, according to Ford's latest investigation.\n\n\n\nUsing EEG (electroencephalography) headsets on a number of our professional drivers \u2013 including five-time FIA World Rally Championship winner S\u00e9bastien Ogier and three-time FIA World Touring Car Championship winner Andy Priaulx \u2013 we monitored the brain activity that deals with focus as they took on a racing simulator.\n\nWe then took some everyday drivers and did the same, which proved racing drivers minds were far more capable at dealing with the stresses involved.\n\n\n\nHowever, with simple breathing and meditation exercises, plus a visualisation technique that uses keywords to describe the task ahead, the everyday drivers repeated the test\u2026 and improved their focus and performance by as much as 50 per cent, almost on a par with the pros.\n\nBased on the research, we\u2019re now developing an EEG-equipped racing helmet for our pro drivers, where brain activity data can be transmitted back to the team during a race alongside other in-car car telemetry. Understanding a driver\u2019s mental state might just be the next frontier in performance.\n\n\nSo next time you\u2019re faced with a tough interview or an important presentation, just get into the mindset of a racing driver and you\u2019ll be winning at life.\n\n\nMore performance stories , more tech stories , or see lifestyle stories \nFollow @FordEU ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle":

My room on floor six was brilliant, the Samsung TV was able to charge my phone via the USB input, as well as play back the movies I brought along on an external flash drive. My ipod nano also worked without issues when connected. The writing bureau desk with complimentary stationery and pen was a nice touch. The room was fully stocked with everything you need, safe, iron + board, shoe horn, sewing kit, shoeshine sponge (but has proper shoe polisher station located by lift) hairdryer, extendable mirror, wonderful shower/bath set up with range of high end complimentary gel, shampoo, cap, moisturiser, nail file, cotton buds, face cleaning pads, marble deco, towels, face cloths,slippers.

We present and validate a method to synthesise GTV data from the iGTV, allowing the combination of 3D and 4D planned patient cohorts for modelling.Material and methodsExpert delineations in 40 non-small cell lung cancer patients were used to develop linear fit and erosion methods to synthesise the GTV volume and shape. Quality was assessed using Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) and closest point measurements; by calculating dosimetric features; and by assessing the quality of random forest models built on patient populations with and without synthetic GTVs.ResultsVolume estimates were within the magnitudes of inter-observer delineation variability. Shape comparisons produced mean DSCs of 0.8817 and 0.8584 for upper and lower lobe cases, respectively. A model trained on combined true and synthetic data performed significantly better than models trained on GTV alone, or combined GTV and iGTV data.ConclusionsAccurate synthesis of GTV size from the iGTV permits the combination of lung cancer patient cohorts, facilitating machine learning applications in thoracic radiotherapy.\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2nGMI0H", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cori", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gareth price", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andre dekker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corinne faivre-finn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan khalifa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dsc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herk background", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gtv", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:49.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "320e74d7bb31c4fc9b30301c5d1bdcd21c926f41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJVdt3nInyIfq4arLpsqhi0pX885HziuCHx9aTXz6Ft0FCqO3iKwBYAxay1OM_5JxYydkjkLIPAa3QzXMFVQ0QbkorG3YFAUXP_lOvfZm7EgAo3pTb8AOVfK", "site_full": "newsfenster.de", "site": "newsfenster.de", "site_section": "http://newsfenster.de/rssfeed.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Presse/News Portal - newsfenster.de - Newsfeed", "title": "Der Tod der Rose - Erinnerungen an eine einzigartige Liebe", "title_full": "Der Tod der Rose - Erinnerungen an eine einzigartige Liebe", "published": "2017-12-07T10:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://newsfenster.de/style/default/img/fb-logo-mini.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "320e74d7bb31c4fc9b30301c5d1bdcd21c926f41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJVdt3nInyIfq4arLpsqhi0pX885HziuCHx9aTXz6Ft0FCqO3iKwBYAxay1OM_5JxYydkjkLIPAa3QzXMFVQ0QbkorG3YFAUXP_lOvfZm7EgAo3pTb8AOVfK", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Der Tod der Rose - Erinnerungen an eine einzigartige Liebe", "text": "07.12.2017 | Kunst & Kultur | geschrieben von Frau Nadine Otto\u00b9   Der Tod der Rose - Erinnerungen an eine einzigartige Liebe Nach dem Tod seiner Frau Rose findet ein Mann ihr Tagebuch. Darin hat sie ihre Gedanken und Gef\u00fchle in einer poetische und bewegenden Sprache zu Papier brachte. Ihren Namen verdankt sie der K\u00f6nigin der Blumen. M\u00e4nner spielten in ihrem Leben eine wichtige Rolle. Ihr Angetrauter, ein gewisser Casanova, entt\u00e4uscht sie bald und die Suche nach einem Mann, mit dem sie wirklich gl\u00fccklich werden kann, beginnt - und steht unter guten Zeichen. Als Rose die Liebe ihres Lebens findet, befinden sich beide bereits in der Mitte des Lebens. Das Paar verbringt dennoch 30 wunderbare Jahre zusammen, bis ein altes Lungenemphysem ihr peu \u00e0 peu die Luft zum Atmen nimmt. Noch in der Klinik nimmt sie sich die Zeit, ihre Erinnerungen zu dokumentieren. Alles, was Rose zuvor erlebt, k\u00f6nnen die Leser in \"Der Tod der Rose\" von Otto W. Bringer nachlesen. Rose teilt ihre Erlebnisse, ihre Gef\u00fchle und wie sie all diese Vorg\u00e4nge und Erlebnisse in ihr eigenes Weltbild einordnet. Das Ergebnis sind mehrere hundert Seiten voller interessanter Augenblicke. \"Ich liebe dich\" sind ihre letzten Worte. Ihrem Mann verdanken wir dieses poetische und tief bewegende Buch. Eine wahrhafte Hommage an die Liebe. Ein Gl\u00fcck f\u00fcr alle, die lieben und geliebt werden, dass Otto W. Bringer es nach dem Tod seiner Frau fand. \"Der Tod der Rose\" von Otto W.

These would, however, still be issued by the Centre for its part of the GST and States for their portion. This arrangement would also be streamlined soon, said Hasmukh Adhia, Finance Secretary. The GST Council had earlier decided that Central Officers will have 10 per cent of assessees and the States the other 90 per cent for taxpayers with annual turnover up to Rs 1.5 crore.\nOver this threshold, assessees would be divided equally between the Centre and States. On that basis, the Centre and 20 States have worked out their jurisdictions, also covering refund issue to exporters.\nAdhia added that delay in refunds arose because some exporters were not filing accurate data in their returns. He says they\u2019re filing for more claims than the taxes they paid, leading to a mismatch. A little over 10,000 assessees had given their returns for input tax credit since the launch a fortnight earlier.\nThe Government, contended, had been very sensitive on exporter concerns. A package had been approved by the GST Council to resolve the problem of blocked working capital.\nInput tax credit and Integrated GST refunds for exporters are being expedited. He explained in detail the process and procedure for refund of exporter claims.\nA Central Board of Excise and Customs official disputed the charge that Rs 50,000 crore of exporters\u2019 GST refunds were stuck. Every paisa would be refunded, he said.\nGST, said Adhia, who\u2019s also Revenue Secretary, is appreciated by one and all as a game changer. This also means that those gaming the system by evading taxes will have to change.\nReferring to the earlier system, Adhia said exporters had to wait for long to get refunds of State-level value added tax. In some States, this could take two years. Some of the levies, such as octroi in Maharashta, were not refundable, he said, to claim his point that GST was much friendlier to exporters than the earlier system.

Wo diese ist und warum sie sich nicht um ihre Kinder sorgt, ist zu Beginn nicht klar. Die Geschichte des radelnden Mannes ist eine Geschichte des Suchens - und vielleicht des Findens. In anderen Geschichten der Sammlung geht es um einen Vorsitzenden eines Chemiekonzerns, der seine Jugendliebe wiederfindet, um eine ehemalige Schauspielerin, die auf einen fr\u00fchen Geliebten trifft, um einen verr\u00fcckten Musiker, der in seiner Vergangenheit nach Frieden sucht und um viele weitere menschliche Schicksale. Allen Protagonisten ist eines gemein: Sie sind auf die eine oder andere Weise auf der Suche, sei es nach Liebe, einem reines Gewissen, Freiheit von einem reichen Ehemann oder Rache an einer verhassten Welt ... Die Texte in \"Schwarzer November\" von Semjon Volkov werfen die Leser in medias res in ein tiefsinniges Geschichtenkaleidoskop. Im Mittelpunkt der facettenreichen Erz\u00e4hlungen stehen die gro\u00dfen Themen des Lebens, Liebe, Tod, die Zeit, Demut und Vergebung. Volkov entf\u00fchrt seine Leser auf eine intensive Reise, die alle Schattierungen des Lebens wiedergibt. \"Schwarzer November\" von Semjon Volkov ist ab sofort im tredition Verlag oder alternativ unter der ISBN 978-3-7323-5127-5 zu bestellen.

The hospital reported him to be a case of HIV+. \nAhmad had applied for a job in Dubai and the test was part of his fitness requirement.

(AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky) prev next comments KHARKIV, Ukraine \u2014 Shakhtar Donetsk advanced to the knockout stage of the Champions League with a 2-1 victory over Manchester City on Wednesday, prompting the Ukrainian club's coach to attend his news conference dressed as Zorro.\nPaulo Fonseca appeared in a black hat, cape and mask after his team had ended the English club's unbeaten record in all competitions this season.\nHe was fulfilling a promise he'd made to dress up as the fictional vigilante if Shakhtar qualified from a group containing favorites City and Napoli.\n\"This is the most joyful press conference of my career,\" Fonseca told reporters.\n\"I feel great joy. I think not only Shakhtar's supporters but all Ukrainians have to be proud of our team. Twelve points in such a group is fantastic.\"\nIn freezing temperatures against a Shakhtar team that only needed a draw to be sure of qualifying, City struggled to cope with rapid counterattacks by the Ukrainian side's Brazilian forwards.\nDefeat means City, which had already qualified as Group F winner, failed to become only the seventh club in Champions League history to win every game in the group stage.\n\"We lose a game, it's part of our profession,\" City coach Pep Guardiola said. \"You cannot expect and all the season I've said many times, we are not going to win all the games... We are going to lose games, today was the first.\"\nWith one eye on Sunday's Manchester derby, Guardiola gave starts to youngsters Phil Foden on the left and Tosin Adarabioyo in the center of defense.\nShakhtar started aggressively and took the lead in the 26th minute when Bernard cut in from the left side of the box and curled a shot inside the far post, beyond the reach of goalkeeper Ederson.\nEight minutes later, Ederson was left helpless in a different way for Shakhtar's second goal as Marlos passed into space behind the City defense. Ismaily, already in behind right-back Danilo, sprinted to beat Ederson to the ball before rounding the keeper and stroking a shot into the unguarded net.\nCity earned a consolation goal in added time when Sergio Aguero scored from the penalty spot after Bogdan Butko brought down Gabriel Jesus.\nIt was City's first competitive loss since being beaten by Arsenal in an FA Cup semifinal in April. City had been unbeaten in 28 games since then, 22 of them this season.\nFeyenoord beat third-place Napoli 2-1 in Wednesday's other game in Group F.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zorro", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "marlos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernardo silva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paulo fonseca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bogdan butko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danilo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ederson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gabriel jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tosin adarabioyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fonseca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shakhtar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sergio aguero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phil foden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pep guardiola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guardiola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taras stepanenko", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "man city associated press", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "man city shakhtar", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "associated press shakhtar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arsenal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press manchester city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shakhtar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "napoli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "feyenoord", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kharkiv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metalist stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukraine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "napoli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kharkiv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shakhtar donetsk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:50.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9a10fc326509b0345a61f8315a7b9517a5624fa6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9P7lfk7pK26FiXHirbs5kKiai1trbPRuMyprtuI4eBcL0trKk5Xf8DFGpoQx92Qt8KFX4ZOf2kJ9Wc_Vtfyj0SSug5XgufulIUlE14Y0jhiGY73cDnR0RMwp.IUo4RGTs-", "site_full": "www.nasdaq.com", "site": "nasdaq.com", "site_section": "http://www.nasdaq.com/", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Nasdaq Stock Market | Stock Quotes &amp; Stock Exchange News", "title": "Validea Peter Lynch Strategy Daily Upgrade Report - 12/7/2017", "title_full": "Validea Peter Lynch Strategy Daily Upgrade Report - 12/7/2017 - Nasdaq.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "http://www.nasdaq.com/images/dreamit.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2975, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9a10fc326509b0345a61f8315a7b9517a5624fa6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9P7lfk7pK26FiXHirbs5kKiai1trbPRuMyprtuI4eBcL0trKk5Xf8DFGpoQx92Qt8KFX4ZOf2kJ9Wc_Vtfyj0SSug5XgufulIUlE14Y0jhiGY73cDnR0RMwp.IUo4RGTs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Validea", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Validea Peter Lynch Strategy Daily Upgrade Report - 12/7/2017", "text": "Shutterstock photo The following are today's upgrades for Validea's P/E/Growth Investor model based on the published strategy of Peter Lynch.

Lynch's common sense approach and quick wit made him one of the most Quote: d investors on Wall Street. (\"Go for a business that any idiot can run -- because sooner or later, any idiot probably is going to run it,\" is one of his many pearls of wisdom.)

Were you inclined to reject it out of hand as mere headline click-bait? Or did it make you think about that big client from whom you get most of your origination credit and your firm gets so many billable hours? Have you ever thought about Fortune 500 companies failing? That\u2019s rare, isn\u2019t it? \nNot really. \nWhen lawyers think about losing clients, they think primarily of being displaced by another law firm or, these days, by technolog y, in-sourcing, an alternative service provider \u2013 or even having the relationship partner take the client with her to another firm. The assumption is that the client will still be buying legal services but from someone else.\nWhat If That Big Client Was No Longer Buying From Anyone? In March 2016, Sports Authority, the national sporting goods retailer that, at its peak, had $3.5 billion annual sales and made Forbes magazine\u2019s list of America\u2019s Largest Private Companies , filed for bankruptcy. Afterward, its email marketing shifted from promoting famous brands to announcing a fire-sale of their remaining inventory. The last email I received, in mid-June that year, wasn\u2019t about merchandise at all, but instead offered its stores\u2019 fixtures for sale.\nWhen they start selling the fixtures, it\u2019s definitely over. By August, the last of Sports Authority\u2019s remaining 450 stores had gone dark, and the last of its once-16,000 employees hit the unemployment office. \nThe pain and loss aren\u2019t limited to Sports Authority and its employees. It affects suppliers, too. While a behemoth like Under Armour says the retailer\u2019s death will \u201cknock a few million off 2016 profits,\u201d many smaller suppliers will be hurt significantly, and some may be in danger of failing entirely.\nLaw Firms Are Suppliers Set aside the bankruptcy firms for whom Sports Authority\u2019s demise was a windfall. What of the other outside counsel who won\u2019t get paid for the work they had already done on employment, contracts, intellectual property, tax and litigation? And the lawyers who must replace that future business? \nIn a Working Capital Review article, \u201c Sports Authority\u2019s Bankruptcy a Reminder to Ratchet Up Your Company\u2019s Robustness ,\u201d the Boston Consulting Group cautions that \u201cSports Authority\u2019s fall reflects a wider phenomenon. The mortality rates of companies \u2014 across all industries \u2014 have increased significantly. Our analysis of entry, growth, and exit patterns for 35,000 publicly listed US companies since 1950 revealed a dramatic trend.\u201d\nPublic companies are perishing sooner, with few surviving into their 50s and 60s. The five-year exit risk stands at 32 percent today \u2014 up from just 5 percent 50 years ago. Increased mortality affects companies of all ages, in all industries. Size provides no refuge either: Only 7 percent of companies that are market share leaders today are also profit leaders in their industries \u2014 down from 25 percent in the 1960s. Steven Denning pointed out a few years ago in Forbes that 50 years ago, the life expectancy of a firm in the Fortune 500 was around 75 years. Today, it\u2019s less than 15 years and declining all the time. That\u2019s less time than it takes a lawyer to make partner and establish himself as a reliable business generator. \nOnly 12.2 percent of the Fortune 500 companies in 1955 were still on the list 59 years later, in 2014, and almost 88 percent of the companies from 1955 have either gone bankrupt, merged, or still exist but have fallen out of the Fortune 500 (ranked by total revenues). \nThe Big Company Failure Trend Will Continue The Boston Consulting Group article continues, \u201cRising mortality among businesses is an increasing threat, and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future. Leaders need to consider not only how strong their game is, but how long it will last.\u201d\nThese are Fortune 500 companies, not mom-and-pop stores or start-ups.\nFast-growing companies fare no better. The Kauffman Foundation and Inc. Magazine conducted a follow-up study of companies five to eight years after they had appeared on the magazine\u2019s list of the 5,000 fastest-growing companies. What they found was startling: About two-thirds of the companies that made the list had shrunk in size, gone out of business or been disadvantageously sold.\nLessons for Lawyers What can law firms learn from this trend? A few things:\nDon\u2019t allow your revenue to be overconcentrated in any company, and overdependent on their financial health. Be careful about drinking the Kool-Aid that \u201cit\u2019s easier to get more work from an existing client than to get a new one.\u201d It may be easier, but after a certain degree of concentration, is it wise? \u201c[T]he importance of the repeat client is central since the number of potential corporate clients is severely limited. What this means is that corporate lawyers depend on a relatively small client base for a large portion of their incomes.\u201d \n\u2013 Lawyers at Work by Herbert M. Kritzer \nFollow your client\u2019s industry news, so you\u2019ll be alert to the competitive, political or other macroeconomic forces that threaten their financial health. (On the positive side, this is also how you\u2019re alerted early to emerging demand and non-competitive sales opportunities.) Market to an industry, not a company. Diversify your client base by cultivating an entire industry, not merely one company within it. Sports Authority\u2019s $3.5 billion revenue, while impressive, was only 5.5 percent of the United States sporting goods industry\u2019s revenue. Industries never go away. The Boston Consulting Group\u2019s data says that a significant percentage of companies not only can go away but, over enough time, will. Bill and collect promptly. Everyone scrambles in December and January to collect outstanding receivables. This is reliable evidence that you haven\u2019t been collecting timely all year. Promptly collecting is necessary to optimize cash flow (the stuff they pay your salary or draw with), but also to reduce risk. Better to have a failing company stiff you only for this month\u2019s work, not three or four months\u2019 worth. When Management Pressures You to Bill and Collect, Take It Seriously \nAccording to Dun and Bradstreet Credibility Corp., which specializes in business credit, \u201cThe greatest risk to working capital and company cash flow is deferred billing.\u201d\nD&B advises, \u201cIn service businesses, make sure to bill for work as soon as the job is completed. Establish a disciplined billing system so that all invoices are sent promptly with clear payment terms. Keep track of all invoices and payments. While this sounds like elementary advice, the busy [lawyer] may become so engrossed in work that actual billing of clients is not prioritized. Failure to maintain discipline in billing affects your cash-conversion cycle and the viability of the business.\u201d\nIn business, there\u2019s no such thing as stasis. Your clients are either getting stronger or weaker, growing or shrinking. You need to know which it is, and how it\u2019s trending.\nMore Than a Google Alert To protect yourself and your firm, resolve today to:\nStrengthen your understanding of how business works, generally, so that you can read, understand and interpret the business news more usefully; Pay attention to the business world at large, and the macro forces that shape it; and Pay particular attention to the waxing and waning fortunes of your clients. Many of you have set up Google alerts to tell you when your clients are in the news. That\u2019s fine, but by the time there\u2019s bad news about your client\u2019s company, it\u2019s too late. Add alerts about your clients\u2019 industries and follow those closely. The industry will be talking about the forces that affect your client long before anybody will be talking about your client specifically.\nRelated: \u201c2017 What\u2019s Hot and What\u2019s Not in the Legal Profession\u201d \nMike O\u2019Horo i s a serial innovator in lawyer training .

Renting: Which Is Better For You?", "text": "Thursday Owning VS. Renting: Which Is Better For You? It\u2019s quite common to get frustrated when renting. After all, you\u2019re paying often expensive rent each month, sometimes even putting work into the property, and while it does cover your accommodation, once you move out you\u2019ve got nothing to show for it. If you own your home however, your monthly mortgage payments are similar to paying rent except they are going directly towards your own home: your own investment. Once you own your home outright, it\u2019s a huge asset, especially in a city with such a high and competitive real estate market. Many people, if financially able, would choose owning a home as the money they put into accommodation goes directly into the property, their own investment. There are, however, considerations to take into account whether renting or owning. Depending on your lifestyle, owning may not be right for you even if you do have the cash for a down payment.In this article, we\u2019ll take a quick look at some of the pros and cons of owning versus renting. Owning Advantages to owning a home include: Owning a home gives you a sense of stability and of ownership. Many people grow up imagining they will one day own property. If you want to settle and start a family, owning a home can give you the stability to do so. Buying a house is likely the largest purchase you will ever make. While it takes time to pay off a mortgage, a home is a good investment, one which you can also keep in the family should you choose. If you own, you have more freedom when it comes to renovations and home improvements. No more dealing with potentially difficult landlords. There are certain tax deductions you can make as a homeowner, such as deductions on property tax and on interest paid.Potential disadvantages include: You will have to spend more money. Even though your mortgage payments may be the same or less than paying rent, there are still considerable expenses, especially in the first few years of home ownership. This can include such expenses as utilities, insurance, and property tax. Make sure you fully understand the expenses before you buy. A mortgage broker can help advise you in that regard. Having a mortgage and owning a home is a big commitment, both financially and timewise. If you plan on moving around or travelling a lot, homeownership may not be right for you. Renting Advantages of renting property include: Renting can give you more flexibility. Usually after a year long lease, leases change to month-to-month which can give you the flexibility you need if you are unsure of your future living situation. As a renter, you will not have to pay for many repairs as those fall under the responsibility of the landlord. Rent is often cheaper than a mortgage, and you don\u2019t pay property tax.While disadvantages include: You must obey the landlord\u2019s rules, which may, for instance, forbid pets. There are limitations on the appearance of the home and home decor. Zero return on your investment. If you are considering making the move from renting to owning, consult a mortgage broker today. A mortgage broker can help you understand the market and assess your financial situation to help you determine if owning is right for you.

We have become accustomed to websites and mobile apps working instantly. If I click on a search result from Google and it doesn\u2019t load within a couple seconds, I will no doubt just click on a different result. We have all been trained to expect websites to load blazingly fast. \nWe all know that the performance of our software is important! \nWe also know that performance optimization can be very time consuming and potentially expensive. We also know that premature optimization is a bad thing. \nWeb performance optimization is a never-ending job. In this article we will review some of the top server and client-side performance issues and how to resolve them. What is web performance optimization? \nWeb performance optimization occurs by monitoring and analyzing the performance of your web application and identifying ways to improve it. \nWeb applications are a mixture of server-side and client-side code. Your application can have performance problems on either side and both need to be optimized. \nThe client side relates to performance as seen within the web browser. This includes initial page load time, downloading all of the resources, JavaScript that runs in the browser, and more. \nThe server side relates to how long it takes to run on the server to execute requests. Optimizing the performance on the server generally revolves around optimizing things like database queries and other application dependencies. \nLet\u2019s take a deeper look at how to optimize performance for both the client and server sides. Optimizing client performance \nClient performance typically revolves around reducing the overall size of web pages. This includes the size of the files and perhaps more importantly, the number of them. \nIt is common these days for a single web page to load 100+ files. You can quickly see this via your web browser with the dev tools. For Google Chrome, hit F12 (on Windows), go to the Network tab and then reload a page on your site. \nFor example, here is what it looks like for the home page of CNN . \nAs you can see, it took 11.04 seconds to download 188 files to load the page. Yikes! \nThis gives you a basic understanding of how long it takes and how many files are being downloaded. Your goal is to optimize both of these. \nHere are some of the top strategies to optimize performance on the client side 1. Caching & content delivery networks \nOne of the smartest things you can do is leverage a content delivery network (CDN). Many of the files on your website, like JavaScript, CSS, and image files, are static and do not change. \nYou can increase the performance of your website by caching these files on servers closer to where your users are. This offloads the traffic from your servers and makes your site load faster. \nI highly recommend Cloudflare for this. It is extremely simple to setup and just works. 2. Bundle & minification \nOne of the most important things you want you to do is bundle your files together so there are fewer files. You can also optimize their contents to shrink the file size down through various minification techniques. \nUnfortunately, bundling and minification typically require code changes to accomplish. \nThe Cloudflare content delivery network offers a feature called Rocket Loader that can automatically combine your JavaScript for you. I have also used a WordPress plugin called Fast Velocity that is also pretty awesome. 3. Optimizing image usage \nI struggle with this problem a lot. My computer has a 4K monitor so I am always taking pretty large screenshots and inserting them into blog posts. This causes the image files to be large. Also, having multiple screenshots on a page can really slow it down. \nMost images can be optimized and made smaller. There are tools for jpeg and png files to help shrink the files. If you are using WordPress, there are plugins that can automatically do it. \nIf you have a lot of small icons on your pages, you should consider switching to an icon font like Font Awesome or using image sprites . \nLastly, if you have pages that are long with a lot of images, you may want to consider lazy loading your images. This means that on page load, you only load the images that you can see on the screen. As your user scrolls down, you setup your site to load additional images. Optimizing server performance \nNo matter which programming language you are using, there are several common issues that cause performance problems. \nWeb performance optimization isn\u2019t just about optimizing the client. Many performance problems are due to slow SQL queries, hidden errors, and other issues. 1. Optimize usage of application dependencies \nMost software applications use SQL databases, caching, external web services, and other application dependencies. These are things like SQL Server, Oracle, Redis, MongoDB, Elasticsearch and external HTTP web services. \nThe best way to evaluate how your code is using application dependencies and how they perform is by code profiling. Products like Retrace are safe to use on your servers and can instantly show you which dependencies are being used and how long they take. \nBelow is an example of a typical web application with pretty consistent traffic and performance. \nIn this example below you can quickly identify that Redis is causing big performance spikes. \nOne of the common problems is identifying slow SQL queries and figuring out how to improve their performance. Another common issue is identifying SQL queries that are being called too often. 2. Identify top application errors \nYour application is probably throwing all sorts of exceptions that you don\u2019t even know about. Exceptions are one of the best ways to identify bugs and even performance problems in your code. \nRetrace can collect and provide excellent reporting about all the exceptions that are being thrown within your code. \nExceptions themselves cause a lot of performance overhead. An application that throws thousands of exceptions a minute will consume a lot more CPU than it should. \nThis is a common problem in code that does a lot of data parsing in \u201ctry catch\u201d blocks and just ignores any exceptions being thrown. \nLearn more: How GWB Found Hidden Exceptions and Application Performance Problems 3. Optimize your most-used web pages \nIf you don\u2019t know which pages on your site are used the most and which ones are the slowest, you definitely should. \nYou could try and do this by parsing the logs from your web server. This is a nightmare if your web application uses REST URLs because most of the URLs will be unique. \nAn easier way is using an application performance management solution like Retrace. \nYour goal is to identify which requests are being used the most and which ones are taking up the most amount of time on your server. This helps you prioritize where to do performance tuning. \nWith Retrace, you can also view code-level performance to understand exactly what it is doing. Summary \nWeb performance optimization is a job that is never done. As you continue to make changes to your software and roll out new features, its usage and performance will continue to change. \nI recommend reviewing your application performance monitoring tools like Retrace on a weekly basis, looking for things that could use some improvement. You can then prioritize these work items as part of your next sprint. \nAlso be sure to check out some of our other guides about application performance.

In 1985, he had defeated Harshadba Chudasama. \nVala vacated the seat for Narendra Modi in 2002 after the latter was then nominated as the chief minister. Later, when Modi moved to Maninagar constituency, Vala continued his undefeated run till 2012. \nLater, after Vala was shifted to Karnataka, Vijay Rupani won the bypoll from the seat in 2014. \nThough Rajkot-West is a stronghold of the RSS, the Congress has mounted a strong challenge by bringing in Rajyaguru, the sitting MLA from Rajkot-East, to rework the caste combination in the party\u2019s favour. \nTo retain his seat, Rupani has to surmount the angry Patidars as well as the trading community, which is smarting under the impact of demonetisation and rollout of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). \nOut of 3.15 lakh voters in the constituency, the number of Kadva and Leuva Patidars is the highest at 62,000, followed by Brahmins, Lohana and Jain communities. \nThe Congress is trying to direct the simmering anger among Patidars over lack of reservation in education and government jobs under the BJP rule against Rupani. \nThe quota agitation and Hardik Patel joining hands with Congress may dent the BJP\u2019s base among the Patidars, who till now were considered as the bedrock of the BJP\u2019s support base in Gujarat. \nCongress nominee Rajyaguru, the richest candidate in Gujarat elections, believes that he has won the \u201cinitial battle\u201d against Rupani by keeping him busy in the constituency since the poll schedule was announced. \n\u201cI wanted to keep the chief minister busy in Rajkot-West constituency and morally I have won the initial battle as the chief minister has to visit his constituency more than once in a week,\u201d Rajyaguru claimed. \nHowever, Rupani has been unfazed and is confidant of his victory. \nHe earlier cited the work done by him for the people of the state as well as his constituency, especially bringing the Narmada river water to Rajkot. \nRupani had said that he was not facing any challenge in Rajkot West as it is a traditional bastion of the BJP. \n\u201cI will win the seat easily,\u201d he had told PTI in an interview recently. \nBJP\u2019s Saurashtra and Kutch spokesperson Raju Dhruv said that Rupani has always been ready to solve the problems faced by the people of Rajkot or elsewhere in Gujarat. \n\u201cAs the CM, he has done well and because of his tireless efforts, Rajkot could get the Narmada water in less than five years of the project announced by then chief minister Narendra Modiji,\u201d Dhruv said. \nThe 182-member Gujarat Assembly will go to the polls in two phases \u2014 on December 9 and 14 \u2014 and the counting of votes will be taken up on December 18. \nPTI",

Sikorski\u00b9   Ringe der Welt -Trau und Partnerringe f\u00fcr jeden Geschmack Das Austauschen der Trauringe ist zweifelsohne der sch\u00f6nste Moment einer jeden Hochzeitszeremonie. Es verwundert nicht, dass f\u00fcr Paare die Auswahl individueller und attraktiver Ringe eine besonders wichtige Rolle spielt. Klassiker wie Wei\u00dfgold und Gelbgold sind seit Jahrzehnten gefragt, wobei Auswahl und Anfertigung der Trauringe beim Juwelier vor Ort oft sehr teuer sind. Mit Ringe der Welt entscheiden sich Verliebte und Paare f\u00fcr zauberhafte Ringe aus dem Internet, die trotz preiswerter Konditionen h\u00f6chste Qualit\u00e4t zusichern. Bequem im Internet bestellt, werden diese \u00fcber Jahrzehnte hinweg zu einem wundersch\u00f6nen Symbol der Liebe. Gold, Silber und Platin in attraktiven Kombinationen Gerade junge Brautpaare w\u00fcnschen sich Partner- oder Eheringe, die vom Standard abweichen und so einzigartig wie die eigene Partnerschaft sind. RInge der Welt geht hierauf mit einem breiten Produktspektrum ein, zu dem neben klassischen Ringen aus Wei\u00dfgold und Gelbgold tolle Kombinationen dieser Edelmetalle geh\u00f6ren. Ineinander in sch\u00f6nen Designs verschlungen, genie\u00dfen Verliebte durch Bicolor-Ringe die Vorz\u00fcge beider Goldfarben. Sogar Tricolor-Ringe in Kombination mit dem seltenen Rotgold geh\u00f6ren zum Sortiment, die auch als einfarbige Trau- und Partnerringe zum Hingucker werden. W\u00fcnschen Brautpaare schlichte Eleganz und suchen hierbei eine Alternative zu Gold als Ringmaterial, sind Platinringe die richtige Wahl. Zeit- und schn\u00f6rkellos gefertigt, stehen Ringe aus Platin als seltenem Edelmetall f\u00fcr eine besondere Eleganz und hohe Qualit\u00e4t. Goldringe des Onlineshops werden durch Brillanten und \u00e4hnliche Schmucksteine \u00e4sthetisch aufgewertet, wobei dies prim\u00e4r f\u00fcr die feminine Variante der Ringpaare gilt. Sch\u00f6ne Auswahl nicht nur f\u00fcr Hochzeitsringe Am h\u00e4ufigsten werden Gold- oder Platinringe aus dem Sortiment von Ringe der Welt f\u00fcr die Verm\u00e4hlung in Kirche oder Standesamt bestellt. Der Einsatzzweck ist hierauf nicht beschr\u00e4nkt, die g\u00fcnstigen Konditionen laden zum \u00dcberreichen zu weiteren Anl\u00e4ssen ein. So k\u00f6nnen Ringe bereits zur Verlobung getauscht werden, was in vielen Regionen Deutschlands eine gro\u00dfe Tradition besitzt. Viele Paare \u00fcberreichen sich Ringe auch als Zeichen der Treue und Zusammengeh\u00f6rigkeit, obwohl sie ohne Trauschein gl\u00fccklich miteinander durchs Leben gehen. Nat\u00fcrlich k\u00f6nnen die Ringe auch w\u00e4hrend einer langj\u00e4hrigen Partnerschaft zu einer besonderen Aufmerksamkeit werden, um den Partner mit einem edlen Pr\u00e4sent zu \u00fcberraschen. Umfassender Service zu fairen Konditionen Ringe der Welt versteht sich nicht als reiner Onlineshop. Mit einem umfassenden Service am Kunden m\u00f6chte der Anbieter die Hemmschwelle nehmen, einen so pers\u00f6nlichen Artikel wie Partner- oder Eheringe \u00fcber das Internet zu bestellen. Hierzu tr\u00e4gt der Shop durch eine pers\u00f6nliche Beratung bei, zudem sind s\u00e4mtliche Ringe ausf\u00fchrlich beschrieben und lassen sich in gro\u00dfen Fotoaufnahmen betrachten. Ausgeliefert werden sie stets in einem attraktiven Etui, das dem feierlichen \u00dcberreichen in einem besonderen Moment w\u00fcrdig ist. Der Versand von Ringen und Etui ist kostenlos. Um den Partner- oder Eheringen eine einzigartige Note zu verleihen, bietet Ringe der Welt eine kostenlose Gravur an. Auf der Innenseite des Ringes lassen sich beispielsweise die Namen der beiden Verliebten oder das Datum des Hochzeitstages eingravieren. Neben der kostenlosen Anpassung der Ringe haben Kunden ein 30-t\u00e4giges Widerrufsrecht, um die gehobene Qualit\u00e4t der Ringe hautnah zu erleben. F\u00fcr Fragen vor und nach der Bestellung erm\u00f6glicht Ringe der Welt die Kontaktaufnahme per Telefon, E-Mail oder als Live-Chat \u00fcber Skype.\u00b9", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle":

The one he didn't approached first, Mars recognized him but had never really talked to him. Nathan, I think that's his name. Mars thought to himself before nodding in Affirmation when Nathan asked to sit next to him. \"Sure, you can sit here. You're uh, Nathan right? I don'think we've ever introduced ourselves. I'm Mars, nice to meet you.\" He said before extending his hand to shake.\nJust then another person approached the bench as well, Mars realized he probably wasn't the only person who felt kind of awkward in this setting. The second person was Wendy Felix, Mars knew her better than Nathan. They were both usually the top of their classes, and often competed with each other for the best grades. They weren't super close, but Mars was happy to see a friendly face at least. \"uh hi Wendy, ya you can sit here. This is Nathan.\" He said, gesturing to the boy sitting to his left. \"I'm not sure if you two ever met.\" Then he pauses, trying to figure out how to start up conversation, \"So, are you two looking forward to summer?\"\nMars eyes wandered towards the open hanger doors, where something caught his attention. A girl he had never seen before was standing against a nearby tree. She was quite strange, not because of her pink hair or red eyes, but because of the scales that ran across her arms leading to claws where a human would normally have fingers. Mars wasn't scared or repulsed by this, but rather curious. Who is she? Or rather what is she? And what is she doing here? He thought to himself. After a few moments he worked up the courage to try to find out. \"Uh, I'm going to get myself something to drink, I'll be right back.\" He said to Nathan and Wendy, a little hastily but mostly calm. He walked causally toward the drink coolers as to not cause suspicion before slowly making his way towards the door. He approached the stranger, not sure if she had noticed him yet, \"Umm.... Hi\" He said, fairly nervous. \"What's your name? I've never seen you around before.\"\nRoy\nRoy couldn't help but roll his eyes when he heard Cassandra. \"Because it's fun Cass.\" He told her as he danced with the crowd, \"Sometimes you just need to let loose, and enjoy yourself. And did you have to wear that outfit here? You look like you're going to start vacuuming any minute now.\" He said with a smile. Cassandra was an AI that Roy had discovered last year, and while Roy mostly wanted to make sure she didn't fall into the wrong hands, they had bonded somewhat over that time.\nAs he danced Roy was approached by Wyatt, a friend of Mars who Roy had hung out with on multiple occasions. \"Hey Wyatt! Good to see you here, you feel like dancing?\" He asked with a smile. Wyatt didn't go out much, similarly to Mars, so Roy was happy to see him. \"Mars is probably off mopping somewhere, I was lucky I could get him here at all.\" He chuckled, starting to dance again as the music started to pic up again.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:51.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "58217f81f0f665099576efc077d4e614044dc837", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_b.qpdVxXEMCbLOFhBOb6P2Of0owr_MqXKCfHR2AQ3EpZhwuKC6QxQ7x4kFNjhQbiqGEowfF7vbuw5Z9AiOwtzIpOVmrDWlrAjSQVd85sKxSZHqXcSSPT7", "site_full": "www.walb.com", "site": "walb.com", "site_section": "http://www.walb.com/global/Category.asp?C=1687&clienttype=rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WALB-TV - Home", "title": "California wind, and fire danger, hits unprecedented high", "title_full": "California wind, and fire danger, hits unprecedented high", "published": "2017-12-07T10:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://APMOBILE.images.worldnow.com/images/15576283_G.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 87328, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "58217f81f0f665099576efc077d4e614044dc837", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_b.qpdVxXEMCbLOFhBOb6P2Of0owr_MqXKCfHR2AQ3EpZhwuKC6QxQ7x4kFNjhQbiqGEowfF7vbuw5Z9AiOwtzIpOVmrDWlrAjSQVd85sKxSZHqXcSSPT7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "California wind, and fire danger, hits unprecedented high", "text": "California wind, and fire danger, hits unprecedented high 2017-12-07T08:40:55Z 2017-12-07T09:41:34Z (AP Photo/Noah Berger).

(AP) - Southern California has felt yellow wind, orange wind, and red wind. But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

Burton", "published": "2017-12-06T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Make 2018 More Productive With This HBR Strategy", "text": "A few months back, Harvard Business Review published a terrific article titled \u201c In a Distracted World, Solitude Is a Competitive Advantage .\u201d The authors reference numerous sources, from Yoda (Star Wars) to Eric Schmidt (Google) to David Rock ( Your Brain at Work ), to propose that working in a quiet mental and physical space maximizes the quality and the quantity of the work accomplished. Getting the work done is, after all, the ultimate objective among the many we wrangle each day.\nThis notion of focusing on the work first reminds me of a partner in my former law firm. The partner, Robert, closed his door every morning from 9 to 11 a.m. His standing instruction was not to interrupt him during that period. We associates used to joke that if the building caught on fire, we were to put it out and tell Robert at 11:01 a.m!\nI once asked Robert why he shut himself off from the world for two hours every morning. He replied, \u201cThe most important thing I do for my clients is the work at hand. Everything else is second. If I don\u2019t do the work, the rest won\u2019t matter.\u201d\nI\u2019ve never forgotten that lesson. And I probably don\u2019t need to tell you that Robert was one of the most successful lawyers in the firm.\nSimple Steps to Solitude How do you achieve quiet focus in a distraction-riddled world? It\u2019s not as hard as it appears. Consider these suggestions.\nTurn off alerts, even if only temporarily. Solitude\u2019s biggest enemies are the alerts our devices constantly deliver. Turn them off, even if only temporarily, to focus entirely on one task. Don\u2019t worry, the research shows we\u2019ll still check the devices 100 times a day even with the alerts off! But in the interim, maybe you\u2019ll get some great work done sooner. \nSilent times, or sequestering. Take a page from Robert\u2019s book and close your door for short periods throughout the day. Maybe it\u2019s only 30 minutes, but think how much you can accomplish in that time if you\u2019re left uninterrupted. In the alternative, sequester yourself in a conference room or empty office. Take along the work you want to do and do it. Then rejoin the fray of the day. \nQuiet zones. One lawyer I know places a visitor chair behind her slightly closed door. There\u2019s also a lamp strategically placed back there. When she wants to get some reading or work done, she sits just behind the door and does it. Those passing by can see she\u2019s \u201cin the office,\u201d but not currently at her desk. She even reports that people occasionally come in and put things on her desk, then leave without even realizing she\u2019s there! \nQuestion blocks. This trick works for people who answer a lot of questions and for those who need a lot of questions answered. Handle questions the way college professors and students do: Schedule times throughout the day to deal with them. That way, you can take a break from other work to either ask or get answered the questions that need addressing. \nMake Solitude a 2018 Competitive Advantage High-quality, high-quantity productivity comes from focus. Focus occurs in mental and physical solitude. Leverage the ideas above to make solitude one of your 2018 competitive advantages.\nPaul Burton is a former corporate finance attorney who helps people regain command of their day.
