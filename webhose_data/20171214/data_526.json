It surprisingly concluded that innovative products that contain nicotine or tobacco can play an important role. \n\"Smoking is the world\u2019s leading cause of preventable death and disease, and its impact is particularly devastating in Indonesia and across Asia, where more than 60% of the world\u2019s smokers reside. Unfortunately, for many years, those numbers have not been decreasing,\" revealed Dr. Konstantinos Farsalinos M.D, a wellknown Greek cardiologist. \nMore than a decade ago, the UK Royal College of Physicians explained that burning tobacco, not nicotine, causes the harms of smoking. \n\"The research revealed that nicotine, an important reason why people smoke, is not particularly harmful. Instead, it provides smokers with \u201ccleaner\u201d forms of nicotine, without burning tobacco, could save millions of lives, they said,\" said Prof. Dr. Achmad Syawqie Yazid, Drg., M.SS, Chairman of Public Health Observer Foundation (YPKP) Indonesia. \nToday, those \u201ccleaner\u201d forms of nicotine exist: electronic cigarettes, which vaporize nicotine solutions, heated tobacco products, which eliminate burning, and smokeless tobacco are three examples. \nNumerous scientific studies on these products, including a systematic review of all publications on e-cigarette science, have already been conducted. The evidence consistently and convincingly shows three things: \n\u200cFirst, e-cigarettes and smoke-free tobacco products are undoubtedly much safer than smoking. For example, in August 2015, Public Health England, part of the British health ministry, reviewed all the available scientific evidence and concluded that e-cigarettes are 95% safer than cigarettes. \n\u200cSecond, electronic cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products can save millions of lives. A recent study from Georgetown University Medical Center, United States, published in the journal of Tobacco Control, stated that if smokers switch to smoke-free nicotine-containing products, as many as 6.6 million people in the United States could avoid premature death and more than 86.7 million years of life could be saved. We are talking here about saving or extending the lives of millions of smokers. If this number were translated into Indonesia and the rest of Asia, investment and innovation could give the tobacco industry a pathway into the 21st century and beyond, enormous social costs could be avoided, and tens of millions of lives could be saved. \nT\u200chird, millions of smokers worldwide are now using e-cigarettes and smoke-free tobacco products instead of cigarettes. Asian smokers should have access to these products as well. In the European Union, 6.1 million smokers quit smoking with the use of electronic cigarettes, according to the 2015 data from Eurobarometer. Numbers have undoubtedly grown since then. Asian countries such as Malaysia has thousands of e-cigarette users. Furthermore, millions of smokers in Japan, Korea and more than 30 countries worldwide have switched from cigarettes to products that heat tobacco instead of burning it. Smokers in Asia are clearly ready for, and in fact need, better alternatives to smoking and smoking rates in Japan and other Asian countries never dropped that quickly before the introduction of alternative tobacco and nicotine products. \nMany governments have begun to regulate e-cigarettes and smoke-free tobacco products as tobacco-related products, prohibiting their sales to youth, adopted quality and safety standards, and funded further scientific research even while the products are sold and available. Countries across Asia should consider the same, tailoring laws to their specific circumstances, but in a way that benefits smokers by encouraging them to switch, drives innovation and investment in the sector and ultimately saves lives, millions of lives. \nBy: Dr. Konstantinos Farsalinos M.D -- The author is a cardiologist and research fellow at the Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center in Athens, Greece at the Department of Pharmacy, University of Patras, Greece and at the National School of Public Health, Greece \nProf. Dr. Achmad Syawqie Yazid, Drg., M.SS -- The author is a Professor in the Faculty of Dentistry, Padjadjaran University, Bandung; Chairman of Public Health Observer Foundation (YPKP) Indonesia Editor: PR Wire", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "achmad syawqie yazid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "konstantinos farsalinos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "konstantinos farsalinos m.d", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "antara news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "onassis cardiac surgery center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faculty of dentistry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "public health observer foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgetown university medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tobacco control", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of pharmacy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chairman of public health observer foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk royal college of physicians", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national school of public health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "padjadjaran university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of patras", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jakarta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bandung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "public health england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:53:12.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cae15c7a67876dcd384fab4f42bd31f139969406", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqIBRdCDNqED.fylSl8ZXK951RlPkipWQ.nECJtz3bw0cZr9ecimTgYBsdnYotwbVrrWplY8dIAUuxRLJmxzZycaST3Z0g_Ft9DWBMYvmaU_w-", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/entertainment/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Entertainment links", "title": "(9829999) Porn star August Ames dead at 23, possibly by her own hand", "title_full": "FARK.com: (9829999) Porn star August Ames dead at 23, possibly by her own hand", "published": "2017-12-07T05:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 136, "participants_count": 111, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img.fark.net/images/cache/orig/J/Jq/fark_Jq67AqX1BWa1KYLRPpMd02FBnZ4.jpg?t=CXylP7YNmXR_5-LdX7Wvcg&amp;f=1512968400", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3382, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ef4616a1f9caafc1dd5e1f611014f811fad3f258", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqIBRdCDNqED.fylSl8ZXK951RlPkipWQ.nECJtz3bw0cZr9ecimTgYBsdnYotwbVrrWplY8dIAUuxRLJmxzZycaST3Z0g_Ft9DfKF34u5yio3qhCgo4D4hg--", "ord_in_thread": 68, "author": "I created this alt just for this thread", "published": "2017-12-07T07:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "inglixthemad : I created this alt just for this thread: inglixthemad: Ooba Tooba: inglixthemad: Hmm, another dead homophobe?

Captain Jack Harkness is disappointed. Saying you won't work with someone because they're gay, or bisexual, is not cool. I'm going to wager, like most adult performers, they got regular STD checks.\nAnd if that's what she'd said, you might have a point. Unfortunately for you, her statement was based on the actor's work history, not their sexuality.\nSo all gay porn is straight guys? I guess it's possible, just seems unlikely.\nNot everyone who does gay porn is gay or bi. Regardless, there's a difference between what someone does and what someone is. Again, if she had objected to the actor being gay or bi, you'd have a point, but she was objecting to their working in gay porn, which has a higher STD rate than the rest of the porn biz. Whether or not the actor in question is gay, bi, straight, or other is entirely irrelevant to why she might want to warn other actresses who would be working with them.", "highlightText": "",

There may be a glut of it online but not every consumer of porn is using the internet. 13% of Americans aren't online.\nThere's still money to be made whether it's the guy in a halfway house whose internet is restricted and monitored but has a portable DVD player and headphones to some drunk dude who stumbles into a porn store and wants something to whack it to back at the hotel before he passes out to someone who just isn't technical enough to figure out how to pipe it to his big screen TV.\nMost paid porn users are people who know what they like and, unlike your average 18-25 year old, needs more than two random people farking to become aroused.

While I don't encourage suicide, I'm not going to say calling a homophobe a homophobe is a bad thing.\nIf you can't see the difference between being a homophobe, and not wanting to have sex with someone who performs in gay porn, than you're an idiot.\nAre you a homophobe, since you're defending a dead homophobe. Captain Jack Harkness is disappointed. Saying you won't work with someone because they're gay, or bisexual, is not cool. I'm going to wager, like most adult performers, they got regular STD checks.\nI don't know if she was a homophobe. Either do you, if you are just judging her by that tweet.\nI have gay friends, and do not think about/care about their preference of being with someone of the same sex. However, that has nothing to do with anything here. You are basing judgement that she won't \"work\" with a gay man, as if her work was like sharing an office or something. It's not. She has to put that D in her P, A, and M. Not wanting to do that doesn't make her a homophobe.\nKinda does. Does gay dick taste different? Bi different again? All porn stars are tested often, She's as likely to get any anything from any other straight cawk or pretend lesbian as bi guy...\nActors who do gay porn are more likely to have STIs. Which means that, as a matter of workplace safety, actors should be made aware of their potential co-workers' work history. If the director or company involved in the shoot was not letting their performers know about the guy's history, they were being irresponsible and putting their performers at additional risk without their knowledge. August's tweet was helping ensure that the people involved were making informed decisions.\nWomen who have heterosexual relations are also more likely to have STI's, does that mean lesbian women doing porn should refuse to work with them?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:53:12.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cae15c7a67876dcd384fab4f42bd31f139969406", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqIBRdCDNqED.fylSl8ZXK951RlPkipWQ.nECJtz3bw0cZr9ecimTgYBsdnYotwbVrrWplY8dIAUuxRLJmxzZycaST3Z0g_Ft9DWBMYvmaU_w-", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/entertainment/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Entertainment links", "title": "(9829999) Porn star August Ames dead at 23, possibly by her own hand", "title_full": "FARK.com: (9829999) Porn star August Ames dead at 23, possibly by her own hand", "published": "2017-12-07T05:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 136, "participants_count": 111, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img.fark.net/images/cache/orig/J/Jq/fark_Jq67AqX1BWa1KYLRPpMd02FBnZ4.jpg?t=CXylP7YNmXR_5-LdX7Wvcg&amp;f=1512968400", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3382, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "042ac88a2c182d46f36ee0e4d0002fdbdcbeb32e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqIBRdCDNqED.fylSl8ZXK951RlPkipWQ.nECJtz3bw0cZr9ecimTgYBsdnYotwbVrrWplY8dIAUuxRLJmxzZycaST3Z0g_Ft9DfKF34u5yiraBCdMdyBO6Q--", "ord_in_thread": 133, "author": "Wretschko", "published": "2017-12-07T11:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Wretschko : Who is this August Ames?

He spoke on Thursday at the Foreign Ministry. \nNetanyahu says that \"we are already in contact with other states that will make a similar recognition.\" \nHe says the \"time has come\" and expressed confidence that others will follow suit and move their embassies to Jerusalem. \nMeanwhile, the Israeli military said it will be deploying additional troops to the West Bank ahead of Friday, when mass Palestinian protests are anticipated in response to Trump's move. \nThe army statement on Thursday says it will deploy several battalions to the territory while other troops have been put on alert to address \"possible developments.\" \nPalestinians went on strike across the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip on Thursday and protests are expected on Friday after midday prayers. \n___ \n11:25 a.m. \nThe top leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas is calling for a new uprising against Israel in the wake of President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nIsmail Haniyeh spoke to his followers in the Gaza Strip on Thursday and called the U.S. decision an \"aggression on our people and a war on our sanctuaries.\" \nHe says the uprising should begin Friday, the Muslim holy day. \nHaniyeh then added: \"We want the uprising to last and continue to let Trump and the occupation regret this decision.\" \nHamas killed hundreds of Israelis during an armed uprising in the early 2000s. But Hamas' ability to carry out attacks is more limited. Israel has imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip, and many of Hamas' supporters in the West Bank have been arrested. \nEven so, Hamas possesses a large arsenal of rockets in Gaza capable of striking many areas in Israel. \n___ \n10:30 a.m. \nSaudi Arabia's royal court, led by King Salman and his powerful son, are condemning the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nIt's a rare public rebuke by the royal court of U.S. ally and President Donald Trump. \nSaudi Arabia, a regional powerhouse that could help the White House push through a Middle East settlement, said on Thursday the kingdom had already warned against this step and \"continues to express its deep regret at the U.S. administration's decision,\" describing it \"unjustified and irresponsible.\" \nTrump's move puts the Sunni nation in a bind. The kingdom, particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. \nU.S. Embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa have warned American citizens of possible protests as a result of Trump's decision. \n___ \n9:40 a.m. \nSchools and shops are closed in the West Bank, as Palestinians are protesting President Donald Trump's recognition of contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nPolitical groups have called for protest marches in West Bank town centers at noon on Thursday. \nTrump's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. \nThe Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital. In recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Trump was seen as siding with Israel which claims the entire city. \n___ \n9:30 a.m. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is accusing his American counterpart of throwing the Middle East into a \"ring of fire\" by declaring the divided holy city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nErdogan also compared President Donald Trump to a \"blender\" that is stirring up trouble in the region. \nThe Turkish leader said, addressing Trump: \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it.\" \nErdogan added that \"political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace.\" \nHe also said: \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right,' he is mistaken.\" \nErdogan spoke to a group of workers on Thursday who had gathered at Ankara's airport, before he departed for an official visit to Greece. \n___ \n8:50 a.m. \nPalestinians, Israelis and the wider Middle East are bracing for the fallout after President Donald Trump's seismic shift in recognizing the bitterly contested Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was to travel to Jordan on Thursday to meet with King Abdullah II. The monarch is seen as Abbas' closest Arab ally, and the two leaders might try to coordinate a response to Trump's policy change. \nIn Wednesday's move, Trump defied worldwide warnings and insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, describing his decision as merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. \nTrump also said the United States would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable for that.

Former Russian Economic Development Minister Alexei Ulyukayev waits for a hearing at a court in Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017. Ulyukayev who is on trial for allegedly taking a $2 million bribe is expected to deliver... \nBy NATALIYA VASILYEVAAssociated Press \nMOSCOW (AP) - Wrapping up one of Russia's most high-profile trials of the year, a former economic development minister charged with bribery on Thursday accused an oil executive of setting him up and apologized for \"turning back on other people's misfortunes.\" \nAlexei Ulyukayev, the highest-ranking Russian official to be arrested since 1993, was detained last year at the headquarters of Russia's largest oil producer, the state-owned Rosneft, after a sting operation by Russia's main intelligence agency. Prosecutors say he accepted a $2 million bribe from Rosneft's influential CEO, Igor Sechin, for giving the company the green light for privatizing another oil firm. \nThe circumstances of the case have ignited speculation that Ulyukayev was caught in a Kremlin power play against Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin. \nIn his final argument on Thursday, Ulyukayev pleaded not guilty and accused Sechin of setting him up. \n\"A horrific and cruel provocation has been perpetrated against me,\" he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies. \nSechin, whose testimony was the cornerstone of the case against the former minister, was summoned to testify in court four times but he did not show up, citing urgent matters of business. \nReferring to a common perception of Sechin as a dark force in Russian politics, Ulyakayev said in court on Thursday that the key witness \"disappeared - what was left was a whiff of sulfur in the air.\" \nUlyukaev went to Sechin's office in November last year to discuss Rosneft's affairs, and was arrested as he was leaving the building with a bag full of cash that Sechin had given him. Ulyukayev told the court that he thought the bag contained a bottle of wine and a basket filled with sausages. \nIn wire tapes played out to the court earlier in the trial, Sechin was heard telling Ulyukayev to take the bag with the sausage. Russian media has reported that Sechin has a tradition of gifting people baskets of sausages from his own butcher's shop. \nUlyukayev could face a lengthy prison term if found guilty. Prosecutors have asked the court to send him to a high-security prison for ten years, arguing that Ulyukayev's actions \"are undermining the authority of the government.\" \nUlyukayev told the court on Thursday that he is not guilty of \"those absurd accusations but guilty of a different thing: I often compromised. I was a hypocrite. I love taking gifts and giving gifts. When you're doing all right, you shamelessly turn your back on other people's misfortunes.\" \nUlyukayev asked for \"people's\" forgiveness and pledged to devote rest of his life to \"defending people's interests.\" \nThe court is expected to deliver the verdict next week.

Paul says, \u201cAnd you know that from childhood you have known the sacred Scriptures, which are able to give you wisdom for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus (2 Tim 3:15).\u201d These scriptures were the Law and the Prophets who spoke BEFORE Jesus came\u2026 but when He rose, they were opened by the Spirit and testified of Christ (Eph 3:5). \nHe alone, God\u2019s Holy Spirit, can reveal the things of Christ, and when He does, then we are wise unto salvation and powerful in His might. He says, \u201cThis is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: \u2018Not by strength or by might, but by My Spirit,\u2019 says the LORD of Hosts (Zech 4:6).\u201d All good done in this world is done by the Spirit: He alone makes Christ known, and this is wisdom and knowledge. \nDo not think that you can do anything without wisdom. Scripture says, \u201cIf the ax is dull, and one does not sharpen its edge, then one must exert more strength; however, the advantage of wisdom is that it brings success (Eccl 10:10).\u201d \nIf we labor in our strength, then we\u2019ll see no revival; if we labor in His strength, then He has limitless might, and we\u2019ll see works and power that we\u2019ve never known. \nDaniel Rowland, the Welsh Calvinist, said: \n\u201cThere is such power as I have never felt before, given me in preaching and administering the Lord\u2019s Supper. The Lord comes down among us in such a manner as words can give no idea of. Though I have, to prevent nature mixing with the work, openly discountenanced all crying out, yet such is the light, view, and power God gives very many in the Ordinance, that they cannot possibly help crying out, praising and adoring Jesus, being quite swallowed up in God; and thus I was obliged to leave my whole congregation, being many hundreds, in a flame . . . this is our condition generally every Sabbath.\u201d \nThis \u201cevery Sabbath\u201d or \u201cevery Lord\u2019s Day\u201d is what I\u2019m hitting at; it is the constant, abiding presence of the Holy Spirit, which is Him whom we cannot control being FAITHFUL to us as promised. Our Lord said, \u201cWhen He comes, He will convict the world about sin, righteousness, and judgment (John 16:8).\u201d If we are wise and lean on Him, then He will show up. \nDo not seek to work in your own might! You fight against God and try producing spiritual life yourself, and it cannot happen! Hear the words of Ezekiel. \u201c Then he ordered me, \u2018Prophesy to the Spirit, Son of Man. Tell the Spirit, \u2018This is what the Lord GOD says: \u2018Come from the four winds, you Spirit, and breathe into these people who have been killed, so they will live (Ezek 37:9).\u2019\u201d The only way to get spiritual life is by the Spirit, and we labor in vain without Him. Thus, we cannot trust sound doctrine, but we must have the Spirit attached, or it is nothing in the heart, and there is no life. Spiritual life is spiritually given. \nDo not fear the Spirit not coming upon you! He\u2019s been given to us by the Lord Jesus and promised by the Father. Jesus said, \u201cBut the Helper, the Holy Spirit\u2013the Father will send Him in My name\u2013will teach you all things and remind you of everything I have told you (John 14:26).\u201d \nOnly believe and LOOK to Him, leaning upon your Beloved. Do not add to Christ or cheapen it by emotionalism, but pray in faith, and He will come. He knows that He must do all the work, and we cast our net on the right side by acknowledging it in our heart (John 21:6). Pray for Him \u2013 united in public and zealously in private -that He will come and drive our labors into the heart, so that the world may take notice, so that Satan\u2019s kingdom may shake, so that souls be delivered. Look to Him and labor! \nLastly, do not forget that you need wisdom! It is the height of folly to labor in vain when so much help is promised. Wisdom WILL make you strong.

Just saying it\u2019s fine doesn\u2019t exactly contribute to the conversation nor does it back up your position.\nOn topic, while the solution presented by the OP isn\u2019t the most optimal it does present the more glaring issues with the passive that IMO should be adressed.\nFirst is that, as pointed out, this makes Volt very weapon selective as this is only thruthly effective on weapons that hit hard each strike, therefore damning auto weapons or those with fast fire rates.\nThe second and definitely biggest issue is (which is partly at fault for the first one) that it all goes away in one strike and you don\u2019t get to choose when, one ability cast, one melee hit or one shot and it all goes away immediately you can\u2019t even choose when. Naturally this is very problematic when fighting several enemies since it\u2019s very easy to waste whatever you saved up on a trash mob as well as other situations where you\u2019d have wanted that bonus dmg, also the fact that you can lose it all by melee striking containers is in dire need of some serious fixing.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nPersonally I feel like the passive could be changed, but keep the same concept, to have it easily deal with this issue.\nMy suggestion would be: Instead of a flat number it could be a percentage based on the damage of the strike delivered, be it melee, shot or power. Naturally this would mean that the maximum output could end up being lower than a flat addition but you\u2019d be able to retain it for every strike you make.... so long as you keep moving, which would be the cost for this tradeoff, move to both generate charge and mantain it and if you were to stand still it would begin to decrease gradually.\nEdited yesterday at 02:13 AM by RahuHordika\nMinor typos", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:53:17.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc2fa86a2d4a5b83df104cc81c45330e023119f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS16MgMHQBM3MBWPbrSj1xFY-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dc2fa86a2d4a5b83df104cc81c45330e023119f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS16MgMHQBM3MBWPbrSj1xFY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "user www-data;\nworker_processes auto;\npid /run/nginx/pid\n\nevents {\n    worker_connections 768;\n}\n\nstream {\n    upstream prod_backend {\n        server 192.168.137.129:23;\n    }\n    upstream test_backend {\n        server 192.168.137.131:23;\n    }\n\n    server {\n        listen 23;\n\n        if ( $remote_addr = 192.168.137.132 ) {\n            proxy_pass test_backend;\n        }\n\n        proxy_pass prod_backend;\n    }\n}\n\nhttp {\n}\r\n\t\r\nuser www-data;\nworker_processes auto;\npid /run/nginx/pid\n\nevents {\n    worker_connections 768;\n}\n\nstream {\n    upstream prod_backend {\n        server 192.168.137.129:23;\n    }\n    upstream test_backend {\n        server 192.168.137.131:23;\n    }\n\n    geo $test_site {\n        default 0;\n        192.168.137.132 1;\n    }\n\n    server {\n        listen 23;\n\n        if ( $test_site ) {\n            proxy_pass test_backend;\n        }\n\n        proxy_pass prod_backend;\n    }\n}\n\nhttp {\n}\r\n\t\r\nnginx: [emerg] \"geo\" directive is not allowed here", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:53:17.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1d1932e032e63c1594ecf765471874d85dd58981", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj2ZX5u28yn6vc50InS2dDvzKQSGGHOsUfrE53JB5OmNvo_IVXlQdUQo-", "site_full": "forums.warframe.com", "site": "warframe.com", "site_section": "https://forums.warframe.com/?/forum/34-warframes-abilities/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Warframes &amp; Abilities - Warframe Forums", "title": "Volt Passive", "title_full": "Volt Passive - Warframes & Abilities - Warframe Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T04:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.106, "main_image": "https://content.invisioncic.com/Mwarframe/monthly_2017_07/warframe_share.png.bec3c989c4517e865df9b45a300e63e0.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7793, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d6503a9342a019fe8c8fd60586fcf9ceacedf4de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj2ZX5u28yn6vc50InS2dDvzKQSGGHOsUfrE53JB5OmNvR4JwuvgxnqbxabId0hOVPA--", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "FitzSimmons", "published": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "1 hour ago, Ventasis said: The only good thing about his passive is that it'll occasionally proc shock when you melee, which is another stack of CO.

People aged 35 to 54 years old expect to spend $669, according to the survey, but that\u2019s down slightly from $670 last year. \nShoppers who are 55 years and older expect to spend $696, up from $693 in 2016. \nREAD MORE: Survey suggests Canadian shoppers will spend nearly $600 on gifts \nBut that\u2019s not the only area where millennials outnumber other generations. \nAsked to describe their gift-giving personalities, 47 per cent of 18-to-34-year-olds considered themselves \u201cModern Day Santas\u201d: people who \u201cabsolutely love giving holiday gifts to friends and family.\u201d \nThat was compared to 40 per cent of 35-to-54-year-olds and 40 per cent of people over 55. \nChristmas decorations welcome last-minute shoppers to City Square Shopping Centre, Vancouver, B.C., Dec. 17, 2014.

THE CANADIAN PRESS IMAGES/Rachel Verbin \nCanadians generally plan on spending more on Christmas this year than last, the survey added. \nOverall, they expect to spend $643, up from $597 in 2016. \nMore than half of respondents (52 per cent) expected that they would go overbudget, and 41 per cent admitted that they can\u2019t afford to spend as much as they think they will. \nNevertheless, they feel pressured to spend, they said. \n\u201cWhile the holidays are meant to be a time to reconnect with loved ones, Canadians are telling us that they\u2019re secretly frustrated with the shopping, stress and overspending that ends up eclipsing the joy of the season,\u201d David Nicholson, vice-president, Imperial Service at CIBC, said in a news release. \nOne of the ways that people can reduce their holiday stress? Send money, or gift packages by mail this holiday season, Nicholson said. \n\u201cSending money electronically can be a great way to reduce stress and keep costs down,\u201d he said. \nCIBC isn\u2019t the only organization that has provided data on how much Canadians are expected to spend this year. \nAn Ebates.ca survey projected that Canadians would spend an average of $570 on Christmas gifts \u2014 less than what CIBC projected. \nMethodology: From Nov. 27 to 28, an online survey was conducted among 1,512 randomly selected Canadian adults who are Angus Reid Forum panellists. The margin of error\u2014which measures sampling variability\u2014is +/- 2.5%, 19 times out of 20. The results have been statistically weighted according to education, age, gender and region (and in Quebec, language) Census data to ensure a sample representative of the entire adult population of Canada.
