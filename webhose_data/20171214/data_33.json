Windar will supply eight WindEYE sensors to be installed on offshore turbines as part of The Carbon Trust's \u00e2\u0082\u01792.3 million wind farm control trials (WFCT), designed to demonstrate how effective implementation of control strategies can reduce the cost of offshore wind. The project - backed by EnBW, E.ON, innogy, Statoil and Vattenfall - will investigate the impact of focusing on strategies that aim to improve energy generation across an entire wind farm, rather than individual turbines and help to lower the levelised cost of energy (LCoE). The WFCT intends to demonstrate a lower LCoE by increasing the total wind energy yield and reducing fatigue, thus saving operational and maintenance costs while also increasing the availability and lifetime of existing and future assets.

Of them, Valeant Pharmaceuticals accounts for a leading share in the HPV therapeutics market and Roche AG accounts for a dominant share in the CMV therapeutics market. A report by Transparency Market Research forecasts the global human papillomavirus (HPV) therapeutics market to rise at a CAGR of 7.7% during the period between 2014 and 2020 to become worth US$2.34 bn by 2020 from US$1.40 bn in 2012. According to the report, the global cytomegalovirus (CMV) market will rise at a 1.49 % CAGR from 2014 to 2020 to attain a value of US$922.8 mn by 2020 from US$870.1 mn in 2012. Read Report overview @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/hpv-cmv-therapeutics-m... Fast Developing Healthcare Infrastructure Makes Asia Pacific Attractive Market Depending upon the types of drugs, the global human papillomavirus (HPV) therapeutics market can be segmented into the following drug classes \u2013 anti-neoplastic agents, immunomodulators, sinecatechins, and keratolytic agents. Among them, the immunomodulators leads the market with maximum share. In terms of growth rate, however, the sinecatechins segment will surpass all. The cytomegalovirus (CMV) therapeutics market, again, can be divided on the basis of antiviral drugs into foscarnet, ganciclovir/valganciclovir (first line drugs), and cidofovir. Of them, ganciclovir and valganciclovir together contribute a lion\u2019s share in the revenue in the overall CMV therapeutics market. Geographically, the key segments of the global human papillomavirus (HPV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) therapeutics market are North America, South America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and the Rest of the World. At present, South America and Asia Pacific are considered the most lucrative markets on account of the fast developing healthcare infrastructure, increasing affluence of the people, cultural shifts, and a booming tourism industry leading to high instances of STDs. Rising Prevalence of HPV Stoking Demand in Market The alarming rise of human papillomavirus (HPV) in people of both developed and developing nations has been the primary growth driver of the HPV therapeutics market. The lead analyst of the TMR report elaborates, \u201cOver a 100 strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) have been identified so far. Of them, certain types are known to cause warts or papillomas that progress to malignant or benign cancers. HPV infections are common in adolescents and younget adults and is known to affect adolescent females the most. According to Centre for Disease Control (CDC), about 20 million persons were infected in 2012 in the U.S., and an estimated 6.2 million new HPV infections were occurring every year. All these have majorly fuelled the global HPV therapeutics market.\u201d Request Sample Report@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag... The cytomegalovirus (CMV) therapeutics market, on the other hand, has received a boost from the launch of brincidofovir in 2016. The launch of letermovir in 2018 will also boost the market. Serving to deal a blow to the growth in the global human papillomavirus (HPV) market is the relatively dry pipeline of drugs and the availability of different substitute treatments such as laser therapy and cryotherapy. This review is based on the findings of a TMR report, titled, \u201cHuman Papillomavirus (HPV) and Cytomegalovirus (CPV) Therapeutics Market (HPV Drug Class - Immunomodulators, Keratolytic Agents, Anti-neoplastic Agents, and Sinecatechins; HPV Application - Genital Warts, Genital Cancer, Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis, and Oral Papillomas; CMV Antiviral Drugs - Ganciclovir/Valganciclovir, Foscarnet, and Cidofovir; CMV Application - CMV Retinitis, Pneumonia, Gastrointestinal Ulcers, and Encephalitis) - Global Industry Analysis, Pipeline Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2014 - 2020.\u201d About TMR Transparency Market Research (TMR) is a global market intelligence company providing business information reports and services.

The Rosenzweig's house nearly didn't make it this last time, and the house across the street from them burnt down in the Thomas Fire. Wind-driven fires have raced through California communities for the second time in two months, leaving hundreds of homes feared lost and uprooted tens of thousands of people. The most damaging fire is in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles, where more than 100 square miles (259 sq. kilometers) and numerous homes have burned. less Resident Melissa Rosenzweig worries about losing her family home in the second round of weather coming in Ventura, Calif., Wednesday, Dec.6, 2017.

Millions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. Officials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. Melissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" In what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. The wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. Little flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. Flames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. Across the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. Back in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. Air tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" ___ Dalton reported from Los Angeles.

With age come a variety of mobility issues. As the world\u2019s graying population base expands dramatically, there is a pressing need for healthcare services and specialists to reach out to these aged individuals rather than the other way round. This factor will lead to an unprecedented interest in the deployment of video telemedicine solutions, especially in countries where the majority of the population is already connected to the internet. In both developed and underserved regions of the world, governments have realized the many benefits of video telemedicine consultations, creating a smoother path for the growth for the global video telemedicine market. The key restraints that will stand in the way of the market\u2019s growth, however, are: Reluctance to adopt new technologies, a dearth of skilled staff to enable the seamless deployment of video telemedicine, and the underdeveloped network infrastructure in many regions of the world. Companies in the telemedicine market can find a way around these problems by introducing integrated telemedicine solutions that are easy to use and cost less than the existing options. With the aim to drill down to the second and third level of the global video telemedicine market, the report segments the market by communication technology into: 3G (GSM, CDMA, Others), Satellite Communications, 4G (LTE, WiMax & Others), Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (B-ISDN), and Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL). Request Sample Report@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag... Furthermore, the report provides extensive qualitative information about the following communication technologies in the context of the video telemedicine market: Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and IP Multimedia Systems (IMS). The highest revenue generating segment in 2013 in the global video telemedicine market, according to the report, was that of ADSL-based video telemedicine segment. However, as the adoption of 4G spreads across the world, the 4G-based video telemedicine segment is poised on the brink of seeing impressive growth. By application, the global video telemedicine market is segmented into dermatology, cardiology, gynecology, psychiatry and neurology, oncology, orthopedics, dentistry, radiology, and orthopedics. While video telemedicine was most widely used for gynecology-related consultation in 2013, the use of neurology and psychiatry segment will see patients and doctors heavily relying on video telemedicine in the coming years. As a result, the neurology and psychiatry segment will exhibit a remarkable 17.0% CAGR from 2014 to 2020. North America saw the highest use of video telemedicine and will continue to remain the key market over the near future. Projected to expand at a CAGR of 15% through the report\u2019s forecast period, companies will continue to invest considerably in the North America video telemedicine market.

Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment.\nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county\u2019s computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won\u2019t significantly lengthen the timeframe.\n\u201cI am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\u201d said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \u201cWe are slower, but we are up and running.\u201d\nMost Read Stories Seahawks broadcaster and former Husky star Warren Moon sued for sexual harassment Neil deGrasse Tyson responds, says Seahawks' lateral was just the 'Galilean transformation' Saying goodbye to Seattle\u2019s beloved 13 Coins Redhook brewery site in Woodinville sells for $24.5M America\u2019s hippest city is Vancouver, Washington? Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. The county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state\u2019s largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers.\nThe computer problems haven\u2019t affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube.\nSuch attacks are becoming more common \u2014 and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco\u2019s mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems.\nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \u201ceasy targets\u201d because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data.\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\u201d he said.\nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it\u2019s taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released.\nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations.\nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services.\nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county\u2019s 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn\u2019t able to gain access to individuals\u2019 health, credit card or social security information.\nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county\u2019s chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system.\nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \u201cpatience and hard work.\u201d\n___\nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .\nJONATHAN DREW", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jonathan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irwin carmichael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dena diorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keith gregg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ross rustici", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anjanette flowers grube", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cybereason", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mecklenburg county sheriff\u2019s office", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mecklenburg county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukraine", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:08:35.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "296d0aa660bb7d1343b131c8d0b38f07c18127cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRZDMEtdSB_YqPj9Z7PsLCWpZ3vz6q6kpa14SYy5hu_sURf3kJgaWOGXWl_QclC4iETjFqtFTYmoa6eETpItVW9doIrBJWO9.Y-", "site_full": "www.24hourcampfire.com", "site": "24hourcampfire.com", "site_section": "https://www.24hourcampfire.com/ubbthreads/ubbthreads.php/forums/39/1/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Custom Rifles &amp; Wildcats - 24hourcampfire", "title": "Custom rifle cost", "title_full": "Custom rifle cost - 24hourcampfire", "published": "2017-12-07T17:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 90814, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "296d0aa660bb7d1343b131c8d0b38f07c18127cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRZDMEtdSB_YqPj9Z7PsLCWpZ3vz6q6kpa14SYy5hu_sURf3kJgaWOGXWl_QclC4iETjFqtFTYmoa6eETpItVW9doIrBJWO9.Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ackleyfan", "published": "2017-12-07T17:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "Custom rifle cost", "text": "Unfortunately even Tikka's and Sakos aren't the holy grail, you'll have a much higher percentage of a shooter with actions such as Defiance, Borden, Surgeon and Big Horn.... sure you'll spend a little more!\nCMG 300 BP\n#12446894 - Yesterday at 10:43 AM Re: Custom rifle cost [ Re: JSmith62198 ] Joined: Apr 2003\nPosts: 9,618 Daveh\nCampfire Outfitter Daveh\nCampfire Outfitter\nJoined: Apr 2003\nPosts: 9,618\nSE WASH STATE Start off with a Kimber Montana and hitting a low weight is easy....BTDT\nBut as for me and my house we will serve the Lord.

Doxorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic and belongs to the group of anti-cancer medication known as antineoplastic and is made from the natural product produced by bacterium Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius. It is used for the treatment of different types of cancer including breast, stomach, ovary, bone, testicles, bladder, lung, soft tissue, osteogenic sarcoma, Wilms\u2019 tumor, and Hodgkin\u2019s and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas. It is also used less commonly in the treatment of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. Vagina and cervix, refractory multiple myeloma, and neuroblastoma. Doxorubicin inhibits and or slows the rate of proliferation of cancerous cells by intercalating between the base pairs in the DNA helix, thereby preventing DNA replication and inhibiting protein synthesis. This medication is available in injection solution and lyophilized powder form and is administered intravenously either through peripheral inserted central line catheters (PICC) or central venous catheters (CVC). The dosage of this medication depends on the type and severity of cancer, and type of other medication used during treatments and is most commonly scheduled at 21 days of every dosage. Report Overview and TOC @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/doxorubicin-market.html The global doxorubicin market is anticipated to expand at a higher growth rate owing to increasing prevalence of cancer patients worldwide. According to the WHO, cancer is the leading cause of death globally, accounting 8.8 million deaths in 2015. The number of new cases is expected to increase by 70% in the next two decades. The global market for this drug is also expected to be driven by increasing use in the treatment of HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma. HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma has markedly increased in countries in Africa and the West in the last two decades. On the other hand, doxorubicin medication can cause life threatening conditions such as heart failure during therapy or sometimes after months or years after treatment. Additionally, it can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and reddish urine after one to two days of treatment. These side effects, specifically cardio toxicity, imposes a limitation on the use of doxorubicin and creates an opportunity for development of lipid based (liposome) formulations with improved therapeutic index of conventional doxorubicin. Request brochure @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag...

In ankylosing spondylitis, the joints, ligaments, and spine become inflamed. The inflammation leads to pain and stiffness in the lower back of the body and progress into the upper spine, neck, and chest. The joints and bones (vertebrae) fuse together eventually, causing the spine to become rigid and inflexible. Fused spine is called as bamboo spine as it is identified on X-rays. Other joints such as the hips, ribs, and small joints of hands and feet are also affected. Symptoms of the disease include pain and stiffness in joints, fever, fatigue, and loss of appetite. The global prevalence of ankylosing spondylitis is about 0.1% to 0.5%. This disease can occur at any age; however, it is common among the people from 19 to 40 years of age. It affects primarily men as compared to women. The prevalence ratio in male to female is 2.5:1. The precise cause of the disease is unknown, but it is believed to be hereditary, i.e., gene variation in HLA-B27. About 85% to 90% of people with the disease have HLA-B27 gene variation. Report Overview and TOC @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/ankylosing-spondylitis... The market is growing as no single therapy is approved. The available treatment is focused on reducing the discomfort caused due to ankylosing spondylitis. Current treatment options include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen and naproxen); disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (methotrexate); and biologics (secukinumab, certolizumab pegol, and infliximab). The market is expected to expand in the near future because of increase in research and development expenditure, rise in the number of treatment seeking population, and high unmet needs of current treatment in terms of appropriate drugs. However, loss of patent exclusivity of certain products such as etanercept and launch of biosimilars act as key restraints for the growth of the ankylosing spondylitis market. Request brochure @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag... The global ankylosing spondylitis market can be segmented based on molecule type, route of administration, and geography. In terms of molecule type, the market can be segregated into small molecules, biologics, and biosimilars. The biologics segment is expected to grow as compared to the small molecules segment as the former segment has shown more promising results in clinical development. The biosimilars segment may change the landscape of the ankylosing spondylitis market as it is likely to impact on the cost of the treatment. Based on route of administration, the market can be divided into oral and parenteral. The parenteral segment is expected to grow as majority of molecules in the clinical development for ankylosing spondylitis are given via this route. for Specific and Customized requirements@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag... In terms of geography, the market can be classified into North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Middle East & Africa. North America dominates the ankylosing spondylitis market, followed by Europe, due to higher incidence and prevalence rate, adoption of newer treatment options, and availability of improved diagnostic tools and health care infrastructure. Asia Pacific is an emerging market for ankylosing spondylitis due to the developing health care infrastructure, increasing patient pool, and rising government expenditure in the health care industry. However, affordability issues and lack of proper treatment are factors restraining the market growth in regions such as Middle East & Africa and Latin America. Major players operating in the global ankylosing spondylitis market include AbbVie Inc., Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc., Pfizer Inc., Sandoz International GmbH, Amgen Inc., Protalix BioTherapeutics, Inc., Reliance Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd., Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc., Celgene Corporation, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and Merck & Co. Inc. Pre Book full report@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/checkout.php?rep_id=26...

In his opening address, the Prime Minister made the following remarks,\u201cAs the host, I would like to offer a few remarks on the occasion of the Awards Ceremony Related to the FY2017 Week of Persons with Disabilities, which is being held in the presence of Their Imperial Highnesses the Crown Prince and Crown Princess. I am truly delighted today to present the awards to honor the achievements of the recipients who are involved in the promotion of national understanding of disabilities, consideration for people with disabilities, and the improvement of welfare, toward the realization of an inclusive society in which all people, regardless of whether they have a disability, mutually respect and support each other\u2019s characters and individuality, and can be active and enjoy a life that suits them. The essays and posters created by the award recipients today candidly reveal love for family members with disabilities or the courage to face one\u2019s own disabilities, and the new discoveries and growth that have arisen as a result. They are all wonderful works and touched me deeply. In addition, the people who are receiving awards for distinguished contributions today have stood up for persons with disabilities in their respective fields for many years, and earnestly built up their achievements in succession, toward the improvement of the welfare of persons with disabilities. I would like to once again express my deep respect for the efforts and contributions of all the recipients, who form the basis of policies regarding persons with disabilities and some of whom also themselves serve as models for the independent participation in society of persons with disabilities. I strongly hope that today\u2019s awards will further promote understanding of disabilities and consideration for persons with disabilities by all the people of Japan. The Government pledges to continue to exert its full efforts toward the realization of an inclusive society. I would like to conclude my remarks by expressing my wish for the continued health and success of all of you, and even greater development of your endeavors.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "disabil", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shinzo abe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "tokyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:08:36.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1dd96943c2678cae4874100f35e7ca76e1b36038", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21QK74rcpt22Kvz7qEhKwC2S_JBrHWqccT4P1gB.DSeVd7ihLr8OSys3IQ52by0.RHQi58miWXMUirXXAozaZfIOkhk7jeZtKN8RSrBL9Yk5Kw--", "site_full": "aipeup3dkl.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://aipeup3dkl.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "ALL INDIA POSTAL EMPLOYEES UNION, GROUP - C, DHENKANAL DIVISION", "title": "Latest information on Implementation of Cadre Restructuring Proposal in Odisha Circle", "title_full": "Latest information on Implementation of Cadre Restructuring Proposal in Odisha Circle", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1dd96943c2678cae4874100f35e7ca76e1b36038", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21QK74rcpt22Kvz7qEhKwC2S_JBrHWqccT4P1gB.DSeVd7ihLr8OSys3IQ52by0.RHQi58miWXMUirXXAozaZfIOkhk7jeZtKN8RSrBL9Yk5Kw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "AIPEU, Gr - C, Dhenkanal Division (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "Latest information on Implementation of Cadre Restructuring Proposal in Odisha Circle", "text": "After receipt of the revised order on Cadre Restructuring, we were in continuous touch with the Circle Office. \n\nSince the Chief PMG, Odisha Circle was out of the headquarters for visit to Sambalpur and Baripada after his operation, the matter became delayed. \n\nAs per latest information collected from CO , the Chief PMG has returned to the headquarters on 6.12.2017 and the identification of the additional LSG Posts (114) with down gradation of HSG -II posts (17) and upgradation of HSG-I posts (13) may take a final shape today and accordingly memo may be released today or tomorrow. \n\nAfter identification, since DPC has already been completed taking into account the additional posts, final allotment order to Regions / Divisional will be issued very shortly. \n\nB SAMAL \nCircle Secretary ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "dpc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pmg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sambalpur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baripada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:08:36.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0d6367dd1fd2925828fc350a9f8cf4e8e7162183", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkd6Ay60oCLGDvxpqJdPXmAw68arbA.i9hIbH3XV.ztf_OGpxhHnH4sC2ouj.uftyxX_CHxytSEfzVEE3NWnXyYCvJhFVZ_tT0xNUp3jGRpJNmQjJv3gElko", "site_full": "www.americanbankingnews.com", "site": "americanbankingnews.com", "site_section": "http://feeds2.feedburner.com/AmericanBankingNews", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "American Banking News", "title": "DineEquity Inc (DIN) Given Consensus Rating of \u201cHold\u201d by Brokerages", "title_full": "DineEquity Inc (DIN) Given Consensus Rating of \u201cHold\u201d by Brokerages", "published": "2017-12-07T10:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/dineequity-inc-logo.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0d6367dd1fd2925828fc350a9f8cf4e8e7162183", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkd6Ay60oCLGDvxpqJdPXmAw68arbA.i9hIbH3XV.ztf_OGpxhHnH4sC2ouj.uftyxX_CHxytSEfzVEE3NWnXyYCvJhFVZ_tT0xNUp3jGRpJNmQjJv3gElko", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ABMN Staff", "published": "2017-12-07T10:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "DineEquity Inc (DIN) Given Consensus Rating of \u201cHold\u201d by Brokerages", "text": "Tweet \nShares of DineEquity Inc (NYSE:DIN) have earned a consensus rating of \u201cHold\u201d from the eleven ratings firms that are presently covering the firm, Marketbeat Ratings reports.

Which means the confirmation wasnt actually confirmed\nWhat people really need to know about IOTA...\n1) THE MARKETPLACE tangle has NOTHING NOTHING to do with the tangle that trades IOTA . It is a completely different tangle, called TestNET.. WTH would that matter for the tangle that uses Mi's . ?? Its complete hype to assume that your IOTA would be in the same tangle that the data marketplace would be trading ...\n2) IOTA is suppose to be unlimited scaling .. And with more users and nodes the faster it becomes ... This is false in so many ways it has scam'ish written all over it.. ( Like spam acts on a tangle ) Why did the tangle come to a complete halt? Where is this claim of unlimited scaling >?\n3) Spam attacks - why would you attack a tangle with spam if you are not benefiting from it . Email scammers are at least profiting from data... Tangle spamming does nothing at all\n4) ALL EXCHANGES have frozen WITHDRAWALS to your iota wallets. Why would they do that during the biggest price jump.. You own Iota, you would like to transfer it back into the exchange, BUT YOU CANT , because the TANGLE OWNS YOU ... Hold your IOTAS till the dev dumps more iotas into the exchange and cashs out for a massive massive profit ..\n5) Why would you own IOTA if it was completely useless. ? For the last couple days the IOTA has been completely USELESS.. Speculation that the NEW wallet wont be open to SPAM attacks?\n6) Wallet upgrades - Promises of \"sometime\" in the future for wallet upgrades is planned yet no information is made public of release dates ..\n7) One transaction per wallet - I have to own 13 wallets to actually be able to transfer between and from .\n8) Micro transactions are complete bogus.. Have you ever tried to send 100,000i's .. ?\n9)Speed, All nodes and wallets are completely slow , comparable to dial up .\n10) I want to love IOTA so badly, but cant fine ONE reason I shouldnt dump all my IOTAS ...\nInpuT ?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:08:36.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "701b54d3d3f5b32bcfd3931ba83004989a049e48", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.87ohzHzuPF_yWpWy60ceBMY5195Osq5jDUBHQicIakLwinFBr1NJl6wQW36qde24rebzGVkw0k_gnR0FlwbqbocJF3yZn20URU1Hq_FpY6aAc.IDgRQvKqHG.TS.FxA4-", "site_full": "www.marketwatch.com", "site": "marketwatch.com", "site_section": "http://www.marketwatch.com/topics/subjects/cloud-computing?prop=industry&propval=internet%20hardware", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Cloud Computing - MarketWatch.com Topics", "title": "The most explosive cryptocurrency these days is not bitcoin - MarketWatch", "title_full": "The most explosive cryptocurrency these days is not bitcoin - MarketWatch", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FZ689_backbo_MG_20171206125201.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 900, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "437c26ff766d6d1847573c05e607003b63290354", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.87ohzHzuPF_yWpWy60ceBMY5195Osq5jDUBHQicIakLwinFBr1NJl6wQW36qde24rebzGVkw0k_gnR0FlwbqbocJF3yZn20URU1Hq_FpY6aAc.IDgRQvKlFBf2v74qhcDn_iUI88Dx.Q_MC5OicRS", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Big Daddy Investor Money Man", "published": "2017-12-06T23:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "just not interested in Bitcoin.

It is commonly known as dry eye syndrome or dry eye. Major symptoms include irritation, blurred vision, and burning sensation. If left untreated, it leads to pain, ulcers, and loss of some vision. Complete loss of vision is uncommon with the dry eye disease. Alternative medical terms which are used to describe the dry eye disease include keratoconjunctivitis sicca (affects cornea and conjunctiva), keratitis sicca (dryness and inflammation of the cornea), and dysfunctional tear syndrome (inadequate quality of tears). Report Overview and TOC @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/dry-eye-disease-market... The two types of the disease are aqueous tear-deficient dry eye and evaporative dry eye. In aqueous tear-deficient dry eye, the lacrimal glands fail to produce ample of the aqueous component of tears to uphold a healthy eye surface. Evaporative dry eye may result from inflammation of the meibomian glands. These glands make the lipid part of tears that slow down evaporation and keep the tears stable. Globally, the dry eye disease affects approximately 60 million people. This disorder can affect individuals of any age, but it is most common in elderly people (prevalence of about 5%-30% above the age of 60\u2009years). It affects primarily women as compared to men due to hormonal changes. Use of certain medications such as antihistamines, analgesics, and antidepressants increases the risk of developing the dry eye disease. People with diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and thyroid problems are more likely to have symptoms of the disease.Request brochure @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag... The dry eye disease has been recognized as an inflammatory process. The primary approach to treat the disease includes adding tears using over-the-counter artificial tear solutions, increasing tear production (omega-3 fatty acid), and treating the inflammation (topical cyclosporine and topical corticosteroids). Drug manufacturing companies such as Ocular Therapeutix, Inc. are focused on new treatment strategies, targeting potential targets such as glucocorticoid receptor which can improve the current standard of care. Additionally, the dry eye disease has become a target for device development (Oculeve neurostimulator device) which addresses different and innovative ways to treat the disease. As of 2017, the clinical pipeline of the disease consists of 50 drug molecules, out of which 44% are small molecules, 2% are small molecules, 21% are peptides, and 33% are others. Increased in research and development expenditure, development of new treatment strategies, growth in patient awareness about the treatment are factors fueling the dry eye disease market. However, increase in use of self-medication such as over-the-counter medications or home remedies acts as a key restraint for the growth of the dry eye disease market.The global dry eye disease market has been segmented by product type and geography. Based on product type, the market has been divided into small molecules, biologics, and others. The small molecules segment is expected to grow as compared to other therapeutic segments because the majority of pipeline molecules for the treatment of dry eye disease are small molecules.for Specific and Customized requirements@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag... Geographically, the global market is classified into five regions: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Middle East & Africa. The Europe and North America markets are expected to grow as compared to the Asia Pacific and Middle East & Africa markets due to higher prevalence rate, increase in the use of other medications such as antihistamine, and rise in geriatric population. Asia Pacific is likely to be an emerging market in the next few years due to the developing health care infrastructure, rising government expenditure in the health care industry, increasing use of effective diagnostic tools, and growing prevalence rate of the disease. However, lack of proper treatment and poor patient awareness are restraining the growth of the market in regions such as Middle East & Africa and Latin America.Major players operating in the dry eye disease market include Novartis International AG, Ocular Therapeutix, Inc., Allergan Plc., LTT Bio-Pharma, RegeneRx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Alcon Research, Ltd., Xigen SA., Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and Novaliq GmbH.Pre Book full report@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/checkout.php?rep_id=26...

The team and players will align to our values as a Club and our vision of being the most respected, inclusive and successful Club in Australian sport.\u201d \nThe Global eSports audience is projected to reach 400 million in 2018, made up of nearly 200 million eSports enthusiasts and a further 194 million occasional viewers. In 2017 the eSports economy grew to US$696 million and brands spent approximately US$517 million on advertising, sponsorship and media rights. Consumer spending this year on merchandise and tickets will amount to US$64 million. \nLeague of Legends OPL is the most developed and professional eSports league in Oceania. Backed by Riot Games, the leading publisher in eSports globally, the OPL provides teams a direct path to global competitions including the League of Legends World Championships. \nMany professional sports clubs have invested in eSports, including NBA teams Philadelphia 76ers and Miami Heat, the New York Yankees, European soccer powerhouses Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain, FC Schalke and AS Roma and in Australia, the Adelaide Crows. \nExecutive Sports and Entertainment (ESE), is a leading Sydney agency founded in 1998. ESE managing directors Leon Spellson and Rohan Sawyer have over 35 years combined experience in sports and entertainment industry and have been seen as key players in Australia eSports commercially. ESE specialise in commercial rights across a number of sports and the joint venture with EFC is another high profile partnership for the agency. \nRohan Sawyer, Managing Director of ESE said: \u201cWe are thrilled to partner with one of the biggest and most respected sports Clubs in Australia.\u201d \n\u201cEssendon is an iconic brand with a huge supporter base and we are excited to give our team members the opportunities to live their dreams under a great club. \n\u201ceSports has already exploded globally and we see League of Legends and the OPL doing the same here. \n\u201cThe majority of gamers are aged 18 to 30 years old and with most sporting codes and brands are struggling to communicate with them, eSports provides the platform for direct engagement.\u201d \nDaniel Ringland, Head of eSports at Riot Games Oceania, said: \u201cIt is great to have another AFL Club come on board to support an OPL team. Next year is looking to be our most competitive year yet and it is going to be amazing to see AFC and Essendon go head to head in the OPL, just like they do on the footy field.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rodski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leon spellson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rohan sawyer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel ringland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin rodski", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "essendon footbal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "essendon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "essendon football club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "efc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fc schalke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "opl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york yankees", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oceanic challenger league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia 76ers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "league of legends", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oceanic pro league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ese", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victorian afl club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami heat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afl club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris saint-germain", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "manchester city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oceania", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:08:37.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e4438e15c07ac0a680144cf4814f7e707550f3bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR93qbSsuKmhHiLKTqP7yZwWAL1nsWDUxeoRf4tvk7aCb_q8DYnCl78OT3J6aJlzqRVGtooh2Hox_AbYIJ1EkiVSULf0TioVxgcc2SGs_AIlPsWOwBIvOCm4LNuBgksJA4zBHdSoI3oiiBX0AryxBJ.g.nJqhtSpJuIEK00YS2WOg--", "site_full": "www.nbcnews.com", "site": "nbcnews.com", "site_section": "https://www.nbcnews.com/", "site_categories": ["media", "television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "NBC News Top Stories", "title": "World leaders slam Trump's 'dangerous' Jerusalem move", "title_full": "World leaders slam Trump's 'dangerous' Jerusalem move", "published": "2017-12-07T09:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 478, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 6981, "comments": 0, "shares": 6981}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e4438e15c07ac0a680144cf4814f7e707550f3bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR93qbSsuKmhHiLKTqP7yZwWAL1nsWDUxeoRf4tvk7aCb_q8DYnCl78OT3J6aJlzqRVGtooh2Hox_AbYIJ1EkiVSULf0TioVxgcc2SGs_AIlPsWOwBIvOCm4LNuBgksJA4zBHdSoI3oiiBX0AryxBJ.g.nJqhtSpJuIEK00YS2WOg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Safia Samee Ali and Rima Abdelkader", "published": "2017-12-07T09:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "World leaders slam Trump's 'dangerous' Jerusalem move", "text": "Palestinians burn posters depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Donald Trump during a protest against the U.S. intention to move its embassy to Jerusalem and to recognize the city of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on December 6, 2017 in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "benjamin netanyahu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald t", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rafah", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:08:37.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c03fd82a584edeaf8e7f4e8c488d7ed9aff7599a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.T4RGWjLQM264Tpv76raWKfaoUFRuwYvnG9z3ya0RgrfOqi2UiiIJj8xQqXlpyPE9BmcJgFNJMCQ--", "site_full": "www.cosportbikeclub.org", "site": "cosportbikeclub.org", "site_section": "http://www.cosportbikeclub.org/forums/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Activity Stream -
