The London Bullion Market is known as the primary global bullion market trading platform for gold and silver . BREAKING DOWN 'Bullion Market' \nThe bullion market is generally known as the market for gold and silver trading. The bullion market is the primary source for gold and silver trading quotes throughout the day. Multiple bullion markets exist across the globe. These bullion markets are typically characterized as over the counter markets. Bullion markets exist in New York, Zurich and Tokyo with London serving as the location for the largest global bullion market. Bullion market trading is known to have a high turnover rate with transactions conducted electronically or by phone. The industrial uses of gold and silver are the primary market drivers for the pricing of the precious metals. Gold and silver traded in the bullion market can sometimes be used as a safe-haven investment or hedge against inflation which may also affect its trading value. \nThe bullion market is just one of several ways to invest in gold and silver. Other options include exchange-traded funds and mutual funds. These options can be more appealing to investors, because they offer greater flexibility. The SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) is the largest gold exchanged-traded fund by assets as of November 30, 2017. Assets in the fund were $34.6 billion with a trading price of $121.10. \nPhysical bullion offers less trading flexibility than other gold and silver investments, because it is a tangible object that comes in bars and coins of established sizes, which can be difficult to buy or sell in specific amounts. Bullion is also expensive to store and insure. London Bullion Market \nThe London Bullion Market is the primary bullion market for trading globally. The London Bullion Market is an over the counter market open 24 hours a day. It transacts gold and silver at market spot prices and also includes trading of forwards and options on the metals. The market is maintained by the London Bullion Market Association which has established standards for production quality of metals transacted and settled within the market. It offers a global standard for precious metal transactions. As of November 30, 2017, gold was trading at USD1,280.20 or GBP948.88 on the London Bullion Market exchange.

Our February budget will show our long-term commitment to building a system of accessible, affordable and quality child care for families across the province,\u201d said Minister of State for Child Care Katrina Chen in a statement. \nMajor projects include the Board of Education for the Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows, which is receiving more than $3 million for seven projects to create a total of 308 spaces. The City of Vancouver will receive $1.5 million for three projects and in Prince George, $1.1 million will be spent to create 145 spaces. \nThe province will work with successful proponents to establish funding agreements and construction and renovations for most of the approved projects will begin shortly, a government news release stated.

Staff reports \nHingham\u2019s Lily Farden and Milton\u2019s Casey O\u2019Brien were two of 23 players selected by USA Hockey on Monday for its Under-18 Women\u2019s National Team that will compete at the 2018 International Ice Hockey Federation Under-18 Women\u2019s World Championship, set for Jan. 6-13 in Dmitrov, Russia. \nThe roster features seven players that helped the U.S. earn gold at last year\u2019s Under-18 championship in Zlin and Prerov, Czech Republic. Twenty-one players also participated in the 2017 Under-18 Series vs. Canada last August in Lake Placid, N.Y. \nThe roster includes 12 forwards, eight defensemen and three goaltenders, representing 10 different states. Minnesota leads the pack with 10 representatives, followed by Massachusetts with three players. \nFarden is a junior defenseman at Noble and Greenough School in Dedham. O\u2019Brien previously played at Nobles but now is at Shattuck-St. Mary\u2019s School in Faribault, Minn., where she\u2019ll be a sophomore with plans to attend the University of Wisconsin in 2020-21. Farden plans to play at Harvard in 2019-20. \nBoth players will participate in a one-week training camp in late December, and then will depart for Moscow on Jan. 2. \nTeam USA is the three-time defending gold medalist in this tournament. \nFarden and O\u2019Brien earned their spots through a multi-stage tryout process this past summer, which culminated in a three-game series against Team Canada in Lake Placid in August. Farden was a First Team All-New England selection as a sophomore, and was also named to the Pre-Season All-American Girls Hockey Team by the USA Today in November. \n\u201cThere is no greater honor in sports than to wear the jersey of your country,\u201d Farden said in a press release. \u201cWe will do our best to represent the USA in this competitive tournament. I am blessed to be a part of such a strong group of teammates, coaches, and administrators. USA Hockey has been great for my personal and hockey development over the years. Hopefully we can return home with another gold medal.\u201d \nThe games will be available on the streaming service MyHockey.com, and the official schedule is posted at www.iihf.com. \n-- CHRIS McDANIEL \nIn other high school news: \nBASEBALL \nBC High coach honored: Norm Walsh will be inducted into the National High School Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame next year.

BOYS HOCKEY: Hingham must replace firepower   9:15 PM Dec 6, 2017 at 10:56 PM The Harbormen lost a lot of goals when last season's talented senior class departed. Now players such as Frankie Higgins, Marshall Terres and Tom Kornack must step up. Marisa Ingemi, For The Patriot Ledger \nHINGHAM \u2013 One thing the members of the Hingham High boys hockey team know how to do is win. \nNot only has the team been to the past two Super 8 tournaments \u2013 this after capturing a Division 1 state title three seasons ago \u2013 but a bulk of the squad also won a lacrosse state championship last spring. \nFor a program with 14 playoff appearances in 18 years, including a Super 8 crown in 2009-10, success is the only option. \nSeveral key players have graduated \u2013 Marc O\u2019Rourke and Jack Hennessey are preparing for their first college lacrosse seasons, and leaders Stephen Jacobs and Jeff Gordon are also gone. Those four, each a Patriot Ledger All-Scholastic pick, combined for 32 goals, 49 assists and 81 points last winter. Fellow graduates Jack Grady and Drew Hickey combined for 27 more points. \nThe Harbormen now need to look deep within themselves to make up that missing production. \n\u201cI think we have a bit of an inexperienced team; some people would call it young,\u201d said coach Tony Messina, whose team opens its season at home against Framingham on Monday. \u201cWe have a small core returning. A good part of the team is guys who have been waiting their turn in line to contribute.\u201d \nAfter posting a 16-6-2 record last season, expectations remain, no matter who is suiting up. Losing, two games to none, in the Super 8 quarterfinals for the second year in a row \u2013 this time to eventual champ Arlington, with each game a 4-1 score \u2013 was a tough look, and Hingham is motivated to go deeper in the Div. 1A tournament this winter. \nSenior captains Frankie Higgins, Marshall Terres and Tom Kornack figure to shoulder much of the load. \nIn net, Rob Kornack returns as an anchor of stability for the new-look roster. He allowed just 1.50 goals per game last season, along with six shutouts, as the Harbormen surrendered just 33 goals in 22 regular-season games. \n\u201cWe have some work to do, but we have a good group of guys from last year, too,\u201d said Messina. \u201cWe want to bring the younger guys in and make them feel comfortable. Everything else takes place on the ice.\u201d \nIn the Super 8 last season, the Harbormen had the misfortune of running into a hot goalie in Arlington\u2019s Jack Pinard. With even less scoring returning than last year, Hingham will have to get creative to beat the best the state has to offer. \nJunior Will Kenney is slated for a big year as a scorer, according to Messina, and senior Jake Quilty is more than capable beside him. Juniors Jacob Clark and John Sullivan are also projected to \u201ccontribute significantly,\u201d Messina said. \nWith so many roster spots open for players to make a name for themselves, the Harbormen will have a more competitive battle for minutes than in years past. \nBut that doesn\u2019t mean Hingham isn\u2019t a force to be reckoned with. Even with some drastic losses, the Harbormen\u2019s depth looks strong, especially along the blueline. \nIt\u2019s just about those players stepping up. \n\u201cWe do have some guys from last year who are very confident we can get there,\u201d said Messina. \u201cWe also have guys who were a part of the team who know what it takes and who will get a shot now.\u201d About Us", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john sullivan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob kornack", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drew hickey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "messina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "junior will kenney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack hennessey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff gordon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony messina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harbormen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marisa ingemi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack pinard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frankie higgins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom kornack", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen jacobs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jake quilty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacob clark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack grady", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marshall terres", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marc o\u2019rourke", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hingham high", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hingham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hingham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "framingham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arlington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:16.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "92d4a63f544ee8656253e77f1c591bfca1179931", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ50HWkEALmJMhgrQ5d93EilL3B29ELNT2tB5Eehjds8T5hCaP4TNQc2aLB35zV4jkkh.cczBhRFw--", "site_full": "thefiringline.com", "site": "thefiringline.com", "site_section": "https://thefiringline.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=5", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "The Hunt - The Firing Line Forums", "title": "Formula for figuring live weight?", "title_full": "Formula for figuring live weight?

We are always looking for ways to make refugees feel as comfortable as possible in uncomfortable and stressful surroundings and a lot of that has to do with how the space and surroundings are designed. While a refugee settlement may not look superficially like a city, it is exactly like a city. Resources flow in and out, people work either formally or informally, they deal with health issues, governance issues, all the complexities exist plus additional ones with these particular circumstances.\u201d \nWeinreich said the average length of stay in a refugee camp is now 24 years. \nFor a major project in an urban setting to be successful, the architects said, efforts should be made to understand the local culture. The kilns that existed in Jingdezhen were more than sources of building materials, they were an integral part of the community fabric, said Zhu \u2014 on cold days students would carry a hot brick from a kiln in their schoolbags to stay warm. \nAnd so the museum he designed features a series of arched exhibition spaces that are open to the sky in places, welcoming the outside in. \nHudson Yards is the largest private development in the United States with some 18-million-square-feet of mixed-use development slated to be built. Cusumano admitted that despite best efforts to minimize the impact of construction on existing neighbourhoods, it was unavoidable there would be complaints. Designers are aiming to create a people place that will accommodate an estimated 65,000 daily visitors when completed. \nCommented Doran in an interview, \u201cMy main message would be the imperative in getting involved early in any project process to help shape it the right way and yield something that is not expected. With the Hudson Yards project, get involved early enough to deal with all the complexity and thinking of all the players and not just showing up and taking it for granted. \u201cThe refugee camp, the same thing, how do you engage your constituency early in the process. \nThat is what we do and the Chinese project as well, with the archeology.\u201d \nDoran\u2019s firm began working with the Malawi Ministry of Health to address the fact that in Malawi, one in 36 women had a lifetime risk of dying during pregnancy or delivery, in part because there are so few skilled health care professionals in smaller villages. MASS designed maternity waiting villages for pregnant women after their 36th week, with clusters of four-bedroom units built around a courtyard offering protected spaces.

Advertisement Advertisement \nIt is made in a wood-burning brick oven and has two classic versions: Marinara (tomato, garlic, oregano and oil) and, the most famous, Margherita (tomato, mozzarella, oil and basil), giving it the red, white and green colors of the Italian flag. \nTradition holds that the Margherita pizza was created in 1889 by a local chef in honor of Queen Margherita, who was visiting Naples, south of Rome on Italy's Tyrrhenian coast. \nAs pizza has become a favorite dish around the world, foreign innovations in toppings have often left Italians perplexed and aghast. \nMatteo Martino, a customer at Fiore's pizzeria, said before the expected announcement, \"I think, and I hope, that this could be the chance to make foreigners understand how pizza is made, without Nutella or pineapple.\" \nUNESCO also accepted Chogan, an Iranian horse-riding game accompanied by music and storytelling, and the craft of millers operating windmills and watermills in the Netherlands. \nTraditional boat making on the Indonesian island of South Sulawesi, and Nsima, a maize-based culinary tradition from the African country of Malawi, also joined the list. \nFood culture already on the UNESCO list includes Turkish coffee culture and tradition, the gingerbread craft of northern Croatia and the traditional ancient Georgian method of Qvevri wine-making. \n(Reporting by Reuters Television; Writing by Darren Schuettler and Isla Binnie; Editing by Clarence Fernandez) Source: Reuters", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "margherita", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fiore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clarence fernandez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matteo martino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isla binnie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darren schuettler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "romano fiore", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "intangible cultural heritage of humanity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unesco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters television", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyrrhenian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rome", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeju", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malawi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naples", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nsima", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south sulawesi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "croatia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:16.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d1dd2ca68de10dab9b676f16779811e2ab3223c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_jdaWzY8D0xsTEqwTKP5b18P1ktuJOnssA8JwBdrHxBs8HjPRSsvtkAgZbssAxxuPJ.W30qOF0DT.TdF2dRYsSwJwaDcKbOjT_gJ_ZVM79GGFD0Ie_KnXjpczNLex_WIM-", "site_full": "www.patriotledger.com", "site": "patriotledger.com", "site_section": "http://www.patriotledger.com/sports?template=rss&mime=xml", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Sports - The Patriot Ledger, Quincy, MA", "title": "H.S.

BOYS BASKETBALL: Spellman not starting from scratch   10:51 PM Dec 6, 2017 at 10:56 PM The Cardinals return all five starters from last season's 14-7 club. Scott Roche, Enterprise Correspondent \nBROCKTON \u2013 At the beginning of the season, basketball coaches spend the first few practices and scrimmages looking for returning and new players to their program to replace starters lost to graduation. \nThat is not the case for the the Cardinal Spellman High boys basketball team this winter. \nThe Cardinals return all five of their starters, along with several key players from their bench, from a 14-7 team last season that dropped a heartbreaking first-round tournament game to Old Rochester. \n\u201cIt makes it easier, having a lot of kids around that where here last year,\u201d Cardinal Spellman coach Mike Perry said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for the kids knowing the drills we do and it makes it easier to go over the offense and run our presses.\u2019\u2019 \nSenior AJ Jaramillo is back for his fourth year running the point, while senior forward Mikey Spencer also begins his fourth year on the varsity. \n\u201cAJ is a very good point guard,\u2019\u2019 said Perry. \u201cHe can score going to the basket and he can also hit the pull-up jumper. He\u2019s fast, in his fourth year and is an exceptional talent that is a good leader.\u201d \nSpencer averaged 19 points a game last year and the senior can score both inside and outside. \n\u201cMikey can step out and shoot the ball,\u2019\u2019 Perry said. \u201cHe\u2019s also tough on the boards. He averaged a double-double last year. His game keeps getting better, while his body has filled out and he has got stronger and faster.\u201d \nSenior guard Tyrone Smith-McCray and senior center Will Cournan return for their third year with Perry, while sophomore guard Craig Faria returns after starting as a freshman. \n\u201cTyrone is a catalyst and when AJ and Tyrone have the ball in their hands, they get us going,\u2019\u2019 Perry said. \u201cTyrone plays very good defense, is good on the boards and has developed nicely as a leader. Will is a scrapper that might score six or seven points a game and grab some rebounds, but he\u2019s always on the floor and does a lot of the stuff that doesn\u2019t end up in the paper. \n\u201cCraig has got a really nice game and has very good court sense. He can shoot the 3 and get to the basket. He\u2019s got good size at 6-3 and we use him at the top of our presses.\u2019\u2019 \nPerry returns several players who saw significant time last season in Pat Gildea, Rob Maguire, Chris Alty, Pat Brooks, Radge Pierre-Paul and Dakari Weston, while sophomore Mike Marshall is expected to break into Perry\u2019s rotation this year. \n\u201cOne thing that we have seen in our first two scrimmages is that there isn\u2019t a big drop-off when we go to our bench,\u2019\u2019 said Perry. \u201cAll these kids play well together. If we play together on the offensive and defensive end and they believe in each other, we can be a really good team.\u2019\u2019 \nOn top of playing their Catholic Central League games, the Cardinals once again has a non-league schedule that should help them come tournament time. Spellman will open the season Friday night at home against St. Ignatius of Australia and host Wilsonville of Oregon on New Year\u2019s Eve, on top of playing non-league games against Division 1 powerhouse BC High and a game against Mansfield at TD Garden in Boston in January. The Cardinals will also play two-time defending Division 2 South champion Whitman-Hanson and will participate in the Oliver Ames Christmas tournament for a second straight year. \n\u201cWe hope to compete in those games and come away with some wins,\u2019\u2019 Perry said. \u201cLast year we had a tough schedule with Malden Catholic, Algonquin and Holyoke and did well. These games will only makes us better.\u201d About Us", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "spellman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyrone smith-mccray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pat gildea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris alty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mansfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig faria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott roche", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob maguire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aj jaramillo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "algonquin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spencer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyrone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mikey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "radge pierre-paul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike marshall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike perry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mikey spencer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "will cournan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dakari weston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pat brooks", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "whitman-hanson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malden catholic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cardinals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "td garden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cardinal spellman high", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spellman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cardinal spellman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic central league", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "old rochester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holyoke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brockton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. ignatius of australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilsonville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:16.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5643614a74c9d386eca78c08111a604ce4788c28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJVp.DKH4T0GljUM2yhGVPZplgwPo7Zi6Ga67pjan9xtJ6hocmpXCJdpdOLRt0DMxV8QleW.Flj8dSgD4vTHw5BlgL8gvyYm5pHOzskxBn3HNRSpaBgpBpUOn4O8KxxJXo8-", "site_full": "news.bestnaira.com", "site": "bestnaira.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/bestnaira/BTbw", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Latest News in Nigeria", "title": "Labour seeks special intervention on job security in oil industry", "title_full": "Labour seeks special intervention on job security in oil industry", "published": "2017-12-07T01:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5643614a74c9d386eca78c08111a604ce4788c28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJVp.DKH4T0GljUM2yhGVPZplgwPo7Zi6Ga67pjan9xtJ6hocmpXCJdpdOLRt0DMxV8QleW.Flj8dSgD4vTHw5BlgL8gvyYm5pHOzskxBn3HNRSpaBgpBpUOn4O8KxxJXo8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BestNaira", "published": "2017-12-07T01:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Labour seeks special intervention on job security in oil industry", "text": "Thu Dec 7th, 2017 - Rivers \nStories by Victor Ahiuma-Young \nT HE increasing loss of jobs and high level of depletion in membership were parts of the focal issues that dominated the National Executive Council, NEC, meeting of the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, NUPENG, held in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. \nIn fact, for members of the union\u2019s NEC, the spate of redundancies and closures of oil firms in the country at the moment is unprecedented, insisting that the government needs to do something fast to arrest the situation. R-L: Joseph Ogbebor, General Secretary, Nigeria Union of Pretroleum and Natural Gas Workers, NUPENG; Igwe Achese, President, NUPENG; Asuquo Okon Deputy President, NUPENG and Bala Mohammed National Auditor of NUPENG, briefing after the Union\u2019s NEC meeting in Port Harcourt, Photo: Nwankpa Chijioke \nNUPENG in a communique issued by its President and General Secretary, Igwe Achese and Joseph Ogbebor respectively, called for a special intervention machinery to address the causes of the closures and redundancies with a view to saving jobs in the industry. \nAccording to the communique, \u201cThe increasing loss of jobs and high level of union membership depletion in the industry was one of the major issues discussed and deliberated upon at the meeting, with the NEC-in-session attributing the worrisome situation to unprecedented spate of redundancies and closures of oil firms in the country. The house finds the situation baffling and confounding bearing in mind the increases in the prices of crude oil and relative peace in the oil producing communities which ought to translate to increasing oil production activities in the industry. \n\u201cIt was noted, that the causes of these company closures and redundancies with its attendant job losses are much more than poor global oil market. We therefore call on the federal government to quickly set up intervention machinery to address the ugly and undesirable trend with a view of saving jobs and reduce poverty in the land.\u201d \nSimilarly, the communique noted that members of NEC also \u201cdeliberated extensively on the increasing and continuing usage of skilled and competent Nigerians as modern day slaves in their country under the unscrupulous guise of contract staffing. The meeting noted with serious concern, that the adoption of contract staffing as a method of employment engagement with its attendant abuses without any apparent institutional guidelines and control has generally entrenched workers\u2019 rights abuses and inhumane treatment of Nigerian workers by both Multinational oil corporations and indigenous oil companies. \n\u201cThe NEC-in- Session calls on the National Assembly, the Executive arm of Government and other relevant bodies to urgently intervene and rescue oil and gas workers from the exploitative and abuses of the employers in the industry.\u201d \nThe protracted unresolved labour issues in the sector, the communique said, were also looked into, saying \u201cThe NEC-in-session examined long list of unresolved labour issues involving Seawolf Drilling Company, Chevron and their labour Contractors, Tecon Oil Services, Universal Energy Limited, Agip, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Specialty Drilling and Fugro Nigeria, Nigeria Agip Oil Company, Forte oil, Oando, MRS, Conoil, NIPCO and other private depots. \n\u201cThese issues range from non-payment of terminal benefits, short payment of terminal benefits, implementation/ refusal to renew CBA, arbitrary declaration of redundancies, refusal to unionization, victimization of workers due to union activities etc. The Council -in-session called on the Federal Government and all relevant agencies to urgently intervene in order to avoid the brewing industrial relations crisis in the oil and gas industry.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "victor ahiuma-young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph ogbebor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bala mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "igwe achese", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asuquo okon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nigeria union of pretroleum and natural gas workers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "exxon mobil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national executive council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "specialty drilling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nipco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal government", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nwankpa chijioke  nupeng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tecon oil services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fugro nigeria, nigeria agip oil company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "agip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seawolf drilling company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria union of petroleum and natural gas workers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nupeng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rivers state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chevron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "universal energy limited", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "port harcourt", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:22:16.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b1ccbb3f77d7c199913eb47e374e1143bdc0423c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxUl5XaPQ9WeJOesupv5r.j7uf8R2dSY2JK8Iu5YeVC.7Pl9_taeCmC9F1hU4BshPRzsYig0QwUIA--", "site_full": "f30.bimmerpost.com", "site": "bimmerpost.com", "site_section": "http://f30.bimmerpost.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=412", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "UK -

The project is a development by ICE District Properties Joint Venture and forms part of a 25-acre mixed-use revitalization initiative in downtown Edmonton. \nDowntown Edmonton\u2019s once-static skyline is changing in a big way. A mixed-use 69-storey tower under construction will, at 250 metres, be the tallest building in Western Canada when it is completed next year. Stantec/ Edmonton\u2019s Stantec Tower, at 69-storeys, will be the tallest building in Western Canada when it is finished next year. The building will feature an office tower 29 floors below a 39-storey residential tower. Stantec is the consulting engineer on the project and PCL Constructors is the construction manager. \nStantec/ Edmonton\u2019s Stantec Tower, at 69-storeys, will be the tallest building in Western Canada when it is finished next year. The building will feature an office tower 29 floors below a 39-storey residential tower. Stantec is the consulting engineer on the project and PCL Constructors is the construction manager. \nThe design building team for the concrete cast-in-place building known as Stantec Tower faces a number of challenges, partly because the tower is very tall and partly because it is essentially two buildings: an office tower on 29 floors below a 39-storey residential tower. Both uses require different column grids \u2014 a long-span grid for office floors and a short span for residential floors. \nBut because the two column grids don\u2019t match up, a two-metre-thick concrete slab had to be poured at level 30 recently to transfer the weight of the building from the residential columns to the office columns below, explains David Woo, project, structural engineer of record with Stantec, the consulting engineer on the tower. \nHe says the concrete slab was installed in layers over a 30-hour continuous pour in cold weather. Thermal blankets kept the slab warm during cure to prevent cracking caused by temperature differentials between the core of the slab and its exterior. \nTen to 15 years ago transfer beams were the engineering standard but the high cost of formwork for the beams had engineers devising transfer slabs, which are an economical alternative used to transition loads, Woo says. \nWhile transfer slabs are more common today, they usually are on a low floor or at grade, the engineer says. But because the slab at the Edmonton tower had to transfer weight for 39 floors, the \u201cmassive,\u201d thick concrete pour was required. \nPlacing it on the 30th level, however, created a construction sequencing challenge because the formwork to shore up the weight of the wet concrete would have required at least 20 storeys of reshoring below it, says Woo. \n\u201cThat would affect the construction schedule because you want to button up the building (install curtainwall) as you build up but you can\u2019t do that and have all those reshores running through your building,\u201d he says. \nThe solution? A supporting steel grillage installed at level 29 and tied into the steel outriggers on level 30. It eliminated 20 levels of reshoring and allows construction to remain on schedule, says Woo. \nHe credits PCL Constructors, the project\u2019s construction manager, for coming up with the grillage concept. \nStantec/ Edmonton\u2019s Stantec Tower, at 69-storeys, will be the tallest building in Western Canada when it is finished next year. The building will feature an office tower 29 floors below a 39-storey residential tower. Stantec is the consulting engineer on the project and PCL Constructors is the construction manager. \nDesigning and building that grillage took \u201cmonths and months of planning,\u201d however, to determine what it would look like and how it would affect the building, he says. Another challenge was how to minimize \u201cbuilding drift\u201d and occupant comfort in a windstorm. \n\u201cOne of the biggest challenges in tall towers is dealing with wind,\u201d he says, noting residents in upper floors will feel sway in high winds. \nThe engineering team designed steel outriggers \u2014 essentially steel trusses at the building\u2019s corners tied into the core walls \u2014 to control that drift. \n\u201cThe outrigger system is one of the most efficient ways of designing a lateral system (to minimize sway) for a building this high,\u201d Woo adds. He says because of the site\u2019s poor soil conditions the team had to rethink plans for conventional strip and spread footings to support the structure. Instead, 72 cast-in-place piles or caissons (1.8-metres in diameter) were drilled 58 to 75 metres deep by \u201cone of the biggest rigs in North America.\u201d \nBauer Foundation Corp. was the piling supplier and contractor. \nWoo says another engineering issue in towers soaring above 50 and 60 floors is concrete columns shortening under loading. The Stantec Tower is monitored during construction to ensure the predicted shortening, which is determined through complex computer and even hand calculations, is accurate or adjustments are made to ensure column shortening is in line with the shortening of the shearwalls, says Woo. \n\u201cIn some cases, you might build the columns a bit longer so that when the load comes down it shortens to where it needs to be,\u201d he explains. \nWoo, who has experience engineering 50-storey towers, says a 69-storey tower presents more engineering challenges. \n\u201cYou might think you are just adding 19 more floors but it is definitely more complicated,\u201d he says, \nStantec Tower is a development by ICE District Properties Joint Venture and forms part of a 25-acre mixed-use revitalization initiative in downtown Edmonton.
