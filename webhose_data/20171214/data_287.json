The pair also share the same blood type, which allowed Scott to donate one of her kidneys to Moore this month. (Laura Harvey/The Messenger via AP) Share story LAURA HARVEY LEAD The Associated Press \nNORTONVILLE, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Be thankful for women\u2019s beauty shop banter, for one day, it might save your life. It definitely saved Jason Moore\u2019s. \n\u201cI was getting my hair done, and she was discouraged as a wife,\u201d said Alli Scott, 23. \u201cI got cold chills from my head to my feet when she was talking about it. I knew it was me immediately.\u201d \nScott was Christy Moore\u2019s regular beauty shop client. The couple, who live just on the outskirts of Nortonville, were at their wits end. Jason Moore, now 43, had a kidney transplant when he was 28 years old. A growing cyst had terminated its ability to filter blood, and Jason Moore was facing renal failure. At the time, his sister was a willing and able donor. \nBut there was only one problem: In 2002, the average lifespan of a donated kidney was only eight years. Jason\u2019s sister\u2019s organ had lasted more than 11. By 2014, it too was failing. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. \nThree years later, Jason was on full dialysis and in desperate need of another transplant. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know my blood type,\u201d Scott said. \u201cBut I knew I was giving this kidney.\u201d \nBy the summer of this year, several willing participants had come to Jason\u2019s aid, including his mother-in-law, co-workers and ex-wife. None of them had been a complete match. \nAfter two full days of testing at Saint Thomas Hospital in Nashville, Scott passed the test. \n\u201cIt\u2019s the best physical you could ever have,\u201d Jason Moore said. \u201cIf they catch anything at all, they will cut you out just like that. When you are on waiting list, like I was, they don\u2019t ever tell you where you\u2019re at. \n\u201cThey do say, the average wait is four to seven years,\u201d he added. \nJason Moore had to wait no more. As soon as Scott passed her donor tests and rigorous physical, the transplant surgery was scheduled for Nov. 7. \n\u201cIt went as smoothly as possible,\u201d Christy Moore said. \u201cI had already went through it once before with Jason, but this time, I wasn\u2019t only worried about him. I was worried about Alli. As much as I was worried about him, I wouldn\u2019t have wanted anything in the world to happen to her. I didn\u2019t even want her sore or hurt.\u201d \nScott enjoyed a speedy recovery in Nashville. By Nov. 9, she was back home. Jason Moore was released the following day. \n\u201cHonestly, once you get up and walk around, it gets better,\u201d Scott said. \u201cMoving around does help, it\u2019s ridiculous. But ever since I donated my kidney, I get butterfly feelings, like when you feel your baby move for the first time. It is freaky, but I know it is a blessing.\u201d \nFor Jason Moore, the difference is like night and day. \n\u201cI felt like I had the flu before,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I feel 100 times better. I can\u2019t go back to work for three months because my immune system is suppressed, but I am steadily getting better. I am not on dialysis anymore, and my energy is coming back.\u201d \nRecently, Jason Moore walked himself into the doctor\u2019s office for a checkup at Saint Thomas. Previously, he had to arrive in a wheelchair. \n\u201cThe average life of a kidney before, was eight years,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, they last 16-20 years. Some don\u2019t ever take, so only time will tell. As long as I take care of myself, eat right and exercise, I believe I\u2019ll be okay \u2014 but I\u2019ll take 11.5 years like last time and that\u2019s okay too.\u201d \nAccording to Kentucky Organ Donation Affiliates, 700 Kentuckians are currently on the transplant waiting list and up to 6,000 die each year waiting to be served. One million residents are currently on the Kentucky Organ Donor Registry. \n\u201cAlli gave us a gift we can never repay,\u201d Christy Moore said. \u201cEven our pastor said he didn\u2019t know if he could do it. When Alli was at peace about it, I was at peace about it.\u201d \nScott is definitely at peace. \n\u201cIf I had five kidneys, I would give away all four,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t worry me at all that I have one now. I get to go to the top of the (waiting) list if I need a kidney since I am a donor. I would do it all over again if I could.\u201d \n___ \nInformation from: The Messenger, http://www.the-messenger.com LAURA HARVEY LEAD", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alli scot", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laura harvey/the messenger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laura harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alli scott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "saint thomas hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kentucky organ donor registry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kentucky organ donation affiliates", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "nortonville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ky.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nashville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nortonville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ky", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:36.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9da92477cd64d634b1d759814ce2a4cf681f754d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKwL7jnTu_kGxwxxkXPg6Zzg8uG1FrlyaIj4GcJ3bgLM01RTM5dkN4oOqLe4FuSKh3Kb90Hf5TNEH4hwLQH53Vf47TqfjfYYs58-", "site_full": "patient.info", "site": "patient.info", "site_section": "http://patient.info/forums/discuss/browse/fissure-in-ano-901", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Fissure In Ano.

It\u2019s SO severe it\u2019s natural to think there\u2019s something else going on but a fissure will most certainly cause that level of pain\nRectogesic will help a lot.

(AP) \u2014 Kentucky Justice Secretary John Tilley is traveling to Washington to talk about the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic. \nTilley is scheduled to speak to the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions at 10 a.m. Thursday. The hearing can be viewed online at the committee\u2019s website . \nTilley also spoke to the House Energy and Commerce Committee about opioids in July. \nMore than 1,400 people died in Kentucky last year because of a drug overdose, a 7.4 percent increase from 2015. Republican Gov. Matt Bevin\u2019s administration has responded with a \u201cDon\u2019t Let Them Die\u201d marketing campaign to raise awareness. Earlier this month, Bevin\u2019s administration launched a help line for people to call to get access to the state\u2019s drug treatment services.

In the end, a judge sentenced Slager to 20 years in prison, giving the Scott family the justice they had sought ever since a stranger came to them with the shocking video of Scott being killed. \n\u201cI forgive Michael Slager. I forgive you,\u201d Scott\u2019s mother, Judy, said as she turned toward her son\u2019s killer. \u201cI pray for you, that you would repent and let Jesus come in your life.\u201d \nSitting just a few feet away, Slager wiped tears from his eyes and mouthed: \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. \nThe punishment wrapped up a case that became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. Slager, 36, is one of only a few police officers to go to prison for a fatal shooting, and his sentence is by far the stiffest since the shootings came under extra scrutiny in recent years. \nAttorneys for the former North Charleston officer said he shot the 50-year-old Scott in self-defense after the two fought and Scott grabbed Slager\u2019s stun gun. They said race didn\u2019t play a role in the shooting and Slager never had any \u201cracial animus\u201d toward minorities. \nStill, Slager pleaded guilty in federal court to violating Scott\u2019s civil rights. As part of a plea agreement reached in May, prosecutors dropped state murder charges. \n\u201cThis is a tragedy that shouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d U.S. District Judge David Norton said. \nSlager apologized to the Scott family, calling Scott\u2019s mother and brothers by their names. \n\u201cWith my actions that day, Walter Scott is no longer with his family, and I am responsible for that,\u201d Slager said. Of their forgiveness, he added: \u201cI am very grateful for that.\u201d \nSlager\u2019s emotions stood in stark contrast to his stoic demeanor during his state murder trial when jurors deadlocked over a verdict. He has several weeks to appeal his sentence and will be housed at the Charleston County jail until he\u2019s assigned to a federal prison. \nAfter the sentencing, Judy Scott and Walter\u2019s two brothers told reporters that, while they had made peace with the case, they remained adamant the officer should pay for his crime. \n\u201cWho are we not to forgive?\u201d Rodney Scott said. \nA bystander recorded the shooting on a cellphone, and it was shared around the world, setting off protests across the U.S. as demonstrators said it was another egregious example of police officers mistreating African-Americans. \nSlager fired at Scott\u2019s back from 17 feet (5 meters) away. Five of eight bullets hit him. \nThe video was seized on by many as vivid proof of what they had been arguing for years: that white officers too often use deadly force unnecessarily against black people. \nWhen the jury failed to reach a verdict in the state murder case, many black people and others were shocked and distressed, because the video seemed to some to be an open-and-shut case. Some despaired of ever seeing justice. \nThe shooting angered local African-Americans who complained for years that North Charleston police harassed blacks, pulling them over or questioning them unnecessarily as they cracked down on crime. But after the shooting, the Scott family successfully pleaded for calm, asking everyone to let the justice system run its course. \nTwo months after the shooting, a young white man killed nine black church members in a racially motivated massacre during a Bible study in Charleston. The family members of those victims struck a similar forgiveness tone after that attack. \nBefore Slager\u2019s sentence was handed down, the judge had to decide whether the shooting amounted to second-degree murder or manslaughter. Norton found that it was murder. \n\u201cNo matter what sentence I give, neither the Scott family nor the Slager family is going to think that it\u2019s right,\u201d the judge said. \nAfter the shooting, Slager picked up his stun gun and placed it next to Scott. Slager contended he was securing the weapon. Prosecutors think he put it there to bolster his self-defense story. \nThe judge also found that Slager obstructed justice when he made statements to state police after the shooting. \nA pre-sentencing report for Slager found that he committed manslaughter and recommended 10 to nearly 13 years in prison. But the judge was not bound by that review. \nIf Slager had faced another state trial and been convicted of murder, he could have been sentenced to anywhere from 30 years to life in prison. \nConvictions in police officer shootings are uncommon in the U.S. and prison time is even rarer. \nSouth Carolina has been aggressive in charging white officers who shoot unarmed black people. Four have pleaded guilty in state or federal court in the past six years. But only Slager and former state trooper Sean Groubert, who shot a man as he tried to get his wallet during a seat belt violation check, will have been sent to prison.

Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment.\nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe.\n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\"\nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers.\nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube.\nSuch attacks are becoming more common \u2014 and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems.\nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data.\n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said.\nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released.\nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations.\nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services.\nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information.\nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system.\nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\"\n___\nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "irwin carmichael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dena diorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keith gregg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ross rustici", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anjanette flowers grube", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cybereason", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mecklenburg county sheriff's office", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mecklenburg county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukraine", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:38.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5be8eabc94c0dd0060c7d2a27d58803ddd2f6e80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2HT48I_PlzDc", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/co/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/co/ - Comics &amp; Cartoons - 4chan", "title": "/swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics", "title_full": "/co/ - /swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics & Cartoons - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T05:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 493, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "45404d6dbab17a096c5aa9b5838598c0d975ba36", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2O8Y28vcGd_15VQYv2rx53U-", "ord_in_thread": 395, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T10:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhZ 0XzSkdqo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYG 2GLV9YVg", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYG", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhZ"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:39.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5be8eabc94c0dd0060c7d2a27d58803ddd2f6e80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2HT48I_PlzDc", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/co/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/co/ - Comics &amp; Cartoons - 4chan", "title": "/swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics", "title_full": "/co/ - /swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics & Cartoons - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T05:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 493, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2cfe7f42c372f73da2b0a8e70d6eb61d22ad4ea0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2O8Y28vcGd_1olej6QWEj1g-", "ord_in_thread": 396, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T10:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>97330871\nHow is a character giving you their views on things a punishment?

The only way they know is what we recognise as terrorism. \n\u201cThe context of terrorism need not be isolated to only suicide bombers. Those who drop bombs in public are also deemed terrorists. These acts are very terrifying and therefore are categorised as terrorism. \n\u201cWe do not support terrorism; we are against terrorism,\u201d he said in a video posting on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/TunDrMahathir/ . \nMahathir added that because Jerusalem is home to sites holy for the Jewish, Christians and Muslims, no one should try to take over Jerusalem. \n\u201cIsrael definitely does not have the right to do so.

New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials at a parliamentary select committee briefing on West Papua, 7 December 2017 : Michael Appleton, Unit Manager, Pacific Regional Division; Stephen Harris, Divisional Manager, South East Asia Division; Ben King, Acting Chief Executive/Deputy Secretary Americas and Asia Group; Phillip Taula, Divisional Manager, United Nations, Human Rights and Commonwealth Division. Photo: VNP / Phil Smith \nThe Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee was today briefed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about West Papua, following an earlier hearing in June. \nA committee member, government MP Louisa Wall, asked about a recent petition to the UN from the indigenous people of Indonesian-ruled Papua region seeking re-inscription with the Decolonisation Committee, or C24. West Papua had been on the list in the early 1960s before being removed when Indonesia took control of the territory. \nMinistry officials said that for West Papua to be added to the list again there first needed to be a resolution in the UN general assembly. \n\"The problem at the moment is there's actually no pathway back for it to go to the C24 if it's blocked by the C24 - Indonesia (which is a member of the C24) would need to agree,\" said Stephen Harris, the Divisional Director of South and South East Asia Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. \nBut Ms Wall said West Papua was a \"growing and emerging issue in the Pacific\", suggesting it would increasingly demand a concerted response by New Zealand. Louisa Wall Photo: VNP / Phil Smith \n\"How interested are we in the Pacific Island interest in the emancipation of Papua? Because it's not going to go away. I can see resolutions in the Pacific islands Forum soon that want us as a block of sixteen countries to be doing something possibly putting an application so they can be added to this non-self governing territory list.\" \nHowever, Mr Harris said sentiment on this issue amongst Pacific Island countries was \"quite varied\". \n\"There is not a block of sixteen Pacific Island countries who think the same on this.\" \nHe said that reports about Indonesia's official reaction to some of the expressions of political voice in Papua were \"disturbing\". \nAccording to Mr Harris, New Zealand tended to register its concern about human rights abuses at the ministerial level. \n\"Since June there has been an upwelling of public unrest that I mentioned with the armed insurrection in a couple of villages in Papua. At the same time there's been redoubling, I think, by the Inodnesian president Joko Widodo to try and invest more of his personal political capital in to progress there.\" \nMr Harris said that human and social indicators showed that Papuans generally lagged behind people in other parts of Indonesia by a long way.

President Donald Trump is expected to announce plans to shrink Bears Ears National Monument as well as Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah that were created by past Democratic presidents. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File) Rick Bowmer \nEver since the creation of Yellowstone National Park in 1872, a pattern has played out when it comes to protecting our best American places. \nIt\u2019s controversial at the time it happens; later, folks begin to appreciate that protection was a good idea; finally, they realize that going bigger might have been better. \nThat\u2019s why we think President Donald Trump\u2019s decision on Monday to shrink the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah is the wrong direction. \nHere\u2019s a quick lesson from history. \nUsing the Antiquities Act \u2014 the same law that President Bill Clinton used to set aside Grand Staircase and President Barack Obama used to set aside Bears Ears \u2014 President Franklin Roosevelt in 1943 created Grand Teton National Monument in northwest Wyoming. \nBut local ranchers, led by a county commissioner named Cliff Hansen, stampeded a herd of cattle through the place to protest its designation and protection. (The story is told in Terry Tempest Williams\u2019 new book, \u201cThe Hour of Land.\u201d) \nHansen would go on to become Wyoming\u2019s governor and a U.S. senator, a Republican who acknowledged before he died that he had been wrong to resist Grand Teton. \n\u201cI\u2019m glad I lost because I now know that I was wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cGrand Teton National Park is one of the greatest national heritages of Wyoming and the nation and one of our great assets.\u201d \nIn issuing the executive order calling for a review of all national monuments created in the past 20 years under the Antiquities Act, President Trump referred to Bears Ears and other recently declared monuments as a \u201cmassive federal land grab.\u201d \nBut who is the federal government if not us, and who are we grabbing this land from? The private sector? No, because no private land is involved in Bears Ears. The states? No, Utah never owned the land. \nHere\u2019s another history lesson: The federal government has owned this land since the end of the Mexican-American War and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. Mexico, then, could be justified in calling what happened 170 years ago a \u201cland grab\u201d by the U.S. government, and Native Americans, too, but not the state of Utah. The land was acquired by the federal government nearly a half-century before the state of Utah even existed and even before Utah became territory in 1850, and at no time has it ever been Utah\u2019s land. \nAnd the enabling legislation by which Western states were created \u2014 Utah included \u2014 required those states to waive all claims and titles to unappropriated federal lands within their borders. Courts have upheld the right of the federal government to decide the fate of federal lands. \nOne final history lesson: The federal government has not been ungenerous to the Western states, either. It gave Utah 7.5 million acres, which is nearly six times more than was protected at Bears Ears. It\u2019s more land than is protected in all of Utah\u2019s national parks, monuments, wildlife refuges and wilderness areas combined, including the two national monuments. Given that, and given that millions of acres of public land are still open to energy, mining, timber, cattle and more, there\u2019s no way they can reasonably argue that the land is being \u201clocked up.\u201d \nMonday was an ugly day for our best American places.

Doppelg\u00e4nging works by utilizing two key distinct features together to mask the loading of a modified executable. By using NTFS transactions, we make changes to an executable file that will never actually be committed to disk. We will then use undocumented implementation details of the process loading mechanism to load our modified executable, but not before rolling back the changes we made to the executable. The result of this procedure is creating a process from the modified executable, while deployed security mechanisms remain in the dark. Process Doppelg\u00e4nging bypasses most modern AVs \nResearchers say malicious code that utilizes Process Doppelg\u00e4nging is never saved to disk (fileless attack), which makes it invisible to all major security products. \nResearchers sucessfully tested their attack on products from Kaspersky, Bitdefender, ESET, Symantec, McAfee, Windows Defender, AVG, Avast, Qihoo 360, and Panda. Furthermore, even advanced forensics tools such as Volatility will not detect it. \nIn their experiments, researchers used Process Doppelg\u00e4nging to run Mimikatz, a known utility used for password-stealing operations, \"in a stealthy way to avoid detection.\" Process Doppelg\u00e4nging is a fileless attack \n\"The goal of the technique is to allow a malware to run arbitrary code (including code that is known to be malicious) in the context of a legitimate process on the target machine,\" Tal Liberman & Eugene Kogan, the two enSilo researchers who discovered the attack explained in an email describing their new research. \n\"Very similar to process hollowing but with a novel twist. The challenge is doing it without using suspicious process and memory operations such as SuspendProcess, NtUnmapViewOfSection. \n\"In order to achieve this goal we leverage NTFS transactions. We overwrite a legitimate file in the context of a transaction. We then create a section from the modified file (in the context of the transaction) and create a process out of it. It appears that scanning the file while it's in transaction is not possible by the vendors we checked so far (some even hang) and since we rollback the transaction, our activity leaves no trace behind.\" \nEverything looks OK to security products because the malicious process will look legitimate, and will be mapped correctly to an image file on disk, just like any legit process. There will be no \"unmapped code,\" which is usually what security products look for. The good news and the bad news \nThe good news is that \"there are a lot of technical challenges\" in making Process Doppelg\u00e4nging work, and attackers need to know \"a lot of undocumented details on process creation.\" \nThe bad news is that the attack \"cannot be patched since it exploits fundamental features and the core design of the process loading mechanism in Windows.\" \nProcess Doppelg\u00e4nging now joins the list of new attack methods discovered in the past year that are hard to detect and mitigate for modern AVs, such as Atom Bombing , GhostHook , and PROPagate . \nResearch material on Process Doppelg\u00e4nging will be published on the Black Hat website in the following days. \nThe article has been updated to remove Norton, Sophos, and Trend Micro from the list of vulnerable products, and add Qihoo 360, due to an email communications mix-up and older test data.

By converting to a COGES power system, the fuel efficiency of the ship will be improved by 30.\u201d \nThis allows ship owners to increase the charter rate and win back opportunities in a market dominated by dual-fuel diesel engines. \nThis study is based on a 138,000 cubic meter LNG carrier powered by a steam turbine, but it can be applied on other similar size ships, Ma said.

(Photo: AFP/Kazuhiro Nogi) 07 Dec 2017 05:14PM Share via E-Mail Bookmark \nTOKYO: People dressed as Super Mario tearing round the streets of Tokyo in go-karts will have to buckle up, Japanese authorities said Thursday (Dec 7), following a series of accidents. \nVisitors to Tokyo are often stunned to see convoys of karts driven by people - often tourists - dressed up as Mario and other popular Nintendo characters screaming around the busy streets of the world's most populous city. \nUnlike many countries, Japan has no ban on people driving go-karts on public highways. \nBut following three accidents over the past year, the transport ministry has decided to enforce the wearing of seatbelts for such vehicles. \nCurrently, the vehicles have no seatbelts and drivers are not required to wear helmets, a ministry official who did not wish to be named told AFP. \n\"It's dangerous as other cars cannot see them because of their low height,\" he added. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe ministry is looking to implement the regulations in a few years. \nUnder the proposed new rules, go-karts must be at least one metre off the ground and the driving wheel must be made with soft material to prevent driver injury in case of accident. \nThe move comes after Kyoto-based Nintendo filed a lawsuit in February against MariCar, a Tokyo go-kart rental firm, for letting tourists wear unauthorised Nintendo character costumes.

As we grow our 10th \u2014 12th grade pathways, we\u2019re also working to enhance how we present the options to our current freshmen and their families. Learn more about our pathways. New Application Process \nThis year, 9th grade students will not only select their 1st/2nd/3rd choices, they\u2019ll also be asked to write down the reasons for their selections. On Jan. 29, pathway directors will conduct brief interviews with any students whose applications didn\u2019t sufficiently answer the queries. \nWe will then place students based on their choices and interests along with our purposeful intention to have each program represent the diversity of Tech. Placement will be followed by acceptance interviews \u2014 an important opportunity for students to ask any remaining questions. \nWhile we would like every student to get into his/her first choice that simply isn\u2019t possible given space limitations. However, we believe \u2014 strongly \u2014 that each pathway offers rich, engaging coursework and tight-knit communities, and know that students can thrive in any of their choices. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we refine with this process. We encourage all 9th grade families to look carefully at the different pathways and choose according to what best fits each student\u2019s interests. If you would like more information or have any questions about the individual pathways, please attend some of the events planned, or contact the pathway directors directly. Key Dates Dec. 20: Academy Video Presentations in Advisory Classes Current academy students will share experiences in academy in a video presentation followed by a student survey. Jan. 8 \u2013 12: Pathway/Academy Week! All 9th grade students are participating in academy outreach events and lunchtime information sessions (with lunch provided!). Come, ask and learn!

Jan. 24: Pathway/Academy Applications Due Jan. 24: Engineering Academy Assessment A math assessment will be given to all 9th grade students interested in applying to the Engineering Academy. (A study guide will be provided in advance.) Jan. 26 \u2013 Feb. 1: Directors Place Students Based on Applications Feb 5 \u201310: Acceptance Interviews These interviews are designed to ensure the best fit for each student and to allow students to meet lead teachers, express interest and ask questions.
