The upper Columbia River is highly contaminated with heavy metal wastes from nearby smelting operations in Trail, British Columbia, Canada, and to a lesser extent, Northport (Le Roi smelter), Washington, USA. Airborne emissions from the Trail operations were historically and are currently transported by prevailing winds down the Columbia River canyon, where particulate metals can be deposited into lakes and watersheds. In lakes, sediment cores contain records of past environmental conditions, providing a timeline of fundamental chemical and biological relationships within aquatic ecosystems, including records of airborne metal depositions. We analyzed trace metal concentrations (Ni, Cd, Zn, As, Cu, Sb, Pb, Hg) and Pb isotope compositions of sediment cores from six remote eastern Washington lakes to assess potential sources of atmospheric heavy metal deposition. Sediment cores displayed evidence to support trace metal loading as a direct consequence of smelting operations in Trail. Smelter contamination was detected 144 km downwind of the Trail Smelter. Cd, Sb, Pb ( p \u2009<\u20090.001), and to a lesser extent As and Hg ( p \u2009<\u20090.05) concentrations were correlated with Pb isotope compositions, suggesting that the Trail operations were likely the main source for these trace metals.\n\n\nfrom b via xlomafota.13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2AApoGw\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "le roi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cu", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "columbia river", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trail", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "british columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington, usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:24.064+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "30ac2a3892fa703e3c28a4287b7ec14db24c30c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSB7xnVOyxHFfJOOgU9SEtQ88dFc6jrNM3boAKkkr0NoRLhDN_XVn34hqaff0iUPIxN5S4WfX7LkUH76xbOx9fBOHwYiznRB6fTfo0B8DQY1SZssAcICXtmg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Apple", "title": "iPhone X - Is this happening to anyone else\u2019s paint?

The upper Columbia River is highly contaminated with heavy metal wastes from nearby smelting operations in Trail, British Columbia, Canada, and to a lesser extent, Northport (Le Roi smelter), Washington, USA. Airborne emissions from the Trail operations were historically and are currently transported by prevailing winds down the Columbia River canyon, where particulate metals can be deposited into lakes and watersheds. In lakes, sediment cores contain records of past environmental conditions, providing a timeline of fundamental chemical and biological relationships within aquatic ecosystems, including records of airborne metal depositions. We analyzed trace metal concentrations (Ni, Cd, Zn, As, Cu, Sb, Pb, Hg) and Pb isotope compositions of sediment cores from six remote eastern Washington lakes to assess potential sources of atmospheric heavy metal deposition. Sediment cores displayed evidence to support trace metal loading as a direct consequence of smelting operations in Trail. Smelter contamination was detected 144 km downwind of the Trail Smelter. Cd, Sb, Pb ( p \u2009<\u20090.001), and to a lesser extent As and Hg ( p \u2009<\u20090.05) concentrations were correlated with Pb isotope compositions, suggesting that the Trail operations were likely the main source for these trace metals.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2AApoGw", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "le roi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cu", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "columbia river", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trail", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "british columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington, usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:25.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "efc04ec7e86136b20a251d6e39a6c4d80bebe95f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMtJnTJAAhK4PzEVjOY_0MqeRBO9nY2jf3uMj_ukgn8KGt..Am6LQCR660w7m1h9Ga.5I.yPEHCYmANb4Uyv.zAB", "site_full": "vishkhanna.com", "site": "vishkhanna.com", "site_section": "http://vishkhanna.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Kreative Kontrol", "title": "Ep. #369: Andrew Cohen & Light Coma", "title_full": "Ep. #369: Andrew Cohen & Light Coma", "published": "2017-12-06T11:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "efc04ec7e86136b20a251d6e39a6c4d80bebe95f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMtJnTJAAhK4PzEVjOY_0MqeRBO9nY2jf3uMj_ukgn8KGt..Am6LQCR660w7m1h9Ga.5I.yPEHCYmANb4Uyv.zAB", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "vish", "published": "2017-12-06T11:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "Ep. #369: Andrew Cohen & Light Coma", "text": "By vish News , Podcast Ep. #369: Andrew Cohen & Light Coma \nAndrew Cohen discusses Jason Molina of Magnolia Electric Co., Michael Dahlquist of Silkworm, and his new Comedy Minus One release with Light Coma, Unreality .

You also have the ability to turn the car's lights on and off, turn the radio on or off, and even open its doors. \nA two-fingered swipe allows you to spin the car around or you can simply walk around the car as I did when I tested the app in New York's Central Park. I used an iPad Pro to test it, and the experience was surprisingly realistic. Don't Miss: Mitsubishi Concept Car Includes AR Display to Improve Driver Safety \nIn fact, while recording, another car passed by and, because of the virtual car's realistic scale and shadowing, the real car almost looked as though it was occupying the same reality as the virtual vehicle. \nWe saw some early demonstrations of this kind of functionality soon after ARKit was first announced, most notably in the form of a virtual Tesla created by an independent developer. But this is a real application of ARKit produced by a major automaker, and the execution is so well done, it may actually lead to a few car sales. \nAn initial version of the app was launched earlier this year for Android devices on Google Play, but this is the first release of the free app on iOS using ARKit.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bmw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:25.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0a949e730a15882ea6b0ed0dcbcca44fabdd475b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspaCLpIUwJ9I7ASvM6iAuRZui9mYgJoykhY6JEB43E_GByAoC_Vcz42B9kNUD65BXFOIgASZf8.Chu9cGHF07aft5Tywx4uS8ZtgCR3t9Xtcfs-", "site_full": "www.expedia.com.hk", "site": "expedia.com.hk", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com.hk/en/Tongzhou-Hotels.d6050437.Travel-Guide-Hotels", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Top 10 Cheap Tongzhou Hotels from HK$183/night | Price Match Guarantee Expedia ", "title": "Rosedale Hotel and Suite Beijing (Beijing,", "title_full": "Rosedale Hotel and Suite Beijing (Beijing, CHN) | Expedia.com.hk", "published": "2017-03-25T12:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 12141, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f607189a736edf6355033d13b1db89e696f68151", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspaCLpIUwJ9I7ASvM6iAuRZui9mYgJoykhY6JEB43E_GByAoC_Vcz42B9kNUD65BXFOIgASZf8.Chu9cGHF07aft5Tywx4uS8Ztuzeo1zc9A4Bx3ziUU2c39OUv_6G88X_Pyz3CymKzMl8-", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-04T16:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Probably a 3.5 star hotel not 4 Lobby area a bit dingy Staff quite helpful but one small thing, they had no map of Beijing in English", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 3.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:25.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "498bd47264fd3698270681033ed2cb89a2a5950a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbQmXOQ5beF8z9EmzVFriIBoLq6VP.enl1ZdCP52sWd1chKBVKnAMTKPIThqtaUf3GMfDjq5abHsRqSB5Z8pzYYA-", "site_full": "www.expedia.nl", "site": "expedia.nl", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.nl/Lissabon-District-Hotels.d178278.Reisgids-Hotels", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hotels in Lissabon District | Betaal met iDEAL op Expedia.nl", "title": "Browns Central", "title_full": "Browns Central Hotel: voorzieningen en recensies | Expedia.nl", "published": "2017-11-07T20:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 44331, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "60f556fc977385cb0eab0156cc89a7b0f3936f82", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbQmXOQ5beF8z9EmzVFriIBoLq6VP.enl1ZdCP52sWd1chKBVKnAMTKPIThqtaUf3GMfDjq5abHsRFfm166O9bUoN7A1EFk5WlsutWxCZvVaB.A1Y9GvxcSo-", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-06T08:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Amazing room, great location, friendly staff and tremendous value for money!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 5.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:25.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "228b5cab69bd0371c819944c98299f0749974b0a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRaOz_gjtpUmMsya5mFvNmrUqAIPItUJ95nD_9i4LhsVNKytPFETFpYWcM3Zl.IAhMrMNzelI4iF7YZFG.BctQdNyTc8YeA0WfIjjTdMBdssISibCPDXaD0", "site_full": "www.flyertalk.com", "site": "flyertalk.com", "site_section": "https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/travelbuzz-176/", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "TravelBuzz - FlyerTalk Forums", "title": "What would you pay to travel at Mach 2 again ?", "title_full": "What would you pay to travel at Mach 2 again ?

Prince was questioned by the committee on November 30 about his meeting with Emirati government officials and a Russian hedge fund manager in Seychelles just before the Inauguration.\nLatest business videos Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff asked Prince during the hearing why he had not responded to a documents request sent to him by the committee on May 17. Prince insisted that he never received the letter and said the first time he heard from the committee was \"only weeks ago\" when a staffer, Kash Patel, asked if he would testify.\nAsked if he had \"any subsequent communication with any of the members or staff of the committee,\" Prince replied that he \"had seen Chairman Nunes.\" Prince said later that his meeting with Nunes was actually the first time he learned that the committee wanted him to testify.\n\"He had talked about coming in for a hearing,\" Prince said. \"And one of his staff members was there as well.\"\nAsked whether Nunes had gotten into \"the substance of your testimony in any way,\" Prince replied that the conversation revolved around Nunes' \"investigation into the unmasking of intelligence on Americans.\"\n\"He said I should come in and talk to him about that,\" Prince said.\nNunes stepped aside from the Russia investigation in early April following his decision to brief Trump and the press on classified intelligence \u2014 without telling his fellow committee members.\nBut he quickly began conducting his own investigation into \"unmaskings\" of Trump associates by the Obama administration, which he has alleged were politically motivated. Prince echoed many of the same arguments Nunes has made in the past about the unmasking process, asserting that \"unlawful leaking\" from the US intelligence community about the names of American citizens caught up in intelligence reports constituted \"abuse.\"\nNunes wrote in a July letter to the Director of National Intelligence that he had \"found evidence that current and former government officials had easy access to U.S. person information and that it is possible that they used this information to achieve partisan political purposes.\"\nA spokesman for Nunes did not respond to questions about whether Nunes and Prince discussed the substance of Prince's testimony, or coordinated in any way, prior to his November 30 hearing.\nPrince, for his part, seemed convinced that The Washington Post learned of his meeting with Emirati officials and the Russian banker in the Seychelles from US intelligence officials who had leaked his name to the press.\nIt is illegal for intelligence officials to reveal the names of unmasked Americans. But Republican and Democratic congressional aides told news outlets in April, shortly after Nunes stepped down from the probe, that Obama administration officials did not act inappropriately in trying to unmask officials on Trump's transition team whose conversations with foreign officials were incidentally collected during routine intelligence-gathering operations.\nPrince told Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell that he \"went to see [Nunes] in his office about Afghanistan.\"\n\"When was that?\" Swalwell asked.\n\"Well, I don't know,\" Prince replied. \"I wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal. I was asked to come into the White House a couple times to talk about that. And so it was sometime, I don't know, over the summer or early fall.\"\nPrince's op-ed was published on May 31.\n\"How did unmasking come up?\" Swalwell asked. \"Did he bring it up, or did you?\"\n\"No,\" Prince said. \"I asked him what the committee was doing to investigate illegal leaks and illegal unmasking of American citizens doing business abroad. And he said: You ought to come in and talk to the committee about it sometime.\"\nPrince alleged that he had learned from former US intelligence officials that his name and others were improperly unmasked by Obama administration officials. But he did not provide details, and refused to name his source when pressed by the Democrats.\nJoin the conversation about this story \u00bb\nNOW WATCH: A North Korean defector tells us what life was like under a dictatorship\nSee Also:\nA 'serious case of amnesia': House Intel Democrat says Trump Jr. was 'pretty non-responsive' in 8-hour interview Trump's lawyers are laying the groundwork for a brazen new legal strategy in the Russia probe What it\u2019s like to live in Putin\u2019s Russia, according to an investigative reporter who lived there for 4 years SEE ALSO: A 'serious case of amnesia': House Intel Democrat says Trump Jr. was 'pretty non-responsive' in 8-hour interview", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.businessinsider.com/hyeonseo-lee-on-life-under-a-dictatorship-north-korea-refugee-defector-2016-1?utm_source=hearst&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=allverticals", "http://www.businessinsider.com/devin-nunes-approved-requests-for-unmaskings-democrats-say-hes-gone-rogue-2017-6?utm_source=hearst&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=allverticals", "http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IG/IG00/20171130/106661/HHRG-115-IG00-Transcript-20171130.pdf", "http://www.businessinsider.com/what-its-like-to-live-in-putin-russia-life-luke-harding-collusion-politics-military-alexander-litvinenko-2017-11?utm_source=hearst&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=allverticals", "http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-john-dowd-obstruction-of-justice-collusion-flynn-comey-russia-2017-12?utm_source=hearst&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=allverticals", "http://www.businessinsider.com/erik-prince-testimony-house-intel-committee-devin-nunes-russia-probe-2017-12?utm_source=hearst&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=allverticals#comments", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-macarthur-model-for-afghanistan-1496269058?mg=prod/accounts-wsj", "http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-jr-testimony-house-intel-committee-russia-probe-2017-12?utm_source=hearst&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=allverticals"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:25.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "228b5cab69bd0371c819944c98299f0749974b0a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRaOz_gjtpUmMsya5mFvNmrUqAIPItUJ95nD_9i4LhsVNKytPFETFpYWcM3Zl.IAhMrMNzelI4iF7YZFG.BctQdNyTc8YeA0WfIjjTdMBdssISibCPDXaD0", "site_full": "www.flyertalk.com", "site": "flyertalk.com", "site_section": "https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/travelbuzz-176/", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "TravelBuzz - FlyerTalk Forums", "title": "What would you pay to travel at Mach 2 again ?", "title_full": "What would you pay to travel at Mach 2 again ? - FlyerTalk Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T13:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.015, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5203, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "373607f2a22650466990423f5793a4211bee3d1d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRaOz_gjtpUmMsya5mFvNmrUqAIPItUJ95nD_9i4LhsVNKytPFETFpYWcM3Zl.IAhMrMNzelI4iF7YZFG.BctQdNyTc8YeA0WfIjjTdMBdssNCaHbgDJATA7AO485s.NwlUPUND5AraLQ--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "darthbimmer", "published": "2017-12-06T14:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I could see paying a small premium over business class fares for SST service on routes like SFO/NRT.

Ilsinho sent a pass through a wide array of defenders, right to Epps's feet. He took a couple dribbles after settling the pass and ripped a shot between the post and the Sounders goalkeeper Stefan Frei. \nEpps's goal was the Union's first of the match, which also proved to be the game-winner. It was also his second career goal, which was the perfect time for Epps to break out his dance moves. \nAfter celebrating with Fafa Picault, CJ Sapong and Ray Gaddis, Epps did a little shoulder shrug dance.

Updated: 4:54 AM EST Dec 7, 2017 CANBERRA, Australia (CNN) \u2014 \nAustralia's parliament voted to legalize same-sex marriage Thursday after years of political jockeying and fierce public debate. \nCheers and applause broke out as ministers voted in favor of the bill following hours of debate and emotional speeches at Parliament House in Canberra. Advertisement \n\"This is Australia: Fair, diverse, loving and filled for respect for everyone,\" said an effusive Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, as he introduced the bill for a final vote. \n\"This is a great day, it belongs to every Australian.\" \nThe move follows a two-month national postal survey that showed 61% of more than 12 million respondents were in favor of marriage equality. \nThe country is now the 24th in the world to allow same-sex couples to marry, according to Pew Research. \nAustralia's first same-sex weddings will not take place until at least January, however, due to a longstanding requirement for all Australian couples to provide a full month's notice of their intention to get married. \nHistoric moment \nMarriage equality campaigners have fought for years for Thursday's vote. Though the bill was expected to pass into law without significant opposition, the lengthy legislative process was excruciatingly slow for the hundreds of advocates watching from the public gallery. \nAmong them was Christine Forster, the gay sister of Tony Abbott, the former Australian Prime Minister who has long been seen as the face of the \"no\" campaign. \nForster was joined in the public gallery by her partner, Virginia Edwards. They plan to marry next year, and Abbott has said he'll attend despite his personal views. \nAbbott and other conservatives proposed amendments to the bill to include further religious protections, all of which were voted down. \n\"These amendments are important and I stress they are not against same-sex marriage, they are simply in favor of the rights of religious organizations to keep doing what their doing,\" Abbott said. \nOpponents of the changes argued they would legalize discrimination against the gay community. The 500 or so people in the gallery were vocal in their disapproval of the amendments. They were warned multiple times that parliamentary rules prohibit them making noise and even applauding. \nAn emotional week \nAfter the bill passed the Senate last week, House proceedings kicked off with fireworks Monday when Liberal MP Tim Wilson surprised his colleagues by proposing to his long-time partner Ryan Bolger. \nThe next day, Liberal MP Andrew Wallace, who is a devout Catholic, shared with his colleagues how his gay daughter helped change his position on same-sex marriage. \n\"She said: Dad, in the years to come, my generation will look back and judge your generation about how you deal with the issue of homosexuality in the same way that your generation considered your parents' generation in the way that they dealt with our Indigenous people,\" Wallace said. \nFighting back tears, Liberal MP Sarah Henderson told the story Wednesday night of a close gay friend of hers who died months ago and who, in one of their last conversations, asked her to continue to push for same-sex marriage. \nSurvey says yes \nThursday's vote comes three weeks after Australia voted overwhelmingly to legalize same-sex marriage as part of a national postal survey lasting two months. \nUnder political pressure to find a solution, the ruling Liberal National Coalition government announced the non-compulsory survey in August, saying if the result was \"yes\" they would allow a free vote in Parliament. \nIn the end, 61.6% of Australia voted in favor of allowing same-sex marriage, with 38.4% saying \"no.\" \nAbout 12.7 million people participated in the survey, which had a response rate of nearly 80% -- which is considered very high. \nAustralians have long been in favor of same-sex marriage, with polling from as long as 10 years ago showing a majority support for legalizing marriage equality.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine forster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia edwards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah henderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan bolger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pew research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal national coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:26.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "caf1e1a94988626d23438a24df70da11bcebfc73", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTV8CHljX_EbUmoAiGc5yaSqiw35F2g1Yc23RlUuShvHnwkChWSD0ioiPyZl7aM14Uun8.qgXpFIg--", "site_full": "forum.nationstates.net", "site": "nationstates.net", "site_section": "https://forum.nationstates.net/viewforum.php?f=25", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "NationStates \u2022 View forum -

Item was delivered 5th December, so one day after the expected date.\nBuyer is now complaining to ebay and wanting a refund. Any advice would be appreciated. Originally posted by kw5 \u201d Firstly what basis are they asking for the refund? The only two options are INR (item not received) or SNAD (significantly not as described) and neither of those seems to fit. They can't just have a refund because something is late.\nHowever if you are a business seller then you are obliged to accept a change of mind return, but buyer needs to pay their own return costs. A private seller doesn't have to accept change of mind returns unless you ticked the box for returns when you listed.\nUnfortunately the 1 day late already gives you a late defect but sometimes even shipping on time sellers can't avoid a delay in Royal Mail handling post, so you are likely stuck with that defect.\nTime sensitive things are a nightmare and it might be an idea in future not to sell so close to the deadline unless you know you can ship instantly .\n\u201c When did you dispatch it?\nE.g. If i was selling an advent calendar so close to 1st December, I would have made sure it was dispatched same day or next morning. Originally posted by pinkshoes \u201d OP states it was delivered 1 day past estimate, so that suggests it went as per the time frame seller gave- with the usual 1 day slip as ebay imagine everything arrives magically the next day. Sellers add a dispatch time for a reason and buyers can't assume that just because they choose a faster postage option it is going to go quicker. Perhaps seller was slightly naive in selling so close to the deadline, but they may well have had a reason not to ship instantly. For instance I had a contract last week that kept me out of the house and which meant I couldn't post on one particular day, so I changed my dispatch time from 1 day to 3 days to cover it- regardless of what service buyer had chosen I couldn't have sent things if I wasn't at home to do so.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:26.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "882259b34001007467de5e0b99e16879bfd968f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xac4qjKWaaB3Ha79.ecsbv4UwZVN0.cWxvzYzTuUPCB32VjfqlLjsFmkyj8pksIsyeY", "site_full": "www.nairaland.com", "site": "nairaland.com", "site_section": "http://www.nairaland.com/jobs", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Jobs/Vacancies - Nigeria - Nairaland", "title": "Good Afternoon, Tell Us, Have You Started Physical Verification At Your End? # (3)", "title_full": "Good Afternoon, Tell Us, Have You Started Physical Verification At Your End? # - Jobs/Vacancies (3) - Nigeria", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 951, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8a3dbb5a372667dabad96d3e23b99e72e0b7bf6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xac4qjKWaaB3Ha79.ecsbv4UwZVN0.cWxvzYzTuUPCB32VjfqlLjsFmk9.2EByDxH4IaejH4E_44EM-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "npowerng", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "thebest1210 :\nPhysical verification has started in Abuja.

NO PROBLEM: A nuTonomy vehicle makes its way down Congress Street in the Seaport District. NuTonomy said a partnership with Lyft allows people to hail a ride from a self-driving car. comments People in the Seaport looking for a lift can now hail a ride in a self-driving car thanks to a partnership in Boston between Lyft and self-driving car company nuTonomy, one of the first public trials in the country.\n\u201cWe want to let members of the public experience driverless vehicles firsthand, so they can better understand the impact this new technology will have on their lives,\u201d nuTonomy said in a blog post.\n\u201cBased on feedback from pilot participants,\u201d the company said, \u201cnuTonomy\u2019s engineers will adapt and improve our system, so that we can deliver an autonomous transportation experience that is extremely safe, efficient, and comfortable.\u201d\nRiders will be limited to areas where nuTonomy\u2019s cars are permitted to drive, including the Seaport neighborhood and South Station. NuTonomy said \u201cselect\u201d passengers will be able to request rides, but it is unclear how those riders will be selected.\nThe cars can be hailed using the Lyft app, and will have a safety engineer in the driver\u2019s seat ready to take over if necessary. In a statement, Lyft said the pilot program will help the company \u201cbuild a future centered around cities and people \u2014 not individual vehicle ownership.\u201d\nNuTonomy already ran its own pilot tests last month, ferrying dozens of passengers to South Station. The riders universally said the cars felt safe, nuTonomy said, with some complaining the car seemed too cautious. The tests included a number of seniors and one blind person, in hopes of getting a better sense of how to cater to riders that have long struggled with getting around.\nEric Balles, managing director of transport and energy at Draper Labs in Cambridge, said tests with real passengers are an expected step, but still a big one.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important step, no doubt about it,\u201d Bayles said, \u201cthe general public still has considerable uncertainty.\u201d\nSelf-driving cars have racked up hundreds of miles in the Seaport between nuTonomy and Optimus Ride, another local company. Optimus Ride will soon begin carrying passengers at the Union Point development in Weymouth.\nAuto parts manufacturer Delphi, which acquired nuTonomy for $450 million earlier this year, has also been granted approval to test in Boston.\nDelphi said nuTonomy will continue to operate independently, and its technology will be used to develop an autonomous system that can be sold to car makers.\nNationwide, a handful of other companies have launched passenger service, including Waymo \u2014 Google\u2019s self-driving car company \u2014 and Uber in Arizona.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nutonomy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris christo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric balles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lyft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bayles", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "draper labs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "optimus ride", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "optimus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delphi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress street", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "seaport jordan graham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seaport district", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weymouth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south station", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seaport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:26.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "48ea8dfbb5c5c7b1c6d1f3278b4ad4b37b3b7983", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQApyRnPnOVUgYzCIiGD1nlOM2RM993jcwIf7Ia2AVB2Q--", "site_full": "vk.com", "site": "vk.com", "site_section": "https://vk.com/zlatik369", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Zlata Maximova", "title": "\u041e\u043e\u043e\u0434 ))) \u0427\u0451\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u044e\u043c\u043e\u0440 today at 7:37 am", "title_full": "\u041e\u043e\u043e\u0434 ))) \u0427\u0451\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u044e\u043c\u043e\u0440 today at 7:37 am", "published": "2017-12-07T02:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "RU", "spam_score": 0.47, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 21, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "48ea8dfbb5c5c7b1c6d1f3278b4ad4b37b3b7983", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQApyRnPnOVUgYzCIiGD1nlOM2RM993jcwIf7Ia2AVB2Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Zlata Maximova", "published": "2017-12-07T02:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "\u041e\u043e\u043e\u0434 ))) \u0427\u0451\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u044e\u043c\u043e\u0440 today at 7:37 am", "text": "\u041e\u043e\u043e\u0434 ))) \u0427\u0451\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u044e\u043c\u043e\u0440 7 Dec at 7:37 am", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://pp.userapi.com/c543108/v543108388/41f8e/BnrTa5rtRJg.jpg);", "https://pp.userapi.com/c638219/v638219545/62c01/zzlbhtvajFo.jpg", "https://pp.userapi.com/c543108/v543108388/41f8e/BnrTa5rtRJg.jpg|529|604"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:26.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "882259b34001007467de5e0b99e16879bfd968f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xac4qjKWaaB3Ha79.ecsbv4UwZVN0.cWxvzYzTuUPCB32VjfqlLjsFmkyj8pksIsyeY", "site_full": "www.nairaland.com", "site": "nairaland.com", "site_section": "http://www.nairaland.com/jobs", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Jobs/Vacancies - Nigeria - Nairaland", "title": "Good Afternoon, Tell Us, Have You Started Physical Verification At Your End? # (3)", "title_full": "Good Afternoon, Tell Us, Have You Started Physical Verification At Your End? # - Jobs/Vacancies (3) - Nigeria", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 951, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "15dd07a89a7dba5a51a84f06e848ddb5ab4a0813", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2EeSt_m8cn84Egk1_xac4qjKWaaB3Ha79.ecsbv4UwZVN0.cWxvzYzTuUPCB32VjfqlLjsFmk1ESKII_BIC8chhQabIxgwM-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "kingjoo", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Presh21 :\nNothing is happening at Aba south lga.

Canadian Press December 7, 2017, 12:31 AM Canadian Press December 7, 2017, 12:31 AM \nEDMONTON \u2014 The Philadelphia Flyers hope they are finally turning things around. \nWayne Simmonds had a goal and an assist and Claude Giroux added a pair of helpers as the Flyers won their second game in a row, defeating the Edmonton Oilers 4-2 on Wednesday. \nJordan Weal , Dale Weise and Michael Raffl also scored for the Flyers (10-11-7), who won consecutive games for only the second time this season, coming on the heels of a 10-game losing skid. \n\"We went through a tough stretch and got a win the other night in Calgary and this one tonight was big to keep us going on the right track,\" said Flyers goalie Brian Elliott. \nWeise said it is nice to be back in the win column. \n\"It definitely feels good, definitely the way we played too, it\u2019s a pretty complete effort from our team,\" he said. \"Getting contributions from everyone, it\u2019s going to be huge if we want to keep stringing some wins together. \n\"I really liked the way we played the last two games.\" \nLeon Draisaitl and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins scored for the Oilers (11-15-2), who have lost two of their last three. \n\"We can\u2019t seem to start two good games in a row,\" Draisaitl said. \"It is setting us back. We always have to come back in games and it takes a lot of energy to do that. I thought we had some good looks in the third, but couldn\u2019t capitalize.\" \nDefenceman Oscar Klefbom said there is still time for the Oilers to turn the corner on what has been a disappointing season so far. \n\"A lot can happen,\" he said. \"There is a lot of hockey left to play, a lot of games. The road is getting tougher and tougher but we have to keep our head high. We don\u2019t have time to be grumpy, that\u2019s only going to make it tougher.\" \nPhiladelphia outshot the Oilers 13-7 in the scoreless opening period. \nEdmonton finally broke the deadlock four minutes into the second period as they broke out on a short-handed two-on-one with Connor McDavid getting a backhand pass through to Draisaitl, who beat Elliott for his eighth of the season. \nThe Flyers tied it up five minutes later on the power play with a nice three-way passing play converted in front by Weal, who tipped it past Edmonton goalie Laurent Brossoit. \nPhiladelphia took a 2-1 lead on a soft goal with five minutes left in the second period as Weise sent a shot through both the defender\u2019s and Brossoit\u2019s legs. \nThe Flyers added to their lead four minutes into the third period as a turnover at the Philadelphia blue line led to a breakaway for Raffl, who buried his fourth of the season. \nEdmonton battled to get back into the game and pulled to within one on a rebound goal by Nugent-Hopkins with 6:40 remaining. \nSimmonds put the game away with an empty-netter with 39 seconds left on the clock. \nThe Flyers are back in action on Thursday, concluding a three-game trip in Vancouver. The Oilers embark on a three-game trip out east, beginning on Saturday in Montreal. \nNotes: Oilers defenceman Adam Larsson remained out with an injury for the Oilers\u2026 Neither of Edmonton\u2019s waiver claims from last week, Brandon Davidson (Montreal) and Nathan Walker (Washington), has yet to play for the team this season\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The Flyers recently placed goalie Michal Neuvirth and defenceman Brandon Manning on injured reserve.

The new 2,700 square meter center, co-located with GE\u2019s European Technology Center, allows current and potential customers to experience every aspect of the additive manufacturing process from design to prototyping to operations. Mohammad Ehteshami, Vice President & General Manager GE Additive, and thought-leaders from business, politics, technology and academia gathered for the Grand Opening and discussed the potential that additive manufacturing will bring to business and industries. \n\n\nGE Additive\u2019s Customer Experience Centers are designed to help customers understand the additive process; from design to prototyping to production and guide them along the way. Customers benefit from hands-on training and instruction at the facility, covering additive design, machine operations and support. \nThe Customer Experience Center in Munich, launched with an investment of $15 million, will employ up to 50 GE Additive employees, including technicians and engineers specializing in additive design and production. 10 additive machines from Germany\u2019s Concept Laser and Sweden\u2019s Arcam EBM have been installed. The center serves as an enabler for customers to accelerate the adoption of additive in their business, regardless of where they are on their additive journey. The facility enables customers to start with a concept, design and build a prototype, and then move all the way through production, while enabling them to think through industrializing processes and helping improve their products and supply chain. \nThe Munich center also offers a modern educational facility for their Additive Academy \u2013 GE Additive\u2019s customer training team. All customers are welcome to visit the center to collaborate with the local team on additive design, process development, prototyping and industrializing their additive operations. \n\n\nThere are a number of ways that customers can interact with the Customer Experience Center in Munich: Machine Access \u2013 Access to use the latest metal additive machines (DMLM and EBM) AddWorks \u2013 Collaboration with GE\u2019s additive experts on product identification, design, material selection and on additive facility setup Prototypes \u2013 Build prototypes and see designs come to life Low rate initial production \u2013 Build multiple parts and develop operations process prior to full rate production Additive Academy \u2013 Training from the GE team of additive experts in all aspects of additive manufacturing Spare parts and powder \u2013 Access to GE\u2019s team who can provide field service knowledge, spares and operational support to customers \nMore than 150 guest and dignitaries from business, politics and academia came to Munich for the opening, and got a chance to tour the facility after a ribbon cutting. Guests also heard from different speakers, including representatives from BMW and Oerlikon, on how they see the future of additive manufacturing. \n\u201cThe opening of our Customer Experience Center here in Munich marks a great milestone for us,\u201d said Robert Griggs, Customer Success Leader at GE Additive. \u201cGermany is the global innovation hub for additive manufacturing. Right here, at the heart of the additive revolution, the center will operate as the interface between customers and our teams, combining the strengths of Germany\u2019s Concept Laser and Sweden\u2019s Arcam, both leading providers of additive machines and services. We look forward to working closely with European companies and institutes, allowing them to fully realize the transformative potential that additive design and manufacturing can bring. We\u2019re excited about the types of products they will design and the improvements they can make to their operations using additive.\u201d \nGE Additive continues to grow its global infrastructure \u2013 as evidenced by the new Munich center, as well as by its on-going expansion of the Concept Laser headquarters in Lichtenfels. \nThe concept of GE Additive\u2019s Customer Experience Centers is an integral part of GE Additive\u2019s strategy to accelerate the adoption rate of additive manufacturing with businesses worldwide, allowing customers to experience first-hand the value that additive manufacturing can bring. \nAfter the first U.S.-based Customer Experience Center in Pittsburgh became part of the GE Additive family in May 2017, Munich is now the first international center \u2013 with other GE Additive centers planned worldwide to boost the use of additive manufacturing in different regions. \nAdditive manufacturing involves taking a digital design from computer aided design (CAD) software and melting/sintering together in a layer-by-layer manner, using a laser or an electron beam as the energy source. Additive components are typically lighter and more durable than traditional forged parts because they require less welding and machining. Since additive parts are essentially \u201cgrown\u201d from the ground up, they generate far less scrap material. Freed of traditional manufacturing restrictions, additive manufacturing (3D printing) drastically expands the design possibilities for engineers \u2013 and allows them to produce better products. \nAbout GE Additive \nGE Additive is part of GE (NYSE: GE) \u2013 the world\u2019s Digital Industrial Company, transforming industry with software-defined machines and solutions that are connected, responsive and predictive. GE Additive includes additive machine providers Concept Laser and ArcamEBM; along with additive material provider AP&C and additive service provider to the medical industry, DTI. As a notable user of additive technologies GE recognize the value and potential it brings to modern design and manufacturing. GE is organized around a global exchange of knowledge, the \u201cGE Store\u201d, through which each business shares and accesses the same technology, resources and intellect. GE delivers better outcomes for customers by speaking the language of industry. For more information, visit https://www.ge.com/additive .

The offer will close on Friday. \n\nAt the higher end of the price band, the issue is priced at 58.1 times its post dilution EPS on FY17 and 39.9 times on H1FY18 (annualised) basis. \n\nBrokerage Prabhudas Lilladher in a note said that a rising significance of logistics as a strategic function, coupled with lower 3PL penetration , rising consumerism in India , regulatory changes like GST implementation, government focus on \u2018Ease of Doing Business\u2019 etc go in favour of larger organised players like Future Supply Chain Solution. \n\n\"On the flipside, expensive valuations along with significance dependence of group entities and stretched working capital go against the company. We like the space; however, the valuations are stretched and one should subscribe only with a longer term investment horizon,\" the brokerage said. \n\nSo far, higher receivable days of 140 days average seem to have an impact on the company's return on equity (RoE) which on an average stood at 14 per cent for the past three years. Ebitda margins for the company contracted to 13.2 per cent in FY17 from 15.7 per cent in FY15. Revenue and profit over FY15-17 though rose at an annual pace of 17 per cent and 36 per cent, respectively. \n\n\"Strong network in a fast-growing 3PL market , a diverse client base and experienced management team with strong domain expertise, the company is well positioned to capitalise on the upcoming opportunities in the Logistics sector. We believe that the valuation of 57 times on its trailing 12-month EPS leaves a limited upside for investors. However, for investors with a long term time horizon (3-5 years), FSCSL would offer steady compounding returns,\" said EMkay Global Financial Services . 0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "prabhudas lilladher", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emkay global financial services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fscsl", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:27.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3114292d5635d6529b4be247fe2e8e5bb656fcbc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAiu2R__txRg9NDWpVmu89yzc-", "site_full": "groups.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://groups.google.com/a/googleproductforums.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=categories/gmail/other-web-browser-please-specify", "site_categories": ["business"], "section_title": "Gmail Help Forum - Google Product Forums", "title": "Manage Android infrastructure", "title_full": "Manage Android infrastructure - Google Product Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.google.com/images/icons/product/groups-128.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0a08232bce6f5f247c014d49053e0726f4d7e4a1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAiu2R__txRg9NWc1UUE_MhjvX53Pe4QaSew--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "bluequoll", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "You posted in the Google Search forum, but it sounds like your question is about Google/Gmail accounts?\nYour question has been moved to the Gmail Product Forum for more specialized attention.\nYou may also find answers to Account questions in the Accounts Help Center .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:27.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "02fcbc2769958b9042c25abd011d73de408dd4ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS_NCHMCu4yvAT2FprmndB9g-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "02fcbc2769958b9042c25abd011d73de408dd4ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS_NCHMCu4yvAT2FprmndB9g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "public class Do_while_silmukka\r\n{\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args)\r\n    {\r\n    \tint i=0;\r\n\r\n    \tdo\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\tSystem.out.println(\"laskurin i arvo on nyt: \" + i);\r\n    \t\ti++;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \twhile (i < 20);\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n}", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:27.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2e387e80b08e01afffdd608a1593c829753d0b2b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJ8pWQLEIHB1DczuoMoRkHEh65rggyCRzQ5IVr_5QHsaXimBkhqFaV_GzGMDSjYi2OXMrKp_m2OCF1kaZ.7RspUa1NmuKNI80zjWRBSdulceSKR2M1WxXb0Q--", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Cleaning-Trash-Recycling-Trash-Cans/N-5yc1vZcb2g/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "Rubbermaid Roughneck 32 Gal.

(AP) \u0097 Attorneys for a politically connected Florida eye doctor convicted of a $100 million Medicare fraud are arguing that the government's actual loss was significantly less. \nAttorney Josh Sheptow told U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra on Thursday that Dr. Salomon Melgen was ahead of his time, injecting patients with then-experimental drugs that are now approved. \nMedicare does not pay for experimental treatments, so Sheptow suggested Melgen may have falsified billing statements to get around those restrictions. Sheptow said that would be fraud, but the treatments were legitimate, making the government's loss nil on many patients. \nThe amount of loss is important because it bears heavily on Marra's sentencing decision. Melgen could get a life sentence for a $100 million loss, but a minor loss could result in a short sentence. Melgen was found guilty of 67 counts, including health care fraud, submitting false claims and falsifying records in patients' files.

Two more wins, and Indiana would become the 15th team to go undefeated in the College Cup era of men's soccer, and the first team since Santa Clara went undefeated in 1989. In just two games, Indiana could end a 28-year-old drought. \nThere's no reason to think the Hoosiers can't do it either; the team has outperformed nearly every team in the country at this point. The Hoosier offense is ranked 12th in the nation, averaging 2.07 goals per game. The Hoosiers score their goals by committee, with six players notching double-digit points. The team is led by Mason Toye, who has 22 points (10 goals, two assists) in 23 games. The team also has nine players with three or more goals on the season, a testament to the team being able to get goals from any player on the pitch. \nAnd while the Indiana offense is one of the best in the nation, their defense is the best. Ranked No. 1 in the nation, Indiana has only allowed six goals through 23 games this season. The team averages 0.24 goals per game, which is 0.2 goals per game better than the second-ranked team. Goalkeeper Trey Muse has been in net for every minute of Indiana's season, giving him the best goals-against average in the nation as well. Muse and Indiana also has the best save percentage in the country (.909). \nBecause of their stellar play throughout the season, Indiana has been able to dispense of every opponent this season. During the course of the season, Indiana has faced 10 ranked opponents and has yet to record a single loss. Just some of the teams Indiana played included No. 2 Maryland, No. 7 Notre Dame, No. 7 Michigan State (twice), and No. 17 Ohio State.

The composites were used for the adsorption of methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) in aqueous solution. The results indicated that MIL-100(Fe) and GO formed a sandwich-like structure, and the crystal structure of MIL-100(Fe) was reserved in the composites. The attachment of GO layers to the MIL-100(Fe) decreased the surface area from 1690 to 1602 m 2 /g, and pore volume from 0.996 to 0.770 cm 3 /g when 5% ( w / w ) GO was added, due to the coating of MIL-100(Fe) by GO sheets. The addition of 5% ( w / w ) GO increased the adsorption capacity for MB (from 1019 to 1231 mg/g) and MO (from 667 to 1189 mg/g). The composites showed a better thermal stability than MIL-100(Fe); the decomposition temperature increased from 280 to 350 \u00b0C. The addition of GO improved the properties of MIL-100(Fe) as an adsorbent for MO/MB from aqueous solution.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2jnNJpJ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:28.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7663dc33668cda7d8057fed812a8e73530c1a5be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTK9tbdQ_2Ov5x0JjBZKZG1CW6MPn31sk0OhzDKdK3453cuIFqMDgqz_mWjQQrjYiQ-", "site_full": "forum.odroid.com", "site": "odroid.com", "site_section": "https://forum.odroid.com/viewforum.php?f=99", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "ODROID \u2022 View forum -
