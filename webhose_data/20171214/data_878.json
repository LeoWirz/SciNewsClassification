KS \nAEI Ideas \u2013 American Enterprise Institute \nDecember 4, 2017 3:23 pm | AEIdeas About the author \nMark J. Perry @Mark_J_Perry Mark J. Perry is concurrently a scholar at AEI and a professor of economics and finance at the University of Michigan\u2019s Flint campus. He is best known as the creator and editor of the popular economics blog Carpe Diem. At AEI, Perry writes about economic and financial issues for American.com and the AEIdeas blog. Elephant economics: To save elephants, we should promote commercial use and encourage ivory markets and trophy hunting View related content: Carpe Diem Font Size A A The video above \u2014 \u201c Africans Demand Trade in Ivory Products \u201d \u2014 was produced by the Ivory Education Institute, a nonprofit public benefit association dedicated to enhancing understanding of the historic, practical and cultural importance of ivory. Here\u2019s a key excerpt on the economics of poaching elephants and banning ivory trade: \nOutsiders insist that a ban on ivory trade will stop elephant poaching. It won\u2019t. Poaching will end when demand is met through an open controlled ivory market. Bans only create scarcity. Scarcity increases prices and increased prices encourage poaching. To argue otherwise as outsiders do, defies the laws of economics. \nWhat is the Ivory Education Institute\u2019s position on the US ban on importing elephant trophies? Its website features an article (\u201c Trump\u2019s decision on trophies from Zimbabwe elephant hunts bad for elephant conservation \u201c) written by Emmanuel Koro, a Johannesburg-based international award-winning environmental journalist who has extensively covered conservation and development issues in African countries, here\u2019s an excerpt: \nUnited States President Donald Trump has delayed a rare and early Christmas gift that he recently presented to the Zambian and Zimbabwean people. By putting a halt on the lifting of the US ban on importing elephant trophies from the two countries into the US he has muddied the US policy waters. \nThe US is the world\u2019s biggest hunting market and poor rural villagers in Zambia and Zimbabwe see their lives being significantly improved through money that the US hunters pay to hunt elephants. Hunting elephants is legal under strict permit systems in several African countries, and the revenue is crucial for supporting conservation efforts. The large fees that trophy hunters pay to be allowed to hunt elephants, lions and leopards can be a significant source of revenue. In Zimbabwe, according to the Safari Operators\u2019 Association, the annual revenue from trophy hunting for this year could be as much as $130 million, mainly from the US market. \nThe southern African countries, including Zambia and Zimbabwe, practice wise and sustainable use of wildlife products such as elephant hunting trophies, ivory and rhino horn trade, to bring wildlife into balance with their habitats. Therefore, the US Department of Interior\u2019s decision to suspend the US ban on elephant trophies from the two countries into the US was a breath of fresh air and good news for elephant conservation. Sadly, it only took a tweet from President Trump saying the ban would remain, \u201cuntil such time as I review all conservation facts.\u201d That review if done responsibly as we anticipate can only result in the reinstatement of his decision to allow imports of elephant hunting trophies into the USA because the motivating facts are strong, scientific and tested. \nBottom Line : As counter-intuitive as it may seem, if you are really serious about saving African elephants and stopping poaching, you have to support the commercial use of elephants, including trophy hunting and trading in ivory. Here\u2019s the bumper sticker version \u2014 \u201cSave the elephants, buy lots of ivory.\u201d That\u2019s what the Africans in the video above would tell you, and in fact they are demanding t rade in ivory products!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "perry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emmanuel koro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark j. perry @mark_j_perry mark j. perry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "safari operators\u2019 association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american enterprise institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ivory education institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us department of interior", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ks  aei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aei", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flint", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zambia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:26.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9c88832947a0c45a079aa64d5e515fc8cf61c428", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLtsGSwLqD9K1qLuZAnK2fVxbqT04BYl5b.UMz3XMYkRgdZk3_JDwfUVtQBrvJvmoKbQ--", "site_full": "floridastate.forums.rivals.com", "site": "rivals.com", "site_section": "https://floridastate.forums.rivals.com/forums/the-tribal-council.32/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "The Tribal Council | Warchant.com", "title": "Where was Bobby Bowden today?", "title_full": "Where was Bobby Bowden today?

It is not possible to set the size or position of a browser window opened by a Safari App Extension.\nUse case: our browser extension which allows users to import recipes, which is available here: https://www.anylistapp.com/recipes/browser-extensions\nIn Chrome and Firefox, when the user clicks a browser toolbar button to import a recipe, we open a new window that shows the recipe and allows them to edit it before saving. When the user saves the recipe (or cancels), we close the window that we opened. This is not possible with a Safari App Extension.\nMore generally, Safari App Extensions will always be fighting an uphill battle when it comes to adoption, because (1) they are very limited in what they can do (see above) and (2) they are different than every other browser. For strategic reasons, the Safari team should support the WebExtensions API, or as much of it as is practical. Otherwise the selection of extensions available for Safari will be limited, which will motivate power users to use Chrome or Firefox instead, which will mean there is even less of an incentive for developers to make the effort to develop Safari extensions (a vicious cycle).\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions", "https://www.anylistapp.com/recipes/browser-extensions"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:26.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9c88832947a0c45a079aa64d5e515fc8cf61c428", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLtsGSwLqD9K1qLuZAnK2fVxbqT04BYl5b.UMz3XMYkRgdZk3_JDwfUVtQBrvJvmoKbQ--", "site_full": "floridastate.forums.rivals.com", "site": "rivals.com", "site_section": "https://floridastate.forums.rivals.com/forums/the-tribal-council.32/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "The Tribal Council | Warchant.com", "title": "Where was Bobby Bowden today?", "title_full": "Where was Bobby Bowden today? | Warchant.com", "published": "2017-12-06T18:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 33, "participants_count": 32, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.646, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3057, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "92482e89f576392f9e5621d8aeb03c6de5ae8a49", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLtsGSwLqD9K1qLuZAnK2fVxbqT04BYl5b.UMz3XMYkRgdZk3_JDwfUVsSA4Rlwp8YadgnqdWNU3mq", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "DoakCampbell1972", "published": "2017-12-06T18:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:26.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "05e43f30e90145f12be2ca0be9dee2019a289639", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTIjXRLn6u6SVT2.lupsJDmkvPOEDxJqFGSCFkNdeJElONXuGuHK2XXLLeSDyBehtSZ2wLLRBhFjDZvip92rnR38DrBG2gERsw-", "site_full": "www.aussiestockforums.com", "site": "aussiestockforums.com", "site_section": "https://www.aussiestockforums.com/forums/general-chat.5/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "General Chat | Aussie Stock Forums", "title": "Is Shorten PM material? | Page 49", "title_full": "Is Shorten PM material? | Page 49 | Aussie Stock Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T15:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.aussiestockforums.com/data/avatars/m/0/366.jpg?1482408638", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bc0d9c839ec4f9192da44ae10411b9e67d6cd00b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTIjXRLn6u6SVT2.lupsJDmkvPOEDxJqFGSCFkNdeJElONXuGuHK2XXLLeSDyBehtSZ2wLLRBhFjDZvip92rnR37lKGFrRXQdPrfQapBC3jMQ--", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "dutchie", "published": "2017-12-07T16:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Macquack said: \u2191 Posting false doctored statements just highlights your bias and lowers your credibility.

More >> Scientists   \nBy RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVARAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - People on Medicaid are more prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But that's not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge. \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" \nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n- Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n- Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n- Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C. \nFor the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point. For Medicaid recipients, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points.

I have looked at the costs and I am not considering using spray foam of any kind.\nFor an unvented, cathedral ceiling, the local code calls for R-38.\nI am planning on having 2x10 rafters with R-30 unfaced batt insulation (with no recessed lighting or other) within the rafter cavity. Above the rafters will be a layer of sheathing, above that 2\" of R-12 rigid polyiso, above that a layer of a nail-base for roof felt and asphalt sheathing. I plan to tape all seams of sheathing and nailbase with the appropriate tape for plywood or OSB.\nA pdf of the proposed assembly is attached.\nI will be doing the construction of the addition myself. The addition is about 1000sf on an existing 720sf home so to some degree is might be considered a new build.\nIn this assembly I plan to create an air barrier directly above the layer of sheathing by taping it. The moisture barrier would occur at the roof felt below the asphalt shingles.\nWould anyone provide feedback on the following:\n1) From what I have read, the R-12 rigid should provide adequate insulation to prevent moisture issues on the underside of the decking. The local code specifies R-10 so I should be OK. I greatly appreciate feedback on the entire assembly and any aspects of it.\n2) Do I need to install taped gypsum board or other as an air barrier below the rafters? I have come across conflicting advice. Most advice has told be to eliminate a Type 1 vapor barrier from below the rafters. However, I have been warned that if I have a wood ceiling I will need taped gypsum board above it. I believe that if I create an air barrier above the batt insulation (by taping the sheathing), it will dry to the inside. Is there an issue with installing a wood ceiling without a taped gypsum substrate?\n3) I would like to install a skylight but I am worried about moisture issues occurring locally around its perimeter. My gut tells me that if things are sealed air-tight I should be OK, but I would love feedback.The skylight will be located just below the ridge and ice dams are not a local problem.\nI have been reading this site for a while but it is my first post. Maybe these questions should be split into separate threads, but not sure. I appreciate any feedback and follow-up questions!!\n125.61 KB eave section_CLVRDL_sg.pdf 27.53 KB", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:27.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9c88832947a0c45a079aa64d5e515fc8cf61c428", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLtsGSwLqD9K1qLuZAnK2fVxbqT04BYl5b.UMz3XMYkRgdZk3_JDwfUVtQBrvJvmoKbQ--", "site_full": "floridastate.forums.rivals.com", "site": "rivals.com", "site_section": "https://floridastate.forums.rivals.com/forums/the-tribal-council.32/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "The Tribal Council | Warchant.com", "title": "Where was Bobby Bowden today?", "title_full": "Where was Bobby Bowden today? | Warchant.com", "published": "2017-12-06T18:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 33, "participants_count": 32, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.646, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3057, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "001e999b11315e5e9b2cb730ebe1d2059bd6fa6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLtsGSwLqD9K1qLuZAnK2fVxbqT04BYl5b.UMz3XMYkRgdZk3_JDwfUVsSA4Rlwp8YabuqFRMERg2H", "ord_in_thread": 21, "author": "TheRealJoePistone29", "published": "2017-12-06T19:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:27.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b0c27b0e07a1a2f678d59a7cf9bb7edfe0ecc19", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nmFR93hfFGTJeefh9wq7n6dPXTYdfN8CDSVfghvMTqHkItVua9itdehHtSh0grOTj0eY6x2mHmYZ4jq1SoX.L7w--", "site_full": "www.theguardian.com", "site": "theguardian.com", "site_section": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Latest financial, market &amp; economic news and analysis | Business | The Guardian", "title": "China's debt levels pose stability risk, says IMF | Business", "title_full": "China's debt levels pose stability risk, says IMF | Business | The Guardian", "published": "2017-12-07T03:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 50, "participants_count": 27, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.117, "main_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e44b6468adf872372bc6bc2f27ae8b814f6542b/0_226_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&amp;s=9c667fd43db81a8537badd5a202cbf98", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 170, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8f1f0b900b5fee4e350fa628bac54cddfd4a9b38", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nmFR93hfFGTJeefh9wq7n6dPXTYdfN8CDSVfghvMTqHkItVua9itdehHtSh0grOTj0eY6x2mHmYY.vEq_tBueY1zI5h60gVnVaMqjh277tsQ-", "ord_in_thread": 44, "author": "Aran1000", "published": "2017-12-07T12:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "That's pretty naive, the forces that cause financial crisises are apolitical.\nFirstly during the last financial crisis plenty of banks have been bailed out outside of China in Europe and the US( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008 ), that did not stop the last crisis.

Read Report Overview @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/energy-recovery-ventilators-market.html Going forward, the competition within this market is likely to intensify further due to the rising number of companies venturing into it. Apart from this, the expansion of the product portfolio of established enterprises, in order to cater to the augmenting demand for technically advanced products is also projected to deepen their rivalry over the forthcoming years. According to the research report, the worldwide market for energy recovery ventilators was valued at US$1.8 bn in 2015. Expanding at a phenomenal CAGR of 11.50% between 2016 and 2024, the opportunity in this market is likely to reach a value of US$4.8 bn by the end of the forecast period. In terms of volume, the market is projected to cross 15.9 mn units mark by 2024. The industrial sector has emerged as the leading application area of energy recovery ventilators and is projected to remain so throughout the forecast period. Europe to Surpass North America in Global Energy Recovery Ventilators Market In this research report, the global energy recovery ventilators market has also been examined on the basis of its regional distribution. Europe, Asia Pacific, North America, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa have been considered as the main regional markets for energy recovery ventilators in this study. Among these, North America has acquired the leading position, thanks to the presence of leading energy recovery ventilators manufacturers in a large number and the high adoption rate of these ventilators in this region. Although the North America market for energy recovery ventilators will continue to report steady growth, its maturing nature may limit its rise to a considerable extent, which is likely to lead the Europe market for energy recovery ventilators to the top position with a share of 30.2% by the end of the forecast period. Asia Pacific, on the other hand, is also anticipated to witness a significant rise in its market for energy recovery ventilators in the near future, thanks to the increasing awareness pertaining to health among consumers in this region, states the research report. Request Sample Report @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=17549 Demand for Energy Recovery Ventilators to be Fueled by Growing Concerns over Health and Well-being \u201cWith the growing concerns of consumers pertaining to their health and well-being, the demand for energy recovery ventilators will witness a tremendous surge in the near future,\u201d expects the author of this study. The alarming rise in the air pollution has turned the interest of consumers towards the quality of the air they breathe, which consequently is leading to an increased demand for energy recovery ventilators. Researchers expect this scenario to remain same over the next few years, reflecting greatly on the sales of these ventilators. On the flip side, the high cost of energy recovery ventilators and the lack of awareness about the benefits offered by these ventilators among consumers may hamper the growth of this market to some extent in the years to come, notes the study. \nAbout Us \nTransparency Market Research (TMR) is a global market intelligence company providing business information reports and services.

Hanson Overdependence On Medical Science As A Way to Cure Snoring and Sleep Apnea\u2026 \nPeople who suffer from snoring or sleep apnea are often unaware of the severity of their condition and the disruption it causes for those around them. Those who do seek treatment for their symptoms may feel as though medical therapy is the only solution. As a result, individuals who snore or experience sleep apnea may become overly dependent on medical technology as they seek to cure their disorders. \nSnoring and other problems associated with sleep apnea are the result of airway obstruction, often from excess or relaxed throat tissue that vibrates during sleep. Treatments for snoring and sleep apnea are mostly focused on opening the airway to facilitate healthy breathing and prevent additional complications. These treatments range from nasal strips to full oral devices. \nLess-intensive treatment options to open the nasal airway include nasal strips, decongestants, and over-the-counter nasal sprays. These options are not always effective, however, and can damage the lining of the nose or encourage dependence. More-intensive medical treatments for snoring and sleep apnea include oral devices to bring the jaw forward and open the airway, although these may not fit well or may be uncomfortable to wear every night. Additionally, oral devices often have lower compliance rates that render them less effective. Surgery is sometimes suggested for severe snoring, but it is not very effective for reducing sleep apnea. \nMedical research has recently emphasized the efficacy of behavioral methods instead of medication or surgery for treating sleep disorders like snoring and sleep apnea. Because approximately 56% of patients with obstructive sleep apnea are position-dependent snorers, many of those with this condition could benefit greatly from positional therapy enabling them to sleep on their side instead of on their back. Other lifestyle changes can be a helpful supplement or an alternative to medical treatment for less-severe cases of snoring and sleep apnea, such as losing weight, quitting smoking, avoiding alcohol and tobacco, and exercising.

Advertisement Advertisement \nLego, whose name is derived from the Danish \"leg godt\" meaning \"play well\", is competing with Barbie maker Mattel Inc and Hasbro, the firm behind My Little Pony, for a slice of the Chinese market. \nThe case was filed against two Chinese companies, which had been manufacturing and selling Bela products that were almost identical to Lego's.

The fee is charged by the fund company and added back to the fund. A redemption fee may also be known as an \"exit fee\", \u201cmarket timing fee\u201d, or \u201cshort-term trading fee.\u201d It is typically instituted within a specified timeframe. BREAKING DOWN 'Redemption Fee' \nA redemption fee is one type of fee typically associated with a mutual fund. A redemption fee may be charged by a fund company when an investor sells shares from the fund. Mutual funds are typically part of a long-term investment strategy and are not usually intended for short-term trading or gains from market timing. For this reason mutual fund timing is a legal but frowned-upon practice that usually results in an additional charge for the investor. To discourage short-term trading, fund companies will typically charge a redemption fee within a specified timeframe. Most fund companies use a timeframe of 30 days. If an investor exits the fund within 30 days of their initial purchase then a redemption fee could be charged. In effect, this means that mutual fund timing may be subjected to higher fees occasioned by the transaction costs of the short-term trading of fund shares. Outside of a designated minimum holding period for an investment in a fund, investors typically are not charged for redeeming shares of the investment. Thus, it is important to be aware of any redemption fees and timeframes that may be associated with them. \nThe primary reason a redemption fee is needed is to protect other investors from higher transaction costs. Active short-term redemptions lead to two significant issues for the fund manager. One, the fund is required to maintain higher cash positions to accommodate sell orders. Two, short-term trading increases the overall operating costs of the fund. To keep cash positions and operating expenses lower, the fund may enact a redemption fee. Fee Considerations \nMutual fund investing can involve numerous fees throughout the investment duration. Other fees involved may include sales loads, 12-b1 fees and account service fees. Investors should ensure they understand all fees involved before buying and selling a mutual fund. \nVanguard mutual funds do not broadly include redemption fees however they are required in some of the fund company\u2019s mutual funds. The Global ex-U.S. Real Estate Index Fund Investor Shares (VGXRX) is one example. This fund has a purchase fee and a redemption fee to support expenses of the Fund. VGXRX charges a purchase fee of 0.25% and a redemption fee of 0.25%.

More >> Scientists   \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

The decision overturns decades of US policy and risks triggering a fresh spasm of violence in the Middle East especially in Palestine and plunge an already volatile region into even more uncertainty. \nThe move has invited sharp criticism from across the world with the Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan terming Jerusalem the red line for Muslims. \nErdogan said that Ankara could go as far as breaking off diplomatic ties with Tel Aviv if the United States formally recognises Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, a move he said would be a \u201cred line\u201d for Muslims. \n\u201cMr Trump! Jerusalem is a red line for Muslims,\u201d Erdogan said in a televised speech to his governing party, warning that if such a move was taken Turkey would call a summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). \n\u201cWe are warning the US once again. You cannot take this kind of step.\u201d \nErdogan also said Jerusalem is inviolable for Muslims and ignoring that would have serious consequences. \nThe Jewish leaders hailed the announcement of US president and called it a \u201chistoric decision\u201d while the Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the move and called it a \u201ccourageous decision\u201d. \nThe move has triggered protests across the whole world and world leaders from across Arab and some from Europe denounced the move. The Arab and the wider Muslim world \u2013 including a number of US allies \u2013 condemned Mr Trump\u2019s announcement. \n\u201cThe US move represents a significant decline in efforts to push a peace process and is a violation of the historically neutral American position on Jerusalem,\u201d the Saudi royal court said. \nMalaysian PM Najib Razak called on Muslims everywhere to \u201cmake it clear that we strongly oppose\u201d the US move. \nBritish PM Theresa May said she disagreed with the US decision, which was \u201cunhelpful in terms of prospects for peace in the region\u201d \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron both said their countries did not support the move \nThe head of Hamas accused Trump of disregarding Palestinian feelings with his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. In a statement, quoted by BBC, Ismail Haniyeh said that the Palestinian people \u201cknow how to respond properly to the disregard of their feelings and sanctuaries\u201d. \nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said there was no alternative to a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians and that Jerusalem was a final-status issue that should be resolved through direct talks. \nLeaders from Kashmir also reacted to the announcement made by US president to move Israel capital to Jerusalem and they called it anti-muslim. \nFormer Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omer Abdullah took to Twitter: \u201cThere was a time when the Trump administration moves to overturn decades of Us policy WRT# Jerusalem would have proved a strong condemnation from India. (sic)\u201d \nProminent Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said that people of Kashmir strongly denounce the US presidents move to announce Jerusalem as the \u201cso-called\u201d capital of Israel. \u201cWe urge the UN to take action In accordance with UN character. OIC should take strong note and stand united against this anti-Muslim move.\u201d \nPalestinians called a general strike and rallies to protest against the Trump\u2019s announcement and the Palestinian education ministry declared a day off and urged teachers as well as high school and university students to take part in the planned rallies in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Palestinian areas in Jerusalem and the Palestinian general delegate to the U.K. stated that if the U.S. president recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, he would effectively be \u201cdeclaring war.\u201d \nDemonstrations have already taken place outside the US consulate in many Muslim dominated countries like Istanbul, Turkey. \nThere were demonstrations in Gaza against the decision before it was announced in response to a call from the Islamist Hamas movement that runs the Gaza strip, local Hamas media reported. \nHamas said that Trump\u2019s decision would \u201copen the doors of hell\u201d on US interests in the region. \nPalestinians want the capital of an independent Palestinian state to be in the city\u2019s eastern sector, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move never recognised internationally.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angela merkel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ismail haniyeh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "najib razak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "omer abdullah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emmanuel macron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antonio guterres", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mirwaiz umar farooq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hamas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "organisation of islamic cooperation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wrt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kashmir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "istanbul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jammu", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:30.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0dc371b6048612052b02ce5448ac252db0acb8ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_kNOYMWIthylTUGkFjTM60jqqdDuDF8RL20bMacrDdQZit4J.kywG8Q2sY2WINJJrHR6nI0mfu961VsgHMhJjINIeWFWxpfYxDlh6pwe5cF8loYmEdViVgfd8CUjSMLFfceAmP9biKQ_xOj8.BI4OI.Gxi0js_1lZmNfD1wSSSeGo6LDoemEoLXGewdtFfW.Y-", "site_full": "www.independent.co.uk", "site": "independent.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/rss", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "The Independent -

I've managed to more or less pinpoint the limit to 2500 characters, but this might be specific to my environment.\nI'm using the following expression to match the comments:\n/<comment:((\\/\\*([^*]|[\\r\\n]|(\\*+([^*\\/]|[\\r\\n])))*\\*+\\/))+>/mi\nIs there some limit to the size of the match I should be aware of, or is there a flaw in my regex?\nMy stacktrace is:\n|project://Sevo1/src/Volume.rsc|(985,32,<53,12>,<53,44>): StackOverflow() at countLines(|project://Sevo1/src/Volume.rsc|(985,33,<53,12>,<53,45>)) at $root$(|prompt:///|(0,73,<1,0>,<1,73>))", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:30.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ff4d1288383c9c7ba17dcf963a94945773957bc9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsChfxanB55rJojv7BvbAVT.JxtP5K4ACjN0hi15_6qSJpe7h.MPJQzEN8Br9GcIoMYjeJ1pniJh8G8QzuCbvO9U071IO.QdIq1r_3jDqti4MKLOWSemAm7", "site_full": "manualdeultramarinos.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://manualdeultramarinos.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "manual de ultramarinos", "title": "Trata de olvidarlas (Editorial Trea)", "title_full": "Trata de olvidarlas (Editorial Trea)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ES", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ff4d1288383c9c7ba17dcf963a94945773957bc9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsChfxanB55rJojv7BvbAVT.JxtP5K4ACjN0hi15_6qSJpe7h.MPJQzEN8Br9GcIoMYjeJ1pniJh8G8QzuCbvO9U071IO.QdIq1r_3jDqti4MKLOWSemAm7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Vokislav Karbajc (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "Trata de olvidarlas (Editorial Trea)", "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[el trapero]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:30.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fab3f14d667e000c023375a07626d17b4760c1de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.U23DugYYoG8Y5E4obsYwWO_xC6SqLtSKRG3DVU8ZMWENEjoqxRtBppowqefTUYJFiqjyz_HfUN5JyYbFz0UyMlTA6hB2cssxh_RAPgZnYaSgde8oTrgu67UMrZCPdDVsRpYdX7zAbwFw--", "site_full": "kashmirlife.net", "site": "kashmirlife.net", "site_section": "http://www.kashmirlife.net/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Kashmir Life", "title": "Wanted in a molestation case, absconder nabbed in Handwara after 9 years: Police", "title_full": "Wanted in a molestation case, absconder nabbed in Handwara after 9 years: Police", "published": "2017-12-07T11:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://kashmirlife.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/court-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fab3f14d667e000c023375a07626d17b4760c1de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.U23DugYYoG8Y5E4obsYwWO_xC6SqLtSKRG3DVU8ZMWENEjoqxRtBppowqefTUYJFiqjyz_HfUN5JyYbFz0UyMlTA6hB2cssxh_RAPgZnYaSgde8oTrgu67UMrZCPdDVsRpYdX7zAbwFw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "KL News Network", "published": "2017-12-07T11:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "Wanted in a molestation case, absconder nabbed in Handwara after 9 years: Police", "text": "Kashmir Wire Srinagar \nAn absconder allegedly wanted in a molestation case dating 2008 in northern Kashmir\u2019s Handwara town of Kupwara district was finally arrested on Thursday from his home, police said \nHe was identified as Mushtaq Ahmad Badana (28), son of Taj-u-din Badana of remote Hatchmarg village was nabbed from his home this afternoon following specific information about his presence there. \n\u201cDespite efforts, he averted arrest in a molestation case registered in police station Villgam in 2008.
