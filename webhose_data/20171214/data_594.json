Al Franken, (D-MN) speaks to the media after returning back to work in the U.S. Senate on Capitol Hill on November 27, 2017 in Washington, DC. Franken took questions from reporters outside of his office in light of the multiple women accusing him of sexual misconduct. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) Leave this field empty if you're human: \nThis is a darn rollercoaster. \nFirst, a quick recap. A former Democratic congressional aide recently came out and accused Sen. Franken of trying to kiss her. He allegedly told her, \u201cIt\u2019s my right as an entertainer.\u201d \nHold on. \n\u2014 Sen. Al Franken (@SenFranken) December 6, 2017 \nWe all know what THAT means, right? What else could it mean, other than him announcing his resignation? \nWell, stop assuming he\u2019s resigning, chumps. YOU DON\u2019T KNOW. That\u2019s what Franken\u2019s saying now. His people are all, \u201cAny reports of a final decision are inaccurate.\u201d Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate. \n\u2014 Sen. Al Franken (@SenFranken) December 6, 2017 Not accurate, @mpr @Stowydad . No final decision has been made and the Senator is still talking with his family. Please update your story. \n\u2014 Sen. Al Franken (@SenFranken) December 6, 2017 \nOh please. Can you imagine the backlash he\u2019d receive if he came out and was all, \u201cSorry folks! I\u2019m not resigning at this time!\u201d? All hell would break loose! There\u2019s NO WAY that\u2019ll happen. (Now watch that happen.) \nWe\u2019ll find out soon enough. Stay tuned.

Liang was the first person with Dieselgate involvement to be sentenced to US federal prison. \nSchmidt was arrested at a Florida airport in January upon returning from holiday, then in August pleaded guilty to two charges related to the emissions scandal \u2013 conspiracy to defraud the United States to commit wire fraud and to violate the Clean Air Act, and violating the Clean Air Act itself. A third charge relating to wire fraud was dropped, said the report. \nSchmidt learned of the emissions control defeat devices in the summer of 2015, and failed to disclose their existence, he said when entering his guilt plea. Schmidt\u2019s defense attorney appealed for a maximum sentence of 40 months with a US$100,000 (RM163,400) fine; however, the federal judge Sean Cox meted out the highest sentencing within guidelines in the Eastern District of Michigan United States District Court. \nAs for the automaker itself, Volkswagen AG pleaded guilty in March to three criminal charges related to the scandal, receiving a $2.8 billion (RM11.4 billion) fine and a three-year probation period.

Per Rossi it was produced in March 2016. The lever cycled smoothly, the sights were on good & square and there were no outward signs of shoddy workmanship or assembly. This one has a little more grain showing than my earlier 92's and there is even sort of a finish on it, as opposed to the stain-painted 92 stocks I've had in the past. The wood to metal fit is better than most that have been through my hands.\nOddly, this rifle has a longer stock than either of my previous 92's. Slick buttplate aside, it shoulders like a rifle ought to. The trigger is better than any new 92 I've handled.\nQuick as chores were done, the Missus and I took it down and ran a few rounds through it. The sights were on from the factory and it fed the Lee 255 RF, the Missouri Bullet 255 SWCs and Sierra 240 JHPs all just fine. It shot well too. We started at 25 yards, moved to 50 yards and ended firing a few shots at 100. I never missed the 14\u201d plate and was pleased to discover this menagerie of ammo landed in an egg shaped group maybe 4x6 inches, from the center of the plate to its lower edge. I gotta say, this 20\u201d gun is easier to hit with than my 16\u201d 45 Colt was. I seem to have finally gotten an excellent Rossi 92.\nI needed to check this 92's accuracy but buckhorn sights and I don't get along for fine shooting. I shoot much better with a flat top rear sight and I happened to have a spare in the parts bin. I also replaced the front bead with a 0.400 tall take-off from a previous 16\u201d Rossi 357, because I figured it'd work better with the lower replacement rear sight. I drifted both sights into what looked to be the center of the barrel and headed down in the field to check zero.\nMy standard 45 Colt load is a 8.5 grains of Universal and Maplewood's Lee 452-255-RF sized 0.454\u201d. It pretty much duplicates the ballistics of the original 40 grain black-powder government load and it's been exceptionally accurate in every 45 Colt I've tried it it. My guesswork sight placement was perfect this time so I moved back to 100 yards, took a rest and fired three careful shots at the rifle plate. I heard it ring steel every time and I didn't see any hits out in the white, so I knew they all had to be in the 6\u201d black dot. What I didn't expect was that they overlapped each other. It might not be a long range rig, but I can't complain about the way it shoots.\nFor clarifications sake- I'm not pretending for a minute I can reproduce that group on demand, but it's sure nice when the stars line up. It also tells me the rifle has plenty of accuracy for anything I'll need to do with a pistol-caliber lever action.\n'What's good for me ain't necessarily good for the weak minded'\nRetargument\nN. 1.

I absolutely do NOT recommend that you buy one. These Taurus-Rossi 357\u2019s are generating a lot of feeding complaints, often due to cartridges hanging up on their way into the chamber. Mine required chamber polishing, a total re-work of the sights, cartridge lifter and guides before it was shootable and remotely reliable. The trigger started at 7 pounds and now breaks at three. The magazine follower is plastic and must be replaced. The wood needs refinishing, right out of the box. Sight dovetail dimensions are all over the place. So are sharp edges, which require rounding off and rebluing. They are a PITA to work on, everything inside them is cast/MIM and Rossi will NOT sell you internal parts. So if you\u2019re serious about investing in a 357 carbine- do yourself a favor and just get a Marlin 1894C.\nThe .357 Magnum Carbine, Perfected\nhttp:/ / www.thesixgunjournal.net/ the-357-magnum-carbine-perfected/\nI was all set to order a 20\" round barrel Marlin in 45 Colt, which are just over $400 if you shop around. So I inquired here and their about the Marlin's current QC and pretty much got this-\nQuote:\nI have a Stainless Marlin 1894 in .44 mag. That had an oversized bore. I returned it to Marlin and they replaced the barrel with a proper bore sized barrel. It is a great shooter. That was about a year before Rem. took over.\nPersonally, I'd snag it. Most of the problems that people report could be fixed, other than the perennial 'oversized chamber and bore' issues, which seem to be endemic among 45 Colt rifles of all makes. Oversized bores just mean you'll need cast bullets of a bit larger-than-standard size, or jacketed bullets.\nIf it isn't up to snuff, sell it on the used market and you'll not likely lose much; there are lots of folks who just want a 'shooter' and don't care all that much about accuracy.\nIt got worse from there. So I decided to roll the dice, one more time, and try another Rossi. It ain't like I've never been inside one LOL! My first 45 Colt was pretty good, the 357 was a PITA and this last 45 appears to be a gem. Third time's a charm?\nI still can't, in good conscience, recommend them.\nLast edited by SargeMO; 11/06/17 . 'What's good for me ain't necessarily good for the weak minded'\nRetargument\nN. 1.

Staff Photo by Matt Stone prev next comments Mark Cuban\u2019s basketball team isn\u2019t where he wants it to be just now, but the Dallas Mavericks owner couldn\u2019t be much happier with the position of his league these days.\nCuban, who envies the Celtics\u2019 quick rebuild, avoided any urge to gloat about the NBA\u2019s rise in TV ratings and popularity while the NFL slides. He was, after all, most prescient 31\u20442 years ago in his prediction of the football downturn because of overexposure. (\u201cPigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.\u201d)\nBut the man who moonlights as co-star of TV\u2019s \u201cShark Tank\u201d also noted the participation issue raised by greater knowledge of head trauma, as well as playing to a key audience.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a confluence of a couple of things,\u201d Cuban said. \u201cNo. 1, our demographic keeps on getting younger. The NFL and baseball, they keep on getting older. And I think what we\u2019re doing with (the video game) NBA 2K is brilliant. And in the bigger scheme of things in terms of building fans for the future, what do you want your kids to play? I mean, of all the sports out there, do you want to go to a baseball game, or do want to watch your kid play basketball? Do you want to worry about him a whole football game, or do you want to watch your kid play basketball? Do you want him to get healthy from running the court, or do you want to watch him play football and worry about collisions.\n\u201cI think we all have structural issues in terms of kids not watching sports like we did, because television isn\u2019t primary anymore. And I think what really makes the NBA stand out heads and tails above every other sport is you know our players. Tom Brady, (Rob) Gronkowski \u2014 how many other football players, if you saw them from the Patriots, would you know? Maybe (Julian) Edelman?\u201d\nSomeone mentioned Brandin Cooks.\n\u201cYeah, but would you know him if you saw him?,\u201d Cuban said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the thing. In baseball, of the 25 players, you might know two or three. Kids play 2K, watch a game, watch TV; you know every player. That\u2019s a huge advantage because our players have brands. Our players have platforms. Our players have voices. LeBron (James) tweets, and more people see it than our politicians.\u201d\nHe took it a step further.\n\u201cI hate to just keep banging on the NFL, but the saturation was a symptom of a bigger problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I said that pigs get fat, because you see how they handle controversy. They don\u2019t know what to do, and the players can\u2019t really deal with it. Here our players have a big enough voice that if we screw up, our players correct us. Whether it\u2019s (Brad (Stevens), whether it\u2019s Danny (Ainge), whether it\u2019s (Al) Horford, whether it\u2019s Kyrie (Irving) \u2014 they all have voices. They can say what\u2019s on their mind, and that has a bigger impact on how fans respond than what (commissioner) Adam Silver says or what I say or what Wyc (Grousbeck, the Celtics co-owner) says. That\u2019s a huge thing.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people realize that talent drives this game. Personalities drive this game. We are the only league where talent comes first, and that\u2019s a critical distinction.\u201d\nBack in the business of winning games, Cuban held up the Celts as a model.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great organization, and they\u2019ve done a great job,\u201d Cuban said. \u201cI think the hallmark of what they did is how they get their teams to play hard. That\u2019s really what we look to emulate more than anything else. I mean, they\u2019ve done a great job in the draft, but there\u2019s as much luck as anything else there, and things have got to fall in your lap one way or the other. So the way it\u2019s worked out, the biggest takeaway that we\u2019ve seen in looking at the Celts \u2014 and we\u2019ve done a lot of deals with them, so we\u2019re close to them \u2014 really, more than anything, it\u2019s just how hard Brad gets his teams to play. \u201d\nThe conversation then turned to Cuban\u2019s team.\n\u201cWe just started last year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t going into last year thinking we were rebuilding, but (Andrew) Bogut got hurt and Deron Williams was hurt. We started off 3-17 or something ridiculous, and until we went into tank mode once we got eliminated from the playoffs, we were just outside the playoffs. So we have just started the rebuild, and hopefully it won\u2019t be long.\u201d\nAnd if some club was willing to make a big offer for 39-year-old Dirk Nowitzki?\n\u201cI still wouldn\u2019t trade Dirk even if they offered me three No. 1\u2019s,\u201d Cuban said with a smile. \u201cFour, yes. But three, no.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

If the New York Giants or any other team with a vacancy isn\u2019t already impressed with his abilities, McDaniels has another opportunity to strut his stuff.\nConsider the variables.\nThe Patriots are down an all-world tight end thanks to Rob Gronkowski\u2019s one-game suspension. That leaves McDaniels drawing up plays without his best offensive weapon. He also might not have wide receiver Chris Hogan, who hasn\u2019t played since Oct.\u200929 because of a shoulder injury. Hogan practiced for the first time yesterday, so he\u2019s a question mark. Then there\u2019s the uncertainty on the offensive line, where the Pats might be down to his third-string right tackle.\nPut all that together with the fact the Patriots are facing the Dolphins for the second time in three weeks, and it gets a little tricky.\nAs we\u2019ve seen through the years, however, McDaniels is creative, especially when up against a wall.\nWhen he didn\u2019t have Tom Brady and Jimmy Garoppolo last season, he came up with a plan for third-string quarterback Jacoby Brissett, a rookie making his first start, to beat Houston.\nAlready this season, he had receiver Julian Edelman taken away and had to adjust his game plans accordingly, without his best chain-mover. He also had to incorporate a deep threat in Brandin Cooks and discover the types of plays that fit him best. The wideout enters Monday night\u2019s game with 53 receptions, second on the team to Gronkowski. McDaniels masterfully has weaved his stable of running backs into the offense, using them to attack on the ground and out of the backfield as receivers.\nSo even before taking the field against the Dolphins, McDaniels\u2019 stock is high. He might already be the leader in the clubhouse in New York, especially if the Giants first hire Nick Caserio as general manager.\nAnd if that doesn\u2019t happen, everything he does from here on out just enhances the resume since his first failed attempt as a head coach in Denver. As the saying goes, it\u2019s all gravy.\nHe has five Super Bowl rings, two as an offensive coordinator. Sure, he has Brady running the show, but the flow and feel of the Patriots offense is directed by McDaniels.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been doing it for a long time. Our whole team has a lot of faith in the game plans he throws out there every week. We really believe in him,\u201d wide receiver Danny Amendola said. \u201cWhatever pieces he has, he\u2019s going to put our guys in the best position to make our guys successful. We do a good job as a team and as an offense buying into that.\u201d\nHis mission against the Dolphins, who were successful getting in to Brady two weeks ago \u2014 either sacking him or beating him up (eight quarterback hits) \u2014 is to prevent that scenario from happening again, this time without Gronk, his best run blocker, pass protector and target in the short passing game.\nStill, McDaniels will dial something up, whether it\u2019s using his running backs more, which worked well in the first meeting, or having Brady rely on the short passing game and get rid of the ball quickly.\n\u201cHe\u2019s an awesome coach. I\u2019m sure glad to play with him,\u201d left tackle Nate Solder said of McDaniels. \u201cLife\u2019s never without its adversity. We go into whatever situation to do the best we can. We don\u2019t make excuses, we don\u2019t find reasons to beat ourselves, we just play the best we can whatever the situation is.\u201d\nCooks also is a believer and will be confident in whatever McDaniels draws up for Monday night.\n\u201cHe does such a great job, working with the pieces of the puzzle he has and putting it all together. You have to commend him for that,\u201d Cooks said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy job, but he comes in here and works hard at it. It\u2019s great to have him as the OC.\u201d\nTheir brief sideline spat in Buffalo notwithstanding, Brady loves having him, too. He knows McDaniels is on everyone\u2019s radar, and if he isn\u2019t, he should be.\nMonday night is just one more chance for him to shine.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://embed.sendtonews.com/player3/embedcode.js?fk=KG5SCeOG&cid=4407&offsetx=0&offsety=0&floatwidth=400&floatposition=bottom-right"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "josh mcdaniels", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "karen guregian", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jimmy garoppolo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob gronkowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcdaniels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom brady", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick caserio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danny amendola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nate solder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cooks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brady", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris hogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacoby brissett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julian edelman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gronkowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gronk", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york giants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brandin cooks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dolphins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foxboro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foxboro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffalo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:34.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c5b3b928976dfe91fc0a4cf9d61cf0ec14f50cb6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS_cjoAg0XEIw5QkF21DKo5A-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "debug", "title_full": "debug", "published": "2017-12-07T11:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c5b3b928976dfe91fc0a4cf9d61cf0ec14f50cb6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS_cjoAg0XEIw5QkF21DKo5A-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "debug", "text": "[07-Dec-2017 09:41:07 UTC] PHP Notice:  wp_enqueue_style was called <strong>incorrectly</strong>.

The more of the world they explore the more it hurts them, worse than before. So they cry, perhaps from pain, perhaps from fear. Kids cry a lot in their first few years of life.\nI kind of feel like love for young adults is a lot like a baby slowly exploring the world. Each time we learn to love a little bit deeper and each time it doesn\u2019t pan out the wound hurts more and takes a lot more out of us.\nI spent the last year out of my 3 year relationship trying to find a way to patch up the wound that was our love life. That is not to say he did not try too, but all we did for the last year was keep picking at a scab, and refusing to let it heal and fade away. But a few months ago I finally realized I ran out of ideas to help and that it was at the point where I was spending more time crying due to him than laughing, and I am sure I was probably hurting him more than helping him as well. And honestly I think that was a really great move on our part, and things have been going pretty well for each of us since then, despite the awkwardness. I feel like I can move on, be myself and explore things finally, and it has been so wonderful doing so.\nBut now I am faced with a situation, I have never had this attraction to someone physically like I do with this playmate. This instant comfort around him is weird. And at first I figured it would not really be a problem since I would graduate in May and move away so I would have an excuse not to pursue this further, but now I have realized that I will not be graduating on time and that the interest is somewhat mutual. I have only ever considered dating my best friends, and while I know this isn\u2019t a decision I need to make right now because we hardly know each other, it is still kind of scary. Now making an effort to pursue it is an option. But I don\u2019t know if I want to play that game again so soon because the pain seems to get worse each time things fall apart, and I just stop hurting not that long ago.\nI really do love playing with him though, and the more I learn about him the more impressed I am with his strength as a person inside and out. I tend to be a fixer. I like to date people who need me in some way, as much as I hate to admit it. But with him, it is the opposite. The more I learn about him the more I realize that he is more than capable of fixing himself when something breaks. I can\u2019t help being fascinated by him and wanting to listen to any story he will share.\nBut for now, I like how things are, and I want to just play and get to know him more, and that seems to be what he wants too. So I will just keep up on my feels repellant for a few months as it is a bit too soon to be catching those.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:58:34.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5de1fc9c20199f4df240fdf29ab63accbb15b6eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVgFg1upPBCWHn7vgpLkpAyGWYuton8KTyVwZOz_X2zZ1TRf3AXKQp7qGd1sRFzH1hwM4dpudHxXoevROZ6IjkurJSY6wPOg2g--", "site_full": "www.expedia.es", "site": "expedia.es", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.es/Collierville-Hoteles.d55089.Guia-Viajes-Hoteles", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "213 Hoteles en Collierville baratos con Expedia.es", "title": "Gardentree Hotels", "title_full": "Gardentree Hotels (Memphis, Estados Unidos) | Expedia.es", "published": "2017-10-20T23:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26131, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9065ce636edddc445a43649f2e1539d4fa9e1d77", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVgFg1upPBCWHn7vgpLkpAyGWYuton8KTyVwZOz_X2zZ1TRf3AXKQp7qGd1sRFzH1hwM4dpudHxXoevROZ6IjksZKk1._crezs21DJWWvQgCn0DA5aPoAopyFWbny.JpHg--", "ord_in_thread": 19, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-03T08:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Staff was great!
