It is by far the most complete skeleton of a human ancestor older than 1.5 million years ever found. It is also the oldest fossil hominid in southern Africa, dating back 3.67 million years. The unveiling will be the first time that the completely cleaned and reconstructed skeleton can be viewed by the national and international media. \nDiscovered by Professor Ron Clarke from the Evolutionary Studies Institute at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, the fossil was given the nickname of \u201cLittle Foot\u201d by Prof. Phillip Tobias, based on Clarke\u2019s initial discovery of four small footbones. Its discovery is expected to add a wealth of knowledge about the appearance, full skeletal anatomy, limb lengths and locomotor abilities of one of the species of our early ancestral relatives. \n\u201cThis is one of the most remarkable fossil discoveries made in the history of human origins research and it is a privilege to unveil a finding of this importance today,\u201d says Clarke. \nAfter lying undiscovered for more than 3.6 million years deep within the Sterkfontein caves about 40km north-west of Johannesburg, Clarke found several foot bones and lower leg bone fragments in 1994 and 1997 among other fossils that had been removed from rock blasted from the cave years earlier by lime miners. Clarke sent his assistants Stephen Motsumi and Nkwane Molefe into the deep underground cave to search for any possible broken bone surface that might fit with the bones he had discovered in boxes. Within two days of searching, they found such a contact, in July 1997. \nClarke realised soon after the discovery that they were on to something highly significant and started the specialised process of excavating the skeleton in the cave up through 2012, when the last visible elements were removed to the surface in blocks of breccia. \u201cMy assistants and I have worked on painstakingly cleaning the bones from breccia blocks and reconstructing the full skeleton until the present day,\u201d says Clarke. \nIn the 20 years since the discovery, they have been hard at work to excavate and prepare the fossil. Now Clarke and a team of international experts are conducting a full set of scientific studies on it. The results of these studies are expected to be published in a series of scientific papers in high impact, peer reviewed international journals in the near future. \nThis is the first time that a virtually complete skeleton of a pre-human ancestor from a South African cave has been excavated in the place where it was fossilised. \n\u201cMany of the bones of the skeleton are fragile, yet they were all deeply embedded in a concrete-like rock called breccia,\u201d Clarke explains. \n\u201cThe process required extremely careful excavation in the dark environment of the cave. Once the upward-facing surfaces of the skeleton\u2019s bones were exposed, the breccia in which their undersides were still embedded had to be carefully undercut and removed in blocks for further cleaning in the lab at Sterkfontein,\u201d says Clarke. \nThe 20-year long period of excavation, cleaning, reconstruction, casting, and analysis of the skeleton has required a steady source of funding, which was provide by the Palaeontological Scientific Trust (PAST) \u2014 a Johannesburg-based NGO that promotes research, education and outreach in the sciences related to our origins. Among its many initiatives aimed at uplifting the origin sciences across Africa, PAST has been a major funder of research at Sterkfontein for over two decades. \nProfessor Adam Habib, Vice-Chancellor and Principal of the University of the Witwatersrand says: \u201cThis is a landmark achievement for the global scientific community and South Africa\u2019s heritage. It is through important discoveries like Little Foot that we obtain a glimpse into our past which helps us to better understand our common humanity.\u201d \nPAST\u2019s chief scientist Professor Robert Blumenschine labels the discovery a source of pride for all Africans. \u201cNot only is Africa the storehouse of the ancient fossil heritage for people the world over, it was also the wellspring of everything that makes us human, including our technological prowess, our artistic ability, and our supreme intellect,\u201d he says. \nThe scientific value of the find and much more will be unveiled in a series of papers that Prof Clarke and a team of international experts have been preparing, with many expected in the next year. \nNote: The above post is reprinted from materials provided by University of the Witwatersrand .

Credit: The Associated Press This image released by Lucasfilm shows Daisy Ridley as Rey in \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi,\" in theaters on Dec. 15. prev next comments LOS ANGELES \u2014 Han Solo is dead. Luke Skywalker is back, but changed. And Leia Organa's story will soon be coming to an end.\nThe Star Wars that inspired four decades of passionate fandom appears to be slowly but surely fading as \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" prepares to descend on Dec. 15, giving way to a newer generation of intergalactic rebels and their foes, like Rey and Kylo Ren, and a fresh voice behind the endeavor in writer-director Rian Johnson (\"Looper\").\nJ.J. Abrams' \"The Force Awakens\" set the stage for this new era of the franchise, but \"The Last Jedi\" has to move it forward and keep audiences interested for the next one too.\nAfter all these years and billions of dollars, Star Wars isn't exactly a scrappy underdog anymore, but the franchise is in somewhat uncharted territory. The prequels did their own damage, but at least no one had to say goodbye to their original heroes.\nAnd then there's the seemingly impossible standard set by that other Star Wars sequel, \"The Empire Strikes Back.\"\nBesides the main cast, filmmakers and some Lucasfilm and Walt Disney Co. brass, no one will see \"The Last Jedi\" until the Los Angeles premiere on Dec. 9. And determining what exactly audiences should expect is a bit like trying to assemble a puzzle with no picture and most of the pieces missing. The cast has left some adjective breadcrumbs (\"intense,\" ''emotional,\" ''intimate,\" ''cinematic\") but for the most part, it's a mystery.\n\"For me, 'The Last Jedi' is not a particularly happy story to tell, but it's just my part,\" Mark Hamill says cryptically. Hamill, 66, returns to play Luke Skywalker after being seen in only a few frames of \"The Force Awakens,\" which ends on a wind-swept cliff as the young protege Rey (Daisy Ridley) approaches him looking for training from the missing Jedi. Luke and Rey are just one of the new pairings promised for the film, which finds every character out of their comfort zone and facing new challenges as the Resistance organizes to go up against the First Order.\n\"It's got so much going on,\" Hamill adds. \"You can cut from the more somber scenes I have to the action/adventure, the suspense, the humor ... I've only seen it once but I thought, 'This is too much information to process.'\"\nThe marketing campaign, no doubt playing into the tone set by \"Empire,\" has focused on the darkness and intensity of \"The Last Jedi,\" but Johnson says that's only one element. He stresses that it is, first and foremost, a Star Wars movie. To him, that means capturing that thing that makes you want to \"run out of the theater and into your backyard\" to play with your spaceship toys \u2014 even without the curmudgeonly wit of Harrison Ford's Han Solo.\n\"That's what everyone was concerned about going in: How do you do it without him?\" Johnson, 43, says. \"I saw so much potential for humor in it. I was looking at every single character and trying to find opportunities to break the tension. I think people are going to be surprised by how fun and light on its feet it is.\"\nIn addition to Luke and Rey, the film brings back Carrie Fisher as Leia in her last film role (Fisher died after filming had wrapped), Adam Driver's Kylo Ren, fresh off murdering his father Han Solo, the mysterious Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), Domnhall Gleeson's General Hux, the ace pilot Poe (Oscar Isaac), the ex-Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) and his old boss Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie), Chewbacca, the droids and a host of newcomers, like Laura Dern's purple-haired Vice Admiral Holdo, a maintenance tech, Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), a hacker (Benicio Del Toro) and some cute little creatures called Porgs.\nHis script, which he was able to write while \"The Force Awakens\" was being made, took some of the cast aback at first.\n\"I was going, 'Uh, I'm not sure about this,'\" Ridley says. \"It just took us all a second to be like, 'Ok this is where the story is heading.'\"\nJohnson jokes that he's like the new boyfriend at Thanksgiving dinner who everyone has to get used to.\n\"(Rian) had a different challenge which was to expand the Star Wars universe further with more inventive ideas, taking more risks,\" Boyega says. \"He was a real fan. I feel like he ticked off his Star Wars fanboy theories just one by one with this film.\"\nThat fandom has also helped Johnson, who Hamill refers to as his Obi-Wan, reach a sort of zen-like state with the film. It also doesn't hurt that Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, who has not been afraid to make tough decisions and fire or bench directors if something isn't working, was so pleased with their collaboration and the resulting film that she has already enlisted Johnson to develop a new Star Wars trilogy separate from the Skywalker saga (he'll write and direct the first).\nNow it's just a matter of putting \"The Last Jedi\" out in the world. Financially, there's not much to worry about \u2014 it's tracking to open somewhere in the $200 million range (far below \"The Force Awakens'\" $248 million debut, but stunning nonetheless). Also box office and the expectations and hopes of a loyal fanbase, who have been burned before, are two very different things.\n\"Having been a Star Wars fan myself for the past 40 years, I know intimately how passionate they are about it and how everyone has stuff they love and hate in every single movie. That takes the pressure off a little bit just thinking, 'Ok, there's going to be stuff that everyone likes, there's going to be stuff that people don't like and it's going to be a mixture,'\" Johnson says.\nAnd with a smile and a shrug, he adds: \"That's what being a Star Wars fan is.\"\n___\nAP Entertainment Writer Sandy Cohen contributed from Los Angeles.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "adam driver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harrison ford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luke skywalker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skywalker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leia organa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rian johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sandy cohen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fisher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john boyega", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holdo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oscar isaac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy serkis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "domnhall gleeson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boyega", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hux", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark hamill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "snoke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kylo ren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carrie fisher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gwendoline christie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daisy ridley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phasma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j.j. abrams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kathleen kennedy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ridley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laura dern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelly marie tran", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "walt disney co.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benicio del toro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucasfilm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chewbacca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:52.069+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "67cbfe126ce61f03c9b7b39de02403ebf75790d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8RjMYmHraOQLOqC8We0m5xbPDsE8Zjx6vJZ9m5Pn81VCGghVeRdRyiM152Nfc7XwKsjBsM2uAwlZmrh1JTgb1Y", "site_full": "www.acousticguitarforum.com", "site": "acousticguitarforum.com", "site_section": "http://www.acousticguitarforum.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=49", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Auctions and Deals - The Acoustic Guitar Forum", "title": "Brand New Fender Acoustic 200 2x8 200W Combo Amp", "title_full": "Brand New Fender Acoustic 200 2x8 200W Acoustic Guitar Combo Amp - The Acoustic Guitar Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T16:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.696, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45043, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "67cbfe126ce61f03c9b7b39de02403ebf75790d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8RjMYmHraOQLOqC8We0m5xbPDsE8Zjx6vJZ9m5Pn81VCGghVeRdRyiM152Nfc7XwKsjBsM2uAwlZmrh1JTgb1Y", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "AGFbot", "published": "2017-12-06T16:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "Brand New Fender Acoustic 200 2x8 200W Combo Amp", "text": "$549.99\nEnd Date: Jan-05 17:09\nBuy It Now for only: US $549.99\nBuy it ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ebay.com/itm/Brand-New-Fender-Acoustic-200-2x8-200W-Acoustic-Guitar-Combo-Amp/292360777485?hash=item44120f6f0d:g:UzQAAOSwke9aA1uA", "https://i.ebayimg.com/thumbs/images/g/UzQAAOSwke9aA1uA/s-l225.jpg", "http://cgi1.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?MfcISAPICommand=MakeTrack&item=292360777485&ssPageName=RSS:B:SHOP:US:104"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:54:52.075+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "410a774455ad760d3cabe37362c12913700d73e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pfguUTHYhAEGjzUCGLap87pIBAa_YQQic", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/sci/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/sci/ - Science &amp; Math - 4chan", "title": "Whats your IQ?", "title_full": "/sci/ - Whats your IQ?

Every couple of years a McFarlane Toys action figure will manage to catch my attention, and like an idiot I\u2019ll go ahead and buy it. I know better too. It always plays out the same way, as soon as I open the figure and start to handle it, the regret seeps in. I suppose that I just need to reinforce these life lessons every now and again. \nStranger Things first became available to watch through Netflix in July of 2016. Since then the internet hasn\u2019t taken a breath to stop talking about it. I enjoyed the first season quite a bit, but I could have done without the constant, almost obsessive, analysis. The second season became available this past October, and it appears to have cooled everyone\u2019s jets. There isn\u2019t nearly as much discussion surrounding this new season. Which is fine because maybe the writers won\u2019t feel as much pressure to replicate whatever worked in the first season. \nChief Hopper and Eleven are the first proper ( non-Funko ) Stranger Things action figures. McFarlane Toys looks to be committed to this line as we\u2019ve also seen prototypes of the Demogorgon, Dustin, and Lucas. I\u2019d like to think that they rushed these out to hit retail shelves in time for the first season\u2019s DVD release. But these feel like every McFarlane figure I\u2019ve ever bought, so there probably isn\u2019t any excuse as to why it is the way it is. \nThe presentation is nice. He\u2019s packed in a traditional-style blister card complete with some retro Stranger Things artwork. Chief Hopper includes a figure stand, coffee cup, and revolver. Part of my rationale for purchasing this toy is that \u201c at least I can use the coffee cup even if he\u2019s complete shit. \u201d \nAs far as Hopper\u2019s sculpt is concerned, I really don\u2019t have any issues there. McFarlane loves to leave those ugly pins exposed at the hips and shoulders, but otherwise it\u2019s a fairly clean sculpt. They did a pretty good job capturing the likeness of David Harbour. The only complaint I have there is that the face printing makes him seem a bit lifeless. On that subject, I would suggest not ordering these figures online. The Hopper I picked up has decent paint, but at the Target I found him there was another Hopper with really bad smears all over his face. Both of the Elevens had the same issue which kept me from grabbing her. Well that and I wasn\u2019t ready to invest another $20 into a McFarlane figure. \nIt looks as though McFarlane is going for a similar 7\u2033\u2013 8\u2033 scale that NECA uses for their figures. He\u2019s much taller than a Figuarts or Marvel Legends figure. But he seems to fit in pretty well with the NECA Aliens figures I have hanging around. At least they aren\u2019t trying to make these in that weird 5\u2033 scale that literally fits with nothing. \nFor a figure that boasts as many articulation points as it does, Hopper is a real chore to find a good pose. First off, I\u2019m not even sure what kind of ankles he has because they feel so tight that I\u2019m afraid that they will break moving them around too much. Both the knees and elbows have swing-swivel joints, which is good, but when bent they expose the giant ratchets inside, which is not so good. The head is on a ball joint that gets okay range, at best. All around, I just wish his articulation had more useful range, and that the joints didn\u2019t feel so fragile. \nIt\u2019s also worth noting that he was solicited with two heads, one hatted one we got and a head with no hat. I guess that second head never made the cut, or will end up as an exclusive somewhere? \nWould I recommend McFarlane Toys Stranger Things Chief Hopper? \nI will say this about the figure, while I was posing it for pictures I was kind of hoping it would break so that I had a reason to return it to Target. So no, I would not recommend this action figure or this line.

Normally, your red blood cells are flexible and round, moving easily through your blood vessels. In sickle cell anemia, the red blood cells become rigid and sticky and are shaped like sickles or crescent moons. These irregularly shaped cells can get stuck in small blood vessels, which can slow or block blood flow and oxygen to parts of the body. There's no cure for most people with sickle cell anemia. But treatments can relieve pain and help prevent problems associated with the disease. Symptoms Signs and symptoms of sickle cell anemia, which vary from person to person and change over time, include: Anemia. Sickle cells break apart easily and die, leaving you without enough red blood cells. Red blood cells usually live for about 120 days before they need to be replaced. But sickle cells usually die in 10 to 20 days, leaving a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Without enough red blood cells, your body can't get the oxygen it needs to feel energized, causing fatigue. Episodes of pain. Periodic episodes of pain, called crises, are a major symptom of sickle cell anemia. Pain develops when sickle-shaped red blood cells block blood flow through tiny blood vessels to your chest, abdomen and joints. Pain can also occur in your bones. The pain varies in intensity and can last for a few hours to a few weeks. Some people have only a few pain episodes. Others have a dozen or more crises a year. If a crisis is severe enough, you might need to be hospitalized. Some adolescents and adults with sickle cell anemia also have chronic pain, which can result from bone and joint damage, ulcers and other causes. Painful swelling of hands and feet. The swelling is caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells blocking blood flow to the hands and feet. Frequent infections. Sickle cells can damage an organ that fights infection (spleen), leaving you more vulnerable to infections. Doctors commonly give infants and children with sickle cell anemia vaccinations and antibiotics to prevent potentially life-threatening infections, such as pneumonia. Delayed growth. Red blood cells provide your body with the oxygen and nutrients you need for growth. A shortage of healthy red blood cells can slow growth in infants and children and delay puberty in teenagers. Vision problems. Tiny blood vessels that supply your eyes may become plugged with sickle cells. This can damage the retina \u2014 the portion of the eye that processes visual images, leading to vision problems. When to see a doctor Although sickle cell anemia is usually diagnosed in infancy, if you or your child develops any of the following problems, see your doctor right away or seek emergency medical care: Unexplained episodes of severe pain, such as pain in the abdomen, chest, bones or joints. Swelling in the hands or feet. Abdominal swelling, especially if the area is tender to the touch. Fever. People with sickle cell anemia have an increased risk of infection, and fever can be the first sign of an infection. Pale skin or nail beds. Yellow tint to the skin or whites of the eyes. Signs or symptoms of stroke. If you notice one-sided paralysis or weakness in the face, arms or legs; confusion; trouble walking or talking; sudden vision problems or unexplained numbness; or a headache, call 911 or your local emergency number right away. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic Causes Sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in the gene that tells your body to make the red, iron-rich compound that gives blood its red color (hemoglobin). Hemoglobin allows red blood cells to carry oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body. In sickle cell anemia, the abnormal hemoglobin causes red blood cells to become rigid, sticky and misshapen. The sickle cell gene is passed from generation to generation in a pattern of inheritance called autosomal recessive inheritance. This means that both the mother and the father must pass on the defective form of the gene for a child to be affected. If only one parent passes the sickle cell gene to the child, that child will have the sickle cell trait. With one normal hemoglobin gene and one defective form of the gene, people with the sickle cell trait make both normal hemoglobin and sickle cell hemoglobin. Their blood might contain some sickle cells, but they generally don't have symptoms. But they are carriers of the disease, which means they can pass the gene to their children. Risk factors For a baby to be born with sickle cell anemia, both parents must carry a sickle cell gene. In the United States, it most commonly affects black people. Complications Sickle cell anemia can lead to a host of complications, including: Stroke. A stroke can occur if sickle cells block blood flow to an area of your brain. Signs of stroke include seizures, weakness or numbness of your arms and legs, sudden speech difficulties, and loss of consciousness. If your baby or child has any of these signs and symptoms, seek medical treatment immediately. A stroke can be fatal. Acute chest syndrome. This life-threatening complication causes chest pain, fever and difficulty breathing. Acute chest syndrome can be caused by a lung infection or by sickle cells blocking blood vessels in your lungs. It might require emergency medical treatment with antibiotics and other treatments. Pulmonary hypertension. People with sickle cell anemia can develop high blood pressure in their lungs (pulmonary hypertension). This complication usually affects adults rather than children. Shortness of breath and fatigue are common symptoms of this condition, which can be fatal. Organ damage. Sickle cells that block blood flow through blood vessels immediately deprive the affected organ of blood and oxygen. In sickle cell anemia, blood is also chronically low on oxygen. Chronic deprivation of oxygen-rich blood can damage nerves and organs in your body, including your kidneys, liver and spleen. Organ damage can be fatal. Blindness. Sickle cells can block tiny blood vessels that supply your eyes. Over time, this can damage the portion of the eye that processes visual images (retina) and lead to blindness. Leg ulcers. Sickle cell anemia can cause open sores, called ulcers, on your legs. Gallstones. The breakdown of red blood cells produces a substance called bilirubin. A high level of bilirubin in your body can lead to gallstones. Priapism. Men with sickle cell anemia can have painful, long-lasting erections, a condition called priapism. As occurs in other parts of the body, sickle cells can block the blood vessels in the penis. This can damage the penis and lead to impotence. Prevention If you carry the sickle cell trait, seeing a genetic counselor before trying to conceive can help you understand your risk of having a child with sickle cell anemia. He or she can also explain possible treatments, preventive measures and reproductive options.

South junior kicker Emma Sampson, who began the season as the junior varsity kicker, booted a winning field goal as time expired. The kick capped off a drive that was led by quarterback Alex Cohen with 1:12 remaining. The Panthers played in six games that were decided by one score or less this season, finishing 3-3 in those contests. \nSouth also defeated Plymouth North, 22-21, on Thanksgiving in one of the best Turkey Day rivalries in the state. Cohen completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Connor Holbrook with 1:01 remaining in the fourth quarter. Down 21-20, the Panthers opted for the 2-point conversion, which Stanley Profete converted, to nab the Panthers a win in the 22nd edition of the rivalry. North\u2019s Robbie Gomes was a tough-luck loser in the game, rushing for 132 yards and all three of the Blue Eagles scores. South battled back from deficits of 14-0 and 21-7. \nHonorable mention: Silver Lake 20, Dighton-Rehoboth 18 (Oct. 27) \nThe first round of the MIAA playoffs is usually riddled with blowouts. That was not the case in this Division 4 South Sectional quarterfinal. With 52 seconds remaining, Silver Lake\u2019s Tanner Boyd scored the winning touchdown. The Lakers stuffed a D-R fourth-and-short with 3:05 remaining while trailing by four (18-14) when Matt Powell made a stop in the backfield. Jake Waters sealed the win with an interception.
