Nearly 1,800 firefighters and a fleet of aircraft are fighting the flames but the blaze is only 5% contained and an estimated 12,000 buildings are in danger. \nEarlier a wildfire in a wealthy western area of Los Angeles reached an estate and winery owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch. \n#SantaAnaWinds will continue to elevate fire danger in Southern CA with expectant winds reaching 80 mph on Thursday. Any new fires will have extreme levels of fire growth potential. Prepare now & be ready to GO!

Brent crude futures LCOc1, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at US$61.29 a barrel, up 7 cents. \nSINGAPORE: Oil prices were stable on Thursday as a fall in US crude inventories was countered by soaring output and a rise in fuel stocks. \nUS West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at US$55.95 a barrel at 0658 GMT, virtually unchanged from their last settlement. \nBrent crude futures LCOc1, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at US$61.29 a barrel, up 7 cents. \nUS crude oil inventories fell by 5.6 million barrels in the week to Dec. 1, to 448.1 million barrels C-STK-T-EIA, putting stocks below seasonal levels in 2015 and 2016. \nDespite this, prices were prevented from rising further. \n\u201cTraders were more concerned about the steep rise in gasoline inventories,\u201d said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. \nGasoline stocks rose 6.8 million barrels, to 220.9 million barrels, according to the report from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), much more than analyst expectations in a Reuters poll for a gain of 1.7 million barrels. \n\u201cThis suggests that refiners may not need to process as much crude in the future,\u201d ANZ said in a note on Thursday. \n\u201cThe EIA report also showed that US production increased again,\u201d the bank said. \nUS crude production C-OUT-T-EIA climbed by 25,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.71 million bpd, the highest since monthly figures showing the United States produced more than 10 million bpd in the early 1970s. \nSoaring US output threatens to undermine efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to bring production and demand into balance following years of oversupply. \nSukrit Vijayakar, managing director of energy consultancy Trifecta warned there were \u201cdarker shadows over the pace of rebalancing, if at all any is taking place.\u201d",

MENA \nGoogle and MediaTek collaborate to deliver improved performance in entry-level smartphones \nHSINCHU, Taiwan, Dec. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ \u2014 MediaTek Inc. today announced that it is a System-on-Chip (SoC) partner for providing Google\u2019s Android\u2122 Oreo (Go edition) software to smartphone makers, and after a deep collaboration with Google, MediaTek\u2019s MT6739, MT6737, and MT6580 SoCs, among others, now have board support packages available to run Android Oreo (Go edition). Google collaborated with MediaTek to ensure that Android Oreo (Go edition) works well on its line of processors, enabling a faster time-to-market mechanism for device manufacturers, and ensuring a quality Android smartphone experience that is both secure and affordable for devices with 512MB to 1GB of memory. This marks one of the first times that entry-level SoCs are ready to be used shortly after the latest version of Android, in this case Android 8.1 Oreo, has been released to the Android Open Source Project. \nWith Android Oreo (Go edition), Google has optimized its OS platform, first party apps and the Google Play\u2122 Store to improve the capabilities of entry level devices. Limited processing power and storage are top pain points for entry-level device users. Android Oreo (Go edition) was created to not only address these issues, but to also ensure that the devices are secure and that users have more control over data usage. \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) leverages the existing Google Play Store ecosystem to deliver apps that run smoothly on low memory devices. This improves the overall user experience with, and support for, devices that have 512MB to 1GB of memory, which results in significant bill of materials (BOM) cost savings. These savings enable device makers to provide the 400 million users who buy entry-level smartphones every year, a better option. \n\u201cEntry-level devices are the gateway to the internet for many people, and we want to make sure everyone has a great experience when they use these devices,\u201d said Sameer Samat, VP of Product Management, Android & Google Play. \u201cWe\u2019re excited that Android Oreo (Go edition) will significantly improve storage, performance, data management, and security.\u201d \n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement builds upon our existing work with Google, including our recent collaboration on Google\u2019s GMS Express to speed up the certification process,\u201d said TL Lee, General Manager of MediaTek\u2019s Wireless Communication business unit. \u201cWith Android Oreo (Go edition), we are partnering with Google to tackle the performance challenges of lower memory phones, improving the user experience of entry level smartphones for consumers in key markets across India, the Middle East & Africa, Latin America and South East Asia.\u201d \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) leverages MediaTek\u2019s acclaimed turnkey references and chipsets that are designed specifically to reduce product development time and compliance testing. A wide range of MediaTek SoC\u2019s supports Android Oreo (Go edition), including the MT6739 and MT6737 for 4G devices, as well as the MT6580 for 3G devices. This gives device makers the range of capabilities they need to develop devices for specific price points and markets. \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) smartphones powered by MediaTek will be available in world-wide market by Q1, 2018. \nFor more information about the program, please explore: https://www.android.com/ \n*Google, Android, and Google Play are trademarks of Google LLC. \nAbout MediaTek Inc.

Nowadays, multimodal management, including surgery, chemotherapy (CMT), and radiation therapy (RT), is advocated. However, AT/RT treatment with gamma knife surgery (GKS) was rarely reported. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of GKS for the treatment of AT/RT.\nPatients and methods Medical records of AT/RT patients who underwent surgery from 2007 to 2014 at the West China Hospital were retrospectively reviewed and statistically analyzed.\nResults Eighteen patients (12 males and 6 females) were presented with AT/RTs. Median age during presentation was 20.5 months (range, 4\u2013179 months). Twelve patients were <\u20093 years and six patients were >\u20093 years. Tumor location was supratentorial in seven patients, infratentorial in ten patients, and center area of the brain in one patient. Treatments performed were as follows: surgery alone in two patients, surgery+RT in two patients, surgery+CMT in five patients, surgery+CMT+RT in two patients, and surgery+CMT+RT+GKS in seven patients. The 2-year overall survival (OS) rate and event-free survival (EFS) rate for all 18 consecutive patients were 33.3 and 27.8%, respectively. Cox regression analyses showed that multimodal management combined with GKS was an independent positive prognostic factor for OS.\nConclusions Although AT/RTs are lethal cancer types, the OS of the disease was improved by using multimodal therapeutic strategies, including surgery, CMT, and RT, combined with GKS.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2kuZ7U3", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cmt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gks", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "west china hospital", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:21.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0ceec360769c52ba29d01eabe6120e0c8a137b0a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSGRyTST0EeZItB_SLlYmnIF2t5YPABC3Iow_Aae9QeQGSD45uRQ5jFnt7JxdHy06iYIv2b488ivK2ZEkBQRMPEqHrw0P0nBZb0VSLbini13vDL4l0vfqeUxCIZHS4hF8xm8nmbuQ_df.jnJryCP8lvQztFWkfDYqfVwPoMlXmN85UOZgrj9P0r", "site_full": "www.arabnewsnetwork.ps", "site": "arabnewsnetwork.ps", "site_section": "http://www.arabnewsnetwork.ps/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Palestine News Network", "title": "Gemalto eSIM technology enables Always Connected experience for new Microsoft Surface Pro with LTE Advanced", "title_full": "Gemalto eSIM technology enables Always Connected experience for new Microsoft Surface Pro with LTE Advanced", "published": "2017-12-07T08:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "PS", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0ceec360769c52ba29d01eabe6120e0c8a137b0a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSGRyTST0EeZItB_SLlYmnIF2t5YPABC3Iow_Aae9QeQGSD45uRQ5jFnt7JxdHy06iYIv2b488ivK2ZEkBQRMPEqHrw0P0nBZb0VSLbini13vDL4l0vfqeUxCIZHS4hF8xm8nmbuQ_df.jnJryCP8lvQztFWkfDYqfVwPoMlXmN85UOZgrj9P0r", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Asianet Pakistan", "published": "2017-12-07T08:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "Gemalto eSIM technology enables Always Connected experience for new Microsoft Surface Pro with LTE Advanced", "text": "December 7, 2017 MENA , Pakistan , Technology Advanced integration of eSIM into Windows 10 delivers an enhanced user experience \nAmsterdam, December 7, 2017 \u2013 Gemalto, the world leader in digital security, is supplying the eSIM (embedded SIM) solution for Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro with LTE Advanced, the most connected laptop in its class 1 which will begin shipping to business customers in December 2017.

Using high-resolution manometry (HRM), this study aims to identify positional adaptations of pharyngeal physiology by evaluating swallowing pressure patterns in a series of inverted body positions. Ten healthy adults each underwent swallowing tasks with pharyngeal HRM at six body positions using an inversion table (0\u00b0[upright], 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0[supine], 110\u00b0, 135\u00b0, and 180\u00b0[fully inverted]). Repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess impact of position on pressure parameters, and pharyngeal-UES pressure gradients translate. Velopharyngeal pressures varied by position ( P < 0.001), with significantly higher pressures generated with inversion \u226590\u00b0, compared with upright and 45\u00b0. Change in position did not significantly affect common mesopharyngeal pressures or swallowing pressure durations. UES valving mechanisms were preserved during inversion, with subtle variations observed in integral pressures ( P = 0.011). Pharyngeal-UES pressure gradients changed with position ( P < 0.01), increasing with inversion > 90\u00b0 compared to upright and 45\u00b0. Mechanisms of deglutition may differ with position and relative direction of gravity, particularly when at > 45\u00b0 inclination. Increased palatal pressure is generated in the upside-down position to achieve nasopharyngeal closure and prevent regurgitation. While other classically measured pressures may not consistently differ with positioning, many individuals exhibit adaptations in pressure gradients when inverted, likely due to a combination of changes in pharyngeal driving force and UES opening mechanisms. Identification of these changes, relative to position, further builds on our understanding of the adaptability of the pharyngeal swallowing system.\n\n\nfrom #ENT via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2nzWiCa\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "hrm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ues", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anova", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:22.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d449e203eb6a7475617a4999f5cea8ad4d14ab94", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLtZqyWX0qjG7ByuyoxLYXeesiw5jE.PaDuPpJuXKglNZixx6Uz23RxNAwTvhHdlsM.HE_GCQgmdIfoR51g8bcEmPSNR.trSwTs-", "site_full": "stackoverflow.com", "site": "stackoverflow.com", "site_section": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/asp.net?sort=newest&days=7", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Newest 'asp.net' Questions - Stack Overflow", "title": "c# - Asp.net web page not prompting for login credentials", "title_full": "c# - Asp.net web page not prompting for login credentials - Stack Overflow", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.118, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=73d79a89bded", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 51, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9f2603e9e47744401934b4f66e2e497295c201a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLtZqyWX0qjG7ByuyoxLYXeesiw5jE.PaDuPpJuXKglNZixx6Uz23RxNAwTvhHdlsM.HE_GCQgmdIfoR51g8bcEm3hdm.pfuJmhmXVsq4vtp2A--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "blue", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "This is a browser feature to prevent your login credentials potentially being stolen by keyloggers.

This is so exciting. Shawn, before the break, we had a little chat and I wanted to ask you something. Do you speak Spanish? \n\nSHAWN: No. \n\nKYNAN: So how can you explain to me how God gave you a Word in Spanish? You want to talk about that a little bit? \n\nSHAWN: I told you, my best friend is Spanish. He used to make fun of me whenever I\u2019d try, so I stopped trying. He\u2019s from Guatemala and he\u2019s like, he was brutal with me and so I never try and speak Spanish. And I was in Vacaville up in Northern California, and I was praying before the meeting. A lot of times before a meeting I\u2019ll pray like on the spot with people if I\u2019m in a coffee shop or whatever, God shows up and I take the risk. A lot of times before a meeting I want to pray because I want to bring a model of what the prophetic would be like in a meeting. So I was praying and had this phrase hit me, and I had to type it as fast as I saw it. I literally saw it written now, so I can say it. It wasn\u2019t like I heard. \n\nKYNAN: So you actually saw this. \n\nSHAWN: I saw it written out. And it was Spanish phrase. It was like two and a half lines, and I was like, I hope this is real, like I have no way to know if this is real. One of my good friends said why don\u2019t you use Google Translator to figure out. And I\u2019m like, I didn\u2019t think of Google Translator. I didn\u2019t even know this could be real. And so I went to the meeting, and all the prophetic words turned out so well that I said I\u2019m going to try this. I don\u2019t know if this is going to work, but I have two names and this Spanish phrase. And so I said, \u201cDoes anybody here speak Spanish?\u201d And this man came up, and he read the phrase. Now it had colloquialisms and it had like a certain way to say things. You\u2019d have to be from the region she\u2019s from to even understand it. So it\u2019s not like Spanish you couldn\u2019t just use Google Translator or something online. It actually had slang. And it basically, like this woman had given up her business career. She married this white man and she gave up her business career and had like a bunch of kids in a row. And she just, there was a part of her that was going through that mom thing, and going, is this significant? I know it is. I know these kids are amazing, but I\u2019ve given up everything. Part of the Word was I said I feel like you\u2019ve rubbed shoulders with John Maxwell, you\u2019re a business woman, but you gave it all up for raising world champion leaders, and you\u2019re kids are going to say, at the end of the day this phrase. And the phrase was, \u201cYou are like a totally charged, amazing mom.\u201d It was like this certain phrase that you\u2019d say. \n\nKYNAN: In Spanish. \n\nSHAWN: Only in Spanish that they\u2019re going to say you are the ones who made our lives possible, basically, and you are this kind of mom. And because you\u2019re this kind of mom, we\u2019re these kinds of kids. And she\u2019s like weeping, just couldn\u2019t believe that, she knew I didn\u2019t know that Spanish. She knew immediately, oh my gosh, this is so like only God could have given her this because it\u2019s what kids so would say. So it\u2019s not only a word from the Lord, it\u2019s a word from the Lord of what her kids would say one day. \n\nKYNAN: Wow, that\u2019s something. You know what that means? Get ready for God to speak to you in a foreign language. Just FYI. You say that God can speak to us in all kinds of ways. What are some of the ways that God speaks to us? Because I know a lot of times we think of \u201cThus says the Lord.\u201d It has to be in the audible Charlton Heston voice. It has to be that kind of thing. But you say he can speak to us in different ways. Give me an example. What are some of the ways God can speak to us? \n\nSHAWN: I think the number one way when we train people is just the impression, just the download of thoughts, or just, I wasn\u2019t thinking of this before and now it\u2019s in my head. \n\nKYNAN: Is that a feeling? \n\nSHAWN: It could be a feeling. It could be a sense. It could be like the same realm your daydreams are. You might get a picture. Whenever you think of something, you\u2019re like, that reminds me of this person. That could be the same kind of experience you\u2019re having with God. So a lot of cerebral ways that people hear from God are the most common ways, and the most discounted, because it\u2019s almost one step past your own thoughts. It\u2019s already in your own thought realm. And we don\u2019t expect that, but the Holy Spirit is relating God\u2019s thoughts to our thoughts constantly. \n\nKYNAN: Now how would you distinguish between, I know a lot of believers have this question: How do I know when God is talking to me? How do I know when it\u2019s my flesh? How do I know when it\u2019s the devil talking to me? \n\nSHAWN: We say it\u2019s either God or it\u2019s your hormones. So many young people go, I know I\u2019m going marry you. I heard it from the Lord. No, you heard it from your hormones. \u201cIt\u2019s the devil\u201d is usually not as much as a factor, but it could be your own desire and it could be your flesh like you\u2019re saying, I think you have to go on the journey of saying, God, I\u2019m looking for your heart to manifest and I\u2019m learning what your heart is. And you have to trust God\u2019s heart to lead you more than the enemy can mislead you or you can mislead yourself. And that\u2019s a hard part where you\u2019re like it\u2019s trial and error for a while until you get it. But once you get it there\u2019s a foundation of when you\u2019re adding the biblical virtues of the fruit of the Spirit and the character when that\u2019s all driving you. It\u2019s all love that you say character base is driving you, you won\u2019t go very far off. \n\nKYNAN: You know, according to you, Shawn, you say that a word of knowledge can restore destinies. Tell us how a man\u2019s destiny was restored. \n\nSHAWN: Are you talking about in the northeast when I told you that story? \n\nKYNAN: Yes. \n\nSHAWN: I love this story because I was praying about it again, racism in America has just been one of my buttons right now, just prayer. And I was up in the northeast and there\u2019s a very diverse crowd. And I called up this woman, an African-American woman, and I said, \u201cHey, is there somebody named this in your life?\u201d And she said, \u201cYes, that\u2019s my son.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhen he was a teenager, did he get violated by white cops?\u201d And she said, \u201cYes, he did.\u201d And he was brutalized and it was totally, it shouldn\u2019t have happened. And they got held responsible for it, but it created a moment in his life that was really hard. I said, \u201cDid it happen again?\u201d And she said yes, and it didn\u2019t get justified. There was no justice for. And she said, \u201cYes.\u201d I said, \u201cWell you go home and tell your son,\u201d who wasn\u2019t there at the time. \u201cYou go home and tell your son, who is now in his 30s, that these policemen were not a representation of God and this is not God\u2019s justice. This is a man of justice. Your son has leadership in his life to restore justice and you\u2019re going to tell him. Because he has purpose confusion now because of what happened in those two incidents that it actually tried to steal his destiny from him. So go home and tell him that God is going to restore him to this one word.\u201d She went home and told him that she never knew this, but his whole life from the time he was little he wanted to be a police officer. And when he was violated by these two different groups of cops he decided that all cops are bad and he\u2019s not working at the police force. When he heard the Word he had this purpose depression lift off his life and immediately enrolled in the police academy, and is now a police officer. \n\nKYNAN: Wow, that\u2019s awesome. Now Shawn, I want you to pray. I believe there are people watching right now that they need a Word, but more importantly, they need to be activated to be able to hear God. Would you pray for them right now. \n\nSHAWN: Yes. I pray right now that God will release in you that, not just the faith, but the connection, the intimacy and relationship with him that you deserve, he paid the price for it, that you could have fellowship with his thoughts and his mind, and I pray that he would unlock in you right now the faith to have that kind of connection. John 17:24. He wants this connection more than you do. Jesus prayed that you would be with him where he is, that you\u2019d see the Father in his Glory. And I pray over you right now a release of words of knowledge, words of prophecy, his original design over you, your family. I pray that you would see what was in his heart in the first place. Even as you\u2019re watching this, I pray that there would be a breakthrough, a moment of time where everything is different because God is speaking to you in a different way than you ever anticipated hearing. I pray he would blow you away, Ephesians 3:20, beyond what you can hope for or imagine, in Jesus\u2019 name. \n\nKYNAN: Wow. I believe. That\u2019s right. I believe that God has a plan for your life. I believe, according to Jeremiah 29:11, he knows that thoughts he thinks towards you. But more importantly, I believe that you are going to know the revealer of secrets and your life will never be the same.

That production has gone down as one of the great productions in the company\u2019s history. \nFour decades on Edgar and the RSC return to Dickens. On the strength of this marvellous production one can only wonder why it\u2019s taken them so long. \nThere are distinct echoes between the two productions. Both have a fluidity, as cast and props enter and exit, and both are driven along with the help of narrators; this time out Mr Dickens himself (Nicholas Bishop) and his editor and friend John Forster (Beruce Khan). \nBoth also have a political point to make. While Edgar drew parallels with the poverty in Nicholas Nickleby to what he viewed as the climate of political selfishness of the 1980s, here the social crisis of the 1830s and 40s \u2013 an era of industrial and economic growth accompanied by extreme poverty, which saw children as young as five working up to 14 hour days in factories, mines, mills \u2013 echoes our own age where the homeless sleep in shop doorways and increasing numbers of families are forced to turn to foodbanks. \nBut this is a Christmas story, and as Forster reminds Dickens at one point \u2013 \u201cyou can\u2019t end it with a corpse\u201d. \nThere is one striking difference between the two productions \u2013 the arsenal of hi-tech trickery now available in the RST. Director Rachel Kavanaugh makes full use of it. Stephen Brimson Lewis\u2019 evocative and imaginative set provides the backdrop to graveyards and magic carpet rides on the road to Scrooge\u2019s salvation. \nStepping into the miser\u2019s shoes is Phil Davis \u2013 and they prove a perfect fit. Davis is often the first phone call for producers in need of a surly Cockney baddie. Many will remember Davis\u2019 previous Dickens outing as a glorious Mr Smallweed in the BBC adaptation of Bleak House. In that his character was bad to the bone, but of course Ebenezer comes good. The more often than not sneering Davis proves equally comfortable with humour and the heartfelt. \nThe reformed Scrooge\u2019s wind-up of his disbelieving clerk Bob Cratchit (Gerard Carey) provides the high laughter point, closely followed by a joke at the expense of foreign secretary Boris Johnson \u2013 a character even Dickens would probably have found a little too far fetched. \nThis is a production of faultless performances, from Brigid Zengeni\u2019s ever-eating Ghost of Christmas Present to John Hodgkinson\u2019s ever-cheery Mr Fezziwig. \nThis timeless Christmas classic with a social conscience may have been told umpteen times, but it has been given a wonderful new lease of life by Edgar and the RSC. \nA Christmas Carol runs until February 4.

All opinions stated are genuine and my own. \n\n\n\nIn the tree, on the tree, or around the tree...Community Coffee's seasonal flavor, Dark Chocolate Peppermint, is sure to be a welcome addition for most anyone this time of year! \n\n\nI brought the Dark Chocolate Peppermint pods to work, and it's a great way to relax a bit, even when the day is absolutely hectic. This festive Christmas-y flavor has definitely been my oasis this week, not to mention my co-workers were excited to come across it in the break room as well. We work hard, especially this time of year, so it's definitely the little things that matter. What better than a nice, hot cup of dark chocolate peppermint coffee, to fuel you up and keep you going all throughout a busy day (or help you relax when it's time to wind down)? \nI'm loving this seasonal flavor. To me (a self-professed holiday nut), it's like Christmas in a cup!  \n\nCommunity Coffee has been a favorite of mine for as long as I can remember. Their coffee is always rich and flavorful, and I love to sample the flavors they come out with seasonally. This one has definitely become an instant favorite. Pick up the limited edition Dark Chocolate Peppermint coffee in traditional (ground) or pods for holiday stocking stuffers. Your recipients are going to appreciate your thoughtfulness, I already know it. :)\n\nAvailable for a limited time only in both 12-ounce bags and single serve boxes, Community\u00ae Dark Chocolate Peppermint coffee offers a decadent blend of rich dark chocolate and smooth, refreshing peppermint\u2014perfect for holiday entertaining or as an everyday sweet treat.  \n\"As seasonal coffee flavors become more popular, we wanted to create a blend that coffee lovers could enjoy morning, noon or night,\u201d said Jodi Conachen, general manager of communications at Community Coffee Company. \u201cOur Dark Chocolate Peppermint blend gives our customers a way to indulge in a sweet treat and share the festive flavors of winter with their family and friends.\u201d  \nLike all Community\u00ae coffee products, this new minty medium roast is made with 100% select Arabica coffee beans! \n For additional information, visit CommunityCoffee.com or find the brand on Facebook and Twitter .
