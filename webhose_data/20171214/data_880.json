This will help them get the property into production faster\nFrom the meeting it was also disclosed that WLF will begin a 10,000m drill program in a few days, once their Quebec based drilling contractor is given a business permit to work in Maine.\nWLF expects to have at least two holes drilled by the Christmas break, and then intends to get right back at it immediately following the break. Holes will be drilled from 50m-650m deep and will target new discoveries, historic discoveries and resource expansion of the historic discoveries!!\nNo where to go but up from here!! Company plans to drill the property year round into 2019!!!\nMD&A said significantly more capital will be required to complete planned exploration. I have a feeling that capital will be acquired and at a significantly higher share price than we closed at today!

Jamie Oliver (Matt Crossick/PA) \nBut Ramsay, 51, read the remark differently, telling Radio Times magazine his younger rival had been judging the size of his family. \nRamsay\u2019s wife Tana suffered a miscarriage with the couple\u2019s fifth child last year. \nAsked about the spat, Oliver told the Radio Times: \u201cI don\u2019t want to put petrol on the fire, but it\u2019s kind of interesting, isn\u2019t it? \n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a fish tank, there should be plenty of room for Nemo and Dory,\u201d he said before clarifying that Ramsay would be Nemo. Celebrity Chef Gordon Ramsay (Adam Davy/PA) \nHe added: \u201cWhat I said was fairly grown-up and reasonable.\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t think he liked me taking the high ground. I think that\u2019s basically it. So, I\u2019m going to take the high ground now and say I wish him all the best, and all success. \n\u201cGood luck to him.

Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake. (Photo: Charlie Leight, The Arizona Republic)\nCONNECT TWEET 25 LINKEDIN 4 COMMENT EMAIL MORE As miscalculations go, John McCain\u2019s lighthearted but misguided bid to reach a milestone in Twitter followers was appropriately, in the social media universe, an inconsequential fail.\nThe Arizona senator sought 74 more followers to hit 3 million; instead, thousands took to an #UnfollowMcCain campaign within hours.\nMore: Sen. Jeff Flake, leaving when the going gets tough is not the same as bravery\nMore: I know Jeff Flake. Trump has shaken him to his core.\nMore long-lasting and serious is the outcry over his vote \u2014 and that of fellow Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \u2014 in favor of the GOP tax reform bill that won passage without a single Democratic vote.\nIn so doing, McCain and Flake squandered a perfectly good opportunity to cement their legacy as deficit hawks, fiscal conservatives and sensible Republican senators.\nThe #UnfollowMcCain campaign matters because it reflected the frustration and anger of Democrats and independents who counted on the \"maverick\" McCain to reject the tax reform bill that nonpartisan experts say will benefit the wealthiest Americans while hurting the poor and the middle class.\nThey were holding out for the same maverick who just earlier this year cast the decisive vote that killed legislation to repeal Obamacare.\nFlake caved for THAT? Flake, meanwhile, has been a prominent Trump critic who essentially, and famously, chose to end his political career rather than compromise his \u201cprinciples\u201d to do what was necessary to win over Trump supporters.\nIn the tax vote, however, Flake and McCain clearly chose the interest of the Republican Party rather than what's best for the country. If the senators were going to support the tax bill despite its fiscal irresponsibility, I wish they\u2019d have fought harder to win more consequential concessions.\nFlake\u2019s explanation is most baffling because he prides himself as a deficit hawk, yet was nonetheless willing to vote for the plan that could increase the federal deficit by more than $1.4 trillion over a decade.\nMore: NAFTA: Trump threatens love fest between Mexico and states with billions at stake\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\nAnd what did Arizonans get in return? Well, a lot if you\u2019re among the \"1%\" super-rich.\nBut wait, Flake explained that he also got a commitment from the Trump administration to have a seat at the table to negotiate protections for so-called \"dreamers\" who were brought to this country illegally by their parents.\nSeriously, congressman. You took the Trump administration\u2019s word?\nWhy #UnfollowMcCain matters This is the president that ended the Obama-era program that protected the roughly 800,000 dreamers and gave Congress until March to pass legislation.\nTrump has used dreamers as political pawns, consistently spewed lies on all sorts of issues and hasn't hesitated to throw under the bus anyone who criticizes him.\nAnd are we supposed to be grateful that our senator, whom Trump has repeatedly mocked and forced him out of his re-election bid, may be welcomed to the negotiating table?\nForgive me if I\u2019m not impressed.\nI understand that for wealthy Americans, Flake and McCain don\u2019t need to justify their tax vote. For them, after all, it\u2019s a perfect holiday gift.\nBut for idealistic people like me and many of those who unfollowed McCain in anger and protest, we believe elected officials should represent the interests of all Americans \u2014 not just those affiliated with their political party.\nTax reform is overdue. But tax cuts and redistribution of wealth should be equitable. That turns out to be too much to ask of our Arizona senators and their Republican brethren in Congress.\nElvia D\u00edaz is an editorial columnist for The Republic and azcentral, where this column first appeared .

However, your work is far from done. You still need to harvest, dry and prepare your buds for consumption. While the process isn\u2019t necessarily difficult, it requires patience and self-discipline. Timing is crucial to get the best out of your plants. So, in this article, we\u2019ll follow an unorthodox approach and we\u2019ll take things from the end: What happens after your plants are full of buds ripe for the taking? Finding the Right Time to Harvest \nThe key to a great product is to harvest cannabis at just the right time . Cannabinoids in your plants\u2019 trichomes are formed exactly during that period, so it is essential that you wait for the buds to ripen. Harvesting too early will lead to an overall worse experience, as the key cannabinoids would not have had enough time to form. Harvesting too late , on the other hand, can lead to the degradation of the main cannabinoids THC and CBD , making the end product more narcotic. \nCBD and THC Formation THC and CBD are the most prevalent chemical compounds in marijuana plants, although at least 113 different cannabinoids and terpenes have been isolated from the plant, exhibiting various effects. THC is the primary psychoactive of cannabis and can be found in trace amounts in the whole plant. However, its highest concentration is in the resin of the buds , where it starts developing about two weeks into flowering. Increase THC content will lead to a more cerebral experience for the smoker. \nIf you wait, even more, the THC will gradually start breaking down into CBD , which is not psychoactive but produces a pleasant, muscle-relaxing effect to the user. Harvesting cannabis in the appropriate window will give you different results depending on what your tastes are. Maintaining these effects on your end product will come through proper harvesting and curing practices. Read on to find out more about it. How to Harvest Marijuana \nFlush Before You Start \nThe last step before harvesting your plants is to clear all remaining salt or nutrient residues that have gradually built up inside them. Flushing your crop a few days before harvest is a great way to enhance taste and potency. The main culprit for this buildup of excess chemicals is a condition called \u201c nutrient lockout \u201c. This happens when your plants receive excess nutrients and leads to unwanted effects on bud quality. \nFlushing your plants is not only useful before harvesting. Experienced growers use this technique frequently throughout the growing process as it is one of the easiest things you can do to improve the quality of your product . There is some debate as to what flushing actually accomplishes, however, the consensus is that it improves bud taste by removing unnecessary chemicals. \nThe final flushing should take place at least a week before harvest and it is similar whether you do it in soil or in hydroponic grows. In soil, you just need to run a lot of fresh water (pH of about 6) through your hydroponic system . The exact amount depends on the size of your container. A good rule of thumb is to use as much water as the volume of your container . \nIn hydro, run clear water (pH of about 5.8) through the system for a few days. Do not be alarmed if you notice leaves yellowing and wilting . At this stage, the plant is focusing on producing buds, so it is natural to get rid of unnecessary parts. \nGet Down to Business: Chopping Down the Buds Now comes the fun part: actually collecting ripe bud from your plant! Although you can certainly improvise, there are quite a few tips to make your life easier. You should, first of all, remove larger leaves to make room for the bud-producing glands at the top. Then you will be ready to cut the kolas. Treat each branch with extreme care as you hang it to dry. If you are rough, the trichomes might fall and this is obviously the last thing you want right now. After Harvest: Curing Marijuana Buds the Right Way \nAfter you have cut your plants apart, it is time to do some final trimming . Use a pair of disinfected scissors to carefully remove all the extraneous leaves surrounding the buds. We would advise you not to throw away all the trimmings, as they are rich in trichomes and you can use them to make amazing edibles. \nKeep the buds in disinfected mason glass jars you will use for the curing process. For the first 14 days, open the lid and let the air circulate for about 15 minutes, two times a day . This removes moisture and reduces the chance of rot. Don\u2019t forget to label your jars according to strain, potency or date! \nGreat curing is where pros really shine. Follow this advice and you will realize that a little bit of patience can add a whole lot of punch to your marijuana experience.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "curing marijuana properly curing marijuana buds the right way  you", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "flushing", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:36.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7d12253615772fd6ffcb8a2aa83dfc06743cdb0e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOS_5hBLgIvVPeiMdH4vqdaZyZHdXa1ik7G0VkBm.lGw9uYR65lJH_QxWRC6.CGSQNStUv_e0vVQojN6umoDjyxj3SvdVSEu_w9MOB2WCus38GrC3ylcMElWOdDkLMW3u_O7VlWGM9mpw--", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com", "site": "tripadvisor.com", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g150805-i7-Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Yucatan Peninsula Forum, Travel Discussion for Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico - TripAdvisor", "title": "Advice and your knowledge needed - Playa del Carmen", "title_full": "Advice and your knowledge needed - Playa del Carmen Forum - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-07T09:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 189, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7d12253615772fd6ffcb8a2aa83dfc06743cdb0e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOS_5hBLgIvVPeiMdH4vqdaZyZHdXa1ik7G0VkBm.lGw9uYR65lJH_QxWRC6.CGSQNStUv_e0vVQojN6umoDjyxj3SvdVSEu_w9MOB2WCus38GrC3ylcMElWOdDkLMW3u_O7VlWGM9mpw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mamaof2tiny1s", "published": "2017-12-07T09:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "Advice and your knowledge needed - Playa del Carmen", "text": "Hi Guys, I'm completely new to this Forum and I'm in need of your knowledge.

Nayyar, Hemant Kumar and many others. \u201cTadbeer Se Bigadi Hui Taqdeer Bana Le\u201d from the film \u201cBaazi\u201d was a turning point in her career! I think everyone might remember her song, \u201cAye Dil Mujhe Bata De\u201d. In childhood we had a Marathi poem (Rajaas Ja Mahaali) taught to us on the tune of this song ;). \u201cWaqt Ne Kiya\u201d from \u201cKaagaz Ke Phool\u201d is one of her most outstanding renditions. \nAs a tribute to her on her birth anniversary today, we have tried to cover some of her famous songs by ourselves singing in this video:- \nSome of the songs which are not included here and which we would like to mention are \u201cNa Yeh Chaand Hoga\u201d, \u201cJaata Kahan Hai Deewane\u201d, \u201cNanhi Pari Sone Chali\u201d and amazing duets like \u201cJaanu Jaanu Re\u201d along with Asha Bhosle, \u201cHum Aapki Aankhon Mein Is Dil Ko Basa De To\u201d, \u201cJaane Kahan Mera Jigar Gaya Ji\u201d and \u201cAye Dil Hai Mushkil Jina Yahan\u201d along with Mohammed Rafi. \nShe sang a variety of songs from romantic to sad songs, lullabies to club songs, classical based compositions to comic songs, ghazals to sensuous songs, bhajans to teaser songs.

She was indeed a gifted artist! \nIt\u2019s tragic that she died at a very young age of 41! 7th October \nBegum Akhtar \nFondly remembering Late Begum Akhtar on her 103 rd birthday. \nShe was given the title of Mallika-e-Ghazal (Queen of Ghazals).

This is evident from the number of songs and Bhajans, which he propagated during his fight for freedom. \nBelow is one such famous Bhajan: \nRaghupati Raghav Raja Ram \u2013 also known as Ram Dhun is an excerpt from Sri Nama Ramayanam by Lakshmanacharya.

Heartfelt Birthday Wishes to the great singer!!!! \nAn iconic singer who has regaled music lovers for over three decades with his \u201cOh So Romantic\u201d voice has been instrumental in making the 90\u2019s era so melodious. \nBeing a teenager from the same era I have always been a big fanatic of Kumar Sanu and his songs. Even today I know the minutest details in each of his songs, the interim pauses, the voice modulations, the word-by-word lyrics and the emotions behind each of the number. I can relate to each of his songs with such special episodes, memories of doing those naughty little crazy things as a teenager. Someone who made my fantasy world all the more dreamier and creamier ;)Kumar Sanu is nothing short of nostalgia for me. \nSome of his all time hits are from films like Aashiqui, Saajan, Phir teri Kahani Yaad Aayi, Dil Hai Ke Maanta Nahi ,DDLJ, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and the list is endless. \nNo wonder he holds the Guinness Book world record for recording the most songs in a day, 28, in the year 1993.

They came to know each other mainly through Lata Mangeshkar and could relate because of their poor financial conditions and also because of their similar ages. When Lata Mangeshkar knew about their financial condition and also identified their talent, she recommended them to established people at that time like S.D. Burman, Naushadji and C. Ramchandra. The duo always stayed united till the death of Laxmikantji in the year 1998, post which Pyarelalji has worked independently on some projects. \nEveryone is aware of the variety of songs they have composed, so I would not list them, otherwise I would run into pages:)!

They are the only composers who brought Lata Mangaeshkar, Mohammad Rafi, Kishore Kumar and Mukesh together for the song \u201cHumko Tumse Ho Gaya Hai Pyar Kya Kare\u201d from the film Amar Akbar Anthony, which I believe would have been quite a task since that time all the artists would have to come together at the recordings, unlike now. \nWe would like to share this amazing song \u201cMan Kyon Behaka\u201d from the film Utsav, sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle!!! \nIt is Pandit Kishan Maharaj\u2019s Birth Anniversary today. \nHe belonged to a family of professional musicians. He got his initial training from his father and then his uncle from Benaras Gharana of Hindustani classical music. \nHe started performing and sharing stage with stalwarts at a very early age. He was a versatile accompanist and could play with any accompaniment. He gave many solo concerts too. \nHe was awarded the Padma Shri in 1973 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2002. \nPlease do watch this video. I especially liked the way he demonstrated the replication of bol (words) on his tabla! A Tabla Maestro indeed!!!

Core plus funds are typically associated with fixed income funds, adding alternative investments such as high-yield, global and emerging market debt to a core portfolio of investment-grade bonds. Core plus equity funds may also exist with a similar strategy using alternative investing to enhance the return from a core market segment. BREAKING DOWN 'Core Plus' \nCore plus investment strategies are primarily associated with fixed income funds. They give a fixed income fund manager some flexibility to add additional return from investments beyond the core objective of a fund. Securities used for enhancing return are typically also fixed income investments with greater risk and return potential than the fund\u2019s core holdings. \nInvestment advisors in a core plus fund will build its core holdings specifically around securities that meet a specified objective. This portion of the portfolio is designed to be maintained as a long-term holding with the intention of holding securities virtually forever. Such holdings might represent as much as 75% of the portfolio. The remaining balance would then consist of higher risk holdings, which may have shorter investment horizons than the core components of the portfolio. As such, a portfolio's core investments would represent a solid foundation to which more aggressive, diversified investments could be added. Core Plus Investments \nBelow are some examples of core plus fixed income and equity investments. \nJPMorgan Core Plus Bond Fund (ONIAX) \nThe JPMorgan Core Plus Bond Fund (ONIAX) is one core plus fixed income example. The Fund invests primarily in investment grade bonds. It has the flexibility to tactically invest 35% of the portfolio\u2019s assets in securities outside the central objective that have enhanced return potential. The Fund typically invests enhancement assets in high yield fixed income and foreign debt. As of September 30, 2017 total assets in the Fund were $9.69 billion. The class A share of the Fund requires a minimum investment of $1,000. The Fund has a gross annual expense ratio of 0.93%. \nAmerican Century Core Plus Fund (ACCNX) \nThe American Century Core Plus Fund is another example of a core plus fixed income investment. The Fund invests primarily in high quality bonds with two to four year durations. The Fund also invests in alternative fixed income investments outside of the core holdings for added return. The Fund\u2019s investor share has a $2,500 initial investment requirement.

The director general of MI5, Andrew Parker, spoke in October of \u201ca dramatic upshift in the threat this year\u201d to \u201cthe highest tempo I\u2019ve seen in my 34-year career\u201d.\nThe figures show 12 people were arrested for the Westminster Bridge attack , 23 for Manchester Arena, 21 for London Bridge , one for Finsbury Park mosque and seven in connection with Parsons Green.\nUK terrorism arrests 2017 The figures also show the sharpest increase on record (77%) in the number of white people arrested, rising from 81 to 143 over the period, and the highest number (58) of women arrested for terrorism-related offences. Nearly 70% of those arrested considered themselves to be British or a British dual national.\n\nThe quarterly Home Office bulletin on police use of counter-terrorism powers shows that so far, 115 of the 400 people arrested have been charged, 213 were released without charge and 60 released on bail pending further investigation. The remainder faced alternative action.\nIn the 12 months to September, the terrorism-related trials of 78 people were completed, an increase of 16% on the previous year, with 69 convicted and nine acquitted.\nThe number of terrorist prisoners in British jails has also risen in the past year to 213, of whom 88% (187) have Islamist extremist views. A further 8% (16) are categorised as holding \u201crightwing ideologies\u201d.\nThe statistics show the Metropolitan police are making increasing use of counter-terrorism stop and search powers, with the number of stops up by 27% to 726.\nThe bulletin reveals that section 47a counter-terrorism stop and search powers were authorised for use after the Parsons Green attack in September for the first time since the threshold for their deployment was raised in 2011. The powers allow police to stop and search people without the need for reasonable suspicion that they are involved in terrorism.\nBoris Johnson blames 'crack cocaine of jihadi terrorism' on repressive states Read more \nHowever, the use of controversial schedule 7 powers to stop and examine people entering and leaving the UK fell by 22% to 16,919 examinations, continuing a long-term downward trend.\nThe reduced use of schedule 7 powers compares with the 61,711 people examined under it in 2011. Over the past six years, there has been an average year-on-year fall of 23% in the use of these powers.\nThe security minister, Ben Wallace, said: \u201cThe police and security services have been clear that we are facing a shift rather than a short-term spike in the terrorist threat. \n\u201cThe statistics we are publishing today demonstrate the breadth of work that they undertake, alongside the rest of the criminal justice system, day in and day out to keep us safe.\n\u201cBut this is not the totality of our work. The whole of society must come together to challenge the terrorist threat. The public must remain alert but not alarmed, and report any suspicions they have about unusual activity or behaviour to the appropriate authorities. \n\u201cFurthermore, the government is reviewing its counter-terrorism strategy in light of recent attacks to ensure we meet the threat from terrorism now and in the future.\u201d\nTopics UK security and counter-terrorism Counter-terrorism policy Police Crime news", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sean dempsey/epa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan travis home", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "home office", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london bridge", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:36.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e32e2d45a619c0b249ea8148fe3b6afe66281670", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTzBH6c9Z4cI15_sA3Hthoy8d6R1VfhXOC0B3M0VZWXhw--", "site_full": "www.walmart.com", "site": "walmart.com", "site_section": "https://www.walmart.com/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Walmart \u2013 Christmas Trees, Christmas Decorations &amp; Christmas Gifts!", "title": "Pampers Swaddlers Diapers, Size 6, 72 Diapers", "title_full": "Pampers Swaddlers Diapers, Size 6, 72 Diapers - Walmart.com", "published": "2017-11-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 49, "participants_count": 48, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.067, "main_image": "https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/1f7a2789-3177-423f-b873-c50a942d3262_1.a23c846c345f75aa0bf0a35f51d29189.jpeg?odnHeight=450&amp;odnWidth=450&amp;odnBg=FFFFFF", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 148, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6130ac514b87bd37870eb2cc452d77dec9a5fdbe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTzBH6c9Z4cI15_sA3Hthoy8d6R1VfhXOAMxQJWfamVb.ILWBOizdYs", "ord_in_thread": 45, "author": "Missy", "published": "2017-11-29T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Best Diapers", "text": "Hands down the best diapers out there!

Photo: Reuters ALSO READ Roche win boosts case for adding chemo to cancer immunotherapy Cancer drug: Supreme Court allows Cipla to withdraw appeal against Roche Novartis' skin cancer drug posts win in trials, Roche flops Roche's new breast cancer drug that could cut treatment time denied patent Intas launches chemotherapy drug at affordable price Adding Roche\u2019s immunotherapy Tecentriq to older drugs doubled the percentage of lung cancer patients who survived a year without their disease advancing, an outcome some experts labeled unprecedented. Thirty-seven percent of patients in a closely watched clinical trial who got Tecentriq, Avastin and chemotherapy reached the one-year mark without their cancer progressing (PFS), according to data released on Thursday. For patients getting only Avastin and chemotherapy, that fell to 18 percent. Roche\u2019s November announcement that its Impower 150 trial had broadly succeeded in first-line lung cancer patients helped spur a one-day, $12 billion rally in the Basel-based drugmaker\u2019s market capitalization. Thursday\u2019s release of specific numbers at a European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Geneva could further fan investor optimism the Swiss drugmaker is gaining on rivals Merck & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Roche Chief Executive Severin Schwan sees an opportunity to leap-frog ahead as competitors still await their own lung cancer combination trial results. \u201cThis is very, very promising,\u201d Dr. Solange Peters, the head of Medical Oncology at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois in Lausanne, Switzerland, said on the latest results. \u201cDoubling PFS (progression-free survival) at one year is something we have not seen with any targeted therapy in unselected patients to date.\u201d Roche said it would submit the results to regulatory authorities around the world. It is counting on Tecentriq to help replace revenue from its $20 billion-per-year trio of Avastin, Herceptin and Rituxan whose patents have expired or will shortly, exposing them to cheaper competition. Lung cancer is easily the biggest oncology market, with about 220,000 people in the United States due to be diagnosed this year and 155,000 seen dying from the disease often caused by smoking. In Roche\u2019s 1,202-patient study, Tecentriq cut the risk of disease progression by 38 percent, within the range analysts have said would signify a robust result. Patients getting Roche\u2019s immunotherapy survived an average of 8.3 months without their disease getting worse, compared with a PFS of 6.8 months for those getting chemotherapy and Avastin. OVERALL SURVIVAL For a set of patients who expressed a specific biomarker called \u201cTeff\u201d that Roche is exploring to help identify people who may respond best, the results were more robust, with PFS at 11.3 months for the Tecentriq group versus 6.8 months.

A drone that hovers over Japanese employees and blares music to force them to go home was unveiled on Thursday (Dec 7), as the country tries to reduce its notoriously long work hours.\nThe \"T-Frend\" buzzes over those trying to work late, blasting out the strains of Auld Lang Syne, a Scottish tune typically used in Japan to announce that a store is closing.\n\"You can't really work when you think 'it's coming over any time now' and hear Auld Lang Syne along with the buzz,\" said Norihiro Kato, a director at Taisei, an office security and cleaning firm that co-developed the system.\nThe drone is equipped with a camera, which stores footage on an SD card. Office scenes can also be monitored almost in real time from a remote location.\nThe machine recognises its location on a building floor without GPS. It takes off from its port, makes a surveillance flight on a pre-set path and then returns autonomously.\nTaisei plans to start the T-Frend service in April in collaboration with drone system developer Blue Innovation and telecoms operator NTT East.\nThe fee for the service is yet to be officially set but \"the target price\" is around 500,000 yen (S$6,000) a month, said Kato.\nJapan Drone 2017\u30fc\u300eT-FREND\u300f\u306e\u300c\u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b9\u30d5\u30ed\u30a2\u3067\u6b8b\u696d\u306a\u3069\u306e\u5168\u81ea\u52d5\u98db\u884c\u76e3\u8996\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u300d T-Frend's developers are also studying the possibility of giving the drone facial recognition technology to tell who is in the office after hours or whether there is an intruder.\nAdministrative officials at many companies push overtimers out of the door but this has ironically resulted in these officials working overtime themselves, to say nothing of \"causing friction between employees\", the companies said in a statement.\nFirms have therefore turned to security companies for this task, but they have struggled to provide enough staff given a nationwide labour shortage in Japan.\nT-Frend therefore serves the twin function of reducing overtime and making up for this labour shortage, the firms claimed.\nJapan's government has been trying to change a culture in which working long hours is perceived as proof of loyalty and dedication.\nEvery year in Japan, long working hours are blamed for dozens of deaths due to strokes, heart attacks and suicides.\nIn February, the country launched the \"Premium Friday\" programme, urging employees to knock off early on the last Friday of the month with the aim of both reducing work hours and invigorating spending.\nBut the plan fell flat with many claiming the last Friday of the month is one of their busiest days.\nTopics: JAPAN WORKER WELFARE //str.sg/oZXT Copy", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

The answer is not so cut and dry. Specific types of strains can turn hermaphroditic depending on their genetics. A lot of different factors can determine whether a plant will turn hermaphroditic. What exactly is hermaphroditism and is this likely to happen to your plants? What is Hermaphroditism? \nHermaphroditism is when your plants display both male and female parts. Most plants are in fact hermaphroditic. Cannabis plants are one of the few species of plants that are grown to have separate genders. Male plants display clearly visible seed pods with no buds. Female plants display buds, but no seed pods.When growing cannabis for consumption, you want female plants. Which Plants are more Likely to Turn Hermaphroditic? \nThai sativas are highly likely to turn hermaphrodite. As such, they are more difficult to grow than other strains because of the amount of time and care that they require. You have to watch them very closely and control their environment. If you are a novice grower, it would be best for you to avoid growing this strain. True Hermaphroditism \nWhen a strain is hermaphroditic strictly via genetics, then it is known as a \u201ctrue hermaphrodite.\u201d True hermaphrodites come from a hermaphroditic clone mother. When you find a true hermaphrodite among your plants it is best to move it out of the vicinity of the other plants, lest they become hermaphroditic as well. Bisexual Plants \nPlants that become hermaphrodites due to environmental factors such as stress, are known as bisexual plants. This happens on the female plant, when it begins to detect factors that can induce stress, it then begins to produce stamen along the pistils. By doing this, the plant shortens its flowering time, ensuring that it is more likely to pass its genes to its offspring. When this happens, you should move the plant away from the others in your crop. In most cases, it should be harvested immediately. A hermaphroditic cannabis plant. Image Source: 420 Magazine What Environmental Factors Cause Hermaphroditism? \nSeveral environmental factors can cause your plants to turn hermaphroditic. Most are caused by negligence and can be easily avoided. One such factor is poor temperature control. If the temperature is too hot, your plants are much more likely to turn hermaphroditic. Pruning too early is another common cause. Other causes include, incorrect fertilization, changes in the photoperiod during the flowering phase, and of course mite infestation. All of these can be prevented as long as you\u2019re vigilant with your plants. For instance, you should always do your pruning and topping when your plants are still in the vegetative stage, prior to flowering. Are There Uses for Hermaphroditic Plants? \nYou can still get smokeable buds from hermaphrodite plants, they will just be full of seeds. It\u2019s not ideal, but if you\u2019re in a tight spot you can still use them. If your hermaphrodite plants are female, then you can use the seeds for your next batch. Feminized seeds have a high likelihood of turning female. \nFeatured Image Source: growery.org \nGot anything to add?

We present the first study addressing molecular effects of fractional non-sequential ultrapulsed CO 2 laser treatment using a 3D skin model that allows standardized investigations of time-dependent molecular changes ex vivo. While histological examination was performed to assess morphological changes, we utilized gene expression profiling using microarray and qRT-PCR analyses to identify molecular effects of laser treatment. Irradiated models exhibited dose-dependent morphological changes resulting in an almost complete recovery of the epidermis 5 days after irradiation. On day 5 after laser injury with a laser fluence of 100 mJ/cm 2 , gene array analysis identified an upregulation of genes associated with tissue remodeling and wound healing (e.g., COL12A1 and FGF7), genes that are involved in the immune response (e.g., CXCL12 and CCL8) as well as members of the heat shock protein family (e.g., HSPB3). On the other hand, we detected a downregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g., MMP3), differentiation markers (e.g., LOR and S100A7), and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1\u03b1.\nOverall, our findings substantiate the understanding of time-dependent molecular changes after CO 2 laser treatment. The utilized 3D skin model system proved to be a reliable, accurate, and reproducible tool to explore the effects of various laser settings both on skin morphology and gene expression during wound healing.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2AzlrSw", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "co", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:38.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "80a5d3294a6da2011c36c8b3e848f409fb7f7b27", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhq6SKsx4lXFwV2cpxf1UI5jorip1NvAhd0X6J.1p25mkczAdfHFTd2bLfQN8qwSWvRA--", "site_full": "www.thestudentroom.co.uk", "site": "thestudentroom.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/forumdisplay.php?f=38", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Maths - The Student Room", "title": "Trig: Losing Solutions", "title_full": "Trig: Losing Solutions - The Student Room", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//static.thestudentroom.co.uk/5a252fde38287/forum/images/base/logo-facebook.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7797, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "51f8f902bb821bb70fd548503447a49a382ef68f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhq6SKsx4lXFwV2cpxf1UI5jorip1NvAhd0X6J.1p25mkczAdfHFTd2bIIlPX16Pltcpb73yNPf_iD", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "RDKGames", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Re: Trig: Losing Solutions\n Quote: : ...

(Photo: AFP/Patrik Stollarz) 07 Dec 2017 06:06PM Share via E-Mail Bookmark \nHAMBURG: Chanel's veteran designer Karl Lagerfeld returned to his Hamburg roots with a playful fashion show in the German port city, inspired by his hometown's seafaring traditions and its audacious new concert house. \nIn Wednesday (Dec 6) evening's defile at the imposing Elbphilharmonie concert hall, models shared the stage with a live orchestra as they strutted around in bejewelled sailor caps with anchor motives and chunky fishermen sweaters. \nLovingly dubbed the \"Elphie\", the building itself has a maritime feel, jutting out from the end of a pier with sweeping views of the Elbe River and a glass roof that evokes frozen waves. \nThe octogenarian Lagerfeld said he wanted to stage a Chanel show there from the moment he first laid eyes on the building, which was plagued by cost over-runs and delays before its opening in January. \n\"I got the idea the first time I saw the Elbphilharmonie.

And I am a Hamburger after all.\" Advertisement Advertisement \nActresses Tilda Swinton, Kristen Stewart and Lily-Rose Depp, daughter of Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis, were among the front-row guests at Lagerfeld's Hamburg debut. \nChanel selects a different city each year for its annual Metiers d'Art fashion show, which shines a spotlight on the legendary craftmanship of the French house's milliners, knitters, plumassiers and bootmakers. \nThe venue is usually inspired by the life of founder Coco Chanel but the focus this year was firmly on Lagerfeld, who has been at the helm of the celebrated fashion house for over 30 years. \nLagerfeld, whose exact age is shrouded in mystery, was born in Hamburg but moved to Paris as a teenager. \nKnown as \"King Karl\" in Germany, his visit was closely followed by local media. \nThe best-selling Bild newspaper on Wednesday provoked much mirth with a picture of Lagerfeld arriving by private jet with a pile of luxury suitcases - and a plastic bag of kitty litter for his beloved white Birman cat Choupette.

Until you hear that distinct Australian twang, that is. \u201cWhen I\u2019m out on the road here in the city, people automatically think I\u2019m Indian. They talk to me in Tamil/Malayalam and they\u2019re quite taken aback when I respond in English,\u201d says the actor, with a guffaw. \nThe very unassuming Trevor or Trev \u2014 as he is called \u2014 is actually Australian theatre royalty, a prominent indigenous playwright and actor, who has performed on stages the world over in front of kings and queens, presidents and prime ministers. He is also a well-known screen actor, contemporary dancer, didgeridoo artiste and is a torch-bearer of Aboriginal music, dance, theatre and storytelling traditions. \nIn fact, Trev, along with fellow members of the Ochre Dance Company of Subaico, Western Australia, is on a three-week cultural exchange at the Daksha Sheth Dance Company in Vellayani on the outskirts of the city \u201cto observe the parallels between indigenous Indian and Aboriginal cultures, correlate them and turn that into a contemporary fusion dance performance that highlights what\u2019s common between the two.\u201d Ochre\u2019s trip to Kerala is in reciprocation of the visit of actor-dance Isha Sharvani and percussionist-musician Tao Issaro of the Daksha Sheth Dance Company out to the Nullabor Plain to immerse themselves in Aboriginal culture, last year. \n\u201cGeographically, we might breathe a different rhythm because of the weather but the more we discover about Kerala, the more we realise that we are not all that different. For instance, the sand art tradition here [Kalamezhuthu]. We have something similar back home. In the old days, much before indigenous art was painted on canvas, Aboriginal people would draw sacred designs on the soil. The Aborigines are also very spiritual and worship nature in its myriad forms and have nature gods \u2014 though not as many as there are here! Much like in Indian culture, we use dance to tell our stories. Our dance, similar to Kalaripayattu, is very grounding and very body intensive; they also involve a lot of stamping and stomping, squatting, jumping and ...,\u201d he says, breaking off as a curious mix of contemporary beats, traditional Indian and Aboriginal music, the didgeridoo and voices shouting out strange words boom out of the dance studio abutting the Vellayani lake. \n\u201cWe are trying to pepper the language of our tribe, the Nyungar, within the fusion dance performance. The Nyungar have words for jumping, sitting down, putting your leg up and so on and with each movement the performers will shout out the corresponding word,\u201d explains the 42-year-old artiste. \nTrev and Co. were supposed to have performed at the inaugural ceremony of IFFK 2017. With the show being cancelled in light of Cyclone Ockhi, now, he\u2019ll be talking about his films in the \u2018In Conversation\u2019 section of the film festival. \u201cI\u2019m first and foremost a theatre actor and dancer, ever since I debuted on stage at age 17, playing the lead in the aboriginal musical, Bran Nue Dae (1993). My auntie, Lynette Markle, herself a theatre-person, convinced me to become an actor; otherwise I would have been an Australian Rules Football player! That said, acting on screen, is something I do only when I have the time. I don\u2019t like being idle. When I\u2019m at home on the Nullabor, I\u2019m a labourer; I like to keep my hands busy,\u201d he explains, while happily striking poses \u2014 the eagle pose, the spirit pose, the bush turkey in flight and so on, inspired by Aboriginal legends, at our photographer\u2019s request. \n\u201cI\u2019m very photogenic; why do you think I took up acting on screen?\u201d he says, with a laugh, proceeding to recount corresponding fantastic \u201ccreation stories\u201d of how the Australian landscape and fauna and flora came to be; of jealous snakes who stole poison glands from iguanas and the bush turkey that bought fire to the land and the dingo that stole it for the people up north, of the making of mountains and lakes and underground rivers... \u201cThe Aborigines have stories for everything; hidden in them is age old traditional wisdom that allows one to survive in the hostile terrain of the Australian bush,\u201d he explains. We\u2019re enchanted. \nExchanging notes \nCatch Trevor in conversation with IFFK\u2019s artistic director Bina Paul on December 10, at 2 pm at Nila Theatre . He will be talking about his many films and TV series such as Rabbit Proof Fence , Lockie Leonard , Boys in the Trees and the upcoming film Storm Boys , many of which highlight the life and struggles of Aborigines. \nFusion of styles \nThe fusion stage production, titled \u2018Kwogkan\u2019 (meaning sand in Nyungar Aboriginal dialect) is being funded by Australia Council for the Arts. \u201cOne of the first commonalities that we came across here in Kerala was sand art and hence we named it sand. The plan is to engage with First Nations in the Indian ocean region and find a form for a performance that came out of the exchanges. The first step in the project was Isha and Tao\u2019s visit out to Trev\u2019s place in Tjuntjuntjara in Western Australia,\u201d explains Ochre\u2019s artistic director Mark Howett.
