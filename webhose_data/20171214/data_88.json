We\u2019re not sure what the cause still is. We are working tirelessly to find a solution to the problem and get our systems operating fully and at full speed,\u201d Trimboli says. \nDMV Operations Manager Bonny Fogdall compared the problem to a garden hose where the water slows to a trickle when someone steps on it. Fogdall says the slowdown started Monday after an update to the system. \n\u201cWe fully tested all of this all weekend long before we rolled out a change. We are very disappointed when we put the change into production it wasn\u2019t the same as when we initially rolled it out,\u201d she says. \nFogdahl says while all but a small part of the system is now functioning, drivers license customers who have to travel a long distance to DMV offices are advised to wait a few days to make sure things are fully functioning. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fogdall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fogdahl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trimboli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vince trimboli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bonny fogdall", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dmv operations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dmv", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "idaho county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:21.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "799aa29fc173e4a13a9ec2b9540654dbf5fdd12e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTcaEpr0Q7xVsXplHboW_5hplF_kWbQx.XE.1r66FX2aSvORVjT3Z8iVhTd1Gai.Euy5xH7vSQ7_TZsLKUKIzG8VSgCovPFVZIdoMFS7Rn.DTBviHrvYiRKlsTqrlDMnLdd", "site_full": "www.heraldscotland.com", "site": "heraldscotland.com", "site_section": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/", "site_categories": ["media", "climbing", "sports"], "section_title": "Herald Scotland", "title": "Named Person policy faces fresh delays after MSP Education Committee vote", "title_full": "Named Person policy faces fresh delays after MSP Education Committee vote | HeraldScotland", "published": "2017-12-06T21:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 70, "participants_count": 21, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7150607/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31684, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2ab9ebe5e4ebb1d9d1e079e8d91764b74d2030d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTcaEpr0Q7xVsXplHboW_5hplF_kWbQx.XE.1r66FX2aSvORVjT3Z8iVhTd1Gai.Euy5xH7vSQ7_TZsLKUKIzG8VSgCovPFVZIdoMFS7Rn.DTBviHrvYiRKlo2Lgs.UyhS2t402ELxA1PE-", "ord_in_thread": 65, "author": "Peter Piper", "published": "2017-12-07T03:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "There are at least some people posting really need to read this to see what IS in the legislation, not what they think is in it:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttp:\\/\\/www.legislation.gov.uk\\/asp\\/2014\\/8\\/part\\/4\\r\\n\\r\\ne.g.: \\\"A health board is to make arrangements for the provision of a named person service in relation to each pre-school child residing in its area.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nand \\\"A local authority is to make arrangements for the provision of a named person service in relation to each child residing in its area, other than\\r\\n(a) a pre-school child, or\\r\\n(b) a child falling within subsection (2) or (4).\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nin other words ALL children in Scotland, not just those at risk.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:21.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a10f494b9b0b6cb96ceb6a8a54d6c46cb2c851a8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisaGDq2UlHqrZpCpXL61UWvvcjFgSjAr1C4_sAKXVPSEs8mTpZfU_b2OV1mwXcnjmtQ--", "site_full": "www.forexfactory.com", "site": "forexfactory.com", "site_section": "https://www.forexfactory.com/forumdisplay.php?f=69", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Platform Tech @ Forex Factory", "title": "Make Money from weekly 1 trade (need EA) - Page 4", "title_full": "Make Money from weekly 1 trade (need EA) - Page 4 @ Forex Factory", "published": "2017-12-07T09:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn-assets.forexfactory.net/images/misc/ff_fb_logo.gif?v=0.1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2596, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "68ab583feeddc7996db50ae921a72ca8dedaf81a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisaGDq2UlHqrZpCpXL61UWvvcjFgSjAr1C4_sAKXVPSEs8mTpZfU_b2Mnv5qKDqb_FdoVtZKOBkcQ2ppoGirR3QE-", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "Noor16", "published": "2017-12-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quoting francisw Disliked the profit factor is awesome, how about increase the spread to 10?

It was a case of dotting the i\u2019s and crossing the t\u2019s,\u201d said Ayres. \n\u201cI think it is a championship winning side and I think we can win the National League. \n\u201cObviously I can bring a bit of experience and hopefully if I can lead from the front the other boys will follow. \n\u201cDrew Kemp just improved every time he put a leg across his bike while Jordan Jenkins has proven he can run with the big boys. \n\u201cI\u2019m ready to go to war in this league as I want honours and I want to be in a title winning side.\u201d \nWhile Ayres hopes to entertain the supporters with the showman antics he has become famed for, he will be faced with racing for the first time without his biggest fan \u2014 mum Anne \u2014 by his side. \n\u201cI\u2019ve had a tough time recently as I lost my mum Anne about six weeks ago. She was a fan of Mildenhall and it was her who got me started,\u201d added Ayres. \n\u201cIt holds a special place within my family as I\u2019ve other family members that are fans and I am from around the area so to join the club as a rider is a great buzz. \n\u201cI am devastated and it still hurts but she would not want me to sit here getting all upset she would want me to prove a point. \nAlthough the new campaign may still be more than three months away, Ayres has already been ensuring that when the time comes to get the wheels turning again, he will be in prime condition to fulfil his ambitions. \n\u201cThis winter will be the first that I am going in feeling fully fit,\u201d said Ayres. \n\u201cI went on a fitness course at the weekend with Richie Worrall, Dan Bewley and James Sarjeant learning things like what to eat and what not to eat to try and better myself. \n\u201cI am dropping weight and I am trying everything to be the ultimate speedway rider. \n\u201cI am really putting in the hard graft. \n\u201cI am really excited about next season and am looking forward to it.\u201d \nn Anyone interested in sponsoring Ayres next season can get in touch by visiting Danny Ayres Racing#15 on Facebook.

India Nippon Electricals Limited   11.31M   22,809 shares   476.4 and high of 1430. The Success of India\u2019s Equity Market \nThe potentials of the Asian economy cannot be undermined especially when they are driven by the success and prospects of thriving economies such as that of India. \nThe equity market is one of any nation\u2019s gems. In India, the corporate sector represents roughly 14% of its gross domestic product (GDP). As a developing economy, this is already a compelling figure. In leading economies such as the US, the corporate sector represents 70% of national GDP. Indian Equity Market \nThe Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) are the two main stock exchanges in the country. They represent about 4% of India\u2019s GDP, with more than half of all publicly traded companies in the country listed on the BSE and the NSE. BSE \nThe BSE, founded in 1875, is the oldest stock exchange not just in India but in Asia as well. It is the first entity to get a permanent recognition in India under the Securities Contract Regulation Act of 1956. Presently, it is the 11th biggest stock exchange globally with a total market capitalization of $1.70 trillion as of January 2015. With a speed of six microseconds, the BSE is also one of the fastest stock exchanges globally. \nThe SENSEX 30 is the index monitoring the top 30 stocks on the BSE based on various factors such as liquidity and market capitalization. \nThe BSE first attained a four-digit figure in July 1990. When the Bhartiya Janta Party won the General Elections in October 1999, it first attained the 5,000 mark. The BSE first attained the 10,000 mark in February 2006 and the 20,000 mark in December 2007. When the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 broke out, the BSE had posted its biggest losses, declining more than 2,000 points in just two consecutive trading days in January 2008. India Nippon Electricals Limited is a stock traded on the Indian stock exchange. \nNonetheless, the BSE was able to recover from the turmoil. In March 2015, it first attained the 30,000 mark. Shortly after, it had once again posted one of its biggest one-day drop, losing 1,741 points in August 2015. The decline is primarily attributed to the devaluation of yuan. China is the biggest economy in Asia, which is why its economic downturn had a huge dent in the entire equity market of the region. NSE \nWhile the BSE is the first stock exchange in Asia, the NSE, founded in 1992, on the other hand, is the stock exchange that introduced electronic trading system in India. Because of its establishment, India had begun embracing and shifting to fully automated stock exchanges that are more efficient, reliable, and convenient. India Nippon Electricals Limited has relatively good liquidity. \nThe NIFTY is the index monitoring the top 50 companies across more than 20 sectors on the NSE based on different factors, particularly market capitalization. \nIndia is one of Asia\u2019s leading economies. With its growth prospects and potentials, the growth opportunities seem limitless as well. Consequently, investing in the Indian stock market is highly advised nowadays, given the thriving success of both the BSE and NSE. Professional analysts might be interested how this will affect India Nippon Electricals Limited. \nAnother recent and important India Nippon Electricals Limited (NSE:INDNIPPON) news was published by Economictimes.Indiatimes.com which published an article titled: \u201c15 midcaps that have surged up to 500% in 2017; can they still deliver?\u201d on September 21, 2017. \nIndia Nippon Electricals Limited designs, makes, and sells electronic ignition systems in India and internationally.

Roosevelt and his advisers knew that an imminent Japanese attack was probable, but nothing had been done to increase security at the important naval base at Pearl Harbor. It was Sunday morning, and many military personnel had been given passes to attend religious services off base. At 7:02 a.m., two radar operators spotted large groups of aircraft in flight toward the island from the north, but, with a flight of B-17s expected from the United States at the time, they were told to sound no alarm. Thus, the Japanese air assault came as a devastating surprise to the naval base. \nMuch of the Pacific fleet was rendered useless: Five of eight battleships, three destroyers, and seven other ships were sunk or severely damaged, and more than 200 aircraft were destroyed. A total of 2,400 Americans were killed and 1,200 were wounded, many while valiantly attempting to repulse the attack. Japan\u2019s losses were some 30 planes, five midget submarines, and fewer than 100 men. Fortunately for the United States, all three Pacific fleet carriers were out at sea on training maneuvers. These giant aircraft carriers would have their revenge against Japan six months later at the Battle of Midway , reversing the tide against the previously invincible Japanese navy in a spectacular victory. \nThe day after Pearl Harbor was bombed, President Roosevelt appeared before a joint session of Congress and declared, \u201cYesterday, December 7, 1941\u2013a date which will live in infamy\u2013the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.\u201d After a brief and forceful speech, he asked Congress to approve a resolution recognizing the state of war between the United States and Japan. The Senate voted for war against Japan by 82 to 0, and the House of Representatives approved the resolution by a vote of 388 to 1. The sole dissenter was Representative Jeannette Rankin of Montana , a devout pacifist who had also cast a dissenting vote against the U.S. entrance into World War I . Three days later, Germany and Italy declared war against the United States, and the U.S. government responded in kind. \nThe American contribution to the successful Allied war effort spanned four long years and cost more than 400,000 American lives.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "united sta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "franklin d. roosevelt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeannette rankin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roosevelt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pearl harbor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states of america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:22.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b0a0eb0f204c4dab79520399e963329da47c76ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTlisYgrgLN5syIKhGp7AScddFOfXg4docaDN9bl97JKz8tRjk1MimvhzcuDcfNoLooh7kQcWGsy4utJtRutR5g7.hGro.bY.pBCF58l9WeL5g4.EZkZj6Bj2ystevwpteUW2oLfsGPmPbm.e2wAhMSHsJJfpp_56g-", "site_full": "www.thisisanfield.com", "site": "thisisanfield.com", "site_section": "https://www.thisisanfield.com", "site_categories": ["world_soccer", "sports"], "section_title": "This Is Anfield: Liverpool FC Fans Website", "title": "Video: Naby Keita scores stunning solo goal as RB Leipzig suffer Champions League exit", "title_full": "Video: Naby Keita scores stunning solo goal as RB Leipzig suffer Champions League exit", "published": "2017-12-07T11:13:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 28483, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b0a0eb0f204c4dab79520399e963329da47c76ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTlisYgrgLN5syIKhGp7AScddFOfXg4docaDN9bl97JKz8tRjk1MimvhzcuDcfNoLooh7kQcWGsy4utJtRutR5g7.hGro.bY.pBCF58l9WeL5g4.EZkZj6Bj2ystevwpteUW2oLfsGPmPbm.e2wAhMSHsJJfpp_56g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Karl Matchett", "published": "2017-12-07T11:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "Video: Naby Keita scores stunning solo goal as RB Leipzig suffer Champions League exit", "text": "Videos 7 December 2017 \nThough RB Leipzig suffered a 2-1 defeat at home to Besiktas on Wednesday night, Naby Keita added to his tally of goals with a stunning effort. \nKeita notched his fifth of the season from central midfield with another driving run forward through the Besiktas defence, momentarily levelling the scores. \nBut a late Anderson Talisca strike ended any hopes of a dramatic winner for the German side, leaving Leipzig in third and facing a Europa League campaign in the new year, while the Turkish outfit topped the group to progress with Porto. \nKeita\u2019s goal, his second of the season in the UEFA Champions League , was a moment of inspiration and opportunism. \nSeizing possession deep in midfield, Keita drove past several challenges into space, slipped past the last defender and buried his finish\u2014finally finding a way past stand-in goalkeeper Tolga Zengin.

Antenne TV is distributed via Norkring\u2019s network, which makes it possible to be available to everyone in Flanders and Brussels. \nThe offer consists of the most frequently viewed channels in Flanders by Medialaan (vtm, Q2, Vitaya, Caz, vtmKzoom, Kadet), SBS Belgium (4, VIJF, ZES), the Dutch public channels NPO 1, NPO 2 and NPO 3 and the French-language channels RTL-TVI, Club RTL and Plug RTL. \n\u201cThere has long been a growing demand for a simpler TV subscription with only the most popular channels at a competitive price,\u201dsaid Yannick Altruy, Country Manager for Belgium at M7 Group. \n\u201cIn addition, the TV offer on the air was limited to VRT\u2019s free-to-air channels. We are therefore very pleased that with Antenne TV we are launching a competitive TV offer with all the major Flemish commercial channels, the Dutch NPO channels and the Walloon RTL channels. \nAccording to Hans Troelstra, CEO of M7 Group, opting for digital TV over the air is a logical evolution in a growing mobile TV viewing market, an ideal addition to satellite TV: \u201cWith Antenne TV we want to capitalise on the current rise of mobile TV viewing. You do not need internet, cable or dish. That makes Antenne TV a compact product that you can use at home, or as a second connection in the bedroom, but that you can also take along at the same time on the campsite, on the boat, on the cot, etc.\u201d. \nAntenne TV offers a DVB-T2 antenna for \u20ac29 that works both indoors and outdoors. For a TV set with DVB-T2 tuner only a card reader (CI+ module for Antenne TV) is needed, which is available for \u20ac39. Viewers can also buy a combination package (CI+ module with decoder for DVB-T2) for a special introductory price of \u20ac99.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kadet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hans troelstra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medialaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yannick altruy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tv vlaanderen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "m7 group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sbs belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vijf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dutch npo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antenne tv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vrt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walloon rtl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "npo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caz", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vitaya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norkring", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:23.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e692e6d9e38412da6ab21cfc1fa50144aedd867a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poyymHTYYdne3u8iVSWm3uhL8dtddTODKJfSTgVyJnRnJxLYyVo0FAt4MIppuHtySu3As5xKuhu4.8sROXbRMKgYnpOfMlielsbwRR95NACkZQ--", "site_full": "it.pr-gateway.de", "site": "pr-gateway.de", "site_section": "http://it.pr-gateway.de/feed/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "IT News, NewMedia und Nachrichten zu  Software Entwicklung", "title": "Webinar der in-GmbH: \u201cProduction goes 4.0 \u2013 Big Data & Co. im Griff\u201d", "title_full": "Webinar der in-GmbH: \u201cProduction goes 4.0 \u2013 Big Data & Co. im Griff\u201d", "published": "2017-12-07T10:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e692e6d9e38412da6ab21cfc1fa50144aedd867a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poyymHTYYdne3u8iVSWm3uhL8dtddTODKJfSTgVyJnRnJxLYyVo0FAt4MIppuHtySu3As5xKuhu4.8sROXbRMKgYnpOfMlielsbwRR95NACkZQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "pr-gateway", "published": "2017-12-07T10:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "Webinar der in-GmbH: \u201cProduction goes 4.0 \u2013 Big Data & Co. im Griff\u201d", "text": "Webinar der in-GmbH: \u201cProduction goes 4.0 \u2013 Big Data & Co. im Griff\u201d \nModulare IoT-Plattform erm\u00f6glicht Prozessoptimierung durch Anbindung, Verkn\u00fcpfung und rollenspezifische Verarbeitung von Live-Daten in der Fabrik \nKonstanz, 7.

Edgeware AB   30.04M   39,215   28.7 and high of 57.25. Getting To Know The OMXS30 \nSweden is a uniquely powerful economy in Europe just like Germany, France, and other thriving European economies. Its rich equity market is a proof of its excellent corporate governance that every investor is looking for when it comes to foreign investments. They are looking for Edgeware AB to check its reliability. The Swedish Equity Market \nThe Stockholm Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq Stockholm, is the main stock exchange in Sweden situated in Frihamnen, Stockholm. Edgeware AB is one of the NASDAQ most active participants. It is operated by Nasdaq Nordiq, a 13-year-old subsidiary of Nasdaq, Inc. \nNasdaq Nordiq was established in 2003 for the primary purpose of overseeing the stock exchanges in Nordic countries. Aside from the Nasdaq Stockholm, it also operates the Tallinn Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq Baltic; the Riga Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq Baltic; the Iceland Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq Iceland; the Helsinki Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq Helsinki; the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq Copenhagen; and the Armenia Stock Exchange, commonly known as Nasdaq OMX Armenia. \nThe Nasdaq Stockholm has been present since 1863, making it one of the oldest European stock exchanges. It has only adopted electronic trading on June 1, 1990. Prior to this, floor trading had happened at the Stockholm Stock Exchange Building. \nThe regular session on the Nasdaq Stockholm commences from 9:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. every business day. That is the time for Edgeware AB to count its gain. \nThe OMX Stockholm 30 Index (OMXS30) is the market-capitalization-weighted index that monitors the 30 most active stocks on the Nasdaq Stockholm. Numerous sectors make up the OMXS30; and the top three largest sectors are Industrials, Financials, and Consumer Services. Being the benchmark index in Sweden, it is a crucial indicator of the Swedish economy. \nThe OMXS30 is rebalanced twice a year, ensuring a strong indication of how well the Swedish equity market is. As such, some components may be dropped to give way to other companies that are more competitive. Several factors such as liquidity, market capitalization, and industry representation play major role in a stock\u2019s inclusion to the OMXS30. By the Numbers \nAs of the end of the first quarter of 2016, the Nasdaq Stockholm has a market capitalization of nearly $1.30 trillion with over 300 stocks listed on it. \nMeanwhile, the OMXS30 holds an all-time low of 98.86 points, which was last seen in November 1987. Sweden is one of the many countries that had suffered from Black Monday, a remarkable global equity market meltdown in history that began with the sinking of stocks on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (HK). \nGradually, the Swedish economy was able to overcome all other challenges through the years. In April 2015, the OMXS30 had reached an all-time high of 1,719.93 points. \nThe Nasdaq Stockholm is one of the most valuable and most competitive stock exchanges in Europe. Because of an attractive borrowing environment in European Union (EU) countries such as Sweden, many investors are flocking the Swedish equity market. There is no better way to take advantage of these growth opportunities than to invest in European stocks such as those listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm. And look for Edgeware AB advantages. \nAnother recent and important Edgeware AB (STO:publ) news was published by Multichannel.com which published an article titled: \u201cKarl Thed\u00c3\u00a9en appointed new Managing Director and CEO of Edgeware\u201d on November 14, 2017. \nEdgeware AB develops, markets, and sells streaming solutions for distributing TV and video content to viewers over IP networks. The company has market cap of $952.36 million. The firm offers virtualized TV servers and plug-and-play TV servers for broadcasters, telecom operators, content owners, and cable providers to distribute TV and video content to their viewers. It has a 102.26 P/E ratio. It also provides support services, including emergency support and assistance, trouble resolution, technical query, software updates and bug fixes, and hardware repair and replacement, as well as on-site problem management, planning and installation, and training.

I know she was trying to be \"helpful\" but ultimately she turned a perfectly fine situation into a mess. Honestly, I was surprised at how biased she was. And she was blaming my rule-following son who couldn't ignore shenanigans of teammates for the general hyper-ness and crazy of seven year old boys. - She was used to working with girls.\nBecause a little over a year ago, the head instructor of my son's martial art's program changed his mind about letting him participate in the sparring program and used the diagnosis as an excuse, despite providing feedback that he thought ODS was doing really well with no signs of motor delays when I sought feedback prior to the eval. -- We're at a much better karate school now.\nOr because now that they know my daughter (no ASD dx at this time, but communication delays and ADHD) has \"behavioral issues\" (which almost never appear during class) she's held back from progressing towards team gymnastics. And frankly, she misunderstands instructions far more than having a behavior problem. She gets confused then upset. Sharing that info was supposed to help her pursue her talent so that they could demonstrate or explain with fewer words, not keep her moving at a slower pace so it's not \"too frustrating.\"\nThose are three examples for when sharing a diagnosis has backfired. I'm going to set aside the annoying conversations along the lines of \"He can't have autism.\" and \"That's not what autism looks like.\" Or the polite judgements that it's just parenting issues, not autism. Despite these being good reasons not to want to share, these are not part of the \"dark path\" to which I referred.\nThe dark path is that my child is not defined by autism. There is nothing that the swim instructor would do differently simply because my son has autism. They are already working very hard to gaining his cooperation, and often provide 1:1 attention. At this age, they are good at individualizing to the child's needs. - Honestly, he needs behavioral therapy to work on rigidity/flexibility and transitions. He has no issues with the water and will perform the skills when he wants to. - When he's upset or being difficult, I don't want the swim instructors to see autism instead of seeing my son.\nAnd then if you look at my son and see autism, you might wonder what programs he should be enrolled in? Can he do the on-my-own programs that many three year olds take? Is tot soccer going to be too much craziness for a child with autism? Is if fair to put him in a gymnastics class to work on following instructions and sticking with the group when you know it's going to be challenging due to autism? ... Autism. Pervasive and intruding into all decisions. A justification, reason and excuse. Always in a negative connotation.\nLabels or diagnoses can be good when they provide direction or help you understand something.

The fabrication flow is fully planar and compatible with large-scale integration on silicon-photonic circuits. \nCMOS compatibility with silicon photonics lowers fabrication costs, and provides access to mature and large-scale facilities, which enables packaging compatibility with CMOS driving circuits. \n\u201cSilicon-photonic technologies are becoming more mature, but the main limitation of these platforms is the lack of an integrated light source,\u201d said Bertrand Szelag, a co-author of the paper. \u201cThis project showed that a laser can be integrated on a mature silicon-photonic platform with a modular approach that does not compromise baseline process performances. We demonstrated that the entire process can be done in a standard CMOS fabrication line with conventional process and materials, and that it is possible to integrate all the photonic building blocks at large scale.\u201d \nThe integration required managing a thick silicon film, typically 500nm thick, for the hybrid laser, and a thinner one, typically 300nm, for the baseline silicon-photonic platform. This required locally thickening the silicon by adding 200nm of amorphous silicon via a damascene process, which presents the advantage of leaving a flat surface favorable for bonding III-V silicon. The laser can be integrated on a mature silicon photonic platform with a modular approach that does not compromise the baseline process performance. \nThe novelty of the approach also included using innovative laser electrical contacts that do not contain any noble metals, such as gold. The contacts also prohibit integration lift-off-based processes. Nickel-based metallization was used with an integration technique similar to a CMOS transistor technique, in which tungsten plugs connect the device to the routing metal lines. \nNext steps include integrating the laser with active silicon-photonic devices, e.g. a modulator and photodiode with several interconnect metal levels in a planarized backend. Finally, III-V die bonding will replace III-V wafer bonding in order to process lasers on the entire silicon wafer.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "leti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bertrand szelag", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:24.045+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cc28f8064cc69ad5eb9d240c0c274dc76f9d64a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9D2Qkpp6vWSMwMM8NxS2qQ4nMVF4sMvv9Bob7v5bEBIu0to4cHUxF1lstNtXQeCF4OazqJKz60CTTELDcBhwZeQcVWHmOZT0eYahb6lnw28QN6bQlTIQRu", "site_full": "www.lse.co.uk", "site": "lse.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.lse.co.uk/share-chat.asp?page=205", "site_categories": ["united_kingdom", "travel", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Share Chat on London South East.

You can even breed them! It was only released a week and a half ago, but on today\u2019s Internet, cats are king, so this was always likely to be big business. Cat Cost Rises After Network Jam \nSo many people have jumped on the breeding bandwagon that the Ethereum network \u2013 the blockchain that CryptoKitties runs on \u2013 has been jammed up because of it. Now, the official CryptoKitties Twitter feed has announced that the fee to \u201cbirth\u201d a new digital cat has doubled. This is so that miners are more incentivised to clear the backlog. \nTo many, this will seem like a typically dumb use of revolutionary technology. If you scratch the surface though, you will see that this is another way of bringing the concept of smart contract trading to the masses. The mechanism behind trading in digital cats and digital currency is essentially the same, as smart contracts now dominate the market. It may be the case that successful usage of CryptoKitties will encourage new investors to have a go at cryptocurrency for real. \nIn the meantime, the popularity is enormous. All possible kitties will have been created by November 1 st 2018, meaning that people will need to breed existing ones in order to keep increasing the \u201cpopulation\u201d.

Meanwhile, the Prime Minister was facing a growing civil war in her own party over her approach to the negotiations, as pro and anti-EU Tories traded insults.\nAround 20 Conservative MPs wrote to the Prime Minister, urging her to stand up to \u201chighly irresponsible\u201d Brexiteer colleagues who want her to walk away from the negotiating table.\nBut Bernard Jenkin, a leading Eurosceptic, accused those MPs of being ready to vote down Ms May\u2019s negotiating strategy \u2013 and turned his fire on Brussels for obstructing trade talks.\nHe dismissed concerns about a hard border and painted the Irish government as a Brussels pawn, saying: \u201cDublin is being used as a proxy by the European Union.\u201d\nHopes of a deal rose after Leo Varadkar, the Irish Prime Minister, told Ms May he was willing to look at a new text and potentially shift Dublin\u2019s position.\nA deal fell apart on Monday when the UK\u2019s pledge of \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d across Ireland \u2013 to avoid border customs checks and posts - was vetoed by the DUP.\nSpeaking in Dublin, Mr Varadkar suggested alignment need not apply to \u201ceverything\u201d, but only to areas of \u201cnorth-south\u201d trading activity, and promised a \u201cpositive and open\u201d attitude.\n\u201cI want us to move forward if it's possible next week,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a very good call. We were willing to look at any proposals the UK have.\u201d\nHowever, DUP sources said an agreement was far away, despite David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, saying regulatory alignment would apply across the UK, rather than treat Northern Ireland differently.\nIn Brussels, Mr Barnier agreed that EU ambassadors must discuss any proposed new agreement at a meeting on Friday evening, if it is to be on the table at the EU Council next Thursday.\nThe ambassadors want sufficient time to take it back to their capitals for scrutiny \u2013 or the summit is likely to rule that \u201csufficient progress\u201d has not been made on the divorce issues.\nA failure to agree to move onto trade talks would be a devastating blow for the Prime Minister, with business leaders increasingly angry at the damage looming.\nIt would also increase pressure from Tory Brexiteers for her to walk out of the talks and prepare for a \u201cno deal Brexit\u201d.\nHowever, one EU source told The Daily Telegraph that Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU Commission President was willing to meet Ms May as late as next week, to rescue a deal.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "leo varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hammond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arlene foster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernard jenkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michel barnier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic unionist party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dup", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belfast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dublin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:25.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ef047bc6a64ee02fba2ef162bc2fd25ee7b27a5d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisaGDq2UlHqrZpCpXL61UWvvcjFgSjAr1CwPEKKjSD0XKFhnOZ8J_aryhTPTLYqkWDQ--", "site_full": "www.forexfactory.com", "site": "forexfactory.com", "site_section": "https://www.forexfactory.com/forumdisplay.php?f=69", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Platform Tech @ Forex Factory", "title": "I will code your EAs and Indicators for no charge - Page 1085", "title_full": "I will code your EAs and Indicators for no charge - Page 1085 @ Forex Factory", "published": "2017-12-06T20:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn-assets.forexfactory.net/images/misc/ff_fb_logo.gif?v=0.1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2596, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "397d5e16050bd2f79c9dfcfc601151f9643ae42e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisaGDq2UlHqrZpCpXL61UWvvcjFgSjAr1CwPEKKjSD0XKFhnOZ8J_arxSwN34buU7YEmxcxHbj3sjfup8DMjFR54-", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "T4Trade", "published": "2017-12-07T10:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quoting Kloppo Disliked Hello, im looking for an indicator that marks a \"popgun\" pattern in the chart.

Meunier and Wangdak, a scholar of Tibetan Buddhism, reunite at the library Friday. The enduring effects of peace, love, kindness and compassion, along with everything else that is positive in human nature, from ethics to aspirations, are achievable when combined with the power of patience, according to Dr. Santi Meunier, a Wickford psychotherapist. \nWithout that strength, she said, those values are fragile. Meunier realized this through nearly three decades of friendship with Pema Wangdak, a Tibetan religious scholar who will visit town Friday night. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve become dear friends,\u201d Meunier said. \u201cPeople are feeling so much fear right now. We need inspiration. We need to know that people are doing amazing things all around the world.\u201d \nDuring his appearance, which will include a blessing, meditation and a screening of the documentary \u201cVisions of Mustang,\u201d Wangdak will discuss the gentle teachings of the Buddha through secular and spiritual approaches. The free lecture starts at 7 p.m. at the library, 26 North Road. \nWangdak, who founded the Vikramasila Foundation in New York City to promote Buddhism in America, became a monk before his eighth birthday. That\u2019s also when he trekked through the Himalayas to a Nepalese refugee camp following the Chinese invasion of his country, which ended in death for most of his family in the 1950s. \nPatience, however, guided Wangdak forward. Since being driven from his homeland, he has graduated from a Sanskrit university and was bestowed the 2009 Ellis Island Medal of Honor as a humanitarian. As the first Tibetan to receive the award, Wangdak joins seven U.S. presidents and two Nobel Prize laureates as recipients. He also was appointed khenpo in 2007; the highly distinguished title refers to Tibetan Buddhists who are qualified to teach the religion. \n\u201cHis wisdom and compassion make him an outstanding role model and teacher in today\u2019s world,\u201d Meunier said. \nThe relationship between Meunier and Wangdak began when she heard him speak in 1986. She\u2019d always been drawn to the Tibetan culture, but Wangdak influenced her to take that a step further. \u201cI\u2019ve had this calling all my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted to help.\u201d \nIt was 10 years ago when Meunier became deeply involved. She connected with the Starkey Hearing Foundation, a Minnesota nonprofit that provides hearing aids to impoverished villages around the globe. The foundation raises money through its annual gala, which is flush with celebrities, from Ben Affleck to Bill Clinton, Desmond Tutu to Steven Tyler. As the Tibetan liaison, however, it was Meunier who was responsible for the holiest connection. \n\u201cI got a hold of my lamas on the ground to arrange a meeting between the Dalhi Lama and the head of Starkey,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have since become great friends. We have brought hearing to thousands and thousands of Tibetans.\u201d \nAfter a decade focusing on hearing improvements, Meunier is now shifting toward eyesight. The documentary to be shown during Wagdak\u2019s appearance Friday, \u201cVisions of Mustang,\u201d showcases the plight of vision in northwestern Nepal. \nThe Forbidden Kingdom of Mustang lies in a remote region nestled in the Himalayas, 13,000 feet above sea level. It is a last refuge for traditional nomadic culture of Tibetan Buddhists. Due to extreme sun exposure, its residents suffer one of the highest rates of cataract blindness in the world and lack even the most basic form of medical care. \n\u201cVisions of Mustang\u201d follows the first expedition to enter Upper Mustang to provide surgical clinics and restore sight.

It could be a hard say at work, where nothing is working properly, even your laptop is stuck. Or the deadline of a project is coming to an end and you are nowhere to the finish line. Sometimes you received a bad news or lost somebody you loved. Or you are lying sick and in pain in the dark alone. We all have experienced the financial crises where money are not enough and the credit payment is due... All of these sad and miserable situations makes you ask yourself why is it so hard? Why life sucks can't thing be better? Yes they can, but it won't happen overnight. Still you have the power to change things, by first changing the way you think. Happiness is possible, if you learn a few simple techniques: 1. Smile - go in front of the mirror and give yourself a nice, juicy smile. You will find it ridiculously stupid, but still... funny. Then when you are out to work, or the supermarket smile to a stranger. There are thousands of articles on the net, describing the benefits of smiling to strangers. It is a gift you give and receive. Be open and present and you will feel the warmth and the quiet support of the stranger smiling back to you. It is a miracle. \n2. Allow yourself to be unhappy. When we're feeling bad, feeling in pain, all we want is to get away from it. Ignore it, pretend you're fine, comfort yourself from the pain, shield yourself, lash out in defensiveness, numb it with drugs, distract yourself. This is a very human response. But actually, wanting to get away from the unhappiness doesn't make it better. It usually just prolongs the pain, makes problems worse. Instead, tell yourself that it's OK to feel unhappy, it's OK to feel pain. Pause and allow yourself to feel it, to fully be immerse in that unhappiness. See that it's OK, and know that it won't last FOREVER. And in fact, it's where the healing starts, where growth happens. 3. Meditate. Escape from the everyday habits and give yourself the benefits from calming your mind and senses. Meditate for just 2 minutes a day, and you'll create a habit that will allow you to notice your thoughts throughout the rest of the day, that will help you to be more present (unhappiness comes from not being present), that will help you notice the source of anxiety and distraction. That's a lot that can be accomplished in 2 minutes! Sit or lie in bed every morning when you wake, and just notice your body, and then your breath. Notice when your mind wanders, and gently return to your breath. You become the watcher of your mind, and you'll learn some useful things, I promise. 4. Realize the pain and it will go away. Now that you're face-to-face with the pain and misery, now that you're touching it and intimate with it... see that in fact, it is a tender feeling of being alive. Being alive means feeling pain, feeling fear, feeling disconnected sometimes. Allow yourself to feel it, and imagine that this is what living feels like. Yeah, you could say, \"That sucks,\" or you could say, \"What an interesting experience, being alive.\" It's like bungee jumping or how I imagine it would feel if you discovered you could fly: full of fear, excitement, shock and joy. That is an incredible experience. You're having one of those right now. 5. Be grateful. Being fully alive, being fully immersed in this experience of this moment... what is there to be grateful for? Even small things, like the sight of leaves outside trembling in the wind or someone laughing nearby. Or things we take for granted, like eyesight and music. Having relationships. Being supported by millions of people. Being able to do all the things you can do. The taste of the coffee or the smell of food being cooked. Your breath. You can find gratitude for any of these things, at any time, including right now. Find three happy things in this moment to be grateful for. \n6. Realize the joy in being alive. You are alive! You should be singing from the hilltops. Even in our worst moments, we can find some joy in this not-small fact, that we ARE alive. Your heart is pumping. You feel the wind gently touching your face, or the water when taking a shower. The warm sun stroking your skin. The loving hug of a family member or a friend. Even the tears running down your face. You can FEEL How awesome is that? Yeah, I know. It's hard. I'm not saying that by doing this will magically make everything better. Step by step start with the simple thing. Just be aware of your thoughts. Once you realize they are negative switch immediately. Think of something that makes you happy, listen to relaxing, calm music or watch a funny video. It is that simple! There's always joy to be found in every moment, if we dare to look. \nSilviya Marchokov \nArticle source \nWhat are your thoughts?

In Austria, about 5,500 women develop it each year and 1,500 die of it despite the availability of an early detection program. When a lump is found in a breast, the next step in clinical practice is a biopsy. Although no remedy exists for the anxious hours faced by the affected women, quick diagnostic procedures and competent information about the results are very helpful. The tissue sample taken is most important for diagnosis and treatment. If the tumor is found to be malignant, the subtype is determined immediately, since, depending on the result, different treatment methods are chosen. \u201cAfter consultation by the interdisciplinary tumor board, the doctors discuss available treatment options with the patient and also talk about prognosis (chance to be cured), if the patient asks for it\u201d, explains oncologist Thomas Bauernhofer from the University Hospital Graz. \nIn this context, the oncologist investigated a new biomarker in a project funded by the Austrian Science Fund FWF. This biomarker indicates a poorer prognosis for breast cancer patients. In a five-year research effort in close collaboration with the Institutes for Biophysics and Pathology , the physician managed to produce evidence: a higher expression of the GIRK1 protein shows a greater relapse rate and mortality among patients with the hormone-dependent (ER+) breast cancer subtype after surgery. \nBUILDING BLOCK OF AN ION CHANNEL AS A BIOMARKER \nThe GIRK1 protein is one of at least two required elements for building functioning potassium ion channels in the cell membrane. Such ion channels are indispensable in the human heart, brain or pancreas and, for instance, ensure that the heart beats regularly. A scientific publication with a small number of cases that found GIRK1 in breast cancer inspired the research team to study this protein as a potential new biomarker. At first, a large quantity of messenger RNA (mRNA), a precursor in the production of the GIRK1 protein, was detected in breast cancer cell lines and tissue. By correlating tissue samples and genetic profiles of breast tumors with women\u2019s survival statistics, it is now possible to identify patients at special risk. \u201cBreast cancer patients with an estrogen-receptive positive tumor (ER+) usually respond well to anti-hormonal treatment. But in case the ER+ tumor express a great amount of GIRK1, such patients have a lower probability of survival\u201d, explains Thomas Bauernhofer. The ER+ tumor subtype is found in about 60% of all breast cancer patients. \nWithin the FWF project, two methods were developed to detect excessive GIRK1 expression in tissue sections. The team spent many months looking for an appropriate staining method by means of immunohistochemistry. Having thus been established successfully, the new method is of benefit for researchers investigating the GIRK ion channel in other contexts. The second detection method (fluorescence in-situ hybridization) even enables scientists to determine the expression of GIRK1-mRNA in tumor tissue by means of automatic image analysis. \nWHICH GENES ARE WORKING IN PARALLEL? \nIn a gene cluster examination, the team from Graz also proved that apart from the GIRK1 gene, three further genes are very active in a tumor. \u201cTwo genes are associated with an estrogen receptor (ER alpha), a third one with the angiotensin II receptor\u201d, reports Thomas Bauernhofer. The higher mortality among women with an estrogen-receptor positive tumor and high GIRK1 expression could be attributed to a diminished effect of antihormonal therapy or an increased ability to form metastases. GIRK1, however, could also become a new target for treatment. Thomas Bauernhofer now wants to gain a more exact idea of the interdependencies: \u201cIt is still too early for verifying the biomarker in every biopsy. Our results do not have therapeutic consequences for the time being, but we need to further investigate the relationship between GIRK1 and poor survival rates.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas bauernhofer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university hospital graz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institutes for biophysics and pathology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "girk", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "graz", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:14:26.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5818851baa1fb94c056fa4f707ca6122d5e5df4e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRy1M9dI1BpwgObCqOBP62gcK6Ju4wA64muFnNV_JwPbnvbG3GIV5PpFzlij7AfFQ7aNbIQpSbNlakOD4oNBRTXx_n63ky3NrzjzAy0BaaqOOug.MEEKCKygrG.A8QmpIICFjm..odzVDTL_2IZTnNAQw3suxhOOg-", "site_full": "completecaremaintenancenj.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://completecaremaintenancenj.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Why do you need professional cleaning services in your office? \u2013 Affordable Commercial, Residential Warehouse Carpet Office Floor Cranbury  Cleaning Services", "title": "Why do you need professional cleaning services in your office?", "title_full": "Why do you need professional cleaning services in your office?", "published": "2017-12-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5818851baa1fb94c056fa4f707ca6122d5e5df4e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRy1M9dI1BpwgObCqOBP62gcK6Ju4wA64muFnNV_JwPbnvbG3GIV5PpFzlij7AfFQ7aNbIQpSbNlakOD4oNBRTXx_n63ky3NrzjzAy0BaaqOOug.MEEKCKygrG.A8QmpIICFjm..odzVDTL_2IZTnNAQw3suxhOOg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "completecaremaintenancenj", "published": "2017-12-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "Why do you need professional cleaning services in your office?", "text": "\nMaintaining a clean environment is vital in securing the health of people.

Janitorial firms can guarantee excellent cleaning. They use the best machines and equipment for services like floor stripping and waxing services. \nSkilled professionals \nThe janitorial firms know their clients want quality cleaning services. Due to this reason, they usually do not dispatch cleaning personnel without training them. Their experts know places where dust and dirt can hide. They ensure that everything within the office is exceptionally clean. The proficiency of the janitors is the reason why janitorial firms are reliable for cleaning.\nFlexible timing \nJanitorial firms are aware that their corporate clients need to carry out their operations without any distractions. Therefore, they offer very flexible timings for office cleaning services firms want. The cleaning companies will agree with their clients on the perfect time to carry out their duties.\nMost firms clean the offices either early in the morning or late in the night.

Alex Wong / Getty Images \nFour months into the new job, his predecessor is sharing deep thoughts on Instagram, his boss is tweeting that his agency's reputation is in \"tatters\" and lawmakers are blasting out dueling press releases to make the case that important decisions have been infected by politics. \nIt's not easy being FBI Director Christopher Wray. \nOn Thursday, Wray will get a say of his own when he appears in Congress for his first oversight hearing since the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm him in August. Here are a few things to watch. 1. Russia, Russia, Russia \nWray declared at his confirmation hearing that the probe of Russian interference in last year's election was not, as the president has claimed, \"a witch hunt.\" \nWray also proclaimed his admiration for his former Justice Department colleague and previous FBI Director Robert Mueller, the man leading that criminal investigation. Since that time, Wray has mostly operated outside the spotlight, and he's kept his opinions of the investigation to himself. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are likely to try to nudge Wray out of neutral gear and to take a position. The Russia probe already has netted criminal charges against four people tied to the Trump campaign, including onetime chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nDoes that mean Mueller is reaching beyond his mandate? Do text messages sent by Peter Stzrok, a high-ranking FBI agent who worked on the Hillary Clinton email probe and the Russia investigation , suggest politics played a part in law enforcement decisions in either case? \nShould there be a second special counsel appointed to investigate the investigators? Can the president, who has denied wrongdoing, be charged with a crime while in office if prosecutors conclude they have enough evidence to charge him? \nLook for members of Congress to lean on Wray about all of this. \n\"The House Judiciary Committee has an important responsibility to keep a watchful eye on the FBI to ensure it is fulfilling its missions and that it follows the facts wherever they lead without political interference,\" Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in announcing the hearing. \n\"We look forward to hearing from Director Wray on the many issues facing the FBI, concerns about the politicization of the Bureau, and on answers to the many questions Members have regarding issues before the FBI,\" Goodlatte added. 2. Independence \nThe job Wray filled only opened up after President Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey, in May, amid questions about Comey's loyalty to the White House and the persistent cloud of what Trump told NBC News was \"the Russia thing.\" \nFor his part, Comey has not gone quietly. Instead, he's penned a book on leadership to be published in the spring of 2018. And he routinely posts thoughts from the Bible, philosophers and world leaders on his Instagram and Twitter feeds. Recently, Comey spoke up on behalf of the independence and the integrity of FBI employees , who have faced criticism from the president this year. \nThis week, Wray himself sent a message to bureau employees advising them to \"keep calm and tackle hard\" amid the current adverse climate. And, at his confirmation hearing, Wray pledged his loyalty was to the Constitution, not a political regime. \"I will never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice, period, full stop,\" he said at the time. \nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee will no doubt want to ask Wray about his contacts with President Trump and others in the White House this year. 3. Oh, yeah \u2014 FBI business \nIn a matter of weeks, an important electronic surveillance tool will expire if Congress does not reauthorize it. The murder rate has spiked in several major American cities. \nCourts have thrown out corruption charges or reduced sentences of public officials accused of bribery and other offenses, following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the tools the Justice Department's public integrity unit can use to attack graft in state houses across the country. \nThe bureau also has open investigations into activity by sympathizers of the Islamic State in every one of its field offices. \nThe FBI, in short, has its hands in many baskets. And after the questions about Russia and Trump, members of the committee may want to discuss some business in regular order. Copyright 2017 NPR.
