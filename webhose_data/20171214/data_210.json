Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital despite intense Arab, Muslim and European opposition to a move that would upend decades of U.S. policy and risk potentially violent protests. Evan Vucci AP Photo On Jerusalem, Trump delivers for supporters at home By CATHERINE LUCEY Associated Press December 07, 2017 09:30 AM UPDATED 4 MINUTES AGO WASHINGTON \nPresident Donald Trump's move to recognize the divided city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital may have triggered a worldwide chorus of critics but the president had his ears closely tuned to his supporters at home. \nFor Trump, the proclamation was an important way to make good on a pledge to his political base, which includes evangelical Christians and pro-Israel Republicans eager for such a move. \n\"While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver,\" the president declared Wednesday in announcing his decision. \"Today, I am delivering.\" \nThose were words to savor for a president who's been frustrated to see a number of key campaign pledges stalled or slowed \u2014 sometimes by a bitterly divided Congress, some by larger national or international concerns. \nRepealing the Obama era health care law is a promise unfulfilled, much to Trump's frustration. Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box \u2014 although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action. \n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" \nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. \nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" \nTrump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \n\"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron david miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evan vucci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilan goldenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill galston", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "white house", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for a new american security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east security program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faith and freedom coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catherine lucey associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:40.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c7c29fafd75f48a7b2447a503f980d2a8db1ac60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQpaWh_hOSo7V1x0UKskY_fGxyBjqakLaJ_KEcz5DRjcjuCnq6tTm9Zn46V5EAVJRhM1TSwIREiIZV7PuHm1OrLsDr3Z1iI7OFGwyBcpF2_BqqdD32ApkACrvPihSAVhFJkzfnBBS47G1M9EHZM5EAxvamCmdmWV7QZZmsgWi1ONQ--", "site_full": "yamunariverblog.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://yamunariverblog.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Canon Single Lens Reflex SLR Digital Camera EOS 5D Mark 3 III EOS5DMK3 22.3MP JP \u2013 Yamuna", "title": "Canon Single Lens Reflex SLR Digital Camera EOS 5D Mark 3 III EOS5DMK3 22.3MP JP", "title_full": "Canon Single Lens Reflex SLR Digital Camera EOS 5D Mark 3 III EOS5DMK3 22.3MP JP", "published": "2017-12-07T11:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c7c29fafd75f48a7b2447a503f980d2a8db1ac60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQpaWh_hOSo7V1x0UKskY_fGxyBjqakLaJ_KEcz5DRjcjuCnq6tTm9Zn46V5EAVJRhM1TSwIREiIZV7PuHm1OrLsDr3Z1iI7OFGwyBcpF2_BqqdD32ApkACrvPihSAVhFJkzfnBBS47G1M9EHZM5EAxvamCmdmWV7QZZmsgWi1ONQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "yamunariverblog", "published": "2017-12-07T11:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "Canon Single Lens Reflex SLR Digital Camera EOS 5D Mark 3 III EOS5DMK3 22.3MP JP", "text": "Canon Single Lens Reflex SLR Digital Camera EOS 5D Mark 3 III EOS5DMK3 22.3MP JP \u2013 Buy \u2013 Canon Single Lens Reflex SLR Digital Camera EOS 5D Mark 3 III EOS5DMK3 22.3MP JP ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "canon singl", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jp canon single lens reflex slr digital camera eos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canon single lens reflex slr digital camera eos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lens reflex slr digital camera eos", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:40.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ff77d33da2754a994d10ba671ff1774952c9594c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSFJYSGeCRgENBJKgpnuluWeqi2g9mw7IAvxRnNp7d4IpQV8fQ6tc8MKfoc0f8hy6UmfsETk57MKA--", "site_full": "forums.realgm.com", "site": "realgm.com", "site_section": "https://forums.realgm.com/boards/viewforum.php?f=19", "site_categories": ["pro_ice_hockey", "pro_basketball", "football", "sports", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Los Angeles Lakers -

Therefore, it is important to direct more of your thoughts to such kind of activities so that the moisturizing skin care products FL you select are good. If you understand the product that best suits you, you will get the anticipated and satisfying results.\n\nKeeping your skin properly moisturized and hydrated by use of moisturizing products requires one to know their skin type. When this is not done, moisturizers ought to be avoided since one that will not fit your skin type can cause severe effects. Determining your skin type is done in a simple process of examining the feel of the skin as a day ends. The state can be dry, normal, or oily.\n\nPeople who experience dry conditions of their skins are commonly prone to slight allergic reactions and are normally encouraged to avoid conventional moisturizers. This is because they contain chemicals that harm the fragile surface. On the other hand, the use of oil-based moisturizers on acne-prone skins can also be disastrous. Such blunders in skincare can nonetheless be avoided. For people having oily skins, lotions are usually recommended as opposed to the use of creams.\n\nIn fact, those people suffering from dry skin conditions and suffer from allergic problems are advised not to use conventional moisturizers. The main reason as to why this advice is given is because usage of these compounds causes harm to the external surfaces that are fragile due to the chemicals they contain, In addition, when oil-based moisturizers are used on skins with acne conditions may cause some problems. Therefore, these types of mistakes should be avoided. In fact, using lotions over creams is recommended to those people with oily skins. On the other hand, you need to look for formulas that have exfoliating ingredients in them. Such ingredients include lactic and salicylic acid.\n\nSkincare specialists may as well recommend products for individuals having combined oily and dry skins. This is can be a tough activity but products like lotions having no acid contents remain appropriate. For persons having normal skins, a preferred product is an ointment. Usually, just some thin ointment layer is usually applied in the night for protection.\n\nAnother essential factor to consider in selecting a suitable skin care product is the surrounding climate. Whether hot, windy, or dry, climate should always be taken into account when selecting a moisturizer. When residing in the chilly areas around the Polar Regions, ointments are usually preferred. Moisturizers are usually easily absorbed even as ointment leave some extra protection layer. During humid conditions, gels can be used instead of lightweight moisturizers. Gels are actually more hydrating.\n\nIf your skin texture is normal, use of natural ointment is okay. You can apply thin ointments layers during the night in order to eliminate the effects caused by natural forces. You also need to consider factors like climatic condition of the environment you dwell in.\n\nThe marketing of the product can also be looked into. Moisturizing products can be branded as hypoallergenic yet they contain elements that react with the body. The ingredients ought to should be assessed to prevent misuse or waste. Again, consider applying the moisturizers when your are still is wet. Applications carried out after toning will guarantee maximum benefits\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nGet a summary of the factors to consider when buying moisturizing skin care products FL companies sell at http://www.naiwbellc.net/products right now. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roger miller", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:41.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "adca30024efcdbdf3641c1fab4dd23eafa9c3568", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQOY2Vu62HdS2fx3k67ipt6upNUj_7ZtN46KMzlXuRTAxRSJ7f2MixUH3pilHgPM8xNhSfRJq5VNv13PVEuDcJptkSJd3WHTJ2gX9L3xsuAjRI0zZHSqlQ05eBeTdZoLuc-", "site_full": "article.wn.com", "site": "wn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.wn.com/English/keyword/health", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WN.com - Health News", "title": "Reading University study says morning sickness a good sign", "title_full": "Reading University study says morning sickness a good sign - Worldnews.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NVYjGoy_8DM/0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5594, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "adca30024efcdbdf3641c1fab4dd23eafa9c3568", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQOY2Vu62HdS2fx3k67ipt6upNUj_7ZtN46KMzlXuRTAxRSJ7f2MixUH3pilHgPM8xNhSfRJq5VNv13PVEuDcJptkSJd3WHTJ2gX9L3xsuAjRI0zZHSqlQ05eBeTdZoLuc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "wn.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Reading University study says morning sickness a good sign", "text": "Endokinin, which acts on the brain to cause morning sickness, also ensures good blood flow through the placenta so that oxygen and nutrients can reach the unborn baby (file image). ...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "reading university", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:41.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "64842dad59c6ef54d11b3f85cc50ef105a311ae2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9kqAwOse9F.RCxP1DXNISvgJpJdGDNBsIJSC1WwZ7kRQh1zMaZQwidxqaAahIgjD2PgbuG43XCJ9dAjbHBz1nxgitfiJPEGc4258rcDT0q9Q--", "site_full": "www.notablestylesandmore.com", "site": "notablestylesandmore.com", "site_section": "http://www.notablestylesandmore.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": ["media", "fashion", "movies", "style_and_fashion", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Notable Styles and More", "title": "Third Annual Trailblazer Awards!!", "title_full": "Third Annual Trailblazer Awards!!", "published": "2017-12-07T11:23:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XWCBW5alE-0/WikDx-ewneI/AAAAAAAAWnw/mrNt397OBBoDfh0DDuPr4Z3YU8jfACabQCLcBGAs/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/Trailblazers%2BAwards%2B%2BFlyer%2B2017.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "64842dad59c6ef54d11b3f85cc50ef105a311ae2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9kqAwOse9F.RCxP1DXNISvgJpJdGDNBsIJSC1WwZ7kRQh1zMaZQwidxqaAahIgjD2PgbuG43XCJ9dAjbHBz1nxgitfiJPEGc4258rcDT0q9Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nicole McClain (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:23:00.000+02:00", "title": "Third Annual Trailblazer Awards!!", "text": "4:14 AM Alpha Blackburn , Courtney Roby , Debra Simmons-Wilson , Delores Lewis Thornton , DJ Skrill , Indianapolis , Indianapolis Black Chamber of Commerce , Matthew Steward , Sherry Sims , Tony Radford , Trailblazer awards No comments Everything Underground partnered with The Indianapolis Black Chamber of Commerce to kick off the third annual Trailblazer Awards.

And have done so ever since my family took a train \u2013 steam engine, of course \u2013 from Johannesburg to Durban sometime in the early 1950s. \nWhenever I can, I take a train in preference to flying or driving.   When I fly, which is often, I have to put up with lines, security, and uncomfortable seats.   When I drive, I have to concentrate on what I am doing. \nWith a train, security is minimal, the seats are comfortable, there\u2019s time to think, reflect, and read, and there are people to meet and talk to if one wants to.   The only occasional discomfort is a bed too short. \nHowever . . . \nUnless you live in Europe, punctuality is often variable.   I use the Empire Builder from Minneapolis to Chicago whenever I can.   The problem?   Freight (and oil) traffic has priority in North Dakota, so the poor train is sometimes 8 hours late arriving in Minneapolis (actually St. Paul).   And even though a European fast train would take no longer than three hours to reach Chicago, the Empire Builder takes eight. \nSo, it\u2019s important not to have pressing engagements at the other end. \nMy latest trip was last week, when I took the Shosholoza Meyl train from Cape Town to Johannesburg to work with Michael on our new book.    \n\nIt\u2019s an overnight trip of about 1400 kms.   It gets its name from a great African song \u2013 Shosholoza \u2013 which is often thought of as South Africa\u2019s second anthem.   The song is about long-distance rail trips to work on the mines. \nClick here for a terrific rendering of it  by the Soweto Gospel Choir. \nMy train The train potters along on relatively narrow-gauge tracks, starting in the scenic Western Cape with its spectacular mountains and vineyards, then ambles through the Great Karoo \u2013 a vast semi-arid area which is home to South Africa\u2019s sheep farms.   After a stop in Kimberely with its famous hand-dug Big Hole \u2013 where diamonds were found 150 years ago \u2013 it heads for the Highveld (altitude 1500 to 1600 metres) and ends in Johannesburg. \nTrain starts in Cape Town  My train set off at 0905 last Tuesday with an anticipated arrival in Johannesburg at 1100 the following morning.   Perfect!   A sleeping compartment to myself, meals included, and decent wines available at the bar.   A day of pleasure to look forward to. \nI admit I was puzzled by the Train Manager\u2019s welcoming speech in the lounge before embarking.   He said that we should regard the 1100 arrival time as a printing error.   One o\u2019clock is the actual time.   Then he went on to describe the service and amenities, and ended with a comment about how the train is sometimes late and could arrive at four. \nLittle did I know. \nThe first twelve hours were spectacular, climbing through the first range of mountains to the Worcester area, then through the stunning Hex River Valley with its wall-to-wall vineyards and rugged mountains, then up through a long tunnel to Touws River at the beginning of the Karoo, which is one of my favorite parts of the country.   But then I prefer deserts to forests.   \nWestern Cape approaching Paarl \nPaarl derives from the Dutch for pearl - a granite pearl \nWestern Cape winter wheat fields \nClimbing up through the first mountain range \n\nThe Karoo is a vast area of about over 300,000 sq. kms - a third again the size of the UK; eight times the size of Denmark (sans Greenland); and half again the size of Illinois.  It lies about 1000 to 1300 metres above sea level.   At best, it enjoys 25 cms of rain per year, with many parts considerably less. \n\n\nAs in many places in the world, trains have fallen out of favour, so many of the small stations, once used to service the farms, have become derelict.   It was sad watching abandoned houses and station buildings, with difficult-to-read signs.   When I was young, this was a vibrant route. \nIn the middle of the Karoo \nAbandoned \nStation sign \nLamp post leaning in De Aar Karoo scene \nKaroo scene \nKaroo scene \nKaroo scene \nAbandoned stone sheep pen \nOasis \nKaroo scene \nKaroo scene \nKaroo scene \nKaroo scene \nKaroo scene We enjoyed a delicious five-course dinner at about 1900 and had just settled in the lounge for a medicinal brandy, when the train stopped \u2013 in the middle of the Karoo \u2013 no towns in sight.   Sheep on the rails, maybe?   Another train coming in the other direction, perhaps?   There was plenty of brandy, so I wasn\u2019t worried.  And I particularly like KWV 10-year Old. \nNo shortage of liquid  Good company from England and Germany After about five hours in the same place, a dozen or so tourists had moved through their stress of going to miss their flights home, to slightly inebriated acceptance, having rebooked for the following day. \nIt was late when we all went to our cabins to sleep. \nWhen we awoke, we were still in the same place, now twelve hours late.   I didn\u2019t mind.   Good company, good food and wine.   And a good book.   A pleasure. \nThe view from where we stopped \nTaking a break from the train Eventually, after nineteen hours of being motionless, the train started up.  Apparently, the overhead power line for the electric engine had broken and was difficult to repair.  Nineteen hours difficult! \nAnyway, to cut a long story short, we arrived in Johannesburg at eight o\u2019clock on Thursday morning instead of eleven o\u2019clock on Wednesday.   Twenty-one hours late. \nGreen grass approaching Johannesburg This one never made it! \nTypical Johannesburg mine dump - from mine tailings \nApproaching Johannesburg station I do have to compliment the train\u2019s staff.  Somehow, they managed to add two extra meals, and maintain their humour in the face of some increasingly restless passengers.  Overall, the passengers were also fine once the uncertainty of knowing whether they would make their original flights disappeared.  Then everyone sat down to enjoy the experience. \n\nI have been asked numerous times whether I would go on the Shosholoza Meyl again.   Absolutely, I would.   But I would ensure I had no pressing appointments at the other end.

Montefiore Health System via AP) In this Nov. 21, 2017 photo provided by the Montefiore Health System, Dr. Tova Koenigsberg at The Montefiore Einstein Center for Cancer Care in New York shows an example of a traditional mammogram scan. U.S. health officials are beginning a huge study to compare traditional mammograms with 3-D versions, to see if the newer choice might really improve screening for breast cancer. Montefiore Health System via AP) A better mammogram? Huge study putting 3-D scans to the test By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer December 07, 2017 03:55 AM WASHINGTON \nA better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray \u2014 and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. \nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? \nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat \u2014 overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. \nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms \u2014 known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" \u2014 with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. \nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. \nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\" \nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? \nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) \nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. \nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. \nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. \nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? \nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles \u2014 not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. \nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts. \nHOW TO DECIDE? \nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. \nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. \nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death \u2014 but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening \u2014 that overdiagnosis problem. \nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. \nTHE NEW STUDY \nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years.

Targeting signaling pathways in CSCs is considered to be a promising strategy for the treatment of cancer. Here, we investigated the role of the A2B adenosine receptor (A2BAR) and its associated signaling pathways in governing the proliferation and viability of breast cancer cell line derived CSCs.\nMethods CSCs were isolated from the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 using a mammosphere assay. The effect of the A2BAR agonist BAY606583 on cell proliferation was evaluated using XTT and mammosphere formation assays, respectively. Apoptosis was assessed using Annexin-V staining and cell cycle analyses were performed using flow cytometry. The expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2, cyclin-D1, CDK-4 and (phosphorylated) ERK1/2 were assessed using Western blotting.\nResults Our data revealed that the breast cancer cell line derived mammospheres were enriched for CSCs. We also found that A2BAR stimulation with its agonist BAY606583 inhibited mammosphere formation and CSC viability. In addition, we found that the application of BAY606583 led to CSC cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through the cyclin-D1/Cdk-4 and Bax/Bcl-2 pathways, respectively. Notably, we found that BAY606583 significantly down-regulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the breast cancer cell line derived CSCs.\nConclusions From our results we conclude that A2BAR induces breast CSC cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through downregulation of the ERK1/2 cascade. As such, A2BAR may be considered as a novel target for the treatment of breast cancer.\n\n\nfrom #MedicinebyAlexandrosSfakianakis via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2iyfefp\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bax", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "csc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:42.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1362f8d37a3608b4c9bc63138f21d944c0a04171", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRb49YCQbprQVTO7B6fq4Qkdo2X3yZ.pgwlFqeXWY2WqNPLiLwGoyBucj9wN86NqqO0JYeqZS5TmbWcx3FPP2SKUZhWnaYly8fwgLlnA4WD56pWrWt4Ho69akn0aV0rNBjqovIkJ7MgzQ--", "site_full": "www.desidime.com", "site": "desidime.com", "site_section": "https://www.desidime.com/forums/hot-deals-online", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping"], "section_title": "Hot Deals Forum | Best Trending Deals, Coupons &amp; Offers by Indian's Shopping Community ", "title": "Walnut Kernels (Light Halves) at just Rs.340/500gm (LOOT)", "title_full": "Walnut Kernels (Light Halves) at just Rs.340/500gm (LOOT) - Hot Deals - Online Forum at DesiDime", "published": "2017-12-07T20:23:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 29, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://cdn2.desidime.com/logo/Desidime_Logo-1200X630.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9399, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "847a88b9d135cdb58b2b3769639dcdceac323b9d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRb49YCQbprQVTO7B6fq4Qkdo2X3yZ.pgwlFqeXWY2WqNPLiLwGoyBucj9wN86NqqO0JYeqZS5TmbWcx3FPP2SKUZhWnaYly8fwgLlnA4WD56pWrWt4Ho69akn0aV0rNBhQltnhtgqQGwRzrQc.BcE9uzAr90ugIWM-", "ord_in_thread": 19, "author": "pbcmehul", "published": "2017-12-07T21:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Point 1 .

A new look at \" A Star Is Born \" remake starring Stefani Germanota ( Lady GaGa ) and Bradley Cooper has made its way out via Entertainment Weekly . The photo highlights the two main characters, played by GaGa and Cooper, who look intimate while delivering a musical performance outdoor. The musical, which is based on William Wellman's 1937's movie of the same name, is Cooper's directorial debut. The story centers on Jackson Maine (Cooper), a country music star who is on the brink of decline, and a talented unknown named Ally (GaGa) whom he takes under his wing. Sebuah kiriman dibagikan oleh Entertainment Weekly (@entertainmentweekly) pada Des 6, 2017 pada 8:15 PST \"It all comes down to this broken love story,\" Cooper says of the central romance in the movie, \"and there's no better way to express that than through singing because there's nowhere to hide when you're singing. Your whole body is electrified...\" The actor describes the storyline, \"[We're exploring] what unconditional love is, how hard it is to love someone in this world as a human being, and what that demands: those are the things I was interested in. I was also very interested in the character of Ally being a bit different than the other versions. She's not an ingenue; she's not this innocent person.\" \"[We're asking]: What happens when you're 30 and you [realize] you might not make it?\" he continues. \"And what happens when the idea that maybe you're not going to make it creeps into your artistic brain, but then you meet somebody who inspires you to run away from that idea and embrace what it is that moves you [creatively]. We're also dealing with the idea of abandonment.\" GaGa composed most of the music, while other musicians who have contributed to the movie include Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real and Mark Ronson . Cooper also talks about recording the songs live on set, \"I actually jumped on many stages at real festivals. I jumped on stage at the Stagecoach Festival and on the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury in front of, like, 90,000 people, which was incredible.

Rumors have been swirling that there will be the first-ever U.S. edition of British show \" Celebrity Big Brother \". The spin-off of the long-running CBS reality show will feature a slew of celebrities competing in the house, but don't expect to see \"Real Housewives\" cast members on the planned series. A new report suggests that the producers ban the ladies from the Bravo reality show. \"There has been a massive amount of interest from D-list stars and their agents, but no one has been more aggressive than the cast of 'Real Housewives',\" a source tells Naugthy Gossip . \" ' Big Brother ' wants to stay away from ladies that have been 'Housewives' because they are looking for real celebrities who are not used to being on camera in a private setting,\" adds the source. The source further explains that \"Celebrity Big Brother\" wants someone with \"genuine reactions.\" The source continues saying, \"The Housewives have had cameras follow them around for years and know all the tricks. They want genuine stars with genuine reactions.\" Words are the show wants Paris Hilton , \" Saturday Night Live \" alum Bobby Moynihan and NSYNC 's Lance Bass to join the show. Also among the preferred celebrity cast members are \" The Bachelorette \" vet Kaitlyn Bristowe and Spencer Pratt , who starred on the U.K. version of \"Celebrity Big Brother\" twice. Blac Chyna is also said to be among the potential cast members of the planned series. Previous report said that by getting Blac onboard the show, producers hoped that she would spill the Kardashians' secrets. Throughout the show, cast members of \"Big Brother\" often spilled juicy stuff during down moments, in which they had private conversations while camera continued to roll. America's \"Celebrity Big Brother\" reportedly will have similar format to the flagship show. It will feature Head of Household and Power of Veto competitions as well as live eviction ceremonies. However, it remains to be seen whether the vote will be determined by other houseguests or the public instead.

That\u2019s the situation Samsung is in and it isn\u2019t alone. Xiaomi and Huawei are part of that club, but the latter seems to have picked up some slack. After making it available in beta last October, Huawei is finally rolling out Android Oreo to the Mate 9 and its variants. Of course, it comes with Huawei\u2019s own custom EMUI 8.0 experience and, sadly, isn\u2019t available everywhere yet. \nHuawei Mate 9 owners are unlikely to directly feel or see the changes that Android 8.0 Oreo brings. That\u2019s because it is masked by the myriad of features that EMUI 8.0 piles on top of vanilla Android. And some of the features of Oreo might have even been implemented in the previous EMUI 5 version. Yes, Huawei skipped a few numbers. \nThe highlight of EMUI 8.0 is on artificial intelligence. No, not exactly in the same way as Google Assistant, though it does have one like it as well. It is more on the machine learning that is used to learn the user\u2019s behavior and patterns in order to predict what he or she will do next. This gives the illusion of a more responsive interface since it seems to be one step ahead of the user. \nEMUI 8.0 also brings in a desktop \u201cProjection\u201d mode, ala Samsung DeX. It\u2019s an interesting spin on the idea, one that doesn\u2019t require a bulky hub. There\u2019s also dual Bluetooth audio support, something that very few phones with Bluetooth 5.0 can do. \nNow for the fine print. At the moment, only Chinese models of the Mate 9 variants are getting updated, including the Mate 9 itself, the Mate 9 Pro, and the Mate 9 Porsche Design. International rollout shouldn\u2019t be that far behind. The biggest oddity, however, is that the update doesn\u2019t come via a regular OTA and has to be downloaded and sideloaded via the phone\u2019s Huawei Mobile Services app.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "xiaomi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "huawei", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huawei mobile services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:43.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "29f0067b2c680779c07aeebc0e37481a32b934d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpRXdhD22O.F1ebtafGu5rXDN.h1320vbUW7P.czD4Ytr8UZEarI_ODjlHk4n9y3AZFTT8p.3kGwG_KUR4HFg0WVXN.HlBKSXVmHyPj7G.yzeH7jGTxdUfGTQ4jrYGuvrk2JU_psXbmxSg--", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "https://www.hotukdeals.com/tag/audiovisual-new?page=2&ajax=true", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Audiovisual Deals \u21d2 Cheap price, best Sale in UK - HotUKDeals - page 2", "title": "Anker / ZOLO Liberty Total-Wireless Earphones \u00a356.24 Sold by AnkerDirect and Fulfilled by Amazon", "title_full": "Anker / ZOLO Liberty Total-Wireless Earphones \u00a356.24 Sold by AnkerDirect and Fulfilled by Amazon - HotUKDeals", "published": "2017-12-07T01:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "https://images.hotukdeals.com/threads/thread_full_screen/default/2849104_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1864, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "29f0067b2c680779c07aeebc0e37481a32b934d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpRXdhD22O.F1ebtafGu5rXDN.h1320vbUW7P.czD4Ytr8UZEarI_ODjlHk4n9y3AZFTT8p.3kGwG_KUR4HFg0WVXN.HlBKSXVmHyPj7G.yzeH7jGTxdUfGTQ4jrYGuvrk2JU_psXbmxSg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T01:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "Anker / ZOLO Liberty Total-Wireless Earphones \u00a356.24 Sold by AnkerDirect and Fulfilled by Amazon", "text": "Edited by: \"GetSchwifty\" 23 h, 57 m ago Found 6th Dec So just found out about these headphones, Anker / Zolo had a Kickstarter for the + version of them with a couple of extra bits of functionality.

The euro at 1.1793 is weaker, as are sterling at 1.3373, the yen at 112.58 and the Australian dollar at 0.7535. The yuan remains flat at 6.6148,   gains. Today\u0092s economic agenda shows Japan\u0092s leading indicators were slightly weaker at 106.1%, down from 106.4% and German industrial production has fallen by 1.4% after a 0.9% fall previously. Data out later includes the French trade balance, UK house prices, Italian unemployment rates, EU revised gross domestic product (GDP), with US data including challenger job cuts, initial jobless claims, natural gas storage and consumer credit. In addition, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is speaking. Most of the base metals prices are correcting, led by aluminium and nickel, while tin and lead prices are holding up and copper and zinc prices have broken lower - but for now are seeing some support. The market therefore remains vulnerable. We   with gold breaking below support at $1,260 per oz to follow silver and platinum prices lower, but for now palladium prices are holding up relatively well. With most of the metals prices in retreat, with the dollar firmer and geopolitical tensions low, the path of least resistance remains to the downside. That said, with the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting next week and with the market expecting an interest rate rise, the weakness we are seeing in gold may well be the market anticipating the rate rise.This  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mario draghi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "shanghai futures exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european central bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us federal open market committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "changjiang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:44.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f1801d9c74bdd165f6dc26fb768eb2760d0485f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpT3gOxqe8z0SGGPPBUXZ0Oeup6n25PJvLhyNNRIEha3JqW.bDcBv0cAj673AF005HCbJ7RFGv1eIvTznx1miBg3VlLClyAUBf_MLNnk12CPC9EgdHhc0ZwcGbTTTZm6FmEhBxQ4SY0NsCW6495TzM8Toj4w3mkAJ2kCY53gguM0dA--", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "https://www.hotukdeals.com/tag/audiovisual-new?page=2&ajax=true", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Audiovisual Deals \u21d2 Cheap price, best Sale in UK - HotUKDeals - page 2", "title": "Oukitel MIX 2 4G 5.99 inch Octa Core 2.39GHz 6GB RAM 64GB ROM 16.0MP + 0.3MP Rear Camera, 4080 mah fast charge - \u00a3173.12 @ Gearbest", "title_full": "Oukitel MIX 2 4G 5.99 inch Octa Core 2.39GHz 6GB RAM 64GB ROM 16.0MP + 0.3MP Rear Camera, 4080 mah fast charge - \u00a3173.12 @ Gearbest - HotUKDeals", "published": "2017-12-06T05:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 16, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.hotukdeals.com/threads/thread_full_screen/default/2848579_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1864, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6523af004295d8197f75469937cf07dc4923860d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpT3gOxqe8z0SGGPPBUXZ0Oeup6n25PJvLhyNNRIEha3JqW.bDcBv0cAj673AF005HCbJ7RFGv1eIvTznx1miBg3VlLClyAUBf_MLNnk12CPC9EgdHhc0ZwcGbTTTZm6FmEhBxQ4SY0NsCW6495TzM8Toj4w3mkAJ2nMK5JQX8Na1mG5FrLme6sMHtubacww0ib2qSYAkKu9Mg--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "webhose.io", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Least it has B20, I generally like snapdragon processors over these chinese ones but some have been seen out performing mid-range chips such as the 625 or the 650.

Using high-resolution manometry (HRM), this study aims to identify positional adaptations of pharyngeal physiology by evaluating swallowing pressure patterns in a series of inverted body positions. Ten healthy adults each underwent swallowing tasks with pharyngeal HRM at six body positions using an inversion table (0\u00b0[upright], 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0[supine], 110\u00b0, 135\u00b0, and 180\u00b0[fully inverted]). Repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess impact of position on pressure parameters, and pharyngeal-UES pressure gradients translate. Velopharyngeal pressures varied by position ( P < 0.001), with significantly higher pressures generated with inversion \u226590\u00b0, compared with upright and 45\u00b0. Change in position did not significantly affect common mesopharyngeal pressures or swallowing pressure durations. UES valving mechanisms were preserved during inversion, with subtle variations observed in integral pressures ( P = 0.011). Pharyngeal-UES pressure gradients changed with position ( P < 0.01), increasing with inversion > 90\u00b0 compared to upright and 45\u00b0. Mechanisms of deglutition may differ with position and relative direction of gravity, particularly when at > 45\u00b0 inclination. Increased palatal pressure is generated in the upside-down position to achieve nasopharyngeal closure and prevent regurgitation. While other classically measured pressures may not consistently differ with positioning, many individuals exhibit adaptations in pressure gradients when inverted, likely due to a combination of changes in pharyngeal driving force and UES opening mechanisms. Identification of these changes, relative to position, further builds on our understanding of the adaptability of the pharyngeal swallowing system.\n\n\nfrom #MedicinebyAlexandrosSfakianakis via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2nzWiCa\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "hrm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ues", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anova", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:44.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7b39d3abe91a64fbb6356457981178e7a87bf8fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpQgZmxVwbZRK9WtT1oIwQ7tAeeNpabVLqk5EFJ0c1i3JDT3xi1gbAke2_ciFdmZaUXbPTpEtuHNu90tzz_Jdcm4QiQ2.pe3BiaXgOwzwODmXWN05v8ZjaJ6B0RnuJb8db7Q1OT_3mST8Q--", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "https://www.hotukdeals.com/tag/audiovisual-new?page=2&ajax=true", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Audiovisual Deals \u21d2 Cheap price, best Sale in UK - HotUKDeals - page 2", "title": "Samsung UE65MU6400 with \u00a3500 cashback on soundbar, subwoofer and blu-ray - \u00a3999.99 @ Richer Sounds", "title_full": "Samsung UE65MU6400 with \u00a3500 cashback on soundbar, subwoofer and blu-ray - \u00a3999.99 @ Richer Sounds - HotUKDeals", "published": "2017-12-06T20:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.015, "main_image": "https://images.hotukdeals.com/threads/thread_full_screen/default/2848943_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1864, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f2640b3b3780438c858d8035b81011b866dbb466", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpQgZmxVwbZRK9WtT1oIwQ7tAeeNpabVLqk5EFJ0c1i3JDT3xi1gbAke2_ciFdmZaUXbPTpEtuHNu90tzz_Jdcm4QiQ2.pe3BiaXgOwzwODmXWN05v8ZjaJ6B0RnuJb8db6TQk_2Q2LpUYEbzeF3dt.Fk17p4YtC9N8-", "ord_in_thread": 11, "author": "webhose.io", "published": "2017-12-06T22:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Trouble is the cheapest soundbar, woofer and player cost \u00a3900 according to pricespy so if you really want to spend \u00a3400 after cashback for all these extras then fine.

As a pediatric cardiologist, I know firsthand: This is a risky game to play. Earlier this fall, Congress allowed the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to expire . The program provides health insurance for about 394,000 children in Texas, plus another 249,000 who CHIP helps fund through Medicaid, according to the Texas Tribune . It also provides coverage to about 36,000 pregnant women. Initially, the situation was concerning, though not completely alarming. So far, states have cobbled together money from various sources to keep the program running, despite Congress\u2019s failure to renew it. But now, we\u2019ve entered new territory. Texas officials have said they may need to close down the CHIP program by January if Congress fails to renew it. Texas already has more uninsured people than any other state. Without CHIP, our state\u2019s count of uninsured will rise by another 15 percent. These are staggering numbers that represent real people, For example, I first met one of my absolute favorite patients, a five-year-old, when I began treating her for a congenital heart condition. She went into cardiac arrest three times the first night I encountered her. I thought she was going to die, but amazingly she survived, and I was able to see her grammar school graduation and later her high school graduation. She died suddenly at age 19, after she stopped taking expensive medication when state-funded coverage ran out. Programs like CHIP and Medicaid are real lifelines to people whose very lives depend on them to function as intended. Her death spurred me into a new career in public health to see what could be done to change our policies. CHIP covers a variety of treatments beyond illness. For example, it allows kids to get help with mental health and substance abuse issues, to hopefully get teens on track as adults. It covers dental work, which is critically important because a third of children miss school due to dental problems. When that happens, parents wind up missing work. But CHIP is running out of time, and Texas \u2014 along with other states \u2014 will soon send out notices telling parents that their children\u2019s health insurance is about to end. This is a pending disaster for ill children and pregnant women. The good news is Congress likes CHIP. The bad news is Congress has been preoccupied, and the CHIP reauthorization has been eclipsed by other legislative priorities. If CHIP is stopped, government workers who administer it will find other work. It will take a long time to rebuild a program that functions well. There\u2019s no debate: CHIP saves lives. Consequently, when you jeopardize CHIP, you jeopardize kids\u2019 lives. It\u2019s time for Congress to reauthorize CHIP before Texas and other states start winding the program down and going down a path that may be impossible to reverse.

I think I like my previous idea. Max the armor, maybe add another SL, then fill up on HS. If that is overly heat neutral, then you start swapping out HS for MLas until you can at least fire all your LLas and do a full move and stay heat neutral.\nLooking at the Awesome, specifically, other alternatives are jump jets, because lol jumping Awesomes, and/or instead of 3xPPCs, do 4xLLas+1HS.

I see videos and hear stories of people successfully calling in hogs all the time. So the question is...what have I been doing wrong? I decided to buy an electronic game caller a while back and I've been very successful calling in coyotes with it. I decided to try and start trying to call in hogs again, mostly because the hogs are laying really low right now and the corn isn't bringing them out like it was in the summer.\nSo I started up the call using the baby pig distress and I almost fell over with excitement with the sight of a nice sized boar hog walking out of the woods in the direction of caller. I turned off the caller when he got closer and finally decided to take a headshot when he stopped at about 90 yards away. The first shot hurt him but he was still able to run. After hitting him with a couple more shots he finally dropped in some thick brush about 20 yards deep in the yards.\nI know that I need to practice to get better at calling in hogs but man, this makes hog hunting a lot easier...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-4PUw2iUEk"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:44.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7b39d3abe91a64fbb6356457981178e7a87bf8fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpQgZmxVwbZRK9WtT1oIwQ7tAeeNpabVLqk5EFJ0c1i3JDT3xi1gbAke2_ciFdmZaUXbPTpEtuHNu90tzz_Jdcm4QiQ2.pe3BiaXgOwzwODmXWN05v8ZjaJ6B0RnuJb8db7Q1OT_3mST8Q--", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "https://www.hotukdeals.com/tag/audiovisual-new?page=2&ajax=true", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Audiovisual Deals \u21d2 Cheap price, best Sale in UK - HotUKDeals - page 2", "title": "Samsung UE65MU6400 with \u00a3500 cashback on soundbar, subwoofer and blu-ray - \u00a3999.99 @ Richer Sounds", "title_full": "Samsung UE65MU6400 with \u00a3500 cashback on soundbar, subwoofer and blu-ray - \u00a3999.99 @ Richer Sounds - HotUKDeals", "published": "2017-12-06T20:50:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.015, "main_image": "https://images.hotukdeals.com/threads/thread_full_screen/default/2848943_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1864, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b2e2647dfaad0c9b5305940400f7dbb0e9492ed9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpQgZmxVwbZRK9WtT1oIwQ7tAeeNpabVLqk5EFJ0c1i3JDT3xi1gbAke2_ciFdmZaUXbPTpEtuHNu90tzz_Jdcm4QiQ2.pe3BiaXgOwzwODmXWN05v8ZjaJ6B0RnuJb8db6TQk_2Q2LpURomBbE8pA6kZympE9rKPW4-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Toon_army", "published": "2017-12-06T22:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Toon_army 54 s ago Does this support HLG just looked there but can't see.
