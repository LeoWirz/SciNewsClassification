In order to do that, I did the following:\n<?php $doc = new DOMDocument(); $doc->load(\"FilenameList.xml\"); $root = $doc->documentElement; $newFiles = $root->getElementsByTagName(\"newFile\"); echo count($newFiles); ?>\nHowever, that returned \"1\", even though, obviously, there are way more nodes. I also tried counting the amount of <newFile> nodes using simpleXML, but again, it did not work. I'm very confused by this, as I used the same syntax in the past and it worked out perfectly. Another thing I tried was to do this:\n$newFiles = $doc->getElementsByTagName(\"newFile\");\nInstead of $root = ...\nIn addition, I also tried using sizeof() instead of count() .

Sonos and Ikea unite on an overdue \u2018music and sound\u2019 partnership \u2026 Sonos and Ikea unite on an overdue \u2018music and sound\u2019 partnership \u2026 December 7, 2017 by Michael Leave a Comment Details are scant, but today Sonos and Ikea are announcing a partnership meant to bring \u201cmusic and sound\u201d into all aspects of the home. Ikea calls the collaboration a third step for its Ikea Home Smart initiative. Step one was the integration of Qi wireless charging into its furniture back in 2015, and step two was the launch of its smart lighting products in 2016. The first realizations from the Sonos and Ikea partnership aren\u2019t expected to be in stores until 2019, however. \u201cAt IKEA we strive to make solutions for life at home by integrating technology into our home furnishing offer that are easy to use and affordable, thereby making smart home technology accessible to the many people,\u201d said Bj\u00f6rn Block of IKEA\u2019s smart home division. \u201cTogether with Sonos we want to democratize music and sound in the home, and we want to create products designed for how people listen together at home. By teaming up with Sonos we want to combine IKEA home furnishing knowledge with Sonos\u2019 expertise within great home sound.\u201d What this means come 2019 is open to interpretation. At a minimum we can expect Ikea to initially sell Sonos\u2019 existing lineup of speakers. But it could also point to entirely new products developed in ways presently unforeseen using Sonos\u2019 intellectual property and Ikea\u2019s vast network of furniture designers. The latter could be years away, however. The partnership\u2019s emphasis on \u201cmusic and sound\u201d is notable. We often think of Sonos in narrow terms as the company that delivers music anywhere in the home. But more generally speaking, it can also deliver sounds. It\u2019s already doing that by integrating Alexa\u2019s intelligent voice assistant inside the Sonos One speaker . But you can imagine Sonos speakers being used to deliver audio for all types of", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sono", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bj\u00f6rn block", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ikea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ikea", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:31.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "79e8363752e329f3f165f8b7c1887b56518db57d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSu2pBmyvyP_UVfznq.FEr9r5YFT2NdaPuCnbg4ORe8AhEWeoQThFZ7uWuyPUlCZjml3XpK8t7DQPVYyxIRourm5QMGwHIyi8mZc07kyaZyxw--", "site_full": "hypixel.net", "site": "hypixel.net", "site_section": "https://hypixel.net/forums/off-topic.2/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Off Topic | Hypixel - Minecraft Server and Maps", "title": "What games do you play outside of Minecraft? | Page 4", "title_full": "What games do you play outside of Minecraft? | Page 4 | Hypixel - Minecraft Server and Maps", "published": "2017-12-07T12:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.212, "main_image": "https://hypixel.net/data/avatars/m/78/78922.jpg?1509711305", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 11753, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4feeb0acd2e44a62082102b196416df1f78bbcf1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSu2pBmyvyP_UVfznq.FEr9r5YFT2NdaPuCnbg4ORe8AhEWeoQThFZ7uWuyPUlCZjml3XpK8t7DQPVYyxIRourm5QMGwHIyi8mY56Id3rgArIgx0K2.q4BR", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "_deadlordz", "published": "2017-12-07T12:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "For mobile Vainglory,yu gi oh (all), Shadow Fight 1,2,3\nFor Pc osu , yu gi oh , danganronpa (all), Digimon,dota 2", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:31.031+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9432d84627415aac7cd567942d11d5eb4ba3e6de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLtZqyWX0qjG7Oa42_5Ar.XSeg8D6lIt.k5Av2CwnZYWavPasNApEyYaPmmxFMUbrSM-", "site_full": "stackoverflow.com", "site": "stackoverflow.com", "site_section": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/xml?sort=newest&pagesize=15&days=7", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Newest 'xml' Questions - Stack Overflow", "title": "How to delete element XML in Java", "title_full": "How to delete element XML in Java - Stack Overflow", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=73d79a89bded", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 51, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9432d84627415aac7cd567942d11d5eb4ba3e6de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLtZqyWX0qjG7Oa42_5Ar.XSeg8D6lIt.k5Av2CwnZYWavPasNApEyYaPmmxFMUbrSM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Arga Daneshwara", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "How to delete element XML in Java", "text": "I can actually read this data and parse these into ArrayList but I don't understand how can I delete all of the elements in XML with Java?\nAnd this is the format:\n<austattungsliste> <austattung anzahl=\"20\" name=\"beamer\">beamer</austattung> <austattung anzahl=\"15\" name=\"flipchart\">flipchart</austattung> <austattung anzahl=\"20\" name=\"laser\">laser</austattung> </austattungsliste>\nI want to make the list like this:\n<austattungsliste> </austattungsliste>\nand this is how I read and parse these XML\npublic void init() { try { // XML-Datei einlesen File fXmlFile = new File(XMLdateiName);

I think it\u2019s his most important speech ever. \n\nDuring the speech, Paul traced the history of the US dollar within the international financial system. \n\nCrucially, he pointed out the one thing that would precipitate the US dollar\u2019s collapse. Now that one thing is about to happen. \n\nHere\u2019s the most important part: \n\nThe economic law that honest exchange demands only things of real value as currency cannot be repealed. The chaos that one day will ensue from our 35-year experiment with worldwide fiat money will require a return to money of real value. We will know that day is approaching when oil-producing countries demand gold, or its equivalent, for their oil rather than dollars or euros. The sooner the better. \n\nIn other words, we\u2019ll know the dollar-centric monetary system is about to end when countries start trading oil for gold or its equivalent\u2026 not dollars. \n\nNow\u2014thanks to China\u2014that\u2019s about to happen in a very big way. \n\nI discussed all of this with Ron Paul extensively at a past Casey Research conference. He told me he stands by his assessment. \n\nChina recently announced a mechanism that will make it possible to trade oil for gold on a large scale for the first time in many decades. \n\nThis mechanism could undermine the petrodollar system\u2014the system that\u2019s supported the US dollar as the top global currency since the 1970s. \n\nI call it China\u2019s \u201cGolden Alternative\u201d to the petrodollar. \n\nWhy the US Dollar Is So Special \n\nThe petrodollar system is the big reason the US dollar is so unique. Here\u2019s how it works\u2026 \n  \nOil is by far the largest and most strategic commodity market in the world. And, until recently, virtually anyone who wanted to import oil needed US dollars to pay for it. \n  \nEvery country needs oil. And if foreign countries need US dollars to buy oil, they have a very compelling reason to hold large dollar reserves. \n  \nThis creates a huge artificial market for US dollars. It also gives a tremendous boost to anyone who lives in the US or holds US dollars. \n  \nThe petrodollar system is the reason foreign countries keep such large US dollar reserves. \n  \nNow China is set to hit the petrodollar with a mortal blow... \n  \nChina\u2019s Golden Alternative to the Petrodollar \n  \nThroughout history, every great power has had money that\u2019s recognized around the world. \n\nUsually, these currencies have been tied to gold and silver. \n  \nAncient Greece had the silver drachma. Rome had the silver denarius. The Islamic Caliphates had the gold dinar and the silver dirham. Venice had the gold ducat. Great Britain had the gold sovereign. \n  \nThe United States used silver in its coins until 1964. And the dollar was under a pseudo-gold standard until 1971. \n  \nNow it\u2019s China\u2019s turn. \n  \nIt\u2019s no secret that China has been stashing away as much gold as it can. \n  \nToday, China is the world\u2019s largest producer and buyer of gold. According to informed observers, China now has official reserves of over 160 million ounces. It also has 400 million ounces in the ground that it could potentially mine. \n  \n(The US, by contrast, claims it has official reserves of around 260 million ounces.) \n  \nChina\u2019s Golden Alternative is the reason it\u2019s been stashing so much gold. \n  \nThe Golden Alternative will allow anyone in the world to trade oil for gold. It will totally bypass the US dollar and the US financial system. \n  \nFor many, it will be much more attractive than the petrodollar system.   \n  \nThe Golden Alternative is the beginning of the end of the international monetary system that has reigned since the early 1970s. \n  \nHere\u2019s how it will work\u2026 \n  \nThe Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE) is about to launch a crude oil futures contract denominated in Chinese yuan. It will allow oil producers to sell their oil for yuan. \n\nOf course, most oil producers don\u2019t want a large reserve of yuan. China knows this. \n\nThat\u2019s why China has explicitly linked the crude futures contract with the ability to convert yuan into physical gold through gold exchanges in Shanghai (the world\u2019s largest physical gold market) and Hong Kong. The system won\u2019t touch China\u2019s official gold reserves. \n\nOil producers will have two ways to do this: \n\n1. Immediately convert the yuan they receive from selling oil into physical gold at the spot price for immediate delivery. \n\n2. Or, lock in the gold to be delivered at a future date for a fixed yuan price with a gold futures contract. This eliminates any uncertainty because of fluctuating prices. \n\nBottom line, it will allow oil producers to sell oil for gold. Producers will be able to completely bypass the petrodollar system and any restrictions/regulations/sanctions of the US financial system. \n\nI recently spoke with the officials at the exchange. They told me they plan to go live with the INE crude contract before the end of the year. \n\nChina Wants Pricing Power \n\nOne of China\u2019s key goals here is to reduce the dollar\u2019s influence over oil pricing. \n\nChina is the world\u2019s largest oil importer. Developing the new crude contract gives it some global pricing power. \n\nCurrently, most of the $1.7 trillion worth of oil traded each year is priced off of two US dollar-denominated crude benchmarks: West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent. \n\nBeijing thinks the yuan crude contract will reflect the market conditions in Asia better. It could become the most important oil benchmark in Asia. \n\nThe vice-chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission recently said: \n\nThe country will make crude oil futures the new starting point of opening up all futures markets\u2026 \n\nAnd then, we will allow foreign players, whose enthusiasm is very high at present, to enter other futures markets, such as iron ore and PTA, when conditions are ripe. \n\nIn other words, oil is just the beginning. \n\nEventually, China plans to challenge the dollar\u2019s dominance over all commodities. \n\nWhy Medium Sour Crude? \n\nThe INE crude futures will be priced in yuan per barrel and be for 1,000 barrels. \n\nBrent and WTI futures contracts are for light, sweet crude. \u201cLight\u201d means it has relatively low density, and \u201csweet\u201d means it has a low sulfur content. \n\nThe INE contract, on the other hand, will be for medium sour crude. \nThere are a handful of reasons for this: \n\n\u2022 Medium sour crude is the main type of oil China and its neighboring countries import. \n\n\u2022 Medium sour crude oil accounts for over 40% of global crude output, but there is currently no price benchmark for it. \n\n\u2022 The supply/demand dynamics of medium sour are not the same as light sweet crude. \n\nPetroChina and Sinopec, two giant Chinese oil companies, will provide liquidity to the new yuan crude futures. \n\nBut non-Chinese companies will be welcome, too. The crude yuan future will be China\u2019s first commodities futures contract open to foreign investors. \n\nJPMorgan and UBS have already gained approval to trade. So have over 6,000 individual traders. It\u2019s just a matter of time before the other big global players join. \n\nRemember the big idea here\u2026 the new yuan crude futures contracts will be a huge hit to the petrodollar. \n\nAnd it\u2019s going to make a lot of money flood into gold\u2014money that would have otherwise gone into the US dollar and US Treasuries. \n\n\u201cWe Don\u2019t Have a Country\u201d \n\nThe breakdown of the petrodollar will cause a financial crisis. \n\nHere\u2019s how things will unravel\u2026 \n\nThe petrodollar system is one of the most powerful forces driving the US bond market. Oil producing countries accumulate hundreds of billions of US dollars in oil profits, which they recycle back into US Treasuries. \n\nThis keeps interest rates lower than they would be otherwise. It allows the US government to finance enormous deficits with debt at an artificially low cost. \n\nIf the petrodollar system unravels, interest rates will soar. (Interest rates are currently near historic lows.) \n\nEven a small rate increase is a lethal threat to the US budget. \n\nThe US government currently needs over $400 billion from taxpayers just to pay the interest on its debt. Tax receipts are just over $2 trillion. \n\nIf interest rates rise\u2026 \n\n\u2022 1%, the government would need over $600 billion to pay the interest on its debt. \n\n\u2022 2%, it would need over $800 billion. \n\n\u2022 3%, it would need $1 trillion. \n\n\u2022 4%, it would need over $1.2 trillion, or over half of what it currently snatches from taxpayers\u2014again, just to pay the interest. \n\nClearly, none of this is sustainable. \n\nTrump was correct last year when he noted: \u201cWhat happens if that interest rate goes up 2, 3, 4 points? We don\u2019t have a country.\u201d \n\nIn many ways, this could turn into President Trump\u2019s financial 9/11. \n\nThe petrodollar system has allowed the US government and many Americans to live way beyond their means for decades. \n\nThe US takes this unique position for granted. But it will disappear once the petrodollar system breaks down. \n\nWhen that happens, inflation could be severe. \n\nThis will likely be the tipping point\u2026 \n\nAfterward, the US government will be desperate enough to implement capital controls, people controls, nationalization of retirement savings, and other forms of wealth confiscation. \n\nI urge you to prepare for the economic and sociopolitical fallout while you still can. Expect bigger government, less freedom, shrinking prosperity\u2026 and possibly worse. \n\nIt\u2019s probably not going to happen tomorrow. But it\u2019s clear where this trend is headed. \n\nIt is very possible that one day soon, Americans will wake up to a new reality. \n\nUntil next time, ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nick giambruno   ron paul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ron paul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "casey research  trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sinopec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china securities regulatory commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "petrochina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us treasuries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shanghai international energy exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "casey research", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "great britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rome", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shanghai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venice", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:32.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "26a094a793120acd21e0d00e03d1a9dc1a0e6208", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jepGgecF_ueFKJawPueYySsdoBFc.SEKinZtxJcnZ0pQWESXLXnMq2k3EjwaRNhuisqB3oZd6wo0mMnkaRdHZ8l", "site_full": "cvt.vn", "site": "cvt.vn", "site_section": "http://cvt.vn/forums/cho-thiet-bi-so.58/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Ch\u1ee3 Thi\u1ebft B\u1ecb S\u1ed1 | RAO V\u1eb6T V\u0168NG T\u00c0U - MUA B\u00c1N - QU\u1ea2NG C\u00c1O", "title": "Tu\u1ea7n L\u1ec5 V\u00e0ng D\u1ecaCH V\u1ee4 M\u1ef0C IN GI\u00c1 SOCK !!!", "title_full": "V\u0168NG T\u00c0U - Tu\u1ea7n L\u1ec5 V\u00e0ng D\u1ecaCH V\u1ee4 M\u1ef0C IN GI\u00c1 SOCK !!!

Last month, computer hackers targeted the Sacramento Regional Transit system, resulting in 30 million files being deleted. The ransom price demanded by the hackers for that attack was a single bitcoin. Now that ransom price is being doubled as hackers have hit the Mecklenburg, North Carolina county government and are demanding 2 bitcoins . Don\u2019t Open That Attachment! \nCounty Manager Dena Diorio said that the hackers got into the county\u2019s system when an employee clicked on an email attachment they shouldn\u2019t have. (It\u2019s amazing in this day and age that people still click on strange email attachments.) Once the click took place, spyware and a worm were unleashed into the system, freezing all of the electronic files. \nDiorio told county commissioners in a meeting that the files were being held for ransom as the hackers were demanding 2 bitcoins, which is now worth almost $25,000 (at the time of this article\u2019s writing). The deadline for paying the ransom is 1pm EST today. \nDena Diorio told reporters that the county was considering paying the ransom, but she did express some concerns over doing so, stating : \nThere\u2019s a risk you don\u2019t get the decryption key and don\u2019t get your files back. There\u2019s also the chance if they think you\u2019ll pay, they may try to get you to come back again. Is It Cheaper to Pay the Ransom? \nLocal governments and businesses do find themselves in a quandary when targeted by hackers. Is it actually cheaper to pay the hackers off to once again have access to critical files? A third-party group could restore said files, but using them could cost more than what the hackers were demanding. Of course, as Diorio mentioned above, paying off a hacker could embolden them to attack you again. \nThis difficult decision is summed up by Diorio when she said : \nWe need to determine how much it would cost (to pay) versus fixing it on our own. There are a lot of places that pay because it\u2019s cheaper. \nThe short deadline is obviously putting pressure on the country commissioners to capitulate to the hackers. As of now, the county is switching to paper records for their employees today. \nAs for the hacking attack, County Manager Dena Diorio summed it up by saying: \nI don\u2019t think we were targeted. I don\u2019t think we were at fault. There have been many, many institutions that have been breached. I think we do everything we can to keep our firewall secure. \nDo you think Mecklenburg, North Carolina should pay the ransom of 2 bitcoins or not?

However, often partnerships do not have one in place as it is not a legal requirement to have a Partnership Agreement. This results in the default position of the partnership being governed by the Partnership Act 1890. \nIn the absence of a Partnership Agreement there can be uncertainties as to the relationship between the partners and the position under the 1890 Act. This can often be outdated and incompatible with how modern businesses operate. \nDanielle Austin explains three important reasons why you should consider having a Partnership Agreement in place: The default position under the 1890 Act is that all profits and losses of the business are shared equally between the partners. This is regardless of the time each partner dedicates to the business or the revenue that they bring in. A Partnership Agreement can provide how profits and losses are to be shared including if they are to be split differently between the partners. The 1890 Act does not place any restrictions on partners leaving the partnership. Therefore, there is nothing preventing an outgoing partner from working for a competing business or contacting customers, suppliers or employees of the partnership. A Partnership Agreement can place restrictive covenants on outgoing partners to protect the interests of the business of the partnership. The 1890 Act provides that if a partner retires, dies or is made bankrupt then the partnership automatically dissolves. However, a Partnership Agreement can include provisions for when a partner retires or otherwise and provide how that partner\u2019s share of the partnership is to be dealt with. \nHaving a clear agreement in place between partners will help lead your business down a path of success and you can agree your own rules rather than relying on the default rules in the 1890 Act. \nIf you would like us to assist you in preparing a Partnership Agreement please contact Danielle Austin at or 01908 689399.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "danielle austin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:32.062+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d71b6a62286579adb6006dd5cffdf4ac6847ca5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ9OXReQDzxcjvL.fUr.HjSpc1mAy8APYYqhXref2dCynahUgx2r0N..I4wn98E1BXuKFwJg_3fmohOk.5dN0fHhDjIUMuVZYma34vH6GPEjA--", "site_full": "finnewsreview.com", "site": "finnewsreview.com", "site_section": "http://finnewsreview.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Financial News Review", "title": "Digging Deeper into Shares of Ramsay Health Care Ltd (RHC.AX)", "title_full": "Digging Deeper into Shares of Ramsay Health Care Ltd (RHC.AX)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://finnewsreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/imagesjj-300x168.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d71b6a62286579adb6006dd5cffdf4ac6847ca5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ9OXReQDzxcjvL.fUr.HjSpc1mAy8APYYqhXref2dCynahUgx2r0N..I4wn98E1BXuKFwJg_3fmohOk.5dN0fHhDjIUMuVZYma34vH6GPEjA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Financial News Staff", "published": "2017-12-07T11:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "Digging Deeper into Shares of Ramsay Health Care Ltd (RHC.AX)", "text": "Digging Deeper into Shares of Ramsay Health Care Ltd (RHC.AX)   \nShares of Ramsay Health Care Ltd (RHC.AX) touched a high of 70.98 and dipped down to a low of 70.02 before settling at 70.33 in the most recent session. The stock has experienced bearish momentum as it\u2019s ATR or Average True Range has dipped consistently over the past 10 sessions. \nWhen focusing on technical stock analysis, traders and investors may choose to also study the ATR or Average True Range. The present 14-day ATR for Ramsay Health Care Ltd (RHC.AX) is currently standing at 1.09. The ATR basically measures the volatility of a stock on a day-to-day basis. The average true range is typically based on 14 periods and may be calculated daily, weekly, monthly, or intraday. The ATR is not considered a directional indicator, but it may reflect the strength of a particular move. \nCurrently, the 14-day ADX for Ramsay Health Care Ltd (RHC.AX) is sitting at 19.26. Generally speaking, an ADX value from 0-25 would indicate an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would support a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would identify a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would lead to an extremely strong trend. ADX is used to gauge trend strength but not trend direction. Traders often add the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to identify the direction of a trend. \nChecking in on some other technical levels, the 14-day RSI is currently at 67.67, the 7-day stands at 77.74, and the 3-day is sitting at 86.18. Many investors look to the Relative   reading of a particular stock to help identify overbought/oversold conditions. The RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970\u2019s. Wilder laid out the foundation for future technical analysts to further investigate the RSI and its relationship to underlying price movements. Since its inception, RSI has remained very popular with traders and investors. Other technical analysts have built upon the work of Wilder. The 14-day RSI is still a widely popular choice among technical stock analysts. \nInvestors may be watching other technical indicators such as the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. The Williams %R is a momentum indicator that helps measure oversold and overbought levels. This indicator compares the closing price of a stock in relation to the highs and lows over a certain time period. A common look back period is 14 days. Ramsay Health Care Ltd (RHC.AX)\u2019s Williams %R presently stands at -10.03. The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. A reading between 0 and -20 would indicate an overbought situation. A reading from -80 to -100 would indicate an oversold situation. \nTaking a closer look from a technical standpoint, Ramsay Health Care Ltd (RHC.AX) presently   100.48. Typically, the CCI oscillates above and below a zero line. Normal oscillations tend to stay in the range of -100 to +100. A CCI reading of +100 may represent overbought conditions, while readings near -100 may indicate oversold territory. Although the CCI indicator was developed for commodities, it has become a popular tool for equity evaluation as well.

A CCI reading of +100 may represent overbought conditions, while readings near -100 may indicate oversold territory. Although the CCI indicator was developed for commodities, it has become a popular tool for equity evaluation as well. The Relative   is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of stock price movements. The RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder, and it oscillates between 0 and 100. Generally, the RSI is considered to be oversold when it falls below 30 and overbought when it heads above 70. RSI can be used to detect general trends as well as finding divergences and failure swings. The 14-day RSI is currently at 35.35, the 7-day stands at 31.37, and the 3-day is sitting at 26.42. \nTaking a peek at some Moving Averages, the 200-day is at 0.25, and the 50-day is 0.26. Dedicated investors may be looking to employ another tool for doing technical stock analysis. The Williams Percent Range or Williams %R is a technical indicator that was designed to measure overbought and oversold market conditions. The Williams %R indicator helps show the relative situation of the current price close to the period being observed. Coastal Greenland Ltd (1124.HK)\u2019s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R presently is at -80.00. In general, if the reading goes above -20, the stock may be considered to be overbought. Alternately, if the indicator goes under -80, this may show the stock as being oversold.

She won a big round of applause from the audience, most of them Chinese descendants. Happy\u2019s sister Baby Bee, then five years old, did equally well, singing nursery rhymes in Chinese.\n\nWhile it is not uncommon for young Chinese language learners to recite ancient poems, Happy spoke in classical Chinese with a fluency that could make even some native Chinese speakers envious, according to a report in Guangzhou Daily.\n\nAnd recently, during US President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to China, his granddaughter Arabella\u2019s recital of Chinese poems went viral online, making her a \u201cpopular figure\u201d among Chinese audiences.\n\nThere is a long list of foreign celebrities and their children learning Chinese, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\u2019 four children and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his daughter. Even Prince William, media reports say, studied Chinese in school.\n\nThe increasing popularity of the Chinese language has led to the introduction of various programmes and classes worldwide. It is estimated that more than 100 million people outside China, including overseas Chinese, are studying the language, as many believe it can be used as a tool to gain access to conveniences in not only China but also some other countries.\n\nThe growing enthusiasm of people in other countries to learn Chinese can be attributed to their love for Chinese culture.\n\nIt perhaps explains why traditional Chinese cultural elements, from kung fu films to ancient works such as The Analects of Confucius and Sun Tzu\u2019s The Art of War, have won so many global diehard fans. Many foreigners even believe that Chinese characters are an expression of aesthetic appreciation \u2013 maybe that\u2019s why many famous personalities including former soccer star David Beckham have got Chinese characters tattooed on their body.\n\nChina\u2019s economic and social development is another important factor for the growing interest in the language and culture. As the world\u2019s most populous country and the second-largest economy, China for years has accounted for the largest number of students studying in other countries, which might also have made people overseas interested in the language.\n\nAs Jim Rogers said, whether you like or not, the 21st century will belong to China. He always tells people that if they have children, they shall encourage them to learn Chinese, \u201cbecause Chinese will be the most important language\u201d. For foreign companies intending to do business in China, they can have a huge advantage over their competitors if they can master the language.\n\nAnd with the Belt and Road Initiative progressing smoothly, a number of Chinese enterprises will venture into countries along the ancient trade routes for business, which means a higher demand for Chinese speakers. \n\nSource: China Daily/Asia News Network\n\nChina rising, but English is still king   \nAsia News Network and The Star recently published an article \u201cSway of the Chinese language\u201d, detailing the rising popularity of learning Chinese as posted above.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, US President Donald Trump\u2019s granddaughter and billionaire investor Jim Rogers\u2019 daughter are among some of the famous people or their family members brushing up on their Chinese language skills.\n\nTourists from China are splashing their cash all over the world (in some countries such as Thailand and Malaysia, the Chinese can also go cashless by making their purchases through Alipay).\n\nMeanwhile, economists predict that the GDP of China, currently the world\u2019s second largest, would surpass the United States\u2019 within 10 years. As the economic value of the Chinese language grows, it will unseat English to become the world\u2019s leading language. Or so we are told....\n\nBut if history is a clue, this may not happen so soon.\n\nIn the heyday of the Roman Empire, as the great Julius Caesar and his successors conquered the Mediterranean, Latin became the dominant language of the European continent. The Roman Empire began to disintegrate in the fifth century. Latin, however, remained relevant for many centuries to come. (The Eastern Roman Empire, also known as Byzantine Empire, survived into 15th century, but its capital was in Constantinople, and its official language was Greek.)\n\nIn year 1215, the unpopular King John of England, pressured by rebel barons, issued Magna Carta. The document established for the first time the principle that everybody, including the king, was subject to the law. It is considered one of the first steps taken in England towards establishing parliamentary democracy. The Magna Carta was initially written in Latin.\n\nIn year 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published three papers which were collectively known as Principia Mathematica. These works form the foundation of classical mechanics. Principia Mathematica, like the Magna Carta, was written in Latin. That was more than 12 centuries after the demise of the Roman Empire.\n\nIn ancient times, Malay language was the lingua franca of the Malay Archipelago. Then the Western powers came, created the modern states of Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and Indonesia. Post-independence, Javanese, who make up 40% of Indonesia\u2019s population, dominate the republic\u2019s politics and economy. Somehow, Bahasa Indonesia is based on Malay rather than Javanese.\n\nBy 2050, China will become the world\u2019s largest economy. The US will drop to second place. In the third spot, as economists believe, will be India. Like Malaysia, India was a British territory. And like our country, English, the language of the former colonial master, is still widely spoken.\n\nBy mid-century, the combined GDP of English-speaking and English-as-second-language nations, which include US, India, Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia, will likely be larger than that of China.\n\nI do not doubt that Chinese language will get more important every year, and I encourage everyone to learn it if conditions allow. However, it would be foolish if we, in the advent of \u201cChina\u2019s Century\u201d, neglect English.\n\nBy CHEW KHENG SIONG Kuala Lumpur\n\nRelated posts: \n\nChinese are the unsung heroes of South East Asia, Robert Kuok Memoirs https://youtu.be/oU0tz-3Uzeg They are the most amazing economic ants on Earth, \u2018Sugar King\u2019 writes in memoir  Good Chinese ... \nUS has to accept China\u2019s rise: expert said in 7th Xiangshan Security Forum    Singapore warns US on anti-China rhetoric!

the latest session, Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO) moved -0.14%, touching a recent bid of 31.09. Current price levels place the shares above the rising trendline. \nOne of the basic tenets put forth by Charles Dow in the Dow Theory is that security prices do trend. Trends are often measured and identified by \u201ctrendlines.\u201d A trendline is a sloping line that is drawn between two or more prominent points on a chart. Rising trends are defined by a trendline that is drawn between two or more troughs (low points) to identify price support. Falling trend-s are defined by trendlines that are drawn between two or more peaks (high points) to identify price resistance. \nA principle of technical analysis is that once a trend has been formed (two or more peaks/troughs have touched the trendline and reversed direction) it will remain intact until broken. That sounds much more simplistic than it is! The goal is to analyze the current trend using trendlines and then either invest with the current trend until the trendline is broken, or wait for the trendline to be broken and then invest with the new (opposite) trend. \nOne benefit of trendlines is they help distinguish emotional decisions (\u201cI think it\u2019s time to sell\u2026\u201d) from analytical decisions (\u201cI will hold until the current rising trendline is broken\u201d). Another benefit of trendlines is that they almost always keep you on the \u201cright\u201d side of the market. When using trendlines, it\u2019s difficult to hold a security for very long when prices are falling just as it\u2019s hard to be short when prices are rising\u2013either way the trendline will be broken. \nSharp investors may be looking to examine the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. Developed by Larry Williams, this indicator helps spot overbought and oversold market conditions. The Williams %R shows how the current closing price compares to previous highs/lows over a specified period. Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO)\u2019s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R is sitting at -58.91. Typically, if the value heads above -20, the stock may be considered to be overbought. On the flip side, if the indicator goes under -80, this may signal that the stock is oversold. \nAnother technical indicator that might serve as a powerful resource for measuring trend strength is the Average Directional Index or ADX. The ADX was introduced by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970\u2019s and it has stood the test of time. The ADX is typically used in conjunction with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to help spot trend direction as well as trend strength. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO) is noted at 14.51. Many technical analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. \nInvestors may use various technical indicators to help spot trends and buy/sell signals. Presently, Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO)   31.16. The CCI was developed by Donald Lambert. The assumption behind the indicator is that investment instruments move in cycles with highs and lows coming at certain periodic intervals. The original guidelines focused on creating buy/sell signals when the reading moved above +100 or below -100. Traders may also use the reading to identify overbought/oversold conditions. \nTaking a look at other technical levels, the 3-day RSI stands at 48.93, the 7-day sits at 49.16 and the 14-day (most common) is at 48.28. The Relative   is an often employed momentum oscillator that is used to measure the speed and change of stock price movements. When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. This measurement is based on closing prices over a specific period of time. As a momentum oscillator, the RSI operates in a set range. This range falls on a scale between 0 and 100. If the RSI is closer to 100, this may indicate a period of stronger momentum. On the flip side, an RSI near 0 may signal weaker momentum. The RSI was originally created by J. Welles Wilder which was introduced in his 1978 book \u201cNew Concepts in Technical Trading Systems\u201d. \nKeeping an eye on Moving Averages, the 50-day is 31.42, the 200-day is at 29.96, and the 7-day is 31.04 for Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO). Moving averages have the ability to be used as a powerful indicator for technical stock analysis. Following multiple time frames using moving averages can help investors figure out where the stock has been and help determine where it may be possibly going. The simple moving average is a mathematical calculation that takes the average price (mean) for a given amount of time.

This is because you may not have the correct equipment to carryout the task. The only option that you have is to hire a vessel transportation service. This will help you get it transported with ease. Below are tips you should consider when looking for boat transport services.\n\nThe vessel can be your investment, but you need them to be transported at an affordable price. Different firms will have different quotes which you should be aware of. Start by contacting different firms to know the price for the boat to be moved. You should then compare the pricing with the quality of services they offer. Hire one that has quality services being offered at a good price.\n\nLook at the services they have to know if they offer extra services. Those that offer extra services should be given more priority since they deliver the best. Inquire if they have tracking support since you want to track them as they are being moved. They should also wrap the boats before they are transported. This will help protect the vessel from any damages that might be caused in case of weather changes.\n\nTheir internet pages will have full information about the services that you should expect from them. Those that have been recommended and are near your location should be given more priority. This is because such firms are more reliable compared to those that are far. You must also read the testimonials that have been written by previous clients. Ensure the testimonials are positive for you to trust their services.\n\nDo proper preparation for the vessel before the transportation starts. All the items must be secured so as to avoid some mistakes. If you do not prepare it in advance, some of them might get lost, or you will waste their time when they arrive. Ask them to come with their crane if you have not found one.\n\nFor you to understand the services that you are about to receive, you should ask them for their referees. They are the ones to give you testimonials about the services of the organization. You have to chat with them so as to know about the service that you will receive. Those that offer quality services will give you their contacts faster since they believe in their service.\n\nFor you to know if you are dealing with a legal organization, ask them to show you their licenses. They are the ones to prove they have all the requirements to enable them to provide the services. It will also prove they have been allowed to do the job by different states. Those that do not have them should be left out. Possession of insurance will mean they will pay you in case of any damages.\n\nLook at their trailers to know if they suit the type of vessels you have. If you do not have a trailer or it does not meet their requirements, you should find one that has adjustable trailers. There are different types of boats that are of different sizes, ensure they have adjustable trailers to cater for your yacht. Some of them will also build custom cradles that will secure the boat during transportation.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are searching for the facts about boat transport , visit our web pages today.
