The decision was announced the same day bitcoin rose 18.2 percent to cross the $13,000- and then $14,000-per-coin trading milestones for the first time.\n\"These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with bitcoin,\" Valve said in a statement. \"The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of bitcoin itself drops dramatically.\"\nValve began accepting bitcoin on its Steam service in 2016 to accommodate international users who might not have access to traditional payment options. Valve's move was part of a larger acceptance of the digital currency, which is now accepted by more than 100,000 merchants worldwide, including Microsoft, Dish and Overstock.\nBitcoin has also proved popular with currency traders, going on a massive bull run in 2017. On Jan. 1 this year, bitcoin was priced at just under $1,000. On Wednesday, the currency rose $2,170 to $14,095 before settling to $13,696 as of this writing and giving it a market capitalization of $231 billion.\nStill, the cryptocurrency's lack of government backing and regulation has led to volatility. After crossing the $11,000 mark for the first time a week ago, the currency lost 20 percent of its value in one day.\nValve said that volatility can complicate purchases made on Steam, a platform and social network for buying computer games and software.\n\"When checking out on Steam, a customer will transfer x amount of bitcoin for the cost of the game, plus y amount of bitcoin to cover the transaction fee charged by the bitcoin network,\" Valve said. \"The value of bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time, so if the transaction doesn't complete within that window of time, then the amount of bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change.\n\"The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different,\" the game distributor said.\nAs a result, Valve said, support for bitcoin has become \"untenable,\" but it said it might re-evaluate the cryptocurrency's fit into its business at a later date.\nUpdate, 7:45 p.m. PT: Adds bitcoin crossing the $14,000 trading threshold.\niHate : CNET looks at how intolerance is taking over the internet.\nSpecial Reports : CNET's in-depth features in one place.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.coindesk.com/price/", "https://blog.bitpay.com/bitcoin-a-new-global-economy/", "http://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1464096684955433613"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valve", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:53.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "884c986ba71a98031724970d1e5010b8f9a782f8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_YxMZS96Uj43IgBlrEvujYxDDVPOm8DaHlEm.FXxs36GbrLmMlSb5TGkEOQ_cN1gs-", "site_full": "www.funnyjunk.com", "site": "funnyjunk.com", "site_section": "http://funnyjunk.com/rss/latest_funny_pictures.rss", "site_categories": ["entertainment"], "section_title": "FunnyJunk Latest Pictures", "title": "Etching projects", "title_full": "Etching projects", "published": "2017-12-07T03:21:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3997, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "884c986ba71a98031724970d1e5010b8f9a782f8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_YxMZS96Uj43IgBlrEvujYxDDVPOm8DaHlEm.FXxs36GbrLmMlSb5TGkEOQ_cN1gs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T03:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "Etching projects", "text": "Reply 0 (22h ago) [-] Thanks!

I first had some trouble adding data to my JSON object because the data was shown on the last row and not inside the object itself.\nNow ive changed my code but the data does not look like its inside the object itself but im a little bit closer now. This is how my JSON object looks like now:\nJSON:\n{ \"Account2\": [{ \"accountId\": \"17467 \", \"containerId\": \"745****\", }, 3, 3, 4, { \"accountId\": \"17467 \", \"containerId\": \"751****\", }, 1, 1, 2], \"Account 1\": [{ \"accountId\": \"17661 \", \"containerId\": \"748****\", }, 2, 1, 1], \"GTMdocx\": [{ \"accountId\": \"21200 \", \"containerId\": \"803****\", }, 0, 0, 1], \"Account3\": [{ \"accountId\": \"21281 \", \"containerId\": \"803****\", }, 0, 0, 0] }\nAs you can see the object is structured like this:\n1) Accountname\n2) Inside Accountname we have accountId and containerId\n3) at last of one Accountname object we have some numbers(count), the problem is that it looks like this:\nWhat i would want the JSON-object to look like is like this:\n{ \"Account2\": [{ \"accountId\": \"17467 \", \"containerId\": \"745****\", \"tags\": \"3\", \"triggers\": \"3\", \"variables\": \"4\" }, { \"accountId\": \"17467 \", \"containerId\": \"751****\", \"tags\": \"3\", \"triggers\": \"3\", \"variables\": \"4\" }], \"Account 1\": [{ \"accountId\": \"17661 \", \"containerId\": \"748****\", \"tags\": \"2\", \"triggers\": \"1\", \"variables\": \"1\" }], \"GTMdocx\": [{ \"accountId\": \"21200 \", \"containerId\": \"803****\", \"tags\": \"0\", \"triggers\": \"0\", \"variables\": \"1\" }], \"Account3\": [{ \"accountId\": \"21281 \", \"containerId\": \"803****\", \"tags\": \"0\", \"triggers\": \"0\", \"variables\": \"0\" }] }\nYou can see the numbers got a key and then value inside the object.\nThis is my PHP-code:\nstatic public function listAllContainers() { try { //Because some containers might not have live-version $containers[] = array(); foreach (self::listAccounts()->account as $accountKey => $account) { foreach (self::listAccountsContainers($account[\"path\"]) as $account_container) { $containers[$account['name']][] = $account_container; $container_version = self::listAccountsContainersVersion($account_container['path']); $containers[$account['name']][] = count($container_version['tag']); $containers[$account['name']][] = count($container_version['trigger']); $containers[$account['name']][] = count($container_version['variable']); } } $filtered_array = (object)array_filter((array)$containers); // Removes empty object return $filtered_array; } catch (\\Exception $e) { return $e->getCode(); } }\nHope you understand my problem. Not so much experience with Arrays/JSON so maybe my explanation is not so good.

Client went to OCBC ATM to draw.\nThe reason was that 1 year ago when gotten my new house with my wife and I went to Hello Singtel @ comcentre to apply but was rejected due to an internal system issue stating I have outstanding payments???!!!\nIn my whole life I did not have/want any deals with SINGTEL but only with Starhub (no issues) and they accused me that I did sign up at woodlands??? (I stay Chinatown that time).in the end, they realize that the signature differs and giving me and my wife a lot of hassle but to sign up under her name and they promise that they will resolve this issue. No news or anything from Singtel then on. I did not even pursue this anymore.\nTo my utmost disappointment, today with my client they came up with this issue again seeking a $400 security deposit and that's in front of my client which greatly affect my business reputation and beside my credit are \u00c1'ratings - CBS.\n1 year ago I requested to see the contract I signed @ woodlands which I obviously did not!! Singtel brushes off and turn down my request. No compensation no apologies.\nKindly see attached contract & invoice which my NRICS is correct but I did not change my surname or name to YONG HUI HAI. (the staff still ask me did I change my name previously?)\nThis is a serious issue and please look into this matter and revert how Singtel can compensate on the above mentioned.\nI will look forward for your favorable reply!\nRegards,\nAlan Yan mortgage guru\nHP: 9857 6524", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:54.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8565125ddde39e12e5821cfd532da4d8c6d79f5f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm0ZoQXjZm9FhwtUSRe9z32T", "site_full": "www.ooyuz.com", "site": "ooyuz.com", "site_section": "http://www.ooyuz.com/newsanalysis?term=rod smith", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "rod%20smith News Results and Analysis |OOYUZ", "title": "Australia to probe Facebook, Google over media disruption", "title_full": "Australia to probe Facebook, Google over media disruption : Related Articles | OOYUZ", "published": "2017-12-04T00:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.049, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53324, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8565125ddde39e12e5821cfd532da4d8c6d79f5f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm0ZoQXjZm9FhwtUSRe9z32T", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CNBC", "published": "2017-12-04T00:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Australia to probe Facebook, Google over media disruption", "text": "Australia's competition regulator said on Monday it would investigate whether U.S. online giants Facebook and Alphabet's Google had disrupted the news media to the detriment of publishers and consumers.

A house that is recessed and hidden behind the continuous concrete wall. This wall becomes a part of the interior by creating the grey wall through the entire apartment and becomes a limit between common spaces and nature.\nPlan \u00a9 Norbert Tukaj Plan \u00a9 Norbert Tukaj \nBy entering the house you meet all three materials used in the interior: \u201cthe grey\u201d, warm wood texture and \u201cthe white\u201d. \u201cThe grey\u201d becomes a path connecting second floor with the living space while the wood and white surfaces connect you with private areas on the second floor: master bedroom, two children rooms and bathroom. Same rule applies to the living space on the first floor - it feels that concrete wall passes through the interior space while everything else becomes neutral and creates conection between the dweller and the nature. Big windows give a light and shadow play on sunny days and all the secondary functions are hidden in the grey wall: stairs, utility room, second bathroom and kitchen become a part of this as well.\n\u00a9 Norbert Tukaj \nSmall sculptural details come to the interior with gentle touch. Hall mirror welcomes with distorted perspective look that softens lines in the overall design. Handrail creates a light path and almost invisibly touches the floor on the first floor. Mirror column in the living area hides a massive technical structure, but at the same time keeps the sence of a space through the reflections. Intersecting lines in master bathroom creates illusion of bigger space as it is in reality. All the small details create an interior ensemble as the architecture itself creates it in the exterior.\nSection \nBig windows as big paintings enchant the monochromatic tones of the everyday life in the apartment. Day by day it becomes more personal and livelier.\n\n\u00a9 Norbert Tukaj \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ras\u0173", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "norbert tukaj", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "aidas barzda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tomas umbrasas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "vilnius", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lithuania", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:54.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "242da6d2ae9432d2eac3530e66155032e24e2a41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21Qist2B47eyxG5nbjQAjIerXxO5xl_LI8tc1usk8sBV2zKNUeGT2od52ADMxMfN0Ag-", "site_full": "aivanet.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://aivanet.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "AIVAnet", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "242da6d2ae9432d2eac3530e66155032e24e2a41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21Qist2B47eyxG5nbjQAjIerXxO5xl_LI8tc1usk8sBV2zKNUeGT2od52ADMxMfN0Ag-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Yiannis Aidinis (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:54.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a43eecd6b5bc8cc250806b16f62efcb136fd56cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSsFPUFcnbScfAdiqDcFSLKxQFO1KOVxbqfCcpwF9Z4wXsCRgM5.jgHhwDKi.Y3Gza7hdBCJ4rJE1HiTW4YZehuwv6tAvLLhjuuy3PJEugVnOT.YtTYPm1yUdWefWFHZnAPEmddaLlhA2kUSLceMQEHqD.jcWXTc5pHbYWogHPNzA--", "site_full": "www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk", "site": "peterboroughtoday.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/rss/cmlink/1.7339023", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Peterborough Telegraph Sport Feed", "title": "Radic reaches 40 goals in nine games for rampant Rangers", "title_full": "Radic reaches 40 goals in nine games for rampant Rangers", "published": "2017-12-07T11:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_300,f_auto,ar_3:2,c_fill/https://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/webimage/1.8279961.1512640611!/image/image.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 94001, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a43eecd6b5bc8cc250806b16f62efcb136fd56cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSsFPUFcnbScfAdiqDcFSLKxQFO1KOVxbqfCcpwF9Z4wXsCRgM5.jgHhwDKi.Y3Gza7hdBCJ4rJE1HiTW4YZehuwv6tAvLLhjuuy3PJEugVnOT.YtTYPm1yUdWefWFHZnAPEmddaLlhA2kUSLceMQEHqD.jcWXTc5pHbYWogHPNzA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:56:00.000+02:00", "title": "Radic reaches 40 goals in nine games for rampant Rangers", "text": "Ramsey Radic reaches 40 goals in nine games for rampant Rangers Netherton United Wagtails Under 12s are pictured before their 7-1 win against Oundle Town.

We aimed to characterize toxicities observed with palbociclib resulting in dose modifications and prescriber preferences in modifying palbociclib dosage in response to treatment-related toxicities outside the context of a clinical trial.\nMethods We conducted a single institution, retrospective study of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) resulting in modifications in dose and schedule and the methods by which dose modifications occurred in patients with advanced hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer receiving palbociclib and endocrine therapy.\nResults From 2/2015 to 10/2016, 100 patients were identified for inclusion in this study. Treatment with palbociclib and endocrine therapy resulted in dose modifications in 38.0% of patients due to AEs with 18.4% requiring subsequent dose changes. Most palbociclib dose modifications occurred during the first 2 cycles. Grade 3\u20134 neutropenia accounted for 54.8% events of palbociclib dose modification. Most providers (65.8%) dose reduced palbociclib from 125 mg to 100 mg as their preferred method of dose modification, while others dose reduced from 125 mg to 75 mg (10.5%) and altered the schedule to 125 mg every other day (7.9%). A comparable rate of palbociclib dose modifications and subsequent dose changes were identified in an age \u2265 65 subgroup. In this group, dose adjustments were most commonly from grade 3\u20134 neutropenia, occurred mainly during cycle 1, and were most frequently addressed by dose reduction from 125 to 100 mg.\nConclusions Neutropenia remains the predominant cause for palbociclib dose modification and most modifications occur within the first two cycles. Older age (\u2265 65) does not affect palbociclib tolerance. Our findings provide context outside of a clinical trial that inform ongoing studies evaluating the safety and feasibility of palbociclib-based therapies.\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2AAebps", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:54.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "68d2a64dcabe289403edaf845e8aee7e6afb269a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqgAk4LN_6vb9TSb8mCHyw188Wv8mOrTuf1lCTPsunVjA5SOpM26dYQRiqpZlpeGydSI2xEc.jO1TxWxFL0mZiyuN1bv6zEF14", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/politics/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Politics links", "title": "(9830007) Sen.

Presented in a bespoke, traditional Italian Big Top tent, the show is emceed by the vivacious Lilian Khumalo as Mama Circus, supported by singer Ziyanda Yako, the hilarious strong man Gilberto Salgueiro Filho and his comical sidekick, Jonathan De Lima Sbano. A stellar cast include Londiwe Dhlomo-Dlamini who just returned from a tour through Asia of Priscilla Queen of the Desert, Gilberto Salguiero Filho, a fifth-generation circus artist from Brazil, Producer, Richard Griffin, describes the production as an inspirational story for children that parents will find impossible to resist. \n Explaining the motivation behind the magic, he says: \u201cAfter adopting my two boys, I wanted to work on a project that has real meaning; to produce a creative body of work that could stand alone, make a statement and be thoroughly entertaining for young and old alike. \u201cAnd in doing so, it was equally important to break from the traditional format and take the local cirque industry one step closer to animal-free entertainment. Griffin has always been a firm proponent for corporate social investment and is therefore thrilled to be joining forces with the Peermont group which has a strong CSI commitment. \u201cIt was also essential that this new creative would allow us to not only inspire our audiences but to also reach the communities in which we thrive, with a special focus on the children who embody our future.\u201d  \nTickets to The Story of the Moon are R140 per person. Please visit www.grifizzi.com for show times and to book tickets.

Josie Knight finished 12th. \nSpalding-based Harrier Grace Mullins was delighted to finish as sixth senior woman.

Brill has a fine role model in older sister Flo who has been starring for the club for several years. \nHarry Hewitt came in sixth with Kyle Warner completing the scorers. The boys secured second place behind Derby AC reflecting the current league standings. \nAaron Hunt led the Nene Valley charge at Under 17 level with a seventh-place finish, helping his team to fourth, one position below their overall league placing. \nThe Under 15 boys race saw Sam Oakley in 13th and Harvey Hancock in 19th to help Nene Valley finish fifth in a closely fought contest. \nFelix Bowling made light work of the thick mud coming home 15th for the Under 11 boys. \nPeterborough AC again highlighted their strength in the senior men\u2019s race coming in third and retaining second place in the league. \nWith times almost meaningless in the Derbyshire mud, Steve Robinson\u2019s ninth place finish in 35:38 and Shaun Walton 35:52 for 12th position over the 10km circuit were particularly impressive. \nKirk Brawn (25th), Simon Fell (27th) and Nick Stone in (34th) completed the scoring team, \nNene Valley were led home by Mike Chapman, who took 57th place. \nElsewhere for PAC, Jacob Fox finished 20th in the Under 17 boys, Joshua Armstrong was 32nd in the Under 15 boys and Joshua Hill 37th in the Under 11 boys.

Vermeer came off his line fast to deny Dries Mertens in the 18th minute and Renato Tapia made a good sliding challenge barely a minute later as Jose Callejon looked set to poke the ball into an empty net.\nVan Bronckhorst's team was less composed near the Napoli goal until the 33rd when Jorgensen rose between three Napoli defenders to head home a Steven Berghuis cross from the right.\nFeyenoord played the closing minutes with 10 men after Tonny Vilhena was sent off for his second yellow card and with visibility reduced by smoke from flares lit up by fans at De Kuip Stadium.\nThe home team pressed despite being a man down, and St. Juste crowned Feyenoord's best European performance of the season with a headed goal a minute into injury time.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steven berghuis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vermeer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicolai jorgensen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyrell malacia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "piotr zielinski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jose callejon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maurizio sarri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amadou diawara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenneth vermeer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jorgensen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shakhtar donestsk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeremiah st. juste", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dejong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tonny vilhena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giovanni van bronckhorst", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "van bronckhorst", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "renato tapia", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cl associated press", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "feyenoord", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "napoli", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dries mertens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press napoli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press feyenoord", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europa league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. juste", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "de kuip stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rotterdam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "napoli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rotterdam", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:55.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6b7a2ffe2b66537888c548942c9f22ae9c6fd2f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQxAowcXMgavRxa7w0ltjkoQvnIdjjZgrjZ65Jq1Z02n_pu4_70qlQFzzywvne9IRQ49uqbZRMbWioOc5F7KWChPnceaCaqwM6Bo6iCZcLdKg--", "site_full": "mcallen.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://mcallen.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist mcallen | for sale search", "title": "17s Ford F150 Gray Wheels 6 Lugs (Mission) $100", "title_full": "17s Ford F150 Gray Wheels 6 Lugs (Mission) $100", "published": "2017-12-07T10:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_aiN00AnZbZV_600x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6b7a2ffe2b66537888c548942c9f22ae9c6fd2f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQxAowcXMgavRxa7w0ltjkoQvnIdjjZgrjZ65Jq1Z02n_pu4_70qlQFzzywvne9IRQ49uqbZRMbWioOc5F7KWChPnceaCaqwM6Bo6iCZcLdKg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "17s Ford F150 Gray Wheels 6 Lugs (Mission) $100", "text": "QR Code Link to This Post Selling set of 4 rims 6 lugs Fit F150 and Expedition $100, interested contact at show contact info do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers post id: 6387497230", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ford", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:55.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e2f0cf569730659a2ca7e60735085d451f94fcdb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzuW0Up1GA78hY1rCz1aAuFGOtfAfBB.ZmRGN5T3PMRVE7Jw4r0njq9UuIjHlI4IKuPQqDNimrz1pgeEbcG2jJ3IOUe6B4BqPl2vWvmATAMws0f78j_ElORRnXxAtHphig-", "site_full": "forums.hardwarezone.com.sg", "site": "hardwarezone.com.sg", "site_section": "http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/makan-zone-117/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "The \"Makan\" Zone - www.hardwarezone.com.sg", "title": "Which is the best Dim Sum restaurant in Singapore?

The digital model is designed to encourage more Fijians to actively save for retirement and to remove the hassle of lining up at a FNPF branch and to provide a means for rural Fijians to make contributions and secure their future.\n\n\u201cThis product makes it possible for people in the informal economy to save money towards their retirement. The amount saved becomes their income once they are too old to work or if they become unfit due to old age, illness or injury, or can be used to support their families after the death of the member\u201d\n\n\u201cOften people in the informal sector are financially excluded and therefore vulnerable and subject to neglect if family members are unable to care for them,\u201d said Krishnan Narasimhan, PFIP Deputy Programme Manager.\n\nFNPF\u2019s Chief Operations Manager Jioji Koroi said \u201cWe are excited to embark on this project with PFIP and Vodafone, aimed at helping the most vulnerable Fijians to live out their twilight years with dignity, security and independence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe project team will be learning from registrants to make sure that the scheme is tailored to the needs of the informal sector with regards to payments flexibility and are also exploring other possible partners (distribution/collection agents) to make it simple to regularly contribute to retirement savings,\u201d he added.\n\nVodafone Fiji Head of E-Commerce and Corporate Affairs Shailendra Prasad said, \u201cWe are delighted to offer a highly accessible and convenient mobile payment channel to make voluntary FNPF contributions a reality. Mobile phone based payment systems are helping achieve greater financial inclusion around the world particularly for the vulnerable and women in unprecedented ways. We are therefore excited to be the first to offer this facility to our customers to make voluntary contributions to their FNPF superannuation account. This will help them secure their future to still be able to live a decent and respectable life after retirement through a secure pension fund.\n\nThe service offers a convenient payment option for labourers, market vendors and those who may be self-employed such as those in the agriculture sector to register and start saving for their old age through an FNPF account. Registered M-PAISA users can dial *567# to access the service on their Vodafone and Inkk mobile.\n\nOver the next six \u2013 nine months, FNPF will be testing the product with at least 500 new registrants from the informal sector. During this period, they will be monitoring whether the registrants will continue to save at regular intervals and will study and analyze their behaviours, attitudes and motivation to do so.\n\nLast year, PFIP funded a feasibility study which was undertaken by a Netherlands-based micro pensions consultant specialised in pension research on the viability of a voluntary scheme in the Solomon Islands and Fiji.\n\nIn Fiji, the research found that demand for a product was strong, with more than 72% of the target group respondents planning to rely on their own savings to provide for old age income, and more than three-quarters of the respondents interested in a pension product that enabled them to save for retirement but also allowed withdrawals during times of emergency.\n\nWhile the FNPF voluntary product has been available since 1985, only six percent of Fijians in the informal sector (7,000 people) save recurrently with the scheme. It is hoped that the new digital channel will increase the percentage of those saving regular.\n\nPFIP is also assisting the Solomon Islands National Provident Fund with new digital channels for pension contributions.\n\nHow does voluntary product work?\n\nThe product consists of two separate savings accounts. Every time a client saves money, these savings are split between the two accounts: General Account (30%) and Pension account (70%).\n\nUnder the general account, the client can withdraw money for emergencies as listed under FNPF rules while the pension account only becomes available at age of retirement (55) or in the case of disability. In case of early death, the funds in both accounts are transferred to the beneficiaries of the account holder.\n\nThe account does not charge any account fees and earns an attractive interest rate, with rates in recent years of approximately 6%, meaning that the account holder accumulates more savings over the long haul.\n\nUnlike a traditional account (requiring mandatory periodic payments), the voluntary account is flexible and allows account holders to save into the account whenever they can.\n\nAt age of retirement, account holders can receive a lump sum payment or opt for monthly payments till their savings are used up.\n\nAbout PFIP\n\nPFIP is a Pacific-wide programme that has helped over 16 million low-income Pacific islanders gain access to financial services and financial education.

The sting, which showed them taking cash for raising questions in Parliament, came to be known as the cash-for-query scam. \nIn December 2005, the Lok Sabha had expelled 10 members, while Lodha was removed from the Rajya Sabha. The prosecution had relied upon the CDs/DVDs containing conversations among the accused and others. \nThe court also framed charges against Rampal\u2019s then PA, Ravinder Kumar, special public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava said. \nThe proceedings against one of an accused, Vijay Phogat, have been abated as he has passed away. Phogat was alleged to be a middleman. \nThe court framed charges against the accused for the offences of criminal conspiracy under the IPC and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. \nIt had on August 10 ordered framing of charges against them but could not frame charges due to repeated non-appearance of the accused who repeatedly sought exemption from appearance. \nThe charge sheet was filed by the Delhi Police in 2009. \nBesides the ex-Parliamentarians, two journalists were also charge-sheeted for allegedly abetting the offence under the anti-graft law and were summoned by the trial court. But the proceedings against them were quashed by the Delhi High Court. \nPTI", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kiran bansal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ravinder kumar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pradeep gandhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narender kumar kushwaha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manoj kumar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lal chandra kol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahajan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chhatarpal singh lodha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rampal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raja rampal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vijay phogat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ram sewak singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chandra pratap singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atul shrivastava", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phogat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suresh chandel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lodha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anna saheb m k patil", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delhi high court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delhi police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ipc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajya sabha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lok sabha", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:56.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9043d0130ac1c5678cae03660e56fcca5a52e175", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_f.vrR0lnROWjYmaxKpXA_oJsy06NUqWJ3FixknpxAp6JcbKOprlP_bOkhoSFHUm5hPFShWJquXlk5mkN31AN9K3O9TStqNUJP.WWvZyeO0Bod0B2q_Io2N9WSMrGa2gRLBug8pFjMHw--", "site_full": "www.telegram.com", "site": "telegram.com", "site_section": "http://www.telegram.com/living/entertainment?template=rss&mime=xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Entertainment - telegram.com", "title": "'A Taffeta Christmas' at Calliope Dec. 8-10 - Entertainment & Life", "title_full": "'A Taffeta Christmas' at Calliope Dec. 8-10 - Entertainment & Life - telegram.com - Worcester, MA", "published": "2017-12-07T13:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.telegram.com/storyimage/WT/20171207/ENTERTAINMENTLIFE/171209660/AR/0/AR-171209660.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31582, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9043d0130ac1c5678cae03660e56fcca5a52e175", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_f.vrR0lnROWjYmaxKpXA_oJsy06NUqWJ3FixknpxAp6JcbKOprlP_bOkhoSFHUm5hPFShWJquXlk5mkN31AN9K3O9TStqNUJP.WWvZyeO0Bod0B2q_Io2N9WSMrGa2gRLBug8pFjMHw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "telegram.com", "published": "2017-12-07T13:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "'A Taffeta Christmas' at Calliope Dec. 8-10 - Entertainment & Life", "text": "'A Taffeta Christmas' at Calliope Dec. 8-10 Thursday Dec 7, 2017 at 6:00 AM \n\nCalliope Productions rings in the Christmas holiday season with \"A Taffeta Christmas,\" a musical revue of pop songs and holiday favorites from the 1950s sung by the \"Taffetas\" \u2014 a quartet of \"sisters\" performing close-harmony numbers in the style of the Andrews and McGuire sisters.\n \nWhat: \"A Taffeta Christmas\"\nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Dec. 8, 2 and 7:30 p.m. Dec. 9, and 2 p.m. Dec. 10\nWhere: Calliope Theatre, 150 Main St., Boylston\nHow much: $20; $17 for seniors and students.

Texas Helldriver,\nThere is actually another method that Ive seen done to install sling swivels on a 95 rifle that I suppose you could say was a \"vintage\" method. But one would still have to drill butstock for the rear swivel.\nIf you could get to an older gun shop and see of they might let you look thru an old box of swivels, find you an old set of non-QD's like used to come on bolt action rifles in the old days. The front swivel is generally a 10 x 32 thread. The thread on the forearm screw on a 95 is the same. I had an old 95 with a front swivel screwed into that forearm screw hole. And its not all that invasive to the front of your rifle. Remove it if and when you wanted and screw the old forearm screw back in. But like I said you'd still have to drill hole in buttstock for that swivel.\nLemme see if I can find a pic of what I'm explaining.\nEdit! Here's a pic.\nYou may have to cut down a bit of the thread to get it to right length! But this does work. This is the 95 my son has now.\nLast edited by kaywoodie; Yesterday at 05:20 PM .

Have your say \nNorthants A are making the early running in the southern section in their bid to reach the English Bowling Federation\u2019s Derbyshire Trophy indoor inter-county championship final for only the third time. \nThey made it two wins out of two by taking the maximum 14 points from their 105-85 victory over last season\u2019s beaten finalists Hunts at Stamford. \nNorthants, with Tristan Morton still an absentee through injury, were two shots down at the 15 end stage, but asserted their authority over the last 10 ends. \nWhile the rink of Brian Martin, Neil Wright and late replacement Roger Martin took command over Lindsey Swannell\u2019s trio after dropping a maximum six on the second end, a run of 11 shots in four ends put Tony Scarr\u2019s rink of Howard Shipp and Adam Warrington 19-15 ahead from which they never relented. \nStephen Harris, Bob Warters and Martyn Dolby were getting little change out of Richard Stevens\u2019 trio as they slumped to a 5-14 deficit, but a switch in formation at the halfway stage resulted in a sequence of 15 shots over the last six ends to win 29-21. \nIt was left to Paul Dalliday, Phil Afford and Simon Law to mop up the maximum points against Tom Swannell\u2019s rink. With the scores level playing the last end, Law fashioned a slightly fortunate deflection to pinch the shot and record a 25-24 victory. \nMeanwhile, Northants B slipped to a third consecutive defeat, this one at the hands of Lincolnshire who powered to a 119-75 victory at Peterborough & District to claim the maximum 14 points. \nMick Humphreys, Jon Earl and John Holroyd put up the most stubborn resistance in a 22-25 defeat, claiming seven shots over the last three ends. \nThe new combination of Steve Roden, Graham Agger and Mick Linnell led 16-15 at 19 ends, but eventually lost by five to Trevor Bannister\u2019s trio who picked up eight shots late on. \nPeter Brown\u2019s trio of Cliff Watson and Dick Noble lost 11-34 to former world indoor champion Billy Jackson, who gave a masterclass in draw and conversion shots, while Rod Maplethorpe\u2019s rink of Brian Bassam and Mick Greaves lost early momentum and went down by 13 shots in a closing barrage. \nRESULTS \nNorthants A 105 (14), Hunts 85 (0) \u2013 (Northants A rinks only): \nPaul Dalliday, Phil Afford, Simon Law won 25-24; Stephen Harris, Bob Warters, Martyn Dolby won 29-21; Howard Shipp, Adam Warrington, Tony Scarr won 25-23; Brian Martin, Neil Wright, Roger Martin won 26-17. \nNorthants B 75 (0), Lincs 119 (14) \u2013 (Northants B rinks only): \nSteve Roden, Graham Agger, Mick Linnell lost 18-23; Brian Bassam, Mick Greaves, Rod Maplethorpe lost 24-27; Mick Humphreys, Jon Earl, John Holroyd lost 22-25; Cliff Watson, Dick Noble, Peter Brown lost 11-34. \nIt was a mixed week for the Peterborough & District men\u2019s senior team with a 52-62 defeat at the hands of Cambridge Chesterton A in the opening round of the KO Cup followed by a comprehensive 108-38 victory away to March B in the Cambs League. \nIn the cup match, both home rinks were held to draws, putting the pressure on the away rinks, but while they won on one of them the defeat on the other left them 10 shots adrift. \nLEAGUE RESULT \nPeterborough & District 108 (10), March B 38 (0) \u2013 (Peterborough rinks only): \nMick Fuller, Norman Gray, Ean Eagle, Ray Keating won 32-9. \nDick Overson, John Barker, Graham Jackson, Phil Afford won 28-9. \nJoe Martin, Jeff Clipston, Mick Greaves, Dick Noble won 24-8. \nTerry Corney, Steve Johnson, Terry English, Rod Maplethorpe won 24-12. \nn The Peterborough League AGM is tonight (7.30pm) at the Peterborough & District club.

This will help the Country to create substantial employment but at the same time put its imprint into new areas of exports.\nThe new Agricultural Export Policy to provide the stable and open exports for long term is the need of the hour said FIEO Chief . India should take a lead in organic exports and encourage States to get them certified as organic as has been done by Sikkim already.\nMr Gupta said that procedural simplification to replace IEC by PAN ; increase in the validity of the scrips from 18th months to 24 months; reintroduction of ARO facility for supply against Advance Authorization / EPCG / EOU; relaxation in export of free of cost samples from 1% to 2% of average exports in preceding 3 years with a ceiling of Rs.2 crore would also mitigate the hardship of the exporters and hassles related to its compliances.\nFIEO, however, suggested that Government should gradually extend the MEIS to other sectors of exports since they are also facing numerous challenges in exports. A one-time relaxation to meet Export Obligation may be provided to the industry so that they can escape the penal provisions, which will be disruptive and will provide an opportunity to add to exports besides providing employment.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shri ganesh kumar gupta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "presi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gupta", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fieo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mid-term", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of commerce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "advance authorization / epcg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "logistics division", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national logistics information portal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sikkim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:57.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a1b5d5ca6eeccbd8c6d17c865d72ad0e5be370e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw37pM0ts6wjUDYlgl5D4Rshneb15Be3GzI.1aoqZd_NWt9lIhEWm9RHOX_W0oEykuq9iy3vAtzyT9MquhJMPCDnkgIcdqOMt2M21nXmt044Cg.1p29E4919kWpWn7YIsSogNEDwzMRg--", "site_full": "www.gumtree.ie", "site": "gumtree.ie", "site_section": "https://www.gumtree.ie/s-leinster/jobs/v1l2q0p1", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Jobs in Leinster | Gumtree Classifieds Ireland", "title": "Plumber (Subcontractor) 217379362", "title_full": "Plumber (Subcontractor) | Dublin | Gumtree Classifieds Ireland | 217379362", "published": "2017-12-07T11:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "https://securet9.classistatic.com/1.1.451/images/en_IE/logoOpenGraph.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 62533, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a1b5d5ca6eeccbd8c6d17c865d72ad0e5be370e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw37pM0ts6wjUDYlgl5D4Rshneb15Be3GzI.1aoqZd_NWt9lIhEWm9RHOX_W0oEykuq9iy3vAtzyT9MquhJMPCDnkgIcdqOMt2M21nXmt044Cg.1p29E4919kWpWn7YIsSogNEDwzMRg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "gumtree.ie", "published": "2017-12-07T11:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "Plumber (Subcontractor) 217379362", "text": "Plumber (Subcontractor)\nWe require domestic plumbing subcontractors for gas/oil system installations in the Dublin Area.
