Through the first 10 months of the year, pork exports increased 8 percent in volume (2.005 million mt) and 10 percent in value ($5.28 billion) from the same period last year. \nExports accounted for 25.4 percent of total pork production in October (steady with last year) and 21.6 percent for muscle cuts only (up slightly from a year ago). For January through October, these ratios increased about one percentage point from a year ago to 26.4 percent of total production and 22 percent for muscle cuts. October export value averaged $51.41 per head slaughtered, up 9 percent from a year ago and the highest since July. Through the first 10 months of the year, per-head export value was $52.64, up 7 percent. \nBeef exports reached 111,287 mt in October, up 5 percent from a year ago, valued at $662 million, up 18 percent. These were the second-largest monthly totals of 2017, trailing only August. For January through October, exports totaled 1.038 million mt, up 9 percent year-over-year, valued at $5.93 billion \u2013 up 16 percent from a year ago and slightly ahead of the record value pace established in 2014. \nBeef exports accounted for 13 percent of total production in October, the highest since July but down from 13.9 percent last year. The percentage of muscle cuts exported was steady with last year at 10.7 percent. For January through October, beef exports accounted for 12.8 percent of total production (down from 13.3 percent last year) and 10.2 percent for muscle cuts (steady with last year). \nOctober beef export value averaged $301.88 per head of fed slaughter, up 12 percent from a year ago and the highest since December 2016. January-October export value averaged $279.85 per head, up 10 percent. \nPork exports rebound to Mexico, Japan; record month for South America \nFollowing a modest slowdown in September, pork exports to leading volume market Mexico regained momentum at 69,529 mt, up 7 percent from a year ago, valued at $129.8 million (up 13 percent). Through October, exports to Mexico are well-positioned for a sixth consecutive annual volume record at 655,527 mt (up 14 percent) valued at $1.24 billion (up 17 percent). \nMexico is an especially important destination for U.S. hams, and consumption growth in Mexico has been critically supportive of ham prices in this time of record U.S. pork production, explained USMEF President and CEO Dan Halstrom. \n\u201cAlthough ham prices are currently below last year\u2019s level, they have been up an average of 2 percent in 2017 and predictions of ham prices plummeting have not come true,\u201d he said. \u201cStrong demand in Mexico is absolutely a key reason for this. USMEF has focused on expanding per-capita pork consumption in Mexico, which is up by about one-third in the past 10 years. This has helped make Mexico an even more critical and more reliable trading partner for the U.S. pork industry.\u201d \nExports to leading value market Japan also trended upward in October, increasing 5 percent from a year ago in both volume (32,475 mt) and value ($134.5 million). January-October exports to Japan were 322,422 mt (up 1 percent) valued at $1.33 billion (up 3 percent). This included 176,609 mt of chilled pork valued at $834 million, down 2 percent in volume but 2 percent higher in value than a year ago. \nLed by Colombia and Chile, October pork exports to South America reached a record 12,624 mt (up 31 percent from a year ago) valued at $32.3 million (up 29 percent). Through October, exports to South America were 78 percent ahead of last year\u2019s pace in both volume (85,175 mt) and value ($218.8 million), already surpassing the previous records set in 2014. Export volumes to Colombia and Chile have also exceeded previous highs reached in 2014 and 2013, respectively. \nOther January-October results for U.S. pork exports include: Having gained further momentum in October, exports to South Korea have already exceeded their full-year 2016 totals in both volume (136,041 mt) and value ($372.7 million). Compared to the first 10 months of last year, exports were up 27 percent and 30 percent, respectively. Led by mainstay markets Honduras and Guatemala, exports to Central America are on a record pace, totaling 56,906 mt (up 7 percent year-over-year) valued at $138.4 million (up 9 percent). Exports also increased substantially to El Salvador and Nicaragua, and edged slightly higher to Costa Rica. Exports are also on a record pace to the Dominican Republic \u2013 up 26 percent year-over-year in volume (26,476 mt) and 32 percent in value ($60.6 million). Despite trending lower in October, pork exports to the ASEAN region were still 16 percent ahead of last year\u2019s pace in volume (39,910 mt) and 31 percent higher in value ($109.2 million), led by strong performances in the Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam. October exports to China/Hong Kong were below last year\u2019s volume but steady in value, reflecting the upward trajectory of China\u2019s domestic pork production. Through October, exports to the region dropped 8 percent from a year ago in volume (413,032 mt) but were just 1 percent lower in value ($872.8 million) as continued strong demand for variety meat largely offset the slowdown in muscle cut exports. \nJapan, Korea, Hong Kong drive outstanding beef export value growth \nJapan continued to be the pacesetter for U.S. beef exports in October, with volume climbing 19 percent from a year ago to 23,981 mt and value up 23 percent to $147.1 million. This pushed January-October volume to 260,517 mt (up 22 percent) valued at $1.59 billion \u2013 up 29 percent and already setting a new single-year record. Chilled beef continues to drive export growth to Japan, with chilled exports up 40 percent in volume (124,699 mt) and 43 percent in value ($918.8 million) \n\u201cThe U.S. beef industry has really broadened its reach in Japan, expanding the range of cuts offered and the retail and foodservice venues in which they are featured,\u201d Halstrom said. \u201cBut USMEF remains concerned about market access barriers in Japan, as we face significantly higher tariffs than our main competitor, Australia, and import safeguards that could hinder further growth.\u201d \nExports to South Korea continued to climb in October, up 2 percent in volume (17,224 mt) and 24 percent in value ($122.4 million) from a year ago. Through October, exports totaled 148,998 mt (up 7 percent) valued at $979.3 million \u2013 20 percent above last year\u2019s record pace. Demand for U.S. chilled beef is especially strong in Korea\u2019s retail sector, with chilled beef exports up 88 percent to 36,773 mt valued at $329 million, up 93 percent. \nOther January-October highlights for U.S. beef exports include: Despite a slow start in 2017, exports to Hong Kong climbed 12 percent from a year ago in volume (97,334 mt) and 23 percent higher in value ($646.1 million). Since the mid-June market reopening, exports to China have totaled 1,570 mt valued at $17.2 million. While beef exports to Taiwan slowed in October, January-October results remained 4 percent ahead of last year\u2019s pace at 36,719 mt, valued at $335.6 million (up 18 percent). With a strong finish, Taiwan will easily top last year\u2019s value record of $362.8 million. Led by strong increases in Indonesia and Vietnam, beef exports to the ASEAN region increased 57 percent in volume (34,777 mt) and 46 percent in value ($173.5 million). Exports were also higher year-over-year to the Philippines. A bounceback year in Peru and strong demand in Chile and Colombia have beef exports to South America on a record pace. Exports increased 27 percent from a year ago in volume (24,236 mt) and 23 percent in value ($93.3 million). Beef exports within North America have remained solid in 2017, with shipments to Mexico increasing slightly from last year in both volume (196,604 mt) and value ($813.3 million). Exports to Canada increased 4 percent in volume (96,401 mt) and 7 percent in value ($667 million). \nLamb exports lower in October \nOctober exports of U.S. lamb were 560 mt, down 7 percent from a year ago, and value slipped 6 percent to $1.32 million. For the first 10 months of the year, exports declined 14 percent in volume (6,139 mt) but increased 8 percent in value to just under $16 million. The volume decline is due to slow demand for lamb variety meat, as muscle cut exports through October were up 15 percent in volume (1,913 mt) and 20 percent in value ($11.38 million). Muscle cut exports have increased year-over-year to leading markets Mexico, the Caribbean and Canada, while also showing promising growth in Central America and Taiwan. \nComplete January-October export results for U.S. beef, pork and lamb are available from USMEF\u2019s statistics web page . \nMonthly charts for U.S. pork and beef exports are also available online . NOTES: Export statistics refer to both muscle cuts and variety meat, unless otherwise noted. One metric ton (mt) = 2,204.622 pounds. \u00a9 2017 Nebraska Rural Radio Association. All rights reserved.

She is such a happy girl with an amazing smile as you can see from her photos. \nBeauty had 8 puppies. 4 have already been offered homes here in the UK and we wish to find loving forever homes for the remaining 4. Beauty was abandoned heavily pregnant. Luckily for Beauty and her puppies they have been rescued by D.O.G Rescue Cyprus and are in a fantastic foster home in Cyprus whilst we find them their forever homes in the UK. \nThey will be able to fly when the puppies reach 15 weeks old. The puppies, Tansy, Tilly and Morgan (all female) and Scooby (male), have adorable round puppy tummies, soft fur, are playful, loving and just simply delicious. Whilst we don\u2019t know exactly what breeds they comprise of, we think they are part Kokoni Terrier as their mum, Beauty has the Kokoni traits. Of course the father is unknown. The Kokoni is a Greek dog and \u201cKokoni\u201d means \u201csmall dog\u201d in Greek. \nKokoni love human interaction and are fearless despite their small size. The breed is alert, lively, cheerful, smart and loyal. They are great companion dogs. Kokoni love to run and play, but with the proper amount of exercise can adjust to a small household and pretty much to your lifestyle. Beauty and her puppies are all super, cute, friendly dogs. Just like any puppy they are inquisitive and boisterous. They will require support, guidance and training to help them develop into the dogs you want them to be. Luckily being in a foster home means they are already learning manners and hove to behave in a home. \nWe hope to find a family for each of them, who will open their heart and home to allow them to grow into the wonderful family pets they have the potential to be. They would do well with another dog in the household to help them learn the ropes or as an only dog providing you can devote time to support them. They are all happy living with cats too. We would always recommend any dog or puppy should be fully supervised if with children. They will be vaccinated. Prior to their flights to the UK they will receive the vet preparation required, be microchipped and have their entry passports prepared.

Delhi's Jama Masjid was originally Jamuna Devi temple, similarly Taj Mahal was Tejo Mahalaya.\"\"Our religious places were targeted by Muslim but we have asked Ram Janambhumi, Baba Biswanath mandir in Kashi and Krishna janambhumi in Mathura.

If congress continues their efforts to build a mosque then we would charge to other 6000 places of religious importance,\" said Katiyar.Sibal on Tuesday demanded for the next hearing in the case to be held only in July 2019 after the completion of the next Lok Sabha polls, citing political ramifications.

He will be presented with the award on Thursday at the Home Depot College Football Awards show in Atlanta, which will air live on ESPN at 6 p.m. (Central). Frost was selected as the winner after leading Central Florida to a 12-0 record and an American Athletic Conference championship as the only undefeated FBS team in 2017. He accepted the Nebraska coaching job on Dec. 2, but will coach the 10th-ranked Knights in the Peach Bowl on Jan. 1 against No. 7 Auburn. In its 24-year history, the 42-year old Frost is the fourth-youngest coach to win the Home Depot Coach of the Year Award. Frost is also one of five coaches to earn the honor in either their first or second year as a collegiate head coach, a group that includes Nebraska\u2019s Frank Solich, the 1999 winner. Frost compiled an 18-7 record in two seasons at UCF after inheriting an 0-12 team. According to ESPN, UCF is the only team in FBS history to go from a winless regular season to an undefeated one in a span of just two seasons. In 2017, UCF matched its highest win total in program history while posting the first perfect regular season in the history of the American Athletic Conference. The Knights also achieved the highest in-season ranking in program history (No. 10) and established a school record with a 12-game winning streak. UCF won its 12 games by an average of more than 24 points per game and picked up three victories over teams currently ranked in the AP poll. With Frost calling the plays, UCF boasted one of the nation\u2019s top offenses, as the Knights led the country in scoring (49.4 points per game) and ranked fifth in total offense (540.4 yards per game). Sophomore quarterback McKenzie Milton was honored as the 2017 American Athletic Conference Player of the Year, while a league-record 16 Knights earned All-AAC accolades. The Home Depot Coach of the Year award is the latest in a slew of coaching honors for Frost, the unanimous winner of the 2017 American Athletic Conference Coach of the Year. He is also a 2017 Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year Finalist and was the Region 1 American Football Coaches Association Coach of the Year. Frost is also a semifinalist for the George Munger Award for the second straight season. He joins Alabama\u2019s Nick Saban and Wisconsin\u2019s Paul Chryst as the only two coaches to be a semifinalist for the Munger Award in both 2016 and 2017. \u00a9 2017 Nebraska Rural Radio Association.

Never before has this happened,\u201d Rapaport told reporters.\nThe gem was unearthed in March in Sierra Leone\u2019s eastern Kono region by a Christian pastor who gave it to the government to handle the sale. It was the government\u2019s second attempt to sell the diamond after it rejected the highest bid of $7.8 million at an initial auction in the capital Freetown in May.\nAhead of Monday\u2019s auction the diamond was shown to some 70 potential buyers and received seven bids, Rapaport said.\n\u201cWe showed the diamond everywhere. We did whatever we could and that\u2019s the best price that we can get from the market today,\u201d he added.\nThe United Nations lifted a ban on diamond exports from Sierra Leone in 2003, though the $113 million sector is plagued by smuggling.\nDiamonds fueled a decade-long civil war in Sierra Leone, ending in 2002, in which rebels forced civilians to mine the stones and bought weapons with the proceeds, leading to the term \u201cblood diamonds.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rapaport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin rapaport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laurence graff", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sierra leone", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rapaport group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "freetown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sierra leone", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:57.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0dd7fa60a26fc90f4c5b34e57d7dce50f3ceeaab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYC0LVt_uHgOI8PTEt4cBzpj", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp; Finance - 4chan", "title": "pphffffu phfff pppphhh", "title_full": "/biz/ - pphffffu phfff pppphhh - Business & Finance - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T11:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 50, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.11, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "70640425a92cea4d2815031a493be515eef4034a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYC0LVt_uHgOI8D3jF4SChwRCCgpfGWU8UM-", "ord_in_thread": 32, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T12:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>4842283\nold but gold", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:36:57.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2471f13986335c5564ed0c7466c50434a363c760", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf7.So8NIENUO5iMX_ruzRhGbFOx2PPrK_cW4mpJn01NKN.uaKtKsyUdjeWkA2B2Q6e5f.fiyaxnTnvhgiVX6oXG", "site_full": "www.expedia.se", "site": "expedia.se", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.se/Alla-Hotell-I-Toronto.d178314.Reseguide-Stad-Alla-Hotell", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Alla hotell i Toronto", "title": "Comfort Hotel Airport North", "title_full": "Comfort Hotel Airport North (Toronto, Kanada) | Expedia.se", "published": "2017-08-17T03:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 96941, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "034dfec939299d5c66cecd87e9322aec6a323262", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZys06Uc2n8GltaC1gZ1pf7.So8NIENUO5iMX_ruzRhGbFOx2PPrK_cW4mpJn01NKN.uaKtKsyUdjeWkA2B2Q6e5f.fiyaxnTuJbB32Y53AwLTtftP9iopIapSfvv0LZ367Ig90zjaUH", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-21T01:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Room was very clean !

The Natural Resources Districts Conservation Tree Program assists property owners with windbreaks and many other benefits every year. Hundreds of thousands of tree-seedlings are planted across Nebraska with the help of the NRDs every year. Since the NRDs\u2019 creation in 1972, landowners have planted more than 96 million trees and shrubs across the state with the help of the NRDs. \u201cOur NRD Tree Program planted more than 700,000 tree and shrub seedlings last year across the state and we hope to do more this year,\u201d Jim Bendfeldt, president of the Nebraska Association of Resources Districts said. \u201cThe program offers landowners an inexpensive way to enhance their properties whether for functional use, wildlife habitat or beautifying the land.\u201d For often less than a dollar or two a tree, conservation trees shade and shelter homes, reduce energy costs, protect and increase crop yields, reduce soil erosion caused by water and wind, improve water quality, control snow and preserve winter moisture, protect livestock, provide food and cover for wildlife, control noise, capture atmospheric carbon, raise property values, and add beauty to our landscape. Each of the 23 Natural Resources Districts administer their own tree program. Available species and tree and shrub options may differ from district to district depending on what grows well in different areas of the state. NRD staff is available to assist landowners in determining the right trees are planted in the right place. \u201cNot only are we seeing farmers and ranchers investing back into trees, but families with small acreages too,\u201d Bendfeldt said. \u201cThe cost is very reasonable.\u201d Many NRD Conservation Tree Program order deadlines are due as early as March. Contact your local Natural Resources District to put your tree orders in today. You can go to nrdnet.org or nrdtrees.org to see the selection of trees and shrubs being offered. \u00a9 2017 Nebraska Rural Radio Association. All rights reserved.
