In addition, the correction function such as adding a brush function to the partial correction tool has been enhanced. This product is RAW development software for professional. Full Basic Functions SILKYPIX allows you to make adjustments such as exposure (brightness), white balance (shading), tone (light and dark sharpness) while maintaining a high quality of image without deteriorating the image. In addition, anyone can easily perform high-quality adjustments because basic adjustments are arranged in order from the top of the control panel. Furthermore, fine tuning adjustments for each item can be minutely performed with the \"Slider\" control. A Variety of Functions to Recreate the Photographer's Images The Partial correction function is included to adjust saturation and brightness of specified areas. In addition, the newly adopted Brush in SILKYPIX Pro8 can be used to designate areas for partial correction more freely than ever. What is more, a variety of fine adjustment functions such as Fine color controller which can be used to adjust each specific color and Highlight controller which restores colors in highlighted parts as well as recover gradation are available. Easy Editing with Tastes SILKYPIX Pro8 has 10 types of maker tastes installed which can take on various shooting scenes in advance. Just by choosing a taste such as \"Landscape\" or \"Portrait,\" you can make a finished photograph easily that fits your image. In addition, you can save your adjusted parameters as a taste. Parameters are very useful functions, and you can easily create pictures from the same image by applying them to other photographs. Compliable with JPEG and TIFF With \"SILKYPIX RAW Bridge\" available only on SILKYPIX Pro8, JPEGs and TIFFs are expanded to 16 bits, so even JPEG and TIFF images can be adjusted to a high degree of image quality with less image degradation. New Features in Version 8.0: Clarity adjustment A \"Clarity\" parameter has been added to the \"Tone\" adjustment item to adjust the luminance level of each pixel based on information from surrounding pixels. Increasing the effects of \"Clarity\" will make it possible to finish the details of the subject in a bold picture, so it is effective when you want to finish bold scenes with a hazy surrounding. In contrast, by lowering the \"Clarity\" you can finish with a soft ambience like with a soft focus, so you can use it to effect with women and children's photography. A Brush added to the Partial correction tools A \"Brush\" that makes it possible to select correction areas more freely to \"Partial corrections\" was added in \"SILKYPIX Developer Studio Pro7.\" Using the \"Brush\" makes corrections easier even in difficult areas of \"circular correction filter\" and \"gradual correction filter.\" More creative adjustments have become possible by making partial corrections that do not take the form of the subject. Strengthening the Monochrome Controller Function A Monochrome Controller function has been installed specialized for adjusting monochrome pictures. Eight kinds of \"Color filters\" can be selected, and it is possible to reproduce filters when shooting monochrome photographs on your screen. In addition, since the \"Lightness\" can be adjusted for each hue, you can make a thorough finish to your black and white photographs. Even beginners of black and white photography can easily switch between color and monochrome images after applying parameters in the preview display, so you will be able to intensify the understanding of effects on monochrome photographs due to changes in color.Underwater Photo Controller Installed as a Function for Correcting Dedicated to Underwater PhotographyA function from \"SILKYPIX Marine Photography\" for RAW development software dedicated to underwater photography has been installed into \"SILKYPIX Developer Studio Pro8\" called Underwater photo controller. With this Underwater photo controller, you can correct the bluishness that is difficult to adjust with the normal white balance by using \"White balance for underwater.\" It also features \"Color restoration,\" which actually reproduces colors lost in water, as well as \"Muddy reduction\" to eliminate murkiness in water. Focus Peaking Function Installed A Focus peaking function has been installed to detect the parts focused on from adjacent pixels in the image, and to display them with colors added to those parts. With this function, you can clearly check the area of focus. Improved User Interface We have improved the design to be clean and simple to make it possible to concentrate on adjusting images. In addition, the layout has been changed to make it easier to understand for those using adjustment functions for the first time. Also, you can now change the background color of the preview display according to your preference.

We all know what he did for us. He's got pace, power, he can score goals, it's as simple as that.\" \nSaturday's clash at Turf Moor sees the Premier League's two surprise packages so far go head-to-head. \nWhile Burnley have made a flying start to the campaign, with 25 points collected so far, Ward believes there is still more to come over the next 23 games, although the first target remains collecting a further 15 points to nudge the Clarets past that mark of 40 for safety. \n\"We're very pleased with the start but we know that we can still get better and play better,\" Ward said. \n\"It's like that with every team, you always think there's more to come. That's why we work so hard every day on the training pitch, to try and nudge ourselves that little bit higher and get better at more things. \n\"We'll keep doing that, we'll keep working hard, we've not come here and been turned over in a bad manner. We've given everything and given a good performance and we were probably a little bit unlucky not to come away with something. \n\"We need to keep it going. There are no easy games in this league. We've got Watford to come and they got a good result against Tottenham. They're a very creative side and it'll be another test for us. We'll go in to it head on as we always do. \n\"It's great but first and foremost we'll look to get to 40 points and then we'll set ourselves a new goal. That's always the way with our manager - get the next points on the board as quickly as possible and that's what we'll look to do against Watford next week.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stephen ward", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gray", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ward", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "andre gray", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "claret andre gray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sean dyche", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "brentford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "watford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turf moor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "premier league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burnley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tottenham", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "watford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burnley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vicarage road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east lancashire", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:01.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3e1e39455d5220fde394bcb4b6e2a6a411f1a792", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DH4fzRhcB2ytt98jwIMLLbCq_Hf4iUfK110EmQlkFN5RUfII8psbSW9CCJm0wibu5XMpAVo76lhJr0QO_Xfr00kknwtDLgQdAU", "site_full": "www.huffingtonpost.co.uk", "site": "huffingtonpost.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/feeds/verticals/uk-tech/index.xml", "site_categories": ["politics", "financial_news", "law_government_and_politics", "finance"], "section_title": "HuffPost UK - Athena2 - All Entries (Public)", "title": "Marriage Equality In Australia Is About More Than Marrying The Woman I Love.

It\u2019s A Catalyst For Social Change", "text": "Fox Kin It\u2019s been a rough few months for the LGBTQ+ community in Australia. We\u2019ve seen a debate happen that really didn\u2019t need to, and we\u2019ve been made to fight, for some because this debate chose us, for others because this debate is something they have chosen.\nPersonally, it\u2019s been challenging. I am proud, resilient, lesbian woman and there have been multiple times where the debate has brought me to tears. Whilst my partner, Arlia and I spent time rallying for our rights at public events, events where we felt supported and loved it\u2019s been in our own home where the weight of the \u2018No\u2019 campaign held strongest. It\u2019s been in the place where we share our lives, behind closed doors, a place where we should feel safest that it has been the hardest.\nThe day of the announcement of the results of the Marriage Equality Survey Arlia and I sat on beach together awaiting the results. It was tense. Not only were we about to find out how the public had voted on our relationship, but we were about to find out the percentage that didn\u2019t think we deserved equality rights in the eyes of the Australian Government.\nIt\u2019s hard to articulate what that moment felt like. We sat, in each other\u2019s arms for 10 minutes before we could speak. We cried, and we cried a little more. Happy tears, tears of relief and tears of overwhelm.\nMarriage Equality was always something that I knew was important but, like many things in life, didn\u2019t really acknowledge the full weight of what it meant until it directly affected me. As Arlia lay in a coma three years ago after a Traumatic Brain Injury I was told that I was considered family. As she lay in a coma and I sat by her bedside 18 hours of every day, I was assumed Arlia\u2019s sister. Hours before Arlia was induced, we had sat and watched the sun setting and discussed eloping. We wanted to be together, and married, regardless of what the legal status was. I was her family, I was her wife to be.\nHaving Marriage Equality in Australia is more than just the legal right to marry the woman I love. It\u2019s a catalyst. A catalyst for social change. For attitudes to shift and for people to start seeing people for something more than just the sexuality and gender in which they identify with.\nIt\u2019s the beginning to the end of social, cultural and legal stigmatisation of sexuality, gender and body diverse people within the Australian community. Whilst the law might change overnight, social attitudes won\u2019t. I\u2019m not naive to know that we might still be a long way from true equality for our community. I know that heteronormativity will still be prominent. I know that assumptions will be made on the gender of my partner and about our sexuality. But, I hold hope that these, often stereotypical, assumptions will be a thing of the past. It\u2019s an opportunity to have open conversations about gender and sexuality and how it affects people.\nIt\u2019s a time for Australia to celebrate. It\u2019s a time where we need to reflect on the LGBTQ+ elders past and present many of whom died fighting for their legal rights to marriage. It\u2019s a time to hold each other close.\nThis week I\u2019ve personally been anticipating for a long time. I teared up at the thought of that moment our Government votes in favour of a change in law. It was an incredible moment. A moment that might be overdue, but it was welcome.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tara baker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexandra burke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arlia", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "defence", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lives of two syrian families   politics the waugh zone budget theresa may jeremy corbyn tories brexit labour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crisis in children\u2019s mental health can", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:01.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eabacf7718f72c286c2b277a04292f7691f9c4aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9l_.3LTOgUEJRblRsADfQimNEWY4q73CMbxEtz4Gx1m_qg6muJn5rYUzkD0JMHIqw-", "site_full": "www.idata.ws", "site": "idata.ws", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/idata", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "iDATA Downloads", "title": "Blue Cats PatchWork 2.11", "title_full": "Blue Cats PatchWork 2.11", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "WS", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eabacf7718f72c286c2b277a04292f7691f9c4aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9l_.3LTOgUEJRblRsADfQimNEWY4q73CMbxEtz4Gx1m_qg6muJn5rYUzkD0JMHIqw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "supnatural", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "Blue Cats PatchWork 2.11", "text": "Blue Cats PatchWork 2.11 | 51.6 MB Blue Cat's PatchWork is a universal plug-ins patchbay that can host up to 64 VST, VST3, Audio Unit or built-in plug-ins into any Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) in one instance. It is possible to chain effects in series or create up to 8 parallel chains that can be activated independently. This lets you create your favorite effects or instruments configurations within the plug-in, without the need for multiple busses. These configurations can be saved as presets and recalled instantly, or shared with multiple DAWs, using any plug-in format (full list below). Use the built-in audio effects to add color to your own plug-in chains.Despite the name, you can forget about wires or cables: configuring plug-ins routing is as simple as adding or removing a row or a column in the rack's matrix. All plug-ins can also communicate with each other or with the host application using the virtual MIDI ports offered by the plug-in.. For each plug-in slot, latency compensation, presets management, undo/redo integration, audio i/o selection and individual plug-in bypass are included for optimal operation. The plug-in also stores the position of the window for each plug-in so that the layout is restored with your session or saved with presets.Also, sub plug-ins can be automated or controlled with external control surfaces using Blue Cat's PatchWork parameters mapping capabilities.

(Photo by AFP) \nPrevious rounds of negotiations under the auspices of the UN over the past five years have failed to achieve tangible results, mainly due to the opposition\u2019s insistence that the elected Syrian government cede power. \nMeanwhile, Russia, Iran, and Turkey have been organizing a parallel peace process between Syria\u2019s warring parties in Astana, Kazakhstan, since January. While they were launched years after the Geneva process, the talks in Astana have comparably resulted in significant achievements, including ceasefires and de-escalation zones that have reduced the actual fighting in Syria. \nMoreover, Russia plans to hold an all-Syrian congress, known as the Syrian National Dialog Congress, in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, which would involve drawing up a framework for Syria\u2019s future structure, adopting a new constitution and holding elections under UN supervision. \nIn a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on November 20, Assad said he was \u201cready for dialog with all those who want to come up with a political settlement.\u201d Loading ...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bashar al-ja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ja\u2019afari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "assad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bashar al-assad", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foreign ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syrian national dialog congress", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "geneva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "damascus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "astana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kazakhstan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "black sea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sochi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:01.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9b968c2715b21b90461bfd6a860e4f98cd112fba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pjEE7ve6gczexwgVjI90T8pPwLNi2qhmn", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/sp/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/sp/ -

She should clearly repay most of that sum. I cannot think of any justifiable reason why someone in charge of a university should be paid that much.\u201d\nIt comes after Bath University chancellor Professor Dame Glynis Breakwell stood down amid a huge row over her \u00a3468,000 pay .\nAdonis said the Somerset town appeared to be \u201cjinxed\u201d.\nAdonis said Prof Slade\u2019s pay was close to 1% of Bath Spa University\u2019s \u00a3100 million annual income. He added: \u201cSomething has gone seriously wrong... It cannot be acceptable.\u201d\nHe has called a House of Lords debate later this week, in which he will argue for an independent inquiry into vice chancellors\u2019 pay.\nAdonis, a Labour peer who worked in Downing Street\u2019s Policy Unit when fees were introduced under Tony Blair, said he wanted them cut back to \u00a33,000 a year, reversing the Coalition Government\u2019s decision to treble them in 2011 to \u00a39,000.\nPA Archive/PA Images Lord Adonis called the former Bath Spa University chancellor's pay 'outrageous' and said it shook confidence in tuition fees But he said he feared the system may have to go altogether, partly because \u201cof the way vice chancellors are behaving and putting their snouts in the trough\u201d.\n\u201cThe whole of the fee regime has become so diseased, it may not be possible [to keep them],\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very worried fees may have to go entirely.\u201d\nHe added the fees\u2019 system meant students were graduating with \u00a350,000 debt that could rise to \u00a3100,000 because of interest.\nHe said the Archbishop of Canterbury, who earns \u00a380,000 a year, should chair the inquiry he was seeking.\n\u201cIf he can look after the souls of nearly 60 million people, he can look into the pay of 130 vice chancellors,\u201d Adonis said.\nA spokeswoman for Bath Spa University told the BBC : \u201cHaving taken legal advice, the university paid Prof Slade a sum which reflected her contractual and statutory entitlements, and was considered to represent value for money.\u201d\nRyan Lucas, president of Bath Spa Students\u2019 Union, said that \u201cexcessive\u201d pay of vice chancellors would \u201ccause greater tension within our student body and our staff\u201d.\n\u201cHolding a public position, such as that of a Vice Chancellor, should be one of privilege. We want to see universities take an approach to senior staff pay that mirrors the best in ethical business practice,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\u201cAt a time where there are continued pay restrictions across the sector, the excessive salaries of university leaders can only compound the issue and cause greater tension within our student body and our staff.\n\u201cAs a community, we feel great frustration at the widening gap between senior staff pay and the investment into the student experience and the Students\u2019 Union.\u201d\nHe added the union welcomed the university\u2019s new chancellor, Prof Susan Rigby, who is due to start in January.\n\u201cHer openness and integrity will go a long way in restoring students\u2019 faith in Higher Education,\u201d Lucas added.",

(Image: Yonhap) \nSEOUL,   \u2014 More than 3,000 have signed up for the die with dignity program since hospitals in South Korea started carrying out end-of-life care trials, government data showed Thursday. \nOn Oct. 20, 13 hospitals launched a program to allow terminally ill patients with no possibility of recovery to forgo treatment before the relevant law comes into force next year. The law, which will take effect in February, was passed by the National Assembly in January last year. \nAccording to the data by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, a large number of terminally ill patients signed necessary documents saying they would opt to stop receiving medical treatment. \nDuring the three-month trial operations, hospitals consulted patients or their family members on details of end-of-life care. \nThe nation\u2019s Supreme Court recognized a comatose patient\u2019s right to die with dignity in 2009 and ordered a hospital to remove her respirator, noting that continuing treatment just to prolong life without hope of recovery violates an individual\u2019s basic dignity.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":
